we're<00:01:56.890> going<00:01:56.980> to<00:01:57.040> look<00:01:57.130> at<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.660> center<00:01:58.920> water

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
we're going to look at the center water

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.070 
we're going to look at the center water
fuel<00:02:00.130> center<00:02:00.700> let's<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.660> there<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:07.780> made

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
fuel center let's in there that's made

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.940 
fuel center let's in there that's made
of<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.350> jack<00:02:08.740> headphone<00:02:09.550> jack<00:02:09.940> mono<00:02:10.420> jack<00:02:10.950> when

of a jack headphone jack mono jack when

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.030 
of a jack headphone jack mono jack when
the<00:02:12.040> water<00:02:12.510> fills<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.930> spot<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.530> closes<00:02:15.010> a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the water fills to that spot it closes a

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.970 
the water fills to that spot it closes a
circuit<00:02:15.580> which<00:02:16.570> goes<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.140> meter<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.740> car

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
circuit which goes to a meter in the car

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.740 
circuit which goes to a meter in the car
that<00:02:18.250> says<00:02:18.490> there's<00:02:18.820> enough<00:02:19.060> water<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
that says there's enough water in the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.500 
that says there's enough water in the
unit<00:02:23.310> everything<00:02:24.310> here<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.760> made<00:02:25.000> as<00:02:25.270> simple

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
unit everything here is made as simple

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.320 
unit everything here is made as simple
as<00:02:25.930> possible<00:02:26.230> there's<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.160> outside<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.180> it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
as possible there's the outside of it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.699 
as possible there's the outside of it
you<00:02:28.870> can<00:02:28.990> see<00:02:29.140> how<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.290> goes<00:02:29.470> through<00:02:33.630> and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
you can see how it goes through and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:44.790 
you can see how it goes through and
those<00:02:35.709> are<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.090> two<00:02:37.090> electrode<00:02:37.720> outputs<00:02:43.800> show

the left- it's a good view of the
separators<00:04:05.260> which<00:04:05.740> are<00:04:05.950> plastic<00:04:06.580> washers

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
separators which are plastic washers

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.190 
separators which are plastic washers
there's<00:04:09.250> two<00:04:09.520> sets<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:10.000> those<00:04:10.180> top<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.840> bottom

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
there's two sets of those top and bottom

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.720 
there's two sets of those top and bottom
to<00:04:11.350> separate<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.860> plates<00:04:12.160> because<00:04:12.430> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
to separate the plates because the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.900 
to separate the plates because the
plates<00:04:12.970> are<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.330> close<00:04:13.600> together<00:04:14.910> after

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
plates are so close together after

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.750 
plates are so close together after
experimenting<00:04:16.840> i<00:04:16.989> found<00:04:17.350> you<00:04:18.100> really<00:04:18.459> can't

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
experimenting i found you really can't

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.870 
experimenting i found you really can't
put<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.269> plates<00:04:19.540> much<00:04:20.140> closer<00:04:20.590> than<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
put the plates much closer than this the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.370 
put the plates much closer than this the
next<00:04:25.530> series<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:28.570> plates<00:04:28.900> are<00:04:29.020> going<00:04:29.170> to<00:04:29.230> be

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
next series the plates are going to be

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:38.730 
next series the plates are going to be
much<00:04:29.650> thinner<00:04:32.940> as<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:35.080> can<00:04:35.350> see<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.590> the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
much thinner as you can see this is the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.170 
much thinner as you can see this is the
unit<00:04:39.100> closed<00:04:40.090> up<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:42.220> way<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.460> look<00:04:42.790> in<00:04:43.030> the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
unit closed up the way to look in the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.420 
unit closed up the way to look in the
car
