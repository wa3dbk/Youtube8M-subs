00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
today we have a Volkswagen block on our

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.240 
today we have a Volkswagen block on our
mill<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.650> demonstration<00:00:17.220> purposes

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
mill just for demonstration purposes

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.480 
mill just for demonstration purposes
here<00:00:17.790> but<00:00:18.600> occasionally<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.920> cases<00:00:20.130> in

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
here but occasionally we get cases in

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.250 
here but occasionally we get cases in
here<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.790> have<00:00:20.880> had<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> thrust<00:00:21.480> really

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
here that have had the thrust really

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.320 
here that have had the thrust really
knocked<00:00:22.470> out<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.460> there's<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.150> much

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
knocked out of them and there's not much

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.909 
knocked out of them and there's not much
you<00:00:24.360> can<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.689> except<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.140> code<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> case<00:00:25.650> wide

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
you can do except the code the case wide

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.120 
you can do except the code the case wide
well<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.970> devised<00:00:27.270> a<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.800> repair<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
well we devised a little repair for this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.850 
well we devised a little repair for this
I<00:00:29.369> want<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.579> show<00:00:29.790> how<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.210> done

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
I want to show how that was done

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.889 
I want to show how that was done
typically<00:00:31.860> you<00:00:32.099> get<00:00:32.220> it<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.510> main<00:00:33.510> bearing<00:00:33.810> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
typically you get it a main bearing to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.380 
typically you get it a main bearing to
replace<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.370> there<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:35.970> got<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
replace what was there and it's got it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.049 
replace what was there and it's got it
oversized<00:00:36.810> thrust<00:00:37.610> sometimes<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.850> doesn't

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
oversized thrust sometimes that doesn't

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.070 
oversized thrust sometimes that doesn't
even<00:00:39.270> work<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:41.160> let's<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:41.970> we<00:00:42.900> got

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
even work and let's see here we got

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.240 
even work and let's see here we got
quite<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.470> bit<00:00:43.650> of<00:00:43.970> slop<00:00:44.970> back<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> fourth

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
quite a bit of slop back to the fourth

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
quite a bit of slop back to the fourth
what<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.780> take<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.650> ring

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
what I do is I take and I make up a ring

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.600 
what I do is I take and I make up a ring
I<00:00:50.160> split<00:00:51.060> it<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.130> put<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.490> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
I split it and then I put it on the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
I split it and then I put it on the
bearing

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
bearing

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.880 
bearing
I<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:56.130> give<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.610> two<00:00:56.790> hands<00:00:57.150> okay<00:00:57.890> like

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I can give this here two hands okay like

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.420 
I can give this here two hands okay like
that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.490 
that
and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:01.190> on<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:02.610> here

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
we have to actually hand fit these

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.200 
we have to actually hand fit these
things<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:13.040> make<00:01:13.310> sure<00:01:13.460> we<00:01:13.549> get<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.700> nice<00:01:13.880> tight
