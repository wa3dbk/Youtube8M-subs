00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.900 

what<00:01:36.870> I<00:01:36.900> did<00:01:37.230> was<00:01:37.260> pretty<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:38.040> took<00:01:38.370> a<00:01:38.670> little

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
what I did was pretty much took a little

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.550 
what I did was pretty much took a little
bit<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.120> my<00:01:39.300> baby<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.930> blending<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.410> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
bit of my baby and blending in with the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.969 
bit of my baby and blending in with the
I<00:01:41.510> guess<00:01:42.510> it's<00:01:42.690> awkwardness<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.590> colors

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I guess it's awkwardness in the colors

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.969 
I guess it's awkwardness in the colors
in<00:01:44.010> there<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.700> i<00:01:45.000> can't<00:01:45.690> really<00:01:45.750> tell<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.590> guess

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
in there so i can't really tell I guess

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.000 
in there so i can't really tell I guess
not<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.270> went<00:01:48.810> ahead<00:01:48.870> with<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> RN<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.890> my

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010
