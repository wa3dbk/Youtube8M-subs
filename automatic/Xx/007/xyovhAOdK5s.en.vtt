harder<00:03:15.110> than<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.290> G<00:03:15.500> because<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.739> going<00:03:15.890> to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
harder than a G because you going to

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.309 
harder than a G because you going to
jump<00:03:16.220> but<00:03:16.579> i'll<00:03:16.730> get<00:03:16.819> that<00:03:16.879> tab<00:03:17.209> out<00:03:17.420> there<00:03:17.689> all

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319
