this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.020> little<00:00:04.319> bit<00:00:04.440> fun<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.980> good<00:00:05.609> way<00:00:05.730> to

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
this is a little bit fun a good way to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.870 
this is a little bit fun a good way to
show<00:00:06.000> surface<00:00:06.750> tension<00:00:07.350> it's<00:00:07.919> sort<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.250> art<00:00:08.550> on

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
show surface tension it's sort of art on

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.660 
show surface tension it's sort of art on
a<00:00:08.910> plate<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.860> if<00:00:13.980> you're<00:00:14.130> talking<00:00:14.519> about

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
a plate so if you're talking about

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.880 
a plate so if you're talking about
liquids<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> things<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> can

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
liquids one of the things you can

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.700 
liquids one of the things you can
mention<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.369> surface<00:00:17.820> tension<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.619> what<00:00:19.619> we

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
mention is surface tension and what we

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.929 
mention is surface tension and what we
got<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.520> good<00:00:20.699> demonstration

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
got here is a really good demonstration

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.790 
got here is a really good demonstration
for<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.900> then<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> children

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
for you to do and then for the children

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.490 
for you to do and then for the children
to<00:00:22.830> try<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:24.060> sort<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> art<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.289> plate

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
to try out it's sort of art on the plate

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.790 
to try out it's sort of art on the plate
really<00:00:25.949> got<00:00:26.609> household<00:00:27.150> things<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.720> usual<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
really got household things as usual so

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 
really got household things as usual so
we've<00:00:28.949> got<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.429> milk<00:00:29.789> we've<00:00:30.779> got<00:00:30.900> some

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
we've got some milk we've got some

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080 
we've got some milk we've got some
washing-up<00:00:31.380> liquid<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.250> ordinary<00:00:32.610> food

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
washing-up liquid and some ordinary food

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.209 
washing-up liquid and some ordinary food
coloring<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.660> I've<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:34.829> cotton<00:00:35.100> ball

coloring and I've got some cotton ball

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.330 
coloring and I've got some cotton ball
birds<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> plate<00:00:36.170> simple<00:00:37.170> okay<00:00:37.710> yeah<00:00:37.829> so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
birds in the plate simple okay yeah so

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
birds in the plate simple okay yeah so
I'm<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> put<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.989> bit<00:00:40.200> of

I'm just going to put a little bit of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
I'm just going to put a little bit of
the<00:00:41.070> milk<00:00:41.250> onto<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.420> plate<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.890> much<00:00:44.100> is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the milk onto the plate that much is

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.119 
the milk onto the plate that much is
fine<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.170> I'd<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
to just put an a few drops of the food

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.490 
to just put an a few drops of the food
coloring<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.050> colors<00:00:52.350> or

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500

whatever<00:00:52.739> into<00:00:53.100> sort<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> center<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
whatever into sort of the center of the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.160 
whatever into sort of the center of the
plate<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.219> as<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.480> unlike<00:01:01.109> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
plate and as you can see unlike you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
plate and as you can see unlike you
putting<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> into<00:01:02.250> water<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:03.120> sort<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> hangs

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
putting it into water it sort of hangs

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.710 
putting it into water it sort of hangs
in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> liquid<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.180> mixture<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
in the liquid and this is a mixture of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.590 
in the liquid and this is a mixture of
surface<00:01:07.590> tension<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.760> property<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> milk

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
surface tension and the property of milk

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
surface tension and the property of milk
milks<00:01:10.049> obviously<00:01:10.650> got<00:01:10.830> fats<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> things<00:01:11.880> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
milks obviously got fats and things like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.999 
milks obviously got fats and things like
that<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:13.850> brilliant<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.240> then<00:01:15.740> we<00:01:16.740> just

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that in it brilliant so then we just

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.120 
that in it brilliant so then we just
take<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> cotton<00:01:17.729> bud<00:01:17.970> dip<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.049> into<00:01:19.320> washing<00:01:20.009> up

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
take a cotton bud dip it into washing up

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
take a cotton bud dip it into washing up
liquid<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> I'll<00:01:21.659> let<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.200> make<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
liquid and I'll let you do this make the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.289 
liquid and I'll let you do this make the
magic<00:01:22.890> happen<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.549> i<00:01:23.640> need<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
magic happen all i need you to do is to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.390 
magic happen all i need you to do is to
touch<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> cotton<00:01:25.080> bud<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.470> various<00:01:26.250> places

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
touch the cotton bud at various places

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.719 
touch the cotton bud at various places
on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.600> plate<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.189> see<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.310> happens<00:01:29.610> okay

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
on the plate and see what happens okay

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
on the plate and see what happens okay
all<00:01:32.729> right<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.780> straight<00:01:34.079> away<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.439> colors

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
all right so straight away the colors

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.740 
all right so straight away the colors
race<00:01:34.860> away<00:01:35.040> from<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.509> start

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
race away from you and then they start

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.990 
race away from you and then they start
mixing<00:01:36.869> together<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.799> they're<00:01:38.490> obviously

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
mixing together and they're obviously

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.910 
mixing together and they're obviously
having<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> whale<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.659> time<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:40.200> what

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
having a whale of a time in there what

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429 
having a whale of a time in there what
you've<00:01:41.070> done<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.970> detergent<00:01:42.630> has<00:01:43.049> broken

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
you've done is the detergent has broken

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469 
you've done is the detergent has broken
the<00:01:43.619> surface<00:01:44.040> tension<00:01:44.220> which<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> what

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the surface tension which is what

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.819 
the surface tension which is what
happens<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.990> wash<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.409> plates<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
happens when you wash your plates you

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.130 
happens when you wash your plates you
want<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> grease<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:48.509> washed<00:01:48.659> away<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
want the grease to be washed away and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
want the grease to be washed away and
obviously<00:01:49.619> milk<00:01:49.890> has<00:01:50.040> got<00:01:50.159> fat<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.579> things

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
obviously milk has got fat and things

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.330 
obviously milk has got fat and things
like<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.170> need<00:01:52.500> either<00:01:52.860> full

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
like that in it you do need either full

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.389 
like that in it you do need either full
fat<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:53.970> semi<00:01:54.299> skimmed<00:01:54.689> milk<00:01:54.930> fully<00:01:55.920> skimmed

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
fat or semi skimmed milk fully skimmed

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
fat or semi skimmed milk fully skimmed
milk<00:01:56.549> won't<00:01:57.450> work<00:01:57.689> because<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.320> need<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
milk won't work because you do need a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.889 
milk won't work because you do need a
little<00:01:58.590> element<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.549> fat<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.750> they

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
little element of fat in there so they
