00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
swatch here it's important to use same

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.199

cases that the product uses in the store

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.110 
cases that the product uses in the store
so<00:02:28.510> since<00:02:28.780> Watchers<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.650> upper<00:02:30.549> case<00:02:30.790> we'll

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
so since Watchers is it upper case we'll

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.449 
so since Watchers is it upper case we'll
use<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.900> will<00:02:32.319> just<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.099> use<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.340> one

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.430 
use that will just we can use that one
keyword<00:02:33.700> since<00:02:34.090> that's<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.389> only<00:02:34.569> product<00:02:35.139> in

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
keyword since that's the only product in

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.270 
keyword since that's the only product in
the<00:02:35.590> store<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.889> uses<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.489> word<00:02:38.280> so

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
the store that uses that word so

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.930 
the store that uses that word so
hopefully<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.120> makes<00:02:40.269> sense<00:02:40.919> so<00:02:41.919> yeah<00:02:42.250> fifty
