 Ok, so let's go, people who do not have

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.870
 How do we do it? 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.620
 I got a little cauldron I already put 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.519

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.979
 Up did not put all the decision in people 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.770
 As a coconut he is already sweet. He already comes to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.659
 Advanced I do not put the Sukata but 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.950
 The recipe I 've seen asks to put 2 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.799
 spoons of sugar but I'm not going 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:53.689
 put now let's add the milk 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:56.549
 All coconut is also there then 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:01.909
 we added our coconut milk 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.909
 we're tinkering 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.330
 Let's put half of our 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.650
 condensed milk carton is finding 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.860
 put the amount you want 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.130
 so I paid here a little more than half 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.710
 But that's it, let's go there and now it's just 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.620
 move people and believe if you want 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.290
 Are you ready, seriously? 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.140

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.190
 to dump it here to the refrigerator for 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.410
 40 minutes and believe if you want our 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.400
 recipe will be ready so let's go 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.400
 that I'm going to set fire to 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.840
 then the form is already mounted 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.880
 with the butter and now just pour the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.880
 content that was in the little clique inside 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.000
 format and wait 40 minutes in the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.000
 refrigerator 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.370
 I went out with taking care of a problem in taking 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.010
 got back so as not to leak 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.660
 let's go 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.660
 people is something very fast and very 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.110
 practical and it is a delight to 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.410

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.180
 It's very very very quietly. 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.260
 simple play out does not take a while 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.430
 You know that way we are. 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.430
 Dying to eat a sweet 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.010

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.880
