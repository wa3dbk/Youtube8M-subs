00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
as well so this is the case itself kind

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.569 
as well so this is the case itself kind
of<00:00:56.780> like<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:56.960> commuter<00:00:57.260> case<00:00:57.410> but<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:57.770> quite

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
of like the commuter case but it's quite

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.099 
of like the commuter case but it's quite
a<00:00:58.610> bit<00:00:58.789> beefier<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.079> it's<00:01:00.379> got<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.989> guess<00:01:02.989> you

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
a bit beefier so it's got I guess you

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.020 
a bit beefier so it's got I guess you
can<00:01:03.230> call<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.469> reverse<00:01:04.129> action<00:01:04.369> but<00:01:04.910> it's

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
can call it the reverse action but it's

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.230 
can call it the reverse action but it's
got<00:01:05.180> three<00:01:05.449> layers<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.750> protection<00:01:06.200> here<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.820> I

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
got three layers of protection here so I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.390 
got three layers of protection here so I
can<00:01:08.540> pull<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:08.960> open<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:09.260> you<00:01:09.500> got<00:01:09.619> your<00:01:09.650> two

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
can pull it open so you got your two

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.070 
can pull it open so you got your two
pieces<00:01:10.580> of<00:01:10.820> your<00:01:11.180> hard<00:01:11.540> shell<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.990> go

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
pieces of your hard shell that go

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.260 
pieces of your hard shell that go
directly<00:01:12.200> on<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.680> device<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.189> then<00:01:14.030> your

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
directly on the device and then your

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.600 
directly on the device and then your
silicone<00:01:14.930> outer<00:01:15.619> layer<00:01:16.010> that<00:01:16.220> goes<00:01:16.369> on<00:01:16.490> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
silicone outer layer that goes on the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.660 
silicone outer layer that goes on the
outside<00:01:16.640> of<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:18.290> other<00:01:18.770> pieces<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.460> we'll<00:01:19.580> go

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
outside of the other pieces so we'll go

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.630 
outside of the other pieces so we'll go
ahead<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:19.850> toss<00:01:20.150> my<00:01:20.420> 9900<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:21.229> here<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:22.400> we<00:01:22.490> lay

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
ahead and toss my 9900 in here so we lay

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.330 
ahead and toss my 9900 in here so we lay
it<00:01:22.759> right<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.090> center<00:01:23.330> there<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:25.100> then<00:01:25.250> we

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
it right in the center there and then we

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.230 
it right in the center there and then we
do<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.490> little<00:01:25.670> clip<00:01:25.909> action<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:28.240> you're

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
do a little clip action and you're

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.730 
do a little clip action and you're
locked<00:01:29.479> in<00:01:29.689> there<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.259> see<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:30.530> got

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
locked in there so you can see it's got

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.890 
locked in there so you can see it's got
the<00:01:31.400> openings<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.090> ports<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.630> your

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
the openings for the ports and your

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.010 
the openings for the ports and your
buttons<00:01:33.200> all<00:01:33.610> squared<00:01:34.610> away<00:01:34.700> not<00:01:35.689> much<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.960> a

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
buttons all squared away not much of a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.620 
buttons all squared away not much of a
case<00:01:36.140> by<00:01:36.380> itself<00:01:36.790> looks<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.909> little<00:01:38.000> shaky<00:01:38.119> but

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
case by itself looks a little shaky but

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.760 
case by itself looks a little shaky but
once<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:39.590> throw<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.070> outer<00:01:40.490> layer<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:41.090> here

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
once you throw the outer layer on here

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.410 
once you throw the outer layer on here
then<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:42.950> are<00:01:42.979> rock<00:01:43.400> solid<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.270> guy

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
then you are rock solid so this guy

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.749 
then you are rock solid so this guy
wraps<00:01:44.720> all<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.020> way<00:01:45.110> around<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.500> device<00:01:45.799> if

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
wraps all the way around the device if

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.649 
wraps all the way around the device if
we<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:47.000> get<00:01:47.119> it<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.360> here<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.880> got<00:01:50.540> your

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
we can get it on here and you got your

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.389

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.930 
actually some of the best I've seen on
cases<00:02:21.800> like<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:22.100> they<00:02:22.280> actually<00:02:22.550> took<00:02:22.670> away

it<00:02:31.160> does<00:02:31.310> stick<00:02:31.520> up<00:02:31.610> kind<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.180> sides

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
it does stick up kind of on the sides

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.730 
it does stick up kind of on the sides
here<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.990> adjust<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> typing

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
here so you have to adjust to the typing

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.020 
here so you have to adjust to the typing
a<00:02:33.800> bit<00:02:33.950> which<00:02:34.100> isn't<00:02:34.400> terrible<00:02:35.060> by<00:02:35.390> any<00:02:35.420> sense

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
a bit which isn't terrible by any sense

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.150 
a bit which isn't terrible by any sense
camera<00:02:38.030> flash<00:02:38.240> on<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.540> back<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.010> got

camera flash on the back and you got

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.800 
camera flash on the back and you got
your<00:02:40.340> your<00:02:40.760> case<00:02:41.000> one<00:02:41.150> hundred<00:02:41.360> percent<00:02:41.390> there

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
your your case one hundred percent there

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.520 
your your case one hundred percent there
and<00:02:41.990> then<00:02:42.770> we<00:02:43.040> got<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.310> belt<00:02:43.610> clip<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:45.410> we

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
and then we got the belt clip so we

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.640 
and then we got the belt clip so we
throw<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:45.950> there<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:47.350> then<00:02:48.350> you're<00:02:48.440> locked

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
throw it in there and then you're locked

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.050 
throw it in there and then you're locked
away<00:02:48.770> for<00:02:49.040> good<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.550> guy's<00:02:49.730> not<00:02:49.880> going

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
away for good so this guy's not going

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.810 
away for good so this guy's not going
anywhere<00:02:50.420> it's<00:02:51.170> near<00:02:51.380> impossible<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:52.100> get<00:02:52.700> it

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
anywhere it's near impossible to get it

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.910 
anywhere it's near impossible to get it
to<00:02:52.940> drop<00:02:53.060> out<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.290> actually<00:02:54.410> does<00:02:54.710> take<00:02:54.890> a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
to drop out so it actually does take a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.120 
to drop out so it actually does take a
little<00:02:55.100> bit<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.340> force<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.230> pop<00:02:57.890> out

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
little bit of force to get it to pop out

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.550 
little bit of force to get it to pop out
which<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:58.400> great<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.090> if<00:02:59.210> you're<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.540> you<00:03:00.440> know

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
which is great so if you're in you know

much<00:03:26.990> safe<00:03:27.260> for<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.470> most<00:03:27.620> part<00:03:27.770> because<00:03:28.010> you

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
much safe for the most part because you

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.560 
much safe for the most part because you
got<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.250> edges<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.820> kind<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.090> stick<00:03:29.270> up<00:03:29.390> here

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
got the edges that kind of stick up here

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.320 
got the edges that kind of stick up here
so<00:03:29.780> I'll<00:03:29.900> keep<00:03:30.020> it<00:03:30.170> from<00:03:30.290> landing<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:31.820> going

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
so I'll keep it from landing and going

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.730 
so I'll keep it from landing and going
directly<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.900> screen<00:03:33.140> but<00:03:33.290> if<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.470> happen

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
directly in the screen but if you happen

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.050 
directly in the screen but if you happen
to<00:03:33.830> catch<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.370> screen<00:03:34.640> then<00:03:34.820> you're<00:03:34.940> out<00:03:35.030> of

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
to catch the screen then you're out of

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.440

luck<00:03:35.240> but<00:03:35.980> so<00:03:36.980> that's<00:03:37.130> pretty<00:03:37.280> much<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.490> solid

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
luck but so that's pretty much it solid
