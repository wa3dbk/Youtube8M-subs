00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
have a little bit in it I'm not going to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
have a little bit in it I'm not going to
pour<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.460> much<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.509> don't<00:01:39.659> want

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440 
pour it out that much in it I don't want
anyways<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> top<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.180> might

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
anyways you don't have a top so it might

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.240 
anyways you don't have a top so it might
waste<00:01:42.780> underneath<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.619> hopefully<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> don't

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
waste underneath but hopefully I don't

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.020 
waste underneath but hopefully I don't
so<00:01:45.290> that's<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> use<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.850> this

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:24.120 

and<00:02:01.869> this<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.200> right<00:02:03.380> side
