00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050

hairdressers that work so hard and these

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.900 
hairdressers that work so hard and these
Commission<00:02:16.330> salons<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:18.280> much<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.610> their<00:02:18.760> money

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
Commission salons so much of their money

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.479 
Commission salons so much of their money
and<00:02:19.060> their<00:02:19.269> creativity<00:02:19.989> are<00:02:20.230> being<00:02:21.010> taken

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
and their creativity are being taken

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.280 
and their creativity are being taken
from<00:02:21.670> them<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.180> don't<00:02:22.239> think<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.019> industry

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
from them and I don't think the industry

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.170 
from them and I don't think the industry
has<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.590> be<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:23.890> way<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.459> fact<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.760> Kobe

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
has to be that way so the fact that Kobe

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.520

what<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.690> charge<00:02:53.019> people<00:02:53.590> that's<00:02:53.920> really

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
what I charge people that's really

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.580 
what I charge people that's really
almost<00:02:54.459> become<00:02:55.090> something<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.930> on<00:02:56.350> the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
almost become something that is on the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.759 
almost become something that is on the
back<00:02:56.920> burner<00:02:57.359> which<00:02:58.359> I<00:02:58.690> think<00:02:59.019> really<00:02:59.320> if<00:02:59.620> you

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
back burner which I think really if you

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.559 
back burner which I think really if you
want<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.040> focus

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
want to focus

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.679 
want to focus
if<00:03:01.379> you're<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> designer<00:03:02.129> anything<00:03:03.000> creative

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
if you're a designer anything creative

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.490 
if you're a designer anything creative
artist<00:03:04.409> if<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.430> take<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.329> money<00:03:06.599> out<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
artist if you take the money out of the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.460 
artist if you take the money out of the
equation<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.760> think<00:03:08.970> really<00:03:09.870> that's<00:03:10.200> where<00:03:10.409> you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
equation I think really that's where you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.280 
equation I think really that's where you
start<00:03:10.739> working<00:03:11.069> with<00:03:11.099> creativity<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.299> that's

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
start working with creativity so that's

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.759 
start working with creativity so that's
definitely<00:03:13.620> not<00:03:14.159> here<00:03:14.760> now<00:03:15.349> when<00:03:16.349> I'm<00:03:16.470> doing

differently and how they're doing things

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.009
