00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 before we hit the river I have 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.589
 something new here namely the hashtag 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.589
 neil selfie 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.550
 this was my cinema selfie hashtag 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.810
 biel set selfie for the movie 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.670
 I am also very curious about you 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.840
 cinema selfie so you go to the pills 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.970
 denotes good man in that chair 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.770
 mindfulness alfie and posy then on twitter 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.630
 or instagram with her stable selfie and 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.119
 the nicest biel selfies I will 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.289
 share via social media and if I have one 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.760
 little place above my bed I would 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.750
 maybe a few places there too 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.750
 both also like that 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.340
 but ultimately we are natural 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.870
 for the review of the new film from 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.120
 director christopher named nolan 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.430
 so interstellar nice for needs with that 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.750
 mouth coney nfu being with demo that too 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.340
 the little film roll super fun 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.620
 but then make up for it 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.300
 I of course called Dutch pride 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.600
 hoyte van hoytema because he is 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.250
 DLP aka Glamor Mine in for the movie 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.500
 and that guy who goes also 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.910
 to film the new James Bond movie 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.829
 and I just wanted to say that 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.539
 nice all those names but in the bunch there is 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.890
 really no movie that you just away 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.420
 look you really have your head there 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.910
 to keep the film good 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.509
 because it takes no less than 169 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.800
 minutes 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.960
 that's about two football matches 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.310
 including injury time so if you like this 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.869
 it is good to follow the film 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.640
 somewhat important that you are reasonable 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.770
 Slept in to play there 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.390
 so in the near future 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.429
 and it becomes increasingly clear that 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.080
 the earth simply no longer a livable place 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.970
 so you know food shortage 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.709
 nature child is against man it is 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.020
 just becoming a total disaster 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.220
 these are the hall and you must stand with it 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.590
 king then we play the role of 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.750
 cooper and ex pilot as an old and 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.580
 also father of two children who 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.590
 unfortunately no longer have a mother but through 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.390
 a very vague but well thought out one 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.160
 way pound cooper 8 a number 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.500
 coordinates and that very vague way 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.209
 has gravity and I like it 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.130
 personally really very bold 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.630
 but i can imagine you sand 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.580
 that falls down through gravity 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.020
 and leads to coordinates 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.700
 still a bit far-fetched find so 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.270
 there is actually already a co or a no-go 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.910
 in 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.890
 and these coordinates lead cooperatively 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.590
 with his daughter murphy to secret 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.720
 nasa space and these people want cooper 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.009
 then not whether we are secret send you and and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.410
 remains cool for the only one 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.130
 pilot if the nuts are appropriate 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.410
 for this mission 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.209
 how accidental and that mission consists of 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.069
 finding a new livable one 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.360
 planet for humanity 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.129
 as really more than just one 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.650
 edventure movie they are looking for 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.030
 to a new livable planet 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.439
 he finds that quite difficult to find out 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.819
 without telling things but 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.409
 You have to imagine that it is pretty good 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.849
 what is that the dome is asked 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.379
 from takes you say good 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.390
 space in search of new livable 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.010
 planet he had four children behind 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.750
 make sure you take care of someone and that one 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.819
 or emotional side of the story 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.260
 even though it appears in the unrealistic suit 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.970
 at least with me at customers 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.470
 well and I personally think that's real 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.970
 well because of the actor's qualities 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.920
 with humor can and in my opinion too 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.569
 just again for oscar nomination is going well 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.069
 a movie and rent shine on the follow 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.780
 makes it in my opinion 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.459
 were the physical terms with which 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.670
 was thrown but sometimes I was too fat 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.349
 of and the time difference between the people 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.299
 in space and on earth on a given 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.760
 one hour of space travel is the same 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.079
 x number of people years and it 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.790
 Crazy thing is that the people living in the room 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.379
 nothing changes in their face 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.639
 but the people on earth make that 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.180
 so I think it's a bit tricky 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.829
 to follow 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.689
 the devil of this film is there 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.310
 the second to last half hour in which you 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.629
 really can think of okay these movies 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.849
 completely dredged 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.739
 or you really love it 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.920
 I personally find it from makers 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.120
 idea really super fat as a viewer I can 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.310
 Imagine that you are with the shipment 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.290
 than I am always giving stars 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.780
 and phil him I give interster 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.120
 set ar 4 stars but that 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.750
 does not mean that it is super right 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.799
 is bold 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.420
 I am also very curious about you 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.140
 opinion so you were allowed to set yourself 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.730
 have seen

 later vein in the comments behind what you 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.940
 of the movie it was there who get it

 description and then otherwise there so 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.670
 my boat was very cool 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.280
 fall 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.099
 scarface or pulp fiction if you don't now 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.489
 made curious and just click 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.489
 later on
