these two that are going to be going up

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.390 
these two that are going to be going up
on<00:00:16.820> eBay<00:00:17.090> very<00:00:17.420> soon<00:00:17.720> it's<00:00:18.710> it's<00:00:19.070> a<00:00:19.130> unique

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
on eBay very soon it's it's a unique

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.590 
on eBay very soon it's it's a unique
powder<00:00:19.580> coating<00:00:19.940> that<00:00:20.060> I<00:00:20.090> designed

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
powder coating that I designed

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.310 
powder coating that I designed
specifically<00:00:21.590> with<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.550> dual<00:00:23.080> bladed<00:00:24.080> saber

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
specifically with the dual bladed saber

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.770 
specifically with the dual bladed saber
in<00:00:24.560> mind<00:00:24.800> it's<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.460> media<00:00:25.940> blasted<00:00:26.180> powder

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
in mind it's a media blasted powder

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.180 
in mind it's a media blasted powder
coating<00:00:27.170> so<00:00:27.290> it<00:00:27.320> looks<00:00:27.470> like<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:27.620> Lumina<00:00:27.950> media

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
coating so it looks like a Lumina media

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.520 
coating so it looks like a Lumina media
blasting<00:00:28.580> is<00:00:28.700> very<00:00:29.060> durable<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.690> of<00:00:30.350> course

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.080 
blasting is very durable and of course
you've<00:00:30.650> got<00:00:30.680> bare<00:00:31.040> aluminum<00:00:31.160> polished<00:00:31.820> parts

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
you've got bare aluminum polished parts

both savers are identical have upgraded

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.779 
both savers are identical have upgraded
with<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.170> crystal<00:00:36.890> shard<00:00:37.070> sound<00:00:37.339> card<00:00:37.609> and

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
with the crystal shard sound card and

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.610 
with the crystal shard sound card and
the<00:00:38.089> custom<00:00:38.739> vented<00:00:39.739> pommel<00:00:40.100> for<00:00:40.309> frost<00:00:40.640> sound

both have my revenge sound fun in there
the<00:00:47.059> boot<00:00:47.210> sound<00:00:48.519> it's<00:00:49.519> like<00:00:49.640> that<00:00:49.850> because

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
the boot sound it's like that because

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:54.549 
the boot sound it's like that because
this<00:00:50.120> one's<00:00:50.300> been<00:00:50.510> in<00:00:50.539> deeps<00:00:53.050> going<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.170> deep

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
this one's been in deeps going to deep

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.130 
this one's been in deeps going to deep
sleep<00:00:54.710> in<00:00:54.920> about<00:00:55.519> an<00:00:55.640> hour<00:00:55.819> without<00:00:56.749> use

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
sleep in about an hour without use

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.689 
sleep in about an hour without use
they'll<00:00:57.499> go<00:00:57.739> into<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.920> deep<00:00:58.100> sleep<00:00:58.309> mode<00:00:58.489> and

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
they'll go into a deep sleep mode and

00:00:58.699 --> 00:00:59.829 
they'll go into a deep sleep mode and
then<00:00:58.789> when<00:00:58.909> you<00:00:58.999> turn<00:00:59.149> it<00:00:59.239> on<00:00:59.329> it<00:00:59.449> needs<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.749> be

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
then when you turn it on it needs to be

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.169 
then when you turn it on it needs to be
rebooted<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.069> you've<00:01:01.219> got<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.489> ascend<00:01:01.850> savers

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
rebooted so you've got to ascend savers

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:03.849 
rebooted so you've got to ascend savers
you're<00:01:02.329> familiar<00:01:02.569> by<00:01:03.199> now<00:01:03.229> watching<00:01:03.769> the

you're familiar by now watching the

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.039 
you're familiar by now watching the
other<00:01:03.979> videos<00:01:04.010> how<00:01:04.400> they<00:01:04.550> work<00:01:04.699> so<00:01:05.049> basically

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
other videos how they work so basically

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.130 
other videos how they work so basically
to<00:01:06.229> make<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.530> into<00:01:06.829> a<00:01:06.880> dual<00:01:07.880> bladed<00:01:08.240> saver<00:01:08.420> I've

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
to make it into a dual bladed saver I've

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.990 
to make it into a dual bladed saver I've
got<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:09.590> coupler<00:01:10.009> which<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.399> powder-coated

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
got this coupler which I powder-coated

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.780 
got this coupler which I powder-coated
with<00:01:11.090> them<00:01:11.270> but<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.840> red<00:01:12.020> highlights<00:01:12.469> to<00:01:13.369> you

with them but the red highlights to you
know<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.939> draw<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.270> draw<00:01:14.479> attention<00:01:14.659> to<00:01:15.020> it

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
know to draw it draw attention to it

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.870 
know to draw it draw attention to it
because<00:01:15.530> when<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.890> saber<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.219> assembled<00:01:16.700> as

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
because when the saber is assembled as

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.539 
because when the saber is assembled as
it<00:01:17.210> do<00:01:17.329> a<00:01:17.360> little<00:01:17.570> looks<00:01:17.719> really<00:01:17.930> cool

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
now you just unscrew the pommels of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.990 
now you just unscrew the pommels of
course<00:01:21.200> you've<00:01:21.350> got<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:22.520> know<00:01:22.640> these<00:01:22.789> are

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
course you've got you know these are

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.219 
course you've got you know these are
upgraded<00:01:23.360> with<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.479> crystal<00:01:23.810> shard<00:01:23.990> sound

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
upgraded with the crystal shard sound

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.080 
upgraded with the crystal shard sound
card<00:01:24.469> that<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.649> can<00:01:24.829> see<00:01:25.039> on<00:01:25.219> the<00:01:25.399> removable

rechargeable 18 650 battery but you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.069 
rechargeable 18 650 battery but you
don't<00:01:29.000> even<00:01:29.119> need<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.270> take<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.659> out<00:01:29.719> you

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
don't even need to take that out you

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.609 
don't even need to take that out you
just<00:01:31.070> remove<00:01:31.369> both<00:01:31.909> Polo's<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.109> screw<00:01:33.439> on

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
just remove both Polo's and you screw on

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.469 
just remove both Polo's and you screw on
the<00:01:33.920> coupler<00:01:34.159> which<00:01:34.399> is<00:01:34.549> matched<00:01:34.820> exactly

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
the coupler which is matched exactly

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.060 
the coupler which is matched exactly
like<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.750> pommel<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:36.229> holds<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.590> speaker

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
like the pommel so it holds the speaker

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.060 
like the pommel so it holds the speaker
in<00:01:37.369> place<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.149> these<00:01:38.240> vents<00:01:38.630> now<00:01:38.810> become<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
in place and these vents now become the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.120 
in place and these vents now become the
place<00:01:40.789> where<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.030> sound<00:01:41.240> comes<00:01:41.509> out<00:01:41.979> if<00:01:42.979> it's

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
place where the sound comes out if it's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.940 
place where the sound comes out if it's
on<00:01:43.310> snugly<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.469> make<00:01:45.469> sure<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.829> you're

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
on snugly and you make sure that you're

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.950 
on snugly and you make sure that you're
doing<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:46.369> very<00:01:46.850> carefully<00:01:47.270> because<00:01:47.719> you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
doing this very carefully because you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.270 
doing this very carefully because you
want<00:01:48.109> to<00:01:48.170> keep<00:01:48.259> these<00:01:48.380> saber<00:01:48.649> straight<00:01:49.039> so<00:01:49.219> you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
want to keep these saber straight so you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.950 
want to keep these saber straight so you
don't<00:01:49.460> mess<00:01:49.579> up<00:01:49.609> the<00:01:49.850> threads<00:01:50.119> because<00:01:50.719> they

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
don't mess up the threads because they

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.469 
don't mess up the threads because they
are<00:01:51.079> aluminum<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:52.159> they're<00:01:52.609> very<00:01:52.880> well

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
are aluminum but they're very well

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.429 
are aluminum but they're very well
machined<00:01:54.399> expertly<00:01:55.399> machined<00:01:55.909> on<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.899> CNC

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
machined expertly machined on the CNC

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.830 
machined expertly machined on the CNC
tools<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.240> everything<00:01:59.509> fits<00:01:59.630> together

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
tools so so everything fits together

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.480 
tools so so everything fits together
perfectly<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.439> you've<00:02:00.530> got<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> dual<00:02:01.070> bladed

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
perfectly and you've got a dual bladed

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.359 
perfectly and you've got a dual bladed
saber<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:02.630> looks<00:02:02.780> like<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.340> both<00:02:04.340> of

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
saber that looks like that and both of

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.029 
saber that looks like that and both of
these<00:02:04.939> savers<00:02:05.479> have<00:02:05.689> my<00:02:06.049> revenge<00:02:06.289> soundfont

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
these savers have my revenge soundfont

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.940 
these savers have my revenge soundfont
which<00:02:07.189> is<00:02:07.310> my<00:02:07.429> Darth<00:02:07.670> Maul<00:02:07.909> soundfont<00:02:08.479> loaded

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
which is my Darth Maul soundfont loaded

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.470 
which is my Darth Maul soundfont loaded
they're<00:02:09.069> so<00:02:10.080> green<00:02:11.370> pro-lite<00:02:12.370> LED<00:02:12.849> which<00:02:13.269> is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
they're so green pro-lite LED which is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.449 
they're so green pro-lite LED which is
as<00:02:13.629> bright<00:02:13.840> as<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.989> p4<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.739> really<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.340> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
as bright as a p4 but I really like the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.369 
as bright as a p4 but I really like the
shade<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.910> green<00:02:16.120> on<00:02:16.599> these<00:02:16.810> pro<00:02:17.050> lights<00:02:17.260> so

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
shade of green on these pro lights so

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.660 
shade of green on these pro lights so
it's<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.560> single<00:02:17.890> color<00:02:18.069> LED<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:20.459> when<00:02:21.459> both

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
it's a single color LED and when both

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.160 
it's a single color LED and when both
savers<00:02:22.060> are<00:02:22.150> activated<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.720> notice<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
savers are activated to notice the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.199 
savers are activated to notice the
difference<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.650> sound

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.319 

so<00:02:28.810> both<00:02:29.049> savers<00:02:29.469> firing<00:02:30.219> together<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:31.239> the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
so both savers firing together and the

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.869 
so both savers firing together and the
sound<00:02:31.629> out<00:02:32.109> of<00:02:32.319> phase<00:02:32.500> with<00:02:32.739> itself

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
sound out of phase with itself

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.720 
sound out of phase with itself
it's<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:34.480> richer<00:02:34.930> deeper<00:02:35.260> more<00:02:35.680> dynamic<00:02:36.370> sound

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it's a richer deeper more dynamic sound

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.009 
it's a richer deeper more dynamic sound
these<00:02:39.730> sabers<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.209> set<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> little<00:02:40.780> bit<00:02:40.870> more

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
these sabers have set a little bit more

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.630 
these sabers have set a little bit more
sensitive<00:02:41.469> so<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.859> you<00:02:42.219> know<00:02:42.310> when<00:02:42.459> it

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
sensitive so that you know when it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.759 
sensitive so that you know when it
register<00:02:43.030> swings<00:02:43.390> when<00:02:43.569> you're<00:02:43.689> moving<00:02:43.930> them

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.349 

I'm<00:02:47.769> going<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:47.920> take<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.329> opportunity<00:02:49.329> to

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
I'm going to take this opportunity to

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.780 
I'm going to take this opportunity to
show<00:02:49.689> how<00:02:50.620> I've<00:02:50.739> been<00:02:50.859> finishing<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.519> empty

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
show how I've been finishing the empty

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.899 
show how I've been finishing the empty
space<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.840> ascent<00:02:53.260> saber<00:02:53.500> where<00:02:53.799> where<00:02:54.790> if

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
space on the ascent saber where where if

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.129 
space on the ascent saber where where if
you<00:02:55.030> were<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.150> upgrade<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.719> to<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.870> petite

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
you were to upgrade it to a petite

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.420 
you were to upgrade it to a petite
crouton<00:02:56.500> or<00:02:56.530> something<00:02:56.920> like<00:02:57.069> that<00:02:57.219> you<00:02:57.340> would

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
crouton or something like that you would

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.099 
crouton or something like that you would
put<00:02:57.579> an<00:02:57.670> auxilary<00:02:58.000> button<00:02:58.329> rather<00:02:58.870> than<00:02:59.019> have

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
put an auxilary button rather than have

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.500 
put an auxilary button rather than have
a<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.379> bare<00:02:59.590> hole<00:02:59.859> there<00:03:00.159> I've<00:03:01.000> started

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
a just a bare hole there I've started

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.770 
a just a bare hole there I've started
putting<00:03:02.290> crystal<00:03:03.069> beads<00:03:03.659> securing<00:03:04.659> them

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
putting crystal beads securing them

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.539 
putting crystal beads securing them
underneath<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.230> collar<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.189> case<00:03:06.370> it's

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
underneath the collar in this case it's

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.770 
underneath the collar in this case it's
a<00:03:06.609> green<00:03:06.790> blade<00:03:06.970> at<00:03:07.120> saber<00:03:07.329> so<00:03:07.540> there's<00:03:07.720> a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
a green blade at saber so there's a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.289 
a green blade at saber so there's a
green<00:03:08.139> faceted<00:03:08.859> crystal<00:03:09.250> bead<00:03:09.400> under<00:03:10.120> there<00:03:10.269> I

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
green faceted crystal bead under there I

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.849 
green faceted crystal bead under there I
don't<00:03:10.419> know<00:03:10.510> if<00:03:10.569> you<00:03:10.689> can<00:03:10.810> see<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.200> if<00:03:11.680> you

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
don't know if you can see that if you

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.470 
don't know if you can see that if you
were<00:03:11.919> to<00:03:12.040> order<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> red<00:03:12.549> saber<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:12.909> get<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.180> red

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
were to order a red saber you get a red

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.349 
were to order a red saber you get a red
crystal<00:03:14.260> bead<00:03:14.379> blue<00:03:14.709> blue<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.939> correspond

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
crystal bead blue blue the correspond

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.849 
crystal bead blue blue the correspond
with<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.569> blade<00:03:16.750> color<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.379> I<00:03:17.530> found<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.799> was

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
with the blade color and I found it was

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.289 
with the blade color and I found it was
just<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.069> really<00:03:18.250> really<00:03:18.459> nice<00:03:18.730> way<00:03:18.969> to<00:03:19.000> kind<00:03:19.209> of

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
just a really really nice way to kind of

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.789 
just a really really nice way to kind of
finish<00:03:19.540> off<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.959> saber<00:03:20.169> and<00:03:20.319> make<00:03:20.439> it<00:03:20.560> look<00:03:20.709> a

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
finish off the saber and make it look a

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.860 
finish off the saber and make it look a
little<00:03:20.950> bit<00:03:21.129> more<00:03:21.310> something<00:03:22.299> more<00:03:22.419> to<00:03:22.659> look

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
little bit more something more to look

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.330 
little bit more something more to look
at<00:03:22.959> something<00:03:23.290> more<00:03:23.379> engaging<00:03:23.709> when<00:03:24.099> you<00:03:24.189> look

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
at something more engaging when you look

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.039 
at something more engaging when you look
through<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.549> hole<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:24.969> just<00:03:25.060> bare<00:03:25.269> metal<00:03:25.450> so

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
through the hole and just bare metal so

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.479 
through the hole and just bare metal so
all<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.290> ascent<00:03:26.560> saber<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:26.889> coming<00:03:27.189> out<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.400> my
