00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.690
 in what financial problems should I think when I buy a car there are two 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.429
 options to pay for your car in a single payment port and birth this means 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.860
 that will make monthly payments until the country carousel completely if you 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.750
 Choose to finance your car remember that the total price will increase because 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.770
 in paying at the cost of the loan you also have to consider how much money 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.700
 can count to pay the down payment and the monthly payments should never sign a 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.100
 contract that mentions monthly payments that show your budget if you can not 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.320
 make monthly payments the vehicle can be dispossessed 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.030
 If you purpose and charge compare the credit rates between different 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.769
 Business 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.750
 you can save money by buying lower interest 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.750
 I must stop the first price that the automaker does not offer 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.220
 almost all used car dealers bargain the price is possible 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.460
 negotiate a discount of between 10 and 20 percent comparing models and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.920
 prices in ads and in the automotive will buy the car to better 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.620
 price 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.310
 review specialized publications on the internet to compare prices of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.870
 used cars vidal the automotive that wants the best price that can give 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.310
 so that you compare it with others you find 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.970
 never tell the automaker the price that another company has offered 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.860
 before said that makes any other engine that does not give a price 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.110
 reasonable to treat him badly or that I pressured him to sign a contract before 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.080
 that this one according to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.840
 that what I have to know about guarantees a guarantee is almost always 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.190
 a written promise where the automaker agrees to fix the car in a 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.700
 certain period some companies charge for a guarantee it is better to have 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.640
 the written guarantee that not having it 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.900
 Thus 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.200
 always ask for a guarantee for the car how long it lasts what is it 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.330
 that kubrick is what does not cover 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.660
 the insurance claims without warranties export gala in writing 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.670
 if it does not and the automaker refuses to keep its promise 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.610
 there's probably not much you can do about it 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.200
 It takes time to carefully read the warranty before it is signed. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.570
 contract 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.340
 If the vehicle has a limited warranty make sure that the auto 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.819
 put all the terms in writing 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.909
 also because the written guarantee indicates everything that covers and the time 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.329
 it will last what I can do if I want to change my face as a deposit when 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.129
 buy a used car 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.980
 if you want to leave your old car as a deposit first investigate your 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.909
 value so that it is such fair price of the vehicle 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.449
 Then take a copy of the car title when you go to the car. 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.379
 raise the possibility of change until after you have negotiated the best 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.239
 possible price of the car you are buying then external that you would like 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.189
 leave your old car as a deposit to compare the used car that pleased you 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.450
 remember if the carmaker offers you little for your old car you can put 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.449
 An ad in the newspaper and sell it on your own 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.729
