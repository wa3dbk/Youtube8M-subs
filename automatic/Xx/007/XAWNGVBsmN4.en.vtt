00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.520
 Good day to all in this video 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.629
 I want to demonstrate the device with 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.360
 by which you can manage 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.849
 any kind of scamp load 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.250
 be and light bulbs heat the electric pump 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.809
 and much more in this case, you can 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.390
 connect up to eight independent 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.640
 loads but after a bit of reworking them 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.260
 quantity can increase to 50 even 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.090
 more 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 this device is built on the base of the board 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.000
 arduino it is installed microcontroller 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.759
 atmega 1280 and firmware for it now 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 demonstrate the firmware written by the forces 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.739
 and arraver data exchange with the computer 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 happens on 3 kind of underwear which 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.219
 set to arduino it means that 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.149
 no problem connecting to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.399
 modern pk 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.140
 and even more so for laptops will not be as 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.540
 Yusb port is now in every camper 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.360
 so demonstration of the LED 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.610
 connected to the second channel in the terminal 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.020
 enter the command to enable this channel 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.410
 and the LED lights up now your 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.640
 command to turn off the LED goes out 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.130
 again for inclusion on fire 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.930
 went out but led the team through the terminal 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 very uncomfortable so i wrote 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.330
 a little program that does everything 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.770
 the same but only much more convenient 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.460
 the program is written in fashion now everything 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.680
 sharpie and she looks like this here we 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.660
 specify the port number and connect to 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.700
 pieces of iron and now simple 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.250
 on-off switch we can 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.850
 manage any channels as you see it 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.500
 much more comfortable and finally I will show 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.920
 how to manage this thing 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.960
 incandescent bulb I collected a small 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.630
 adapter transistor and relay and 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.720
 connected it to channel six and now 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.100
 when i'm the old tick on the sixth channel 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.920
 light bulb turns off tick 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.630
 bulbs goes out 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.630
 as you can see everything works fine on 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.970
 I hope everything was interesting for everyone 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.970
 until
