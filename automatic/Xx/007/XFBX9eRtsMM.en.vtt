rebury cable calm this particular model
is<00:00:10.950> called<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.400> tractor<00:00:11.880> unit<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.840> was

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
is called a tractor unit and it was

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.799 
is called a tractor unit and it was
designed<00:00:13.170> by<00:00:13.679> hedgy<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> second

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
designed by hedgy and this is the second

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.450 
designed by hedgy and this is the second
model<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.230> his<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.920> built<00:00:17.220> this

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
model of his that I have built this

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.720 
model of his that I have built this
model<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.449> basically<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.500> tractor<00:00:20.160> portion

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
model is basically the tractor portion

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.359 
model is basically the tractor portion
of<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.970> tractor<00:00:21.420> trailer<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.010> fully

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
of a tractor trailer and it is fully

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.880 
of a tractor trailer and it is fully
remote<00:00:23.730> control<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.600> got<00:00:24.810> power<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
remote control it's got power to the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
remote control it's got power to the
wheel<00:00:26.099> steering<00:00:26.640> power<00:00:27.210> function<00:00:27.689> lights<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
wheel steering power function lights and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.820 
wheel steering power function lights and
the<00:00:28.769> fourth<00:00:29.039> feature<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:30.840> has<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> shiftable

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the fourth feature is it has a shiftable

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.639 
the fourth feature is it has a shiftable
4-speed<00:00:32.460> transmission<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:34.230> will<00:00:34.410> take<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
4-speed transmission and we will take a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.260 
4-speed transmission and we will take a
look<00:00:34.920> at<00:00:35.010> all<00:00:35.130> those<00:00:35.309> features<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.910> I'd<00:00:36.030> give

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
look at all those features but I'd give

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.330 
look at all those features but I'd give
you<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.450> real<00:00:36.930> quick<00:00:37.170> look<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.800> my

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
you a real quick look at it my

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
you a real quick look at it my
particular<00:00:38.670> model<00:00:39.149> I've<00:00:39.270> built<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.719> black<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
particular model I've built in black and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.580 
particular model I've built in black and
red

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
red

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.180 
red
and<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.820> features<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.680> here<00:00:44.040> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and it features that you have here is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.130 
and it features that you have here is
the<00:00:44.370> cab<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.879> suspended<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:45.809> that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the cab is suspended on it I think that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.389 
the cab is suspended on it I think that
is<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> pretty<00:00:46.649> neat<00:00:46.829> feature<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.430> thing

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
is a pretty neat feature on this thing

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.069 
is a pretty neat feature on this thing
does<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> fifth<00:00:51.059> wheel<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.870> if

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
does have the fifth wheel back here if

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040 
does have the fifth wheel back here if
you<00:00:52.289> want<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> build<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.430> trailer<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> tow<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you want to build a trailer and tow a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.630 
you want to build a trailer and tow a
trailer<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.980> think<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.460> model

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
trailer with this I think this model

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:15.899 
trailer with this I think this model
would<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> very<00:00:57.390> good<00:00:57.510> job<00:00:57.809> at<00:00:57.989> that

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.029 

no<00:01:16.479> opening<00:01:16.869> doors<00:01:17.140> or<00:01:17.289> anything<00:01:17.469> on<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:17.859> one

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
no opening doors or anything on this one

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:31.620 
no opening doors or anything on this one
guys<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.250> power<00:01:27.490> function-wise<00:01:30.420> does<00:01:31.420> have

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
guys so power function-wise does have

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.190 
guys so power function-wise does have
four<00:01:31.899> power<00:01:32.170> function<00:01:32.619> features<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:35.020> does

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
four power function features it does

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.529 
four power function features it does
have<00:01:35.409> steering<00:01:36.219> with<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.369> servo<00:01:36.849> motor<00:01:39.539> the

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
have steering with a servo motor the

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:51.130 
have steering with a servo motor the
power<00:01:40.840> function<00:01:41.319> lights

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.120 

okay<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.230> obviously<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.800> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.010> have

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
okay and obviously it's going to have

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.670 
okay and obviously it's going to have
power<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.730> wheels

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.290 

and<00:02:02.770> then<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.520> next<00:02:03.670> thing<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:03.970> want<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.180> show

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
and then the next thing I want to show

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.090 
and then the next thing I want to show
you<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.720> can<00:02:04.750> see<00:02:05.020> really<00:02:05.260> well<00:02:06.480> is<00:02:08.100> how

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
you is you can see really well is how

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.000 
you is you can see really well is how
the<00:02:09.160> transmission<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.210> thing<00:02:10.390> shifts

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
the transmission on this thing shifts

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.760 
the transmission on this thing shifts
let's<00:02:12.010> take<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.190> look<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.520> see<00:02:12.760> how<00:02:12.910> this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
let's take a look and see how this

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.420 
let's take a look and see how this
transmission<00:02:14.770> shifts<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.830> I've<00:02:18.040> got<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
transmission shifts so I've got the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.780 
transmission shifts so I've got the
remote<00:02:18.610> here<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.120> can<00:02:19.300> go<00:02:20.520> forward<00:02:21.520> and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
remote here and I can go forward and

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.510 
remote here and I can go forward and
backwards<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.540> would<00:02:22.750> expect<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:24.490> I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
backwards as you would expect but then I

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.390 
backwards as you would expect but then I
can<00:02:24.790> shift<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.240> gears

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.830 

so<00:02:33.400> that's<00:02:33.610> all<00:02:33.760> done<00:02:33.970> remotely<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.690> that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
so that's all done remotely so that

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.400 
so that's all done remotely so that
basically<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:39.160> just<00:02:39.490> like<00:02:39.670> any<00:02:39.880> other

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
basically is just like any other

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.600 
basically is just like any other
transmission<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.740> technic<00:02:42.100> model<00:02:42.430> and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
transmission and a technic model and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.780 
transmission and a technic model and
that<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.850> can<00:02:43.000> shift<00:02:43.470> gears<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.860> change<00:02:45.640> the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
that it can shift gears and change the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.580 
that it can shift gears and change the
gear<00:02:45.970> ratio<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.720> actually<00:02:46.900> changes<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
gear ratio and it actually changes the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.610 
gear ratio and it actually changes the
speed<00:02:47.860> at<00:02:48.550> which<00:02:48.610> this<00:02:48.910> thing<00:02:49.120> drives<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.590> a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
speed at which this thing drives so a

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.080 
speed at which this thing drives so a
lot<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:50.800> people<00:02:50.980> always<00:02:51.250> ask<00:02:51.370> hey<00:02:51.790> why<00:02:51.970> do<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
lot of people always ask hey why do you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
these 11 length flat panels but I didn't

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.890 
these 11 length flat panels but I didn't
have<00:03:21.550> any<00:03:21.730> more<00:03:21.910> of<00:03:22.030> those<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.480> just<00:03:22.569> went

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
have any more of those so I just went
