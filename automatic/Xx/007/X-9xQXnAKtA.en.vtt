00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.190 
having said that you know that there are
the<00:02:10.830> advantages<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.120> can

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
the advantages in that you can you can

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.830 
the advantages in that you can you can
and<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> think<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.800> need<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:15.300> need<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.630> sort<00:02:15.810> of

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and I think you need you need to sort of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.750 
and I think you need you need to sort of
build<00:02:16.019> that<00:02:16.290> trust<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.040> relationship<00:02:17.100> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
build that trust in that relationship to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.210 
build that trust in that relationship to
your<00:02:17.850> students<00:02:18.239> with<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.050> your<00:02:19.170> class<00:02:19.440> so

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
your students with you in your class so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.580 
your students with you in your class so
that<00:02:20.250> they<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.970> switch<00:02:21.840> from<00:02:21.870> motor<00:02:22.290> mode

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
that they can switch from motor mode

that they can switch from motor mode
they<00:02:22.739> know<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.130> okay<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.519> they're

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
they know that okay if they're

they know that okay if they're

that so that you're not always having to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.170 
that so that you're not always having to
use<00:02:59.610> stern<00:03:01.190> method<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.430> might<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.940> like

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
use stern method but you might have like

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.730 
use stern method but you might have like
a<00:03:03.209> signal<00:03:04.170> or

you<00:03:07.590> know<00:03:07.680> 1<00:03:07.860> 2<00:03:08.070> 3<00:03:08.250> ice<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.730> me<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.900> they're

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
you know 1 2 3 ice to me and so they're

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.240 
you know 1 2 3 ice to me and so they're
not<00:03:10.170> always<00:03:10.410> having<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.770> listen<00:03:10.980> out<00:03:11.070> but

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
not always having to listen out but

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.770

those are all triggers they they they
hear<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.350> they<00:03:13.410> might<00:03:13.530> not<00:03:13.650> be

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
hear that and they might not be

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.890 
hear that and they might not be
specifically<00:03:14.280> listening<00:03:15.240> for<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.570> but<00:03:15.750> they

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
specifically listening for it but they

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.170 
specifically listening for it but they

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
can it switches on a reaction to them

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.050 
can it switches on a reaction to them
and<00:03:18.300> if<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.480> but<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.840> takes<00:03:19.940> practice<00:03:20.940> and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
and if you but that takes practice and

and if you but that takes practice and
then<00:03:21.380> routine<00:03:24.740> good<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:25.770> few<00:03:25.950> weeks<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.280> give

to engage the students but you have to

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.630 

okay<00:06:22.530> well<00:06:22.710> I<00:06:23.040> guess<00:06:23.910> any<00:06:24.510> style<00:06:24.870> of<00:06:24.930> teaching

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
okay well I guess any style of teaching

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.450 
okay well I guess any style of teaching
that<00:06:26.640> you<00:06:26.820> use<00:06:27.110> and<00:06:28.110> any<00:06:28.350> any<00:06:28.620> group<00:06:29.340> of

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
that you use and any any group of

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.410 
that you use and any any group of
students<00:06:29.730> that<00:06:29.760> you're<00:06:29.910> going<00:06:30.060> to<00:06:30.150> have<00:06:30.270> are

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
students that you're going to have are

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.580 
students that you're going to have are
going<00:06:30.570> to<00:06:30.630> present<00:06:30.930> problems<00:06:31.790> and<00:06:32.790> I<00:06:32.940> think

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
going to present problems and I think

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.720 
going to present problems and I think
most<00:06:34.590> teaching<00:06:34.980> styles<00:06:35.580> are<00:06:36.270> never<00:06:36.570> all

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
most teaching styles are never all

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.150 
most teaching styles are never all
student-centered<00:06:38.730> or<00:06:38.910> teacher<00:06:39.780> centered<00:06:40.170> and

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
student-centered or teacher centered and

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.270 
student-centered or teacher centered and
I<00:06:41.250> think<00:06:41.400> that's<00:06:41.580> because<00:06:41.760> of<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.030> nature<00:06:42.240> of

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
I think that's because of the nature of

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.230 
I think that's because of the nature of
the<00:06:44.280> difficulties<00:06:44.880> that<00:06:44.940> you're<00:06:45.060> going<00:06:45.210> to

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
the difficulties that you're going to

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.640 
the difficulties that you're going to
face<00:06:45.420> with<00:06:45.600> either<00:06:45.750> of<00:06:45.930> those<00:06:46.050> two<00:06:46.110> extremes

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
face with either of those two extremes

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.050 
face with either of those two extremes
and<00:06:46.800> I<00:06:46.830> think<00:06:46.980> that's<00:06:47.130> why<00:06:47.250> most<00:06:47.430> teachers<00:06:47.670> and

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
and I think that's why most teachers and

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.990 
and I think that's why most teachers and
most<00:06:48.540> teaching<00:06:48.990> styles<00:06:49.440> are<00:06:50.340> a<00:06:50.400> blend<00:06:50.760> of<00:06:50.880> the

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
most teaching styles are a blend of the

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.640 
most teaching styles are a blend of the
two<00:06:51.180> and<00:06:51.870> they<00:06:51.960> feel<00:06:52.200> that<00:06:52.320> they're<00:06:52.470> making

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
two and they feel that they're making

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.680 
two and they feel that they're making
the<00:06:52.830> decisions<00:06:53.310> but<00:06:53.910> you<00:06:54.090> have<00:06:54.240> to<00:06:54.360> you<00:06:54.630> have

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
the decisions but you have to you have

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.390 
the decisions but you have to you have
to<00:06:54.810> direct<00:06:55.200> it<00:06:55.350> yourself<00:06:55.770> you<00:06:55.890> have<00:06:55.920> to<00:06:56.070> by<00:06:56.340> the

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
to direct it yourself you have to by the

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.360 
to direct it yourself you have to by the
choices<00:06:56.940> that<00:06:57.120> you<00:06:57.210> give<00:06:57.420> them<00:06:57.660> by<00:06:57.960> the<00:06:58.370> tasks

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
choices that you give them by the tasks

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.540 
choices that you give them by the tasks
that<00:06:59.610> you<00:06:59.730> set<00:07:00.410> that<00:07:01.410> might<00:07:01.620> have<00:07:01.800> quite<00:07:02.370> a<00:07:02.430> lot

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
that you set that might have quite a lot

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.340 
that you set that might have quite a lot
of<00:07:02.640> freedom<00:07:02.790> in<00:07:03.000> it<00:07:03.120> but<00:07:03.270> they're<00:07:03.510> just<00:07:03.660> by<00:07:04.290> the

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
of freedom in it but they're just by the

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.540 
of freedom in it but they're just by the
nature<00:07:04.620> of<00:07:04.680> the<00:07:04.770> task<00:07:04.920> itself

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
nature of the task itself

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.160 
nature of the task itself
it<00:07:05.760> helps<00:07:06.090> narrow<00:07:06.360> down<00:07:06.570> what<00:07:06.870> the<00:07:06.990> options

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.170 
it helps narrow down what the options

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.050 
it helps narrow down what the options
that<00:07:07.620> the<00:07:07.830> students<00:07:08.190> are<00:07:08.280> going<00:07:08.400> to<00:07:08.520> have<00:07:08.730> so

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
that the students are going to have so

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.180 
that the students are going to have so
you<00:07:09.090> want<00:07:09.360> to<00:07:09.450> give<00:07:09.570> them<00:07:09.750> the<00:07:10.380> impression<00:07:10.980> and

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
you want to give them the impression and

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.830 
you want to give them the impression and
the<00:07:11.310> feeling<00:07:11.640> that<00:07:11.670> they<00:07:11.850> are<00:07:11.880> making<00:07:12.360> the

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
the feeling that they are making the

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.680 
the feeling that they are making the
choices<00:07:13.020> themselves<00:07:13.620> but<00:07:14.040> you<00:07:14.190> need<00:07:14.400> to

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
choices themselves but you need to

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.140 
choices themselves but you need to
really<00:07:15.690> be<00:07:15.870> thinking<00:07:15.900> and<00:07:16.640> trying<00:07:17.640> to<00:07:17.700> be<00:07:17.790> five

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
really be thinking and trying to be five

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.520 
really be thinking and trying to be five
steps<00:07:18.450> ahead<00:07:18.570> and<00:07:19.020> thinking<00:07:19.290> of<00:07:19.350> all<00:07:19.440> the

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
steps ahead and thinking of all the

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.220 
steps ahead and thinking of all the
contingencies<00:07:19.830> that<00:07:20.220> can<00:07:21.020> come<00:07:22.020> about

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230 
contingencies that can come about

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
contingencies that can come about
because<00:07:22.380> of<00:07:22.560> the<00:07:22.680> choices<00:07:23.040> that<00:07:23.070> you're

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
because of the choices that you're

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.880 
because of the choices that you're
giving<00:07:23.610> and<00:07:24.240> I<00:07:24.330> think<00:07:24.540> that's<00:07:25.380> probably<00:07:25.680> the

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:25.890 
giving and I think that's probably the

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.630 
giving and I think that's probably the
biggest<00:07:26.220> hurdle<00:07:26.700> of<00:07:28.400> student<00:07:29.400> centered

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.640 
biggest hurdle of student centered

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.970 
biggest hurdle of student centered
learning<00:07:29.670> is<00:07:30.000> it's<00:07:30.330> very<00:07:31.050> expensive<00:07:31.710> you<00:07:31.950> have

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:31.980 
learning is it's very expensive you have

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.370 
learning is it's very expensive you have
to<00:07:32.160> really<00:07:32.430> think<00:07:32.580> of<00:07:33.210> all<00:07:33.420> the<00:07:33.780> possibilities

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
to really think of all the possibilities

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.680 
to really think of all the possibilities
no<00:07:34.680> x<00:07:34.890> y&amp;z<00:07:35.400> rather<00:07:35.670> than<00:07:35.910> just<00:07:36.090> if<00:07:36.360> I<00:07:36.480> teach

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:36.690 
no x y&amp;z rather than just if I teach

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.050 
no x y&amp;z rather than just if I teach
this<00:07:36.900> this<00:07:37.170> will<00:07:37.350> happen<00:07:37.640> yeah<00:07:38.640> you<00:07:38.880> know<00:07:38.970> you

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
this this will happen yeah you know you

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.520 
this this will happen yeah you know you
have<00:07:39.300> to<00:07:39.390> be<00:07:39.510> really<00:07:39.750> prepared<00:07:39.900> it<00:07:40.140> takes<00:07:40.350> my

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
have to be really prepared it takes my

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.620 
have to be really prepared it takes my
thing<00:07:40.710> extra<00:07:40.980> preparation<00:07:41.430> to<00:07:41.970> achieve<00:07:42.450> them

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.630 
thing extra preparation to achieve them

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.570 
thing extra preparation to achieve them
and<00:07:42.840> I<00:07:42.870> think<00:07:43.050> that's<00:07:43.170> why<00:07:43.350> it's<00:07:44.060> probably<00:07:45.170> the

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.580 
and I think that's why it's probably the

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.180 
and I think that's why it's probably the
less<00:07:47.580> seen<00:07:47.910> of<00:07:48.120> the<00:07:48.480> two<00:07:48.660> styles<00:07:49.560> I<00:07:49.860> guess<00:07:50.040> or

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.190 
less seen of the two styles I guess or

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.850 
less seen of the two styles I guess or
the<00:07:50.220> two<00:07:50.400> extremes
