00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.900
 Tell me guys, Bruno, just seven back. 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.940
 everything beauty or in today's video will 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 bringing a course starting including 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.289
 tam dof maps is actually not quite a 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.480
 short game I've already picked up 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.949
 started there and you are seeing that I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.160
 I already joined the game losing people 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.289
 by 20 points of difference this was a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.779
 I think it's a good match to play. 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 Very interesting, I'm going to start bad at 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.450
 but at the end it is from the middle to the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.270
 At the end I'm going to hit the great strip and then 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.399
 I end up taking orbital 97 what to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.190
 I worried because I understood 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.930
 that was the determining factor for our 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.980
 this match was an upset 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.600
 fantastic 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.780
 the opposing team was more or less 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.309
 two or three points to close the game 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.289
 and we managed to take an advantage 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.730
 huge and make a turn 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.550
 Of course I did not play the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 at the end of the video there you go 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.660
 see that my entire team was 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.760
 positive but the guys who were giving 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.979
 point for the opposing team there 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.110
 I was suffering I was getting sick 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.750
 I started with two more players 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.850
 nor were we together with Egypt together 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 by chance at the same time and people 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.820
 ended up turning if it rains at the end 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.560
 that the whole team physically got 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 positive who was bad about the team 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.820
 ended up giving kings of criticism and for that reason 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.200
 we got the turn more 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.759
 is no longer an excellent turn 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.340
 because we stayed the whole match 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.600
 with more than 20 points of difference and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.700
 At last we got a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.829
 fantastic and obvious start that the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.750
 Orbital and 7 Helped 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.810
 so I felt proud of this turn 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.460
 And as if it was my fault, it's good I 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.659
 I'm bringing this match today, guys. 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.640
 Why were you watching this sharing? 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.799
 here in my place and this lifted me up. 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.500
 subject and I got up with an idea that 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.530
 It's what kind of game you prefer to play. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.070
 And you'd rather watch I'm the kind of guy. 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.229
 I prefer to watch and play games 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.170
 most disputed not by chance have watched 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.450
 code very competitive today we only ever 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.770
 competitive time but today 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.450
 days I'm much more connected only 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.459
 watching much more often 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.629
 because they are not always part and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.459
 Of course I'm not comparing 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.140
 matches I do in the public lobby 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.270
 with the matches of the other 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.010
 - professionals but it is still 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.470
 interesting also there are people in 9 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.750
 public will have the condition that more 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.430
 tight most disputed because it requires 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.260
 a little more of our concentration there 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750
 to make the victory of course it's cool 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.270
 also we enter a part of the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.910
 times and or in the galera if you get the looks 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.620
 make excellent freights and such is 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.120
 also legal to watch this type of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.940
 game when you see a player 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.550
 suddenly killing millions and dying nothing 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.959
 practically but my preference is 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.580
 this type of match 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.030
 but of course I have fun too 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.620
 games like I said or did not I 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.300
 I remember that at the time of the black ops in 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.280
 It's true, it's not a problem. Cup, yes. Not this one. 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.230
 It was already mw3 but I was coming back 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.060
 to play black box was for the end of the year 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.810
 past subscribers will get 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.600
 remember 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.090
 and I set up a part with friends who 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.060
 called the dream ball that was the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.190
 basic was museum vandrÃ© pio nicho lei 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.989
 always a different friend playing and the 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.489
 played several times with us I think 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.650
 that America has played a few times that 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.650
 We were people too and we were destroying 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.900
 so 98% of the parties clearly had 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.540
 time we catch up but not 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.519
 generally it was always us destroying right 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.709
 even played with a kid named 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.780
 andep cry that if we called 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.519
 some dog something like that went without 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.070
 Thank you for the ultimate that was down there. 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.630
 tempted us in the shopper these things 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.690
 Dude, trying to kill in the water is over. 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.310
 getting boring is not enough to play a part with 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.049
 good players is not cool even though 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.790
 strike lethal mostly strike more 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.590
 because it ends up being boring and 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.340
 make a network crew fun kit 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.040
 same 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.750
 in the full wall so we are with 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.120
 that the non-lethal brics for all power 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.310
 World fun down there is good but 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.780
 would require short game in this type 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.820
 to come and serve the spirit that I took 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.590
 in the end that for me determined the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.299
 victory and also says there 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.010
 the video was fast as I said 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.440
 It's a bit tighter in time. 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.120
 because I had to make a chosen video 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.070
 but I wanted your opinion are 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.870
 speaking in the comments you prefer 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.730
 that match where the guy is the nando 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.190
 Prefer to play a match that you are 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.660
 watch or play a match 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.350
 a little tighter a little more 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.239
 disputed 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.829
 My preference is the most 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.750
 listen to bring a little more 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.940
 competitiveness but I want to hear from you 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.740
 Let me know what you think. 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.099
 video here guys I'm going to ask you 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.509
 evaluate the video and leave a comment and 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.639
 sign up for the channel if you have not yet 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.729
 Enclosed I see you in the next video 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:40.550
 A hug is a source of response. 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.550
 way and today allied with
