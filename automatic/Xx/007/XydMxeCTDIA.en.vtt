00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
see if it lives up to what it's supposed

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.530

produce more power than what they say
they<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.650> we're<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.270> do<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.479> tests

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
they do so we're going to do those tests

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.539 
they do so we're going to do those tests
and<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> results<00:01:20.100> are<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> we

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and see what the results are that we

00:01:20.549 --> 00:02:17.370 
and see what the results are that we
come<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.850> with

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.750 

alright<00:02:18.380> guys<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.830> results<00:02:19.250> are<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:19.490> and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
alright guys so the results are in and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.270 
alright guys so the results are in and
definitely<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.510> very<00:02:21.320> impressive<00:02:21.680> amplifier

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
definitely a very impressive amplifier

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.980 
definitely a very impressive amplifier
one<00:02:22.460> thing<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:22.700> want<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:22.940> make<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.120> quick<00:02:23.750> note<00:02:23.780> on

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.700 
manual it does our amp Dino doesn't
actually<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.730> 3<00:02:40.730> ohm<00:02:40.910> load<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:42.620> it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
actually have a 3 ohm load to do but it

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.610 
actually have a 3 ohm load to do but it
actually<00:02:42.860> gives<00:02:43.160> us<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.520> two<00:02:44.090> point<00:02:44.450> six<00:02:45.260> seven

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
actually gives us a two point six seven

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.110 
actually gives us a two point six seven
ohms<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.250> that's<00:02:46.430> obviously<00:02:46.610> going<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.970> be<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
ohms so that's obviously going to be the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.560 
ohms so that's obviously going to be the
closest<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:47.660> could<00:02:47.810> get<00:02:48.020> in<00:02:48.200> regards<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.220> what

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
closest we could get in regards to what

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.940 
closest we could get in regards to what
completely<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.900> utterly<00:02:51.050> impressive<00:02:51.770> for

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
completely and utterly impressive for

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.490 
completely and utterly impressive for
such<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.550> small<00:02:52.760> amplifier<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:54.200> let's<00:02:54.320> go<00:02:54.440> over

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
such a small amplifier so let's go over

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.580 
such a small amplifier so let's go over
the<00:02:54.620> results<00:02:55.600> for<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.720> m<00:02:57.580> HX<00:02:58.580> 280<00:02:59.360> /<00:02:59.600> 4<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.380> we

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
the results for the m HX 280 / 4 so we

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.170 
the results for the m HX 280 / 4 so we
did<00:03:00.710> certified<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.310> dynamic<00:03:01.760> which<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.060> guys

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
did certified and dynamic which you guys
