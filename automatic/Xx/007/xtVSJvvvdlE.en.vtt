00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
to defend themselves against all the

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
anti-american media the top well I think

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.579 
anti-american media the top well I think
that's<00:00:59.449> a<00:00:59.539> really<00:00:59.809> good<00:00:59.929> question<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.499> I

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
that's a really good question and I

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.950 
that's a really good question and I
think<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.859> answer<00:01:00.889> to<00:01:01.249> that<00:01:01.399> would<00:01:02.329> be<00:01:02.389> both<00:01:02.690> I

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
think the answer to that would be both I

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.710 
think the answer to that would be both I
think<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:03.440> what<00:01:04.339> it<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.489> a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
think this is what it is a

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.670 
think this is what it is a
fifty-million-dollar<00:01:06.010> PR<00:01:07.010> move<00:01:07.220> foreign<00:01:08.000> PR

experiment<00:01:09.680> I<00:01:09.770> guess<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.009> could<00:01:10.159> call<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.340> in

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
experiment I guess you could call it in

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.870 
experiment I guess you could call it in
Pakistan<00:01:11.899> but<00:01:12.079> at<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.289> same<00:01:12.500> time<00:01:12.799> US<00:01:13.219> aid<00:01:13.549> has

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
Pakistan but at the same time US aid has

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.760 
Pakistan but at the same time US aid has
hundreds<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:14.960> hundreds<00:01:15.320> of<00:01:15.409> really

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
hundreds and hundreds of really

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.740 
hundreds and hundreds of really
excellent<00:01:16.159> programs<00:01:16.700> on<00:01:16.939> population<00:01:17.630> and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
excellent programs on population and

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.050 
excellent programs on population and
health<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.369> democracy<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:19.430> governance<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:20.000> I

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
health on democracy and governance and I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.149 
health on democracy and governance and I
think<00:01:20.270> it's<00:01:20.420> fair<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.689> those<00:01:21.109> programs<00:01:21.920> you

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
think it's fair that those programs you

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.279 
think it's fair that those programs you
know<00:01:22.280> forget<00:01:23.180> their<00:01:23.359> fair<00:01:23.539> share<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.810> coverage

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
know forget their fair share of coverage

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.010 
know forget their fair share of coverage
but<00:01:24.979> do<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.250> think<00:01:25.579> then<00:01:25.789> that<00:01:25.820> perhaps<00:01:26.659> other

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
but do you think then that perhaps other

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.539 
but do you think then that perhaps other
people<00:01:27.320> will<00:01:27.439> look<00:01:27.530> at<00:01:27.619> those<00:01:27.799> media<00:01:28.159> outlets

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
people will look at those media outlets

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.789 
people will look at those media outlets
they<00:01:29.060> are<00:01:29.240> working<00:01:29.539> with<00:01:29.869> US<00:01:30.170> government<00:01:30.680> that

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
they are working with US government that

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.889 
they are working with US government that
are<00:01:30.890> getting<00:01:31.159> this<00:01:31.280> aid<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:31.850> only<00:01:32.450> point<00:01:32.719> more

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899

fingers<00:01:33.350> only<00:01:34.070> say<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.310> now<00:01:34.700> you're<00:01:34.969> working

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
fingers only say that now you're working

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.730 
fingers only say that now you're working
hand<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:35.659> hand<00:01:35.719> you're<00:01:36.079> in<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.259> pocket<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.679> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
hand in hand you're in the pocket of the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.349 
hand in hand you're in the pocket of the
US<00:01:36.979> government<00:01:37.009> I<00:01:37.520> think<00:01:37.880> that's<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.119> very<00:01:38.240> good

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
US government I think that's a very good

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.819 
US government I think that's a very good
question<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.929> I<00:01:38.990> think<00:01:39.229> that's<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.500> really

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
question and I think that's a really

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.130 
question and I think that's a really
realistic<00:01:40.369> possibility<00:01:41.179> South<00:01:41.719> Asians<00:01:42.020> are

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
realistic possibility South Asians are

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.529 
realistic possibility South Asians are
notorious<00:01:42.710> for<00:01:42.950> being<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.460> conspiracy<00:01:44.240> there

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
notorious for being a conspiracy there

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:45.880 
notorious for being a conspiracy there
is<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:44.840> definitely<00:01:45.259> think<00:01:45.469> that<00:01:45.590> there's<00:01:45.829> a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
is so I definitely think that there's a

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.700 
is so I definitely think that there's a
risk<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.539> post<00:01:47.539> 9-11<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.289> always<00:01:48.530> been

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
risk in that post 9-11 it's always been

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.230 
risk in that post 9-11 it's always been
like<00:01:48.859> that<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.369> Muslim<00:01:49.700> world<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:50.119> know

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
like that in the Muslim world you know

Pakistan there's a huge issue of
mounting<00:02:30.379> civilian<00:02:31.220> casualties<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.030> think

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
mounting civilian casualties so I think

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.990 
mounting civilian casualties so I think
ultimately<00:02:32.840> bet<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:34.010> what<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> US<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:34.670> going

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
ultimately bet is what the US is going

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000 
ultimately bet is what the US is going

like I said before you can buy the

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.970 
like I said before you can buy the
coverage<00:03:56.599> that<00:03:56.629> you<00:03:56.900> want<00:03:57.169> but<00:03:57.349> people<00:03:57.769> are

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
coverage that you want but people are

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.039 
coverage that you want but people are
ultimately<00:03:58.459> going<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.790> judge<00:03:59.150> not<00:03:59.690> what<00:03:59.870> they

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
ultimately going to judge not what they

ultimately going to judge not what they
read<00:04:00.319> but<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:00.769> they<00:04:00.919> see<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.609> while

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
read but what they see and while

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.420 
read but what they see and while
speaking<00:04:02.810> though<00:04:03.079> of<00:04:03.290> coverage<00:04:03.739> do<00:04:03.949> you<00:04:04.099> think

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
speaking though of coverage do you think

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.879 
speaking though of coverage do you think
that<00:04:04.699> if<00:04:04.970> they're<00:04:05.389> do<00:04:05.720> become<00:04:06.470> more<00:04:06.709> of<00:04:06.769> these

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
that if they're do become more of these

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.619 
that if they're do become more of these
news<00:04:07.099> outlets<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.609> are<00:04:07.669> perhaps<00:04:08.269> a<00:04:08.540> little

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
news outlets that are perhaps a little

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.439 
news outlets that are perhaps a little
friendlier<00:04:09.169> to<00:04:09.620> America<00:04:10.220> then<00:04:10.819> can<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.239> just

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
friendlier to America then can we just

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.059 
friendlier to America then can we just
see<00:04:11.599> a<00:04:11.629> counter<00:04:12.169> to<00:04:12.199> that<00:04:12.409> because<00:04:12.620> we've<00:04:12.889> done

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
see a counter to that because we've done

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
discussed the stark differences in how

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.340 
discussed the stark differences in how
they're

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
they're

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.670 
they're
is<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.890> fox<00:04:20.490> and<00:04:20.790> an<00:04:20.880> MSNBC<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:22.290> then<00:04:22.470> will

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
is a fox and an MSNBC and so then will

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.250 
is a fox and an MSNBC and so then will
there<00:04:22.830> be<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:23.040> fox<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.150> equivalent<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:25.050> just

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
there be a fox like equivalent that just

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.110 
there be a fox like equivalent that just
starts<00:04:25.560> point<00:04:25.980> even<00:04:26.250> more<00:04:26.400> fingers<00:04:26.730> coming<00:04:27.030> up

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
starts point even more fingers coming up

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.240 
starts point even more fingers coming up
with<00:04:27.240> even<00:04:27.360> more<00:04:27.600> conspiracy<00:04:28.530> theories<00:04:28.950> and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
with even more conspiracy theories and

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.060 
with even more conspiracy theories and
being<00:04:29.460> perhaps<00:04:29.940> ten<00:04:30.390> times<00:04:30.690> as<00:04:31.020> harsh<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.590> think

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
being perhaps ten times as harsh I think

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.130 
being perhaps ten times as harsh I think
that<00:04:32.160> that's<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:32.850> very<00:04:33.090> valid<00:04:33.330> point<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.900> think

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
that that's a very valid point I think

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.170 
that that's a very valid point I think
that<00:04:34.260> that's<00:04:34.350> definitely<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.180> realistic

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
that that's definitely a realistic

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.330 
that that's definitely a realistic
possibility<00:04:36.330> there's<00:04:36.960> always<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.710> risk<00:04:38.010> of

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
possibility there's always a risk of

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.220 
possibility there's always a risk of
backlash<00:04:39.000> when<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.420> are<00:04:39.540> working<00:04:39.750> with<00:04:40.020> the
