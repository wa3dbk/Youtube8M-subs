other<00:01:16.650> than<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.159> guess<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> guy<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.270> he<00:01:18.780> says

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
other than I guess this guy here he says

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.609 
other than I guess this guy here he says
not<00:01:19.200> working<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:21.110> no<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.229> else<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.470> really

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.340 
not working and no one else is really
complaining<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.869> what<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> guess<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.259> going

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
complaining so I what I guess I'm going

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
complaining so I what I guess I'm going
to<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> wait<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.040> their<00:01:26.580> next<00:01:26.610> update

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to do is wait for their next update

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.649 
to do is wait for their next update
being<00:01:27.869> either<00:01:28.100> 1.9<00:01:29.100> point<00:01:29.130> 2<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.030> 1<00:01:30.240> point<00:01:30.479> 8

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
being either 1.9 point 2 or 1 point 8

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.620 
being either 1.9 point 2 or 1 point 8
point<00:01:31.020> 3<00:01:31.110> i'm<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.130> sure<00:01:32.250> how<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:33.479> go

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
point 3 i'm not really sure how they go

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.609 
point 3 i'm not really sure how they go
about<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> numbers<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.210> but

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
about with the numbers here but

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
about with the numbers here but
definitely<00:01:37.619> can't<00:01:38.549> really<00:01:38.909> use<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> program

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
definitely can't really use the program

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
definitely can't really use the program
and<00:01:39.960> i<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.860> program

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and i really do like this program

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.280 
and i really do like this program
because<00:01:41.400> i<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.909> optimize<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:43.110> game

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
because i can optimize all my game

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.130 
because i can optimize all my game
settings<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.250> i'm<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.090> unable<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
settings and i'm just unable to do that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
settings and i'm just unable to do that
right<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.009> there's<00:01:47.340> nothing<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.700> can

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
right now so there's nothing I can

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.450 
right now so there's nothing I can
really<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.659> except<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.409> wait<00:01:50.009> till

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
really do about it except for wait till

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.510 
really do about it except for wait till
their<00:01:50.880> next<00:01:51.240> update<00:01:51.570> all<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:53.040> games<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.490> now

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
their next update all my games right now

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
their next update all my games right now
are<00:01:53.850> optimized<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.229> their<00:01:55.560> correct

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
are optimized and on their correct

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
are optimized and on their correct
settings<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.729> don't<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.390> much<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
settings so I don't really have much to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.590 
settings so I don't really have much to
worry<00:01:58.049> about<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.479> definitely<00:02:00.479> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
worry about with that but definitely in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.899 
worry about with that but definitely in
the<00:02:00.689> future<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.380> know<00:02:01.920> they're<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> put

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the future I know they're going to put

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
the future I know they're going to put
out<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> new<00:02:03.240> update<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.689> I'll<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.930> uninstall

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
out a new update so I'll just uninstall

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.859 
out a new update so I'll just uninstall
the<00:02:04.680> program<00:02:05.090> I'm<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.210> sure<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.630> going

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the program I'm not sure if that's going

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.390 
the program I'm not sure if that's going
to<00:02:07.020> remove<00:02:07.469> my<00:02:07.860> latest<00:02:08.520> video<00:02:08.789> driver<00:02:09.390> but

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
to remove my latest video driver but

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.910 
to remove my latest video driver but
when<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.580> install<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> newest<00:02:12.569> version

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
when I do install the newest version

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.240 
when I do install the newest version
hopefully<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.640> works<00:02:13.760> correctly<00:02:14.090> and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
hopefully it works correctly and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.550 
hopefully it works correctly and
everything<00:02:16.250> works<00:02:16.520> as<00:02:16.760> should<00:02:17.150> if<00:02:17.390> not<00:02:18.110> I

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
everything works as should if not I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.250 
everything works as should if not I
guess<00:02:18.830> I'll<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.450> uninstall<00:02:20.450> delete<00:02:20.810> GeForce
