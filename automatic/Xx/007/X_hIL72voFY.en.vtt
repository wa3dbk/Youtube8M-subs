group<00:01:15.330> together<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.869> else<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.170> will<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.470> be

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
group together or else you will not be

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.929 
group together or else you will not be
able<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.860> slay<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.220> can't<00:01:17.520> slice<00:01:17.759> right

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
able to slay see I can't slice right

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580 
able to slay see I can't slice right
there<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> Stars<00:01:19.110> ain't<00:01:19.409> group

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
there because the Stars ain't group

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.320 
there because the Stars ain't group
together

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.000 

I<00:01:28.390> thought<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.230> might<00:01:29.320> have<00:01:29.590> had<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.890> right

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
I thought I might have had it right

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:38.700 
I thought I might have had it right
there<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.790> if<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.090> hit<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.240> star<00:01:37.570> you<00:01:37.960> do<00:01:38.110> have

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
there and if you hit a star you do have

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.140 
there and if you hit a star you do have
to<00:01:38.860> start<00:01:39.130> over<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.520> basically<00:01:45.700> have<00:01:46.060> to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
to start over and you basically have to

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.640 
to start over and you basically have to
have<00:01:46.240> patience<00:01:46.720> with<00:01:46.870> this<00:01:46.900> game<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.380> have<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
have patience with this game to have the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:59.530 
have patience with this game to have the
stars<00:01:47.920> line<00:01:48.220> up

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.250 

and<00:02:00.140> believe<00:02:00.410> me<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:01.130> easier<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.150> person

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
and believe me this is easier in person

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.060 
and believe me this is easier in person
but<00:02:03.260> when<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.560> playing<00:02:03.800> through<00:02:03.980> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.450 
the light tougher levels like for
example<00:02:24.260> let's<00:02:24.830> go<00:02:24.890> ahead<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.130> pick<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.340> one

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
example let's go ahead and pick this one

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.830 
example let's go ahead and pick this one
and<00:02:28.460> you<00:02:28.670> notice<00:02:28.850> these<00:02:29.060> little<00:02:29.120> bars<00:02:29.540> you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and you notice these little bars you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.000 
and you notice these little bars you
cannot<00:02:30.170> slice<00:02:30.470> through<00:02:30.740> those<00:02:30.980> at<00:02:31.220> all<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.950> you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
cannot slice through those at all so you

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.710 
cannot slice through those at all so you
really<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.580> use<00:02:35.000> your<00:02:35.150> mind<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.600> be

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
really have to use your mind and be

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.410 
really have to use your mind and be
strategic<00:02:36.500> about<00:02:36.650> where<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.160> slice<00:02:37.490> on<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
strategic about where you slice on the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.350 
strategic about where you slice on the
higher<00:02:38.660> levels<00:02:39.200> which<00:02:39.800> which<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.150> because

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
higher levels which which I like because

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:52.180 
higher levels which which I like because
it<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:41.840> adds<00:02:42.110> more<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.430> game<00:02:51.190> but

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
it just adds more to the game but

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.770 
it just adds more to the game but
overall<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:52.850> guys<00:02:53.000> pretty<00:02:53.300> much<00:02:53.390> get<00:02:53.660> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
overall you guys pretty much get the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.420 
overall you guys pretty much get the
point<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:54.500> pretty<00:02:55.040> much<00:02:55.190> have<00:02:55.370> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
point of it you just pretty much have to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.580 
point of it you just pretty much have to
be<00:02:55.610> used<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.970> change<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.390> about<00:02:56.720> your<00:02:56.930> slices

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
be used to change it about your slices

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.790 
be used to change it about your slices
and<00:02:58.100> when<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.459> want<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.730> get<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.270> the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
and when you want to get it to the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.650 
and when you want to get it to the
ribbon<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.040> slice<00:03:01.310> off<00:03:01.520> as<00:03:01.700> much<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.150> can<00:03:02.390> in

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
ribbon and slice off as much you can in

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.130 
ribbon and slice off as much you can in
a<00:03:02.750> little<00:03:03.080> time<00:03:03.440> as<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.830> can<00:03:04.040> but<00:03:05.140> overall

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
a little time as you can but overall

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.170 
a little time as you can but overall
