worried<00:01:57.590> about<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:57.890> can<00:01:58.100> clean<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.370> up<00:01:58.550> you

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
worried about I can clean that up you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.570 
worried about I can clean that up you
know<00:01:59.540> whatever<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.740> if<00:02:00.980> i<00:02:01.070> get<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.400> same

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
know whatever but if i get the same

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.090 
know whatever but if i get the same
rough<00:02:01.910> down<00:02:02.210> here<00:02:02.510> where<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:03.140> makes<00:02:03.890> contact

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
rough down here where it makes contact

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.430 
rough down here where it makes contact
with<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.610> seals<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.480> fork<00:02:05.720> seals<00:02:05.990> then<00:02:06.290> we're

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
with the seals the fork seals then we're

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.290 
with the seals the fork seals then we're
going<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.620> have<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.830> mix<00:02:06.950> with<00:02:07.070> new<00:02:07.190> forks<00:02:07.580> and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
going to have to mix with new forks and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.729 
going to have to mix with new forks and
I'm<00:02:08.509> originally<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:08.959> kind<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.319> threw<00:02:09.619> around

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
I'm originally I kind of threw around

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.980 
I'm originally I kind of threw around
the<00:02:09.979> idea<00:02:10.129> of<00:02:10.399> getting<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:11.060> dual<00:02:11.240> disc<00:02:11.420> set<00:02:11.840> up

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
the idea of getting a dual disc set up

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.170 
the idea of getting a dual disc set up
but<00:02:12.280> i'm<00:02:13.280> not<00:02:13.460> going<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.640> go<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.940> route

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
but i'm not going to go that route

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.809 
but i'm not going to go that route
because

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
because

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.220 
because
not<00:02:14.909> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> gain<00:02:15.299> anything<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.079> only

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
not going to gain anything this is only

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.280 
not going to gain anything this is only
a<00:02:16.349> little<00:02:16.560> tiny<00:02:16.829> 350<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.180> although<00:02:19.139> it<00:02:19.200> would

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
a little tiny 350 and although it would

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.599 
a little tiny 350 and although it would
look<00:02:19.439> cool<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.219> to<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> different

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
look cool I have to get a different

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.300 
look cool I have to get a different
wheel<00:02:21.079> you<00:02:22.079> know<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.709> kind<00:02:22.889> of<00:02:22.980> thing<00:02:23.040> I've

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
wheel you know that kind of thing I've

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.830 
wheel you know that kind of thing I've
already<00:02:23.459> got<00:02:23.639> those<00:02:23.819> wheels<00:02:24.359> i<00:02:24.569> showed<00:02:24.810> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
already got those wheels i showed you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.020 
already got those wheels i showed you
over<00:02:25.139> there<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.340> there's<00:02:26.459> really<00:02:26.549> no<00:02:26.790> reason

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
over there so there's really no reason

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.580 
over there so there's really no reason
to<00:02:27.329> do<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:29.359> other<00:02:30.359> than<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:30.689> I<00:02:31.230> mean<00:02:31.469> you

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
to do that other than that I mean you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800 
to do that other than that I mean you
know<00:02:31.709> I've<00:02:31.799> got<00:02:32.239> some<00:02:33.239> parts<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.659> bike

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
know I've got some parts for the bike

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.339 
know I've got some parts for the bike
still<00:02:34.019> sitting<00:02:34.349> there<00:02:35.090> got<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.329> whole<00:02:37.079> pan

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
still sitting there got the whole pan

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.830 
still sitting there got the whole pan
here<00:02:37.590> which<00:02:37.829> is<00:02:38.010> needs<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.519> be<00:02:38.639> cleaned<00:02:39.420> see

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
here which is needs to be cleaned see

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.649 
here which is needs to be cleaned see
it's<00:02:39.959> leaked<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.439> box<00:02:40.680> there<00:02:41.659> started

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
it's leaked on the box there started

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.179 
it's leaked on the box there started
cleaning<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.079> little<00:02:43.319> bit<00:02:43.560> down<00:02:43.739> here<00:02:44.040> and

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
cleaning this a little bit down here and

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.659 
cleaning this a little bit down here and
see<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.459> difference<00:02:46.159> just<00:02:47.159> a<00:02:47.250> little<00:02:47.489> bit

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
see the difference just a little bit

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.170 
see the difference just a little bit
just<00:02:47.879> seeing<00:02:48.329> how<00:02:48.419> it's<00:02:48.659> going<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> clean<00:02:49.049> up

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
just seeing how it's going to clean up

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.970 
just seeing how it's going to clean up
next<00:02:51.180> after<00:02:51.569> we<00:02:51.900> do<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.139> frame<00:02:52.409> stuff<00:02:52.739> we'll

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
next after we do the frame stuff we'll

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.140 
next after we do the frame stuff we'll
probably<00:02:53.159> are<00:02:53.489> after<00:02:53.669> we<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.939> force

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
probably are after we do the force

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.929 
probably are after we do the force
rather<00:02:54.389> will<00:02:54.629> take<00:02:54.780> off<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.139> wiring<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.939> I'm

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
rather will take off the wiring and I'm

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.429 
rather will take off the wiring and I'm
probably<00:02:57.209> wait<00:02:57.389> till<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.629> ends<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.019> sort<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
probably wait till the ends of sort the

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.899 
probably wait till the ends of sort the
wiring<00:02:58.889> out<00:02:59.010> because<00:02:59.459> I'm<00:02:59.579> not<00:02:59.639> going<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.849> be

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
wiring out because I'm not going to be

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.159 
wiring out because I'm not going to be
using<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.359> lot<00:03:00.389> of<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.719> i'm<00:03:00.900> not<00:03:00.989> going<00:03:01.109> to

using a lot of this i'm not going to

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.839 
using a lot of this i'm not going to
turn<00:03:01.379> signals<00:03:01.889> i<00:03:01.949> have<00:03:02.099> just<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.400> brake<00:03:02.609> light

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
turn signals i have just a brake light

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.709 
turn signals i have just a brake light

get to that tomorrow i'll start making

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.159 
get to that tomorrow i'll start making
some<00:03:13.919> more<00:03:14.099> videos<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.849> that's<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.079> it

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
some more videos and that's really it

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.439 
some more videos and that's really it
adjust<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.949> update<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:17.969> a<00:03:18.180> lot

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
adjust it for the update I just a lot

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.759 
adjust it for the update I just a lot
more<00:03:18.510> space<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.139> way<00:03:19.349> instead<00:03:19.590> of

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
more space this way instead of

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.140 
more space this way instead of
separating<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.400> out<00:03:20.549> but<00:03:20.759> was<00:03:20.879> really<00:03:21.060> no

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
separating it out but was really no

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.719 
separating it out but was really no
reason<00:03:21.359> for<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:22.799> just<00:03:23.189> had<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> lot<00:03:23.549> more

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729 
reason for it I just had a lot more

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.819 
reason for it I just had a lot more
space<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.329> this<00:03:24.359> have<00:03:25.290> been<00:03:25.439> making<00:03:25.739> some

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
space like this have been making some

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.280 
space like this have been making some
channels<00:03:26.220> or<00:03:26.609> some<00:03:26.879> videos<00:03:27.569> on<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.900> Hot<00:03:28.259> List

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
channels or some videos on the Hot List

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.059 
channels or some videos on the Hot List
channel<00:03:28.889> but<00:03:29.849> I<00:03:30.439> haven't<00:03:31.439> been<00:03:31.560> neglecting

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
channel but I haven't been neglecting

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.289 
channel but I haven't been neglecting
this<00:03:32.189> one<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.519> just<00:03:32.669> those<00:03:32.790> are<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.090> much

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
this one it's just those are so much

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.640 
this one it's just those are so much
easier<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.750> make<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.139> know<00:03:34.229> it<00:03:34.319> takes<00:03:34.439> two

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
easier to make you know it takes two

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.589 
easier to make you know it takes two
