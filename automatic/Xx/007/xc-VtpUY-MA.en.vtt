more<00:01:13.070> seriously<00:01:13.490> about<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.760> reading<00:01:13.910> room<00:01:14.060> is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
more seriously about the reading room is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.300 
more seriously about the reading room is
it's<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.660> pretty<00:01:14.840> cool<00:01:15.170> feature<00:01:15.440> because<00:01:15.830> it

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
it's a pretty cool feature because it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.020 
it's a pretty cool feature because it
kind<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.990> takes<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.070> serious<00:01:19.820> edge

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
kind of it takes the the serious edge

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.360 
kind of it takes the the serious edge
out<00:01:20.510> of<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.810> game<00:01:21.080> while<00:01:21.530> there<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.950> serious

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
out of the game while there is a serious

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.980 
out of the game while there is a serious
edge<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.760> game<00:01:22.910> doing<00:01:23.450> things<00:01:23.600> like<00:01:23.810> this

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
edge the game doing things like this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.900 
edge the game doing things like this
just<00:01:24.230> being<00:01:24.620> able<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.920> come<00:01:25.160> together<00:01:25.340> before

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
just being able to come together before

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.700 
just being able to come together before
and<00:01:26.060> after<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.360> match<00:01:26.540> creates<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.440> team

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
and after the match creates a team

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.370 
and after the match creates a team
atmosphere<00:01:27.950> creates<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.820> non<00:01:29.120> non<00:01:30.050> aggressive

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
atmosphere creates a non non aggressive

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.200 
atmosphere creates a non non aggressive
atmosphere<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.580> think<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.820> lot<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.000> games

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
atmosphere and I think a lot of games

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.900 
atmosphere and I think a lot of games
could<00:01:32.570> use<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.410> could<00:01:33.710> use<00:01:33.980> situations<00:01:34.760> like

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
could use that could use situations like

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.210 
could use that could use situations like
that<00:01:34.970> because<00:01:35.300> it's<00:01:35.600> sometimes<00:01:36.170> easy<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:37.070> be<00:01:37.190> a

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
that because it's sometimes easy to be a

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.680 
that because it's sometimes easy to be a
little<00:01:37.370> bit<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.670> prick<00:01:37.940> when<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.510> know

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
little bit of a prick when you know

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.270 
little bit of a prick when you know
you'll<00:01:38.900> never<00:01:38.960> have<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.380> work<00:01:40.010> with<00:01:40.250> that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
you'll never have to work with that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.090
