that cluster eggs but I tried a new

that cluster eggs but I tried a new

trick I went and gathered up a whole

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.050 
trick I went and gathered up a whole

bunch of Catawba poop from the base of a
tree<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:28.020> covered<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.560> ground<00:04:28.740> under<00:04:29.190> my

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.920 
trees with Catawba poop and the moth
evidently<00:04:32.460> thought<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:32.970> was<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.120> good<00:04:33.360> tree<00:04:33.690> I

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
evidently thought that was a good tree I

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.960 
evidently thought that was a good tree I
think<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.440> found<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.860> new<00:04:34.980> trick<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.490> work<00:04:37.970> they

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
think I found a new trick to work they

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.880 
think I found a new trick to work they
will<00:04:39.090> eat<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> tree<00:04:39.600> up<00:04:39.840> in<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.110> short<00:04:40.410> time<00:04:40.680> if

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
will eat a tree up in a short time if

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.410 
will eat a tree up in a short time if
there's<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.190> bunch<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.700> them<00:04:41.820> but<00:04:42.060> I've<00:04:42.240> been

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
there's a bunch of them but I've been

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.850 
there's a bunch of them but I've been
getting<00:04:42.720> them<00:04:42.780> all<00:04:42.930> so<00:04:43.200> they<00:04:43.230> hadn't<00:04:43.530> eaten<00:04:43.650> my

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
getting them all so they hadn't eaten my

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.060 
getting them all so they hadn't eaten my
little<00:04:44.190> tree<00:04:44.400> up<00:04:44.610> very<00:04:44.880> much<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:46.620> see<00:04:46.890> where

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
little tree up very much and see where

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.340 
little tree up very much and see where
they<00:04:47.220> do<00:04:47.280> eat<00:04:47.640> on<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.970> leaves<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.570> think<00:04:48.720> if<00:04:49.260> I

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
they do eat on the leaves I think if I

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.510 
they do eat on the leaves I think if I
can<00:04:49.560> find<00:04:49.800> this<00:04:49.980> there<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.240> see<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.520> but

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
can find this there and see on that but

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.070 
can find this there and see on that but
they'll<00:04:53.700> completely<00:04:54.150> eat<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.570> leaves<00:04:54.780> off

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
they'll completely eat the leaves off

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.780 
they'll completely eat the leaves off
the<00:04:55.110> tree<00:04:55.470> if<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.710> leave<00:04:55.950> them<00:04:56.040> along<00:04:56.310> leave

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
the tree if you leave them along leave

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.350 
the tree if you leave them along leave
them<00:04:57.060> alone<00:04:57.090> long<00:04:57.570> enough<00:04:58.910> if<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.120> birds

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
them alone long enough if the birds

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.060 
them alone long enough if the birds
don't<00:05:00.690> get<00:05:00.960> them<00:05:01.140> other<00:05:01.350> people<00:05:01.680> don't<00:05:01.890> get

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
don't get them other people don't get

don't get them other people don't get
them<00:05:02.220> they<00:05:02.910> don't<00:05:03.120> hurt<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.570> tree<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.500> leaves
