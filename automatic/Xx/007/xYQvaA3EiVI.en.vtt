00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 hi all this h 15 and we end up 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.009
 first if you do not know me I 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.450
 am a guy who makes videos on 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.400
 recognize that he fucks mojaves all 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 the days on a youtube machine so 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.560
 if you want to see names at every 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.300
 days and for the channel sees there too if 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 you will love this video we forget 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.980
 no drawing I like it makes me really 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.750
 pleasure 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.750
 and in addition it's a death had the pm 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.369
 the her in team death match 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.020
 yes match to death by team if you 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.250
 did not see yesterday's video I was saying 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
 that there were a lot of actors everywhere 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.879
 in domination and that ends so I 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.260
 am perceived a match to death by team and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.850
 that I do it full of me but that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.910
 you will have months of a marked match 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.010
 by team for a few days there I 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.079
 think then it's to arrive 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.000
 directly to about discussion that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.410
 looks pretty much about 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.879
 of yesterday a little bit it's the hackers on a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.390
 buoy 3 I do not know what's going on but 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.469
 there is more than before yesterday 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.820
 impossible even in death match by 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.580
 team that had forgotten mullahs 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.710
 heart of stuff like this year it's 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.150
 insupportable 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.409
 so there were hackers 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.920
 it made me want to stop playing 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.900
 the 3 frankly me who am really 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 thoroughly in the es3 all the time but 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 really no I'm the subject if I have the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.540
 possibility to play in blue and pink in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.320
 online chat to play if I really did not 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.939
 the possibility of playing something else but 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.170
 there yesterday I had the opportunity to play 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.900
 to furnish 3 but I pass on 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.790
 battlefield because all three a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.979
 to support all parties to 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.079
 hackers so I do not know if what happened 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.640
 happened so kind he was doing something 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.250
 before to beg for a double heart 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.150
 and 3 and they stopped or it's 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.200
 much simpler hacker 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.079
 now or I do not know what but 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.060
 it's really unbearable 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.530
 I really can not do it anymore and I 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.920
 believe that I'm going to happen 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.140
 as well 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.329
 I want to come back to my subject a little too 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 here I think I play a little bit more 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.070
 on hba your daughter because I have 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.189
 discovered a big one finally discovered it's 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.500
 Antoine who made me discover a little the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.759
 matchmaking team mode that I 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.989
 did not know and who is super stylish 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.060
 because there are always plenty of guys 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.349
 stroller brothel that's a little what 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.129
 I like it looks a bit and so 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:20.700
 there is a little how to say the punch of 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.830
 code not nerves and so here I think 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.360
 that I will not play even 29 feed 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.590
 do not worry I will not post 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.190
 of methane cracks the chain since 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.180
 even if we keep everything waxed that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.379
 would look ripped off will not look but 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.360
 I will not go on this channel but 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.540
 we will surely start a 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.250
 chain with antoine on one of two games 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.590
 different have mainly 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.060
 battlefield with concepts of 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.370
 new concepts rather not bad that we have 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.690
 discovered and I'm not sure we're 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.459
 not really sure yet finally I think 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.879
 it's almost certain that we will start the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.810
 chain we are not really sure of 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.760
 how was it going again but in 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.930
 anyway I'll give you I'll give you 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.090
 would not put anything inscription if you 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.980
 want to see antoine and me live like 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.640
 to shareholders i got battlefield 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.909
 and other stuff 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.379
 or else by the way thank you my helmet 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.489
 attention here we hear it coming 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.430
 the second time I heard binary 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.720
 make up a brief yeah but I give you 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.599
 I will send you the good and the name of the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.930
 chain and all that but in any case that 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.489
 exactly would we can this train I 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.230
 do not know where I'm not on the 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.489
 regularity of composter videos with 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.019
 because we are going to make a new concept 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.090
 who will take time to make 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.879
 videos to make the videos and I hope 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.090
 that it will please you just if you 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.920
 love my personality 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.080
 and say we have with Antoine I think 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.629
 that it's a good channel for you 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.980
 after if you do not like it too low 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.299
 was not there I was just a shot 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.349
 from elsewhere I can if you 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.090
 turn on but yeah let's match to death by 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.400
 team with brf without silencer 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.840
 by the way talking about that I want 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.000
 to have a month will put all the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.640

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.870
 after tomorrow 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.920
 but except that I have not managed to see 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.030
 with me basel did 90 e mp7 the p90 which 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.250
 are the rule myths 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.900
 do I do not know if I have not enough 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.700
 targeted not what but I did not see 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.190
 a mob with that but in fact with the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.600
 rb7 and peace 90 I know I count 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.790
 to have a double me good match to death 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.080
 by team which is super hard because 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.940
 that I play alone and that the guys 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.139
 who make kills with me and I 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.900
 not even have a perfume box voice 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.840
 thank you for watching this video I have a 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.760
 little accelerated parties that are 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.919
 uninteresting like the my score i 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.419
 think it's 28 2 I hope it 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.880
 you will have more than 1500 3000 it's not 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.350
 badly as what you have 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.520
 smashed look videos on the screen 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.520
 now thanks all that
