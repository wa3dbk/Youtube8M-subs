00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:10.019
 Yes then 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:15.650
 I would like a little a little thought was the explanation of the exit and eggs from the mouth to the OkuNaru 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:19.520
 First of all with this connected playing card 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.660
 This loose card was included 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.260
 Once in a while acting 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.580
 Do not show this unfold this 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.580
 Playing cards 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.829
 People of Te strokes 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:40.140
 In a monster with you 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.100
 Head office here to take this and throw it away 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.610
 Put in your pocket 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.960
 Have 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:56.340
 The recovery of a finite tree coming from a boy from here was done 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:00.000
 In which even It does not matter just when a little only to strengthen the Toka how to show or was the facial expressions 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.930
 Once I think whether not it look beautiful 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.220
 Masu regular first theme demotion that we thought that if such a Fu how 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.640
 What 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.640
 Here 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.760
 Card 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.760
 All right 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.159
 I will start from the beginning and move this out to bring the card today 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.730
 Takamasa 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.340
 I will 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:31.659
 This is unusual in the pocket after this 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.909
 This was an expression I had you there a little facial expression 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.390
 In the following 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.980
 Not get close 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.970
 I'm fine 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:48.780
 Once you get here, this lamp 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.320
 As if coming out of the Vostok house trying to fall apart 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.320
 Blt 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:58.690
 It is easy for magicians to do well 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.740
 I have watched a TV and it's a little difficult because it's a size card from hitting 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.990
 But this is also 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:08.960
 It looks like it's really coming out of noon because it's smaller in size 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:14.180
 The first of it is the guy who has led the Koch in 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.900
 The card with which there is nothing from the hand comes apart in spite of having done this by showing 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:23.900
 I thought it was made just like this 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.910
 It is by all means everyone a little practice because it may be but is quite difficult magic of show 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.980
 But I think that if there 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.519
 The shop is ok ok 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.519
 Put the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.770
 dee 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.680
 Jump 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.680
 I think that you should go by all means
