00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
battlefield 3 and I found that I just

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.099 
battlefield 3 and I found that I just
couldn't<00:00:28.400> get<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.699> hang<00:00:28.849> of<00:00:29.150> it<00:00:29.240> even<00:00:29.869> though

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109

it<00:00:30.320> had<00:00:30.470> high<00:00:30.679> rate<00:00:30.859> of<00:00:30.890> fire<00:00:31.009> which<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:31.519> still

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
it had high rate of fire which it still

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.029 
it had high rate of fire which it still
maintains<00:00:31.970> in<00:00:32.450> battlefield<00:00:32.899> 4<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.440> just

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
couldn't get a feel for the weapon and I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260 
couldn't get a feel for the weapon and I
always<00:00:36.410> seem<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.800> get<00:00:36.920> outshot<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:38.120> other

thing was I always seem to burn through
my<00:00:39.890> ammunition<00:00:40.129> quickly<00:00:40.789> and<00:00:41.030> with<00:00:41.210> no

support classes around that we're
dropping<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.190> dropping<00:00:43.340> ammo<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.840> was<00:00:44.989> a

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
dropping and dropping ammo that was a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.430 
dropping and dropping ammo that was a
problem<00:00:45.520> here<00:00:46.520> though<00:00:46.789> it<00:00:47.480> seems<00:00:48.109> as<00:00:48.410> though

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
problem here though it seems as though

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.349 
problem here though it seems as though
the<00:00:48.800> weapon<00:00:49.129> has<00:00:49.160> gotten<00:00:49.699> a<00:00:49.940> little<00:00:50.149> bit<00:00:50.329> of

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
the weapon has gotten a little bit of

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:51.970 
the weapon has gotten a little bit of
love<00:00:50.449> I<00:00:50.870> don't<00:00:51.109> know<00:00:51.230> if<00:00:51.469> it's<00:00:51.620> my<00:00:51.769> imagination

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
love I don't know if it's my imagination

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.970 
love I don't know if it's my imagination
or<00:00:52.609> what<00:00:52.850> but<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.510> am<00:00:53.870> having<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.379> blast<00:00:54.559> with

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
or what but I am having a blast with

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.189 
or what but I am having a blast with
this<00:00:55.039> weapon<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.000> I<00:00:56.059> find<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.570> even<00:00:56.719> more

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
this weapon and I find it even more

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.669 
this weapon and I find it even more
effective<00:00:57.620> than<00:00:58.309> I<00:00:58.760> know<00:00:58.910> this<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.269> blasphemy

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
effective than I know this is blasphemy

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.639 
effective than I know this is blasphemy
than<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:00.829> m416<00:01:01.579> now<00:01:02.179> the<00:01:02.239> m416<00:01:02.899> is<00:01:03.170> arguably

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
than the m416 now the m416 is arguably

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.920 
than the m416 now the m416 is arguably
probably<00:01:04.160> one<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.489> best<00:01:04.640> guns<00:01:04.939> in<00:01:05.390> the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
probably one of the best guns in the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.749 
probably one of the best guns in the
game<00:01:06.140> it's<00:01:06.680> also<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.040> most<00:01:07.070> accessible

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
game it's also the most accessible

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.670 
game it's also the most accessible
because<00:01:07.939> you<00:01:08.210> unlock<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:08.750> fairly<00:01:09.049> early<00:01:09.350> so

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
because you unlock it fairly early so

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.520 
because you unlock it fairly early so
you'll<00:01:10.070> see<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.250> lot<00:01:10.369> of<00:01:10.430> low-level<00:01:10.820> players

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
you'll see a lot of low-level players

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.859 
you'll see a lot of low-level players
running<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.680> m416<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:14.479> other<00:01:14.659> thing<00:01:14.840> about

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
running the m416 the other thing about

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.649 
running the m416 the other thing about
it<00:01:15.259> is<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.439> it's<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.340> fairly<00:01:16.610> easy<00:01:16.970> weapon<00:01:17.479> to

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
it is that it's a fairly easy weapon to

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.140 
it is that it's a fairly easy weapon to
control<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:18.740> easy<00:01:19.100> for<00:01:19.369> players<00:01:19.640> who<00:01:19.790> aren't

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
control it's easy for players who aren't

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.819 
control it's easy for players who aren't
used<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.540> dealing<00:01:20.750> with<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:20.960> lot<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.170> recoil<00:01:21.409> or

don't<00:01:22.040> know<00:01:22.130> how<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.310> compensate<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:23.090> recoil

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
don't know how to compensate for recoil

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
to get a good hold on this weapon and to

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.380 
to get a good hold on this weapon and to
be<00:01:26.210> able<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:26.540> excel<00:01:27.549> unlike<00:01:28.549> weapons<00:01:28.970> like<00:01:29.180> say

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
be able to excel unlike weapons like say

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.109 
be able to excel unlike weapons like say
the<00:01:29.630> AEK<00:01:30.590> which<00:01:30.860> has<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> tremendous<00:01:31.670> amount<00:01:32.000> of

the AEK which has a tremendous amount of
upwards<00:01:32.689> recoil<00:01:32.840> as<00:01:33.259> well<00:01:33.409> side-to-side

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.950 
upwards recoil as well side-to-side
recoil<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.729> it's<00:01:35.210> difficult<00:01:35.509> for

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
recoil and it's difficult for

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.410 
recoil and it's difficult for
inexperienced<00:01:36.799> players<00:01:37.280> or<00:01:37.820> players<00:01:37.909> that

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
and a suppressor now you saw that I was

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.350

just able to get that guy was a fairly

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.600 
just able to get that guy was a fairly

long range shot for a suppressed famas
and<00:03:33.450> he<00:03:34.260> was<00:03:34.380> peeking<00:03:34.650> over<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.950> rock<00:03:35.160> a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
and he was peeking over that rock a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.670 
and he was peeking over that rock a
little<00:03:35.820> bit<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.090> tap<00:03:36.239> firing<00:03:36.570> aiming<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.560> little

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
little bit of tap firing aiming a little

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.140 
little bit of tap firing aiming a little
bit<00:03:37.890> higher<00:03:38.130> because<00:03:38.489> remember<00:03:38.910> your

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
bit higher because remember your

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.470 
bit higher because remember your
suppressor<00:03:39.950> affects<00:03:40.950> your<00:03:41.070> bullet<00:03:41.340> velocity

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
suppressor affects your bullet velocity

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.400 
suppressor affects your bullet velocity
which<00:03:42.480> means<00:03:42.690> your<00:03:42.780> bullets<00:03:43.019> are<00:03:43.079> gonna<00:03:43.170> fall

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
which means your bullets are gonna fall

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.380 
which means your bullets are gonna fall
off<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.650> lot<00:03:43.920> quicker<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.760> was<00:03:44.910> still<00:03:45.180> able

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
off a lot quicker but I was still able

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.319 
off a lot quicker but I was still able
