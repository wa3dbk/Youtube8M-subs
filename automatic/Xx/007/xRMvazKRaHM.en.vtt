is<00:06:45.800> you<00:06:45.949> can<00:06:46.039> look<00:06:46.160> it<00:06:46.250> up<00:06:46.340> on<00:06:46.520> I<00:06:46.550> think<00:06:46.820> it's

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
is you can look it up on I think it's

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.300 
is you can look it up on I think it's
scuff<00:06:47.150> gaming<00:06:47.600> calm<00:06:48.050> but<00:06:48.320> it's<00:06:48.500> a<00:06:48.620> custom

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
the back they're super cool they're

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.580 
the back they're super cool they're
really<00:06:53.030> geared<00:06:53.870> towards<00:06:53.900> first-person

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 
creative with it it could but I'm really

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.680 
creative with it it could but I'm really
excited<00:07:01.639> about<00:07:01.789> that<00:07:01.940> probably<00:07:02.360> do<00:07:02.449> a<00:07:02.479> review
