00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
22nd the launch in Japan I'm quite sure

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.039 
22nd the launch in Japan I'm quite sure
the<00:02:15.870> numbers<00:02:16.200> are<00:02:16.379> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.800> very<00:02:17.129> high

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
the numbers are going to be very high

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.959 
the numbers are going to be very high
every<00:02:19.049> time<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.560> went<00:02:19.889> on<00:02:20.040> pre-order<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.609> Japan

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969 
every time it went on pre-order in Japan

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.040 
every time it went on pre-order in Japan
it's<00:02:21.329> sold<00:02:21.870> out<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.799> minutes

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
it's sold out in minutes

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.950 
it's sold out in minutes
so<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.950> numbers<00:02:25.400> are<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.940> be<00:02:26.060> high<00:02:26.270> now

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
so the numbers are going to be high now
