there's a chance for us to try to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.110 
there's a chance for us to try to
understand<00:02:38.770> something<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.490> monastic

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
understand something of the monastic

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.000 
understand something of the monastic
tradition<00:02:40.450> what<00:02:41.110> they<00:02:41.320> went<00:02:41.530> through<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.980> how

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
tradition what they went through and how

00:02:42.010 --> 00:03:03.210 
tradition what they went through and how
chant<00:02:42.610> was<00:02:43.030> developed<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.590> past<00:03:02.860> I

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
chant was developed in the past I

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.070 
chant was developed in the past I
suppose<00:03:03.340> they<00:03:03.790> would<00:03:03.910> have<00:03:04.090> had<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.570> hundred

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
suppose they would have had a hundred

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.140 
suppose they would have had a hundred
more<00:03:05.470> than<00:03:05.530> 100<00:03:05.950> monks<00:03:06.280> in<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.610> Abbey<00:03:06.910> at

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
more than 100 monks in the Abbey at

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.400 
more than 100 monks in the Abbey at
various<00:03:07.600> times<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:09.390> we<00:03:10.390> had<00:03:10.600> about<00:03:10.750> 120

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
various times and we had about 120

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.979 
various times and we had about 120
people<00:03:11.709> here<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:12.730> gives<00:03:13.000> an<00:03:13.120> idea<00:03:13.239> roughly

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
people here so it gives an idea roughly

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.229 
people here so it gives an idea roughly
of<00:03:14.080> how<00:03:14.290> packed<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:15.160> choir<00:03:15.400> would<00:03:15.760> have<00:03:16.000> been

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
of how packed the choir would have been

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:56.530 
of how packed the choir would have been
at<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.260> time<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:21.480> was

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.170 

we'll<00:03:57.540> take<00:03:57.750> my<00:03:58.130> inspiration<00:03:59.130> from<00:03:59.850> having

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
we'll take my inspiration from having

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.420 
we'll take my inspiration from having
met<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:00.720> many<00:04:00.750> people<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.560> suppose<00:04:01.950> at<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.190> top

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
met so many people I suppose at the top

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.150 
met so many people I suppose at the top
of<00:04:02.610> their<00:04:02.820> profession<00:04:03.330> but<00:04:03.990> who<00:04:04.440> should<00:04:04.800> I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
of their profession but who should I

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.610 
of their profession but who should I
think<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.490> profound<00:04:05.970> spirituality<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.110> think

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
think a profound spirituality I think

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.140 
think a profound spirituality I think
which<00:04:07.800> is<00:04:07.980> something<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.370> we<00:04:08.550> need<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:08.850> take
