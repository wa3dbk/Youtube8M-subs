00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:17.089
 Crackdown of 2007 a production able to split critical users 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.539
 forming two stumps 1 intent to cheer him the other treat him like a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.849
 rather mediocre paradox 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.089
 the title was still a success 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.560
 jessica streaming distance raf and environment tries to replicate with a sai 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.110
 what follows is the path of the alberto pd 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.110
 crackdown 2 will be available exclusively for xbox 360 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.740
 from 9 July 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.520
 the first point in common between old and new and without doubt the component 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.449
 storytelling 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.899
 present as - outline to begin introduction to the world. 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.530
 fassitech simti 10 years of female crime few is a city almost 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.589
 completely ruin me which 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.670
 a virus that changes humans is spreading like wildfire 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.329
 give a sort of zombie of athletic quality to hinder 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.229
 agency involved in the elimination of fried foods will take care of it even if it is new to me 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.560
 argument the rebellious dog this phantom free 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 our customizable alter-ego simply by selecting in the face between 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.659
 a series of predefined models will therefore be found between two foci in a 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.490
 constant flurry of firefights the melee that will leave no room 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.970
 twists reflection 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.970
 a sort of return to the origins of the Roma 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.420
 that especially after seeing read dead redemption we do not feel of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 to share 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 the play structure of crack down 2 shares the same fate as that 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.740
 intimate narrative articulated modular tasks and anything else but a series of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.080
 simple goals 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.899
 everything 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.719
 the huge map of fix it steps will fill mom is one of the symbols 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.340
 symbols that will act as indicators for doing activities we could 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.090
 indivisible sbobet if we want in main and secondary 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.299
 rice the first will be characterized by the differentiation between saddles freaks 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.769
 even if, on balance, they will see us engaged in quite similar small items 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.109
 for example, rebel occupations will force us to engage 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.519
 steno anti fighting waiting for the strong or simple will exterminate sheltered by 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.269
 energy installations tampered with by the same 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.419
 by activating this installation we could therefore have rights of its own 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.299
 to destroy them from within 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.999
 eliminated the inhabitants of a lair will create a split his bar 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.290
 surface that will have to be punctually closed again making the square 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.290
 clean and lot 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.159
 conventional weapons kill common 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.159
 but if you want a job done daily 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.680
 the secondary missions on their part will not see graves being engaged in the course 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.619
 listicket and so on 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.709
 as reiterated since the first moments of play the day will be the territory of 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.639
 always the note of the freaks 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.749
 so open up dine map don't underestimate 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.170
 during the day the rebels will spread to the city to create the 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:06.850
 panic 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.059
 and the mutants burrowed were their how to bury me 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.929
 vice versa, at night, the abominable street will run around 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:14.570
 roads 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.819
 with dissidents holed up in the areas of their domain 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.830
 all this leads to different scenarios however 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.329
 they are not enough to eliminate a really high background repetition 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.559
 mitigated only in part by the German growth system 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.360
 even in this you know those facts 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.020
 our hero will feature 5 parameter instincts whose enhancement 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.080
 initially useful for reaching inaccessible macaws 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.869
 will force a methodical extraction 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.659
 in the long run, however, the lack of a narrative background structure and 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.559
 something that spurs progression feels bringing in the title has one 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:54.519
 remarkable component dispersive education entirely for its own sake 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.459
 after a few hours of play beyond an undeniable amusement among the title yes 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.019
 transforms the summary a sort of futuristic crawler cut 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.849
 where is the pursuit of the bags 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.510
 the confusion is almost always the master together with the frenzy 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.300
 greater than the battles fed by the same power from our alter 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.729
 ego and from some problem firearm game system 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.290
 from a technical point of view, crackdown 2 is only slightly convincing 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.569
 and precisely in the structuring of the interesting cat bari design 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.439
 and in the last depth of field that characterize that comes out a little so 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.639
 in striming 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.879
 the same cannot be said, unfortunately, of everything else 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.460
 from the polygonal modeling of characters in the same environment 

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:51.580
 generally poor texturization 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.160
 to finish not compact of low level particle effects 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
 and a rather poor animation sector 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.610
 even if we tried to cover with hostel sharing all in all pleasant 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.479
 lady 20 technical deficiencies the glance and those that do not remain 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.490
 imprinted 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.510
 in the media the sound sector 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.190
 with successful samples 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.990
 catchy music and dubbing for the few lines of dialogue present 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.990
 of moderate turnover 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.759
 crackdown 2 on balance is a game suitable for those seeking care 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.770
 serious experience with a single splash of plot 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.370
 and even less presents psychological characters for these site rankings 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.370
 could become the ideal playground but for how much 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.379
 cystitis in the facts it wins after little to do that conceptual not indifferent 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.330
 proposing a progression all too focused on empowerment end in itself 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.610
 same of the protagonist to which are added 5 6 assignments say all 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.889
 dozens of times without logical reasoning convinces 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.259
 the mediocrity of the Enfin production expressed by a sentral technical sector 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.210
 minimal artistic vocation simply functional in order to reproduce 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.039
 a huge and sparsely populated setting 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.509
 too bad because as we said positive elements cession of 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.849
 title and in any case capable of amusing surprise in small doses 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.409
 far too little, however, to wait in this generation
