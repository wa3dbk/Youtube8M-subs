00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.580 
central claims of the great world
religions<00:00:14.629> are<00:00:15.629> true<00:00:16.670> a<00:00:17.670> lot<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.690> us<00:00:18.960> would

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
religions are true a lot of us would

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
religions are true a lot of us would
call<00:00:19.769> ourselves<00:00:19.980> spiritual<00:00:20.910> that's<00:00:21.330> even

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
call ourselves spiritual that's even

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.130 
call ourselves spiritual that's even
religious<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.250> taught<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.090> tend<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
religious but we are taught and tend to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.849 
religious but we are taught and tend to
accept<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:27.050> secular<00:00:28.050> history<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> world

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
accept a secular history of the world

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.749 
accept a secular history of the world
and<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> first<00:00:31.109> part<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.310> sacred

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and so the first part of the sacred

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.470 
and so the first part of the sacred
history<00:00:34.730> tells<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> history<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.250> creation<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.580 
history tells the history of creation of
evolution<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> founding<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.820> ancient

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
evolution and the founding of ancient

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.180 
evolution and the founding of ancient
civilizations<00:00:44.840> according<00:00:45.860> to<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> great

civilizations according to the great
religions<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.969> story<00:00:51.329> of

the<00:00:52.170> world<00:00:52.440> created<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.760> helped<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> evolve

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
the world created and helped to evolve

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.569 
the world created and helped to evolve
by<00:00:55.969> great<00:00:56.969> spiritual<00:00:57.570> beings<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.399> then<00:00:59.399> in

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
by great spiritual beings and then in

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.070 
by great spiritual beings and then in
the<00:00:59.699> second<00:01:00.120> half<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> book<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:03.080> have

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the second half of the book I have

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.670 
the second half of the book I have
accumulated<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:05.340> lot<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> evidence<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:07.050> show

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
accumulated a lot of evidence to show

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
accumulated a lot of evidence to show
that<00:01:08.160> again<00:01:08.520> contrary<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.660> what<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.020> might

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that again contrary to what you might

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.220 
that again contrary to what you might
expect<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:13.230> supernatural<00:01:14.190> has<00:01:14.940> continued<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
expect the supernatural has continued to

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.380 
expect the supernatural has continued to
operate<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.850> modern<00:01:18.120> world<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:19.590> people

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
operate in the modern world but people

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.890 
operate in the modern world but people
are<00:01:21.390> still<00:01:22.100> guided<00:01:23.100> by<00:01:23.340> great<00:01:24.210> spiritual

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
are still guided by great spiritual

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.400 
are still guided by great spiritual
beings<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> appear<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.290> in<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
beings that appear to them and in the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.400 
beings that appear to them and in the
20th<00:01:28.830> century<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.730> was<00:01:29.850> still<00:01:30.210> very<00:01:30.960> large

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
20th century there was still very large

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.640 
20th century there was still very large
scale<00:01:32.100> miracles<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> par<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
scale miracles on a par with the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.470 
scale miracles on a par with the
American<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.160> miracles<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.940> attended

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
American of the miracles that attended

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.320 
American of the miracles that attended
the<00:01:36.570> life<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.960> Moses<00:01:37.440> witnessed<00:01:38.370> by<00:01:38.580> thousands

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
the life of Moses witnessed by thousands

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.690 
the life of Moses witnessed by thousands
of<00:01:39.450> people<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.920> tend<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> assume<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of people now we tend to assume that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.890 
of people now we tend to assume that
isn't<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> case

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
isn't the case

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.270 
isn't the case
and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> root<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.220> is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and I think that the root of that is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.310 
and I think that the root of that is
probably<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.450> root<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:48.390> tendency<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
probably the root of the the tendency to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.130 
probably the root of the the tendency to
-<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.100> dismiss<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.120> is<00:01:51.300> is<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> Scottish

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
- to dismiss that it is is the Scottish

- to dismiss that it is is the Scottish

David<00:01:54.690> Hume<00:01:55.760> said<00:01:56.760> well<00:01:57.230> isn't<00:01:58.230> it

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
David Hume said well isn't it

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.450 
David Hume said well isn't it
extraordinary<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:02.930> miracles<00:02:04.100> only<00:02:05.100> ever

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
extraordinary that miracles only ever

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.040 
extraordinary that miracles only ever
seemed<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:05.970> happened<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.420> long<00:02:06.450> time<00:02:06.660> ago

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
seemed to have happened a long time ago

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.279 
seemed to have happened a long time ago
and<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:08.129> remote<00:02:08.459> places<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.539> what<00:02:09.869> he<00:02:10.050> meant

and in remote places and what he meant
by<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.500> was<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.100> suggest<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.700> they<00:02:12.180> haven't

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
by that was to suggest that they haven't

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.690 
by that was to suggest that they haven't
really<00:02:12.780> happened

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
really happened
