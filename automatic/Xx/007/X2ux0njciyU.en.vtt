00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and like most Kirby games you can float

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.980 
and like most Kirby games you can float
forever<00:01:05.220> which<00:01:05.580> makes<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.030> too<00:01:06.240> fucking<00:01:06.840> easy

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
forever which makes it too fucking easy

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.520 
forever which makes it too fucking easy
look<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.590> this

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.190 

Kirby<00:01:16.250> 64<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:17.090> don't<00:01:17.330> know<00:01:17.450> what<00:01:17.690> it<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:17.810> about

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
Kirby 64 I don't know what it is about

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.930 
Kirby 64 I don't know what it is about
all<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> geometric<00:01:18.980> shapes<00:01:19.280> but<00:01:19.610> they're

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
all the geometric shapes but they're

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.340 
all the geometric shapes but they're
just<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:20.330> cool

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
just so cool

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.080 
just so cool
you<00:01:21.440> can't<00:01:21.710> float<00:01:22.010> forever<00:01:22.370> so<00:01:22.700> that's<00:01:22.940> an

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
you can't float forever so that's an

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.090 
you can't float forever so that's an
improvement<00:01:23.330> but<00:01:23.840> it's<00:01:23.990> still<00:01:24.229> too<00:01:24.410> easy<00:01:24.440> gets

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
improvement but it's still too easy gets

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.650 
improvement but it's still too easy gets
too<00:01:25.310> repetitive<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:26.210> seems<00:01:26.450> like

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
too repetitive and it seems like

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.330 
too repetitive and it seems like
everything<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.200> spaced<00:01:27.470> too<00:01:27.680> far<00:01:27.950> apart<00:01:28.280> from

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
everything is spaced too far apart from

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.100 
everything is spaced too far apart from
each<00:01:28.490> other<00:01:28.640> which<00:01:28.910> makes<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.240> too<00:01:29.420> slow<00:01:29.750> it's

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
each other which makes it too slow it's

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.690 
each other which makes it too slow it's
kind<00:01:30.410> of<00:01:30.500> kiddie<00:01:30.740> but<00:01:31.010> that's<00:01:31.310> okay<00:01:31.670> because

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
kind of kiddie but that's okay because

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.370 
kind of kiddie but that's okay because
all<00:01:32.119> games<00:01:32.360> are<00:01:32.510> nothing<00:01:32.720> but<00:01:32.810> life<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.170> sound

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
all games are nothing but life and sound
