with the donphan so I went out into a
concession<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.500> corsage<00:02:43.800> can

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
concession on that a corsage can

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.290 
concession on that a corsage can
actually<00:02:44.430> take<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> earthquake<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.150> just

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
actually take the earthquake and just

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.880 
actually take the earthquake and just
Casey<00:02:45.510> happy<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.960> go<00:02:46.080> for<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.260> rapid<00:02:46.500> spin

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
Casey happy to go for the rapid spin

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.010 
Casey happy to go for the rapid spin
that's<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:47.220> biggest<00:02:47.610> concern<00:02:48.240> for<00:02:48.690> him<00:02:48.810> going

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
that's my biggest concern for him going

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.110 
that's my biggest concern for him going
for<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.290> rapid<00:02:49.470> spin<00:02:49.830> but<00:02:50.340> at<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.670> same<00:02:50.880> time

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
for the rapid spin but at the same time

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.940 
for the rapid spin but at the same time
it<00:02:51.360> helps<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.930> i'm<00:02:52.080> not<00:02:52.110> making<00:02:52.680> these

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
it helps that i'm not making these

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.860 
it helps that i'm not making these
switches<00:02:53.250> because<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.970> makes<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.600> look<00:02:54.840> like

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
switches because it makes it look like

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.440 
switches because it makes it look like
i'm<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.530> noob<00:02:55.740> i<00:02:55.920> really<00:02:56.460> really<00:02:56.760> look<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.120> i'm

i'm a noob i really really look like i'm

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.880 
i'm a noob i really really look like i'm
a<00:02:57.480> new<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:57.990> instance<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.530> greninja

a new like for instance this greninja
comes<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.400> why<00:02:59.760> would<00:02:59.940> you<00:02:59.970> switch<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.420> good

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
comes in why would you switch and good

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
enough so I can actually switch out into

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.330 
enough so I can actually switch out into
mice<00:03:06.450> may<00:03:06.660> go<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.440> swing<00:03:07.710> closed<00:03:07.950> f-father
