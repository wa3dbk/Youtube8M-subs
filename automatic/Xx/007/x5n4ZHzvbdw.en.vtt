want to do is to isolate each one of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.889 
want to do is to isolate each one of
these<00:00:55.350> balls<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> smaller<00:00:57.180> shape<00:00:57.600> than

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
these balls into a smaller shape than

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
these balls into a smaller shape than
this<00:00:58.020> rectangle<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.489> here

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
this rectangle so I'm going to go here

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
this rectangle so I'm going to go here
and<00:00:59.969> hope<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.899> ice<00:01:01.170> balls<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.070> hit

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and hope that my ice balls do not hit

and hope that my ice balls do not hit
the<00:01:03.090> bar<00:01:03.390> before<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.899> close<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.500> off<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.949> let<00:01:05.129> me

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the bar before I close it off so let me

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
the bar before I close it off so let me
try<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.400> again<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.909> unfortunately<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.960> hit
