00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
actually rebuilt this the lab that I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.240 
actually rebuilt this the lab that I
usually<00:00:55.969> do<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.960> mod<00:00:57.140> reviews<00:00:57.559> in<00:00:57.739> into<00:00:58.219> a

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
usually do the mod reviews in into a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.639 
usually do the mod reviews in into a
normal<00:00:58.820> world<00:00:59.000> because<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.690> used<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:00.410> be<00:01:00.530> in

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
normal world because I used to be in

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.310 
normal world because I used to be in
just<00:01:00.829> say<00:01:00.949> a<00:01:01.219> flat<00:01:01.789> world<00:01:02.090> but<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:02.870> just<00:01:03.170> think

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
just say a flat world but I just think

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.800 
just say a flat world but I just think
it<00:01:03.500> was<00:01:03.559> too<00:01:03.620> plain<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.309> I<00:01:04.340> decided<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:05.150> just<00:01:05.600> go

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
it was too plain so I decided to just go

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.310 
it was too plain so I decided to just go
into<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.790> random<00:01:07.790> world<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.720> rebuild<00:01:09.230> it

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
into a random world and just rebuild it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.230 
into a random world and just rebuild it
so<00:01:09.470> I<00:01:09.500> think<00:01:09.740> it's<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:10.100> lot<00:01:10.640> more<00:01:10.790> better<00:01:10.970> than

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
so I think it's a lot more better than

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.330 
so I think it's a lot more better than
just<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.600> flat<00:01:11.840> world<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:12.799> once<00:01:13.189> you<00:01:13.310> install

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
just the flat world so once you install

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.609 
just the flat world so once you install
it<00:01:13.939> into<00:01:14.479> block<00:01:14.869> launches<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:15.380> if<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:15.530> guys

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.260

aren't<00:01:15.920> block<00:01:16.189> launch<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.549> full<00:01:16.759> zero<00:01:17.030> point

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
aren't block launch a full zero point

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.120 
aren't block launch a full zero point

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
which is pretty cool I love this mode

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.550 
which is pretty cool I love this mode
because<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.240> working<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:14.780> zero<00:02:15.230> point

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
because it's working on zero point

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.480 
because it's working on zero point
eleven<00:02:15.620> point<00:02:16.070> Oh

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
eleven point Oh

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.360 
eleven point Oh
so<00:02:16.880> let's<00:02:17.090> go<00:02:17.540> ahead<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.050> open<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.770> back

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
so let's go ahead and open that back

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.520 
so let's go ahead and open that back
up<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.760> let's<00:02:20.360> see<00:02:20.510> what<00:02:20.659> else<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:20.959> can<00:02:21.110> do<00:02:21.290> so

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
up and let's see what else we can do so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.220 
up and let's see what else we can do so
I<00:02:21.560> think<00:02:21.680> C<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.250> be<00:02:22.430> right<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:23.000> us<00:02:23.150> you'll<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:24.019> a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
I think C to be right of us you'll see a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.289 
I think C to be right of us you'll see a
back<00:02:24.530> button<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.159> a<00:02:25.340> next<00:02:25.760> button<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.269> can

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
back button and a next button so you can

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.720 
back button and a next button so you can
navigate<00:02:26.599> which<00:02:27.440> item<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.860> basically<00:02:28.370> want

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
navigate which item you basically want

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.789 
navigate which item you basically want
so<00:02:29.030> say<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:29.659> wanted<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:29.989> go<00:02:30.140> into<00:02:30.290> survival

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
so say we wanted to go into survival

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.220 
so say we wanted to go into survival
like<00:02:31.129> that<00:02:31.370> okay<00:02:31.730> I'm<00:02:31.819> in<00:02:31.970> survival<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.599> say

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
like that okay I'm in survival and say

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.930

squid egg I don't actually see it there
either<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.849> he's<00:04:11.269> most<00:04:11.540> likely<00:04:11.870> going<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.079> be

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
either so he's most likely going to be

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.009 
either so he's most likely going to be
adding<00:04:12.639> more<00:04:13.639> stuff<00:04:14.000> obviously<00:04:14.629> into<00:04:14.900> this

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
adding more stuff obviously into this

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.140 
adding more stuff obviously into this
mod<00:04:15.290> since<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.709> is<00:04:15.829> still<00:04:16.190> in<00:04:16.489> beta<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:16.940> he's

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
mod since it is still in beta and he's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.170 
mod since it is still in beta and he's
still<00:04:17.389> working<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:18.440> improve<00:04:18.829> this<00:04:19.130> mod<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:20.150> I

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
still working to improve this mod so I

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.909 
still working to improve this mod so I
think<00:04:20.269> it's<00:04:20.479> really<00:04:20.720> cool<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.260> let's<00:04:21.650> go<00:04:21.829> ahead

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.310 
think it's really cool so let's go ahead
and<00:04:22.280> go<00:04:22.490> into<00:04:22.880> creative<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.720> then<00:04:23.810> back<00:04:24.110> into

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
and go into creative and then back into

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.219 
and go into creative and then back into
survival<00:04:24.830> so<00:04:25.460> we<00:04:25.580> just<00:04:25.789> clear<00:04:26.150> our<00:04:26.479> inventory

got a mushroom we've got a mushroom from
that<00:05:04.460> I<00:05:04.610> have<00:05:04.880> no<00:05:05.150> idea<00:05:05.509> what<00:05:06.259> block<00:05:06.530> that<00:05:06.710> was

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
that I have no idea what block that was

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.260 
that I have no idea what block that was
going<00:05:07.009> to<00:05:07.070> be<00:05:07.190> but<00:05:07.400> we<00:05:07.550> just<00:05:07.729> got<00:05:07.940> mushrooms

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
going to be but we just got mushrooms

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.600 
going to be but we just got mushrooms
and<00:05:08.599> we<00:05:08.780> can<00:05:08.900> just<00:05:09.050> place<00:05:09.289> that<00:05:09.320> down<00:05:09.610> wherever

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
and we can just place that down wherever

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.029 
and we can just place that down wherever
you<00:05:10.759> want<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:11.300> it's<00:05:11.780> really<00:05:12.020> cool<00:05:12.259> and<00:05:12.440> the

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
you want so it's really cool and the

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.310 
you want so it's really cool and the
next<00:05:13.400> button<00:05:13.580> actually<00:05:14.570> doesn't<00:05:14.870> do<00:05:15.020> anything

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
next button actually doesn't do anything

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.480 
next button actually doesn't do anything
at<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.590> moment<00:05:15.740> he's<00:05:16.070> still<00:05:16.340> actually

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
at the moment he's still actually

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.060 
at the moment he's still actually
working<00:05:16.970> on<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.180> mod<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:18.770> will<00:05:18.949> probably

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
working on the mod so that will probably

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.400 
working on the mod so that will probably
be<00:05:19.370> fixed<00:05:19.699> in<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.419> next<00:05:20.509> couple<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.169> versions

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
be fixed in the next couple of versions

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.050 
be fixed in the next couple of versions
buzzing<00:05:21.919> see<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.220> can<00:05:22.340> just<00:05:22.370> add<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.849> eggs

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060
