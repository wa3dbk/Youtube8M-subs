neat I think it I think a lot of people
using<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.500> in<00:04:31.740> the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
using it in the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.230 
using it in the
bacchus<00:04:32.410> way<00:04:32.620> possible<00:04:33.220> which<00:04:33.460> is<00:04:33.610> uploading

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240

the coolest thing I think about YouTube
is<00:04:47.500> is<00:04:47.680> like<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:49.419> ability<00:04:49.629> to

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
is is like the the ability to

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.830 
is is like the the ability to
decentralize<00:04:51.069> not<00:04:51.520> only<00:04:51.819> you<00:04:52.120> know<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.240> media

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.499 
decentralize not only you know the media
and<00:04:53.169> television<00:04:53.470> all<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.889> stuff<00:04:54.099> but<00:04:54.280> like

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
and television all the stuff but like

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.149 
and television all the stuff but like
education<00:04:55.509> has<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.349> potential<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.889> be

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
education has the potential to be

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.790 
education has the potential to be
decentralized<00:04:58.120> i<00:04:58.330> mean<00:04:58.449> i<00:04:58.479> can<00:04:58.750> put<00:04:58.960> I<00:04:59.080> i<00:04:59.169> I'm

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
decentralized i mean i can put I i I'm

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.619 
decentralized i mean i can put I i I'm
hoping<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.490> have<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.639> time<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.030> resources
