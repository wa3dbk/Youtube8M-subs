the<00:01:59.200> attention<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.710> your<00:01:59.770> students<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.640> that

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
the attention of your students so that

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.950 
the attention of your students so that
when<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:00.970> talk<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.390> them<00:02:01.509> when<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:01.720> give<00:02:01.900> them

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
when you talk to them when you give them

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.390 
when you talk to them when you give them
your<00:02:02.110> instructions<00:02:02.650> they're<00:02:03.100> actually

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
your instructions they're actually

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.490 
your instructions they're actually
listening<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:04.150> now<00:02:04.930> some<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.229> these<00:02:05.350> are

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
listening to you now some of these are

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.260 
listening to you now some of these are
applicable<00:02:05.740> for<00:02:05.979> older<00:02:06.310> students<00:02:06.700> some<00:02:07.150> are

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
applicable for older students some are

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.729 
applicable for older students some are
more<00:02:07.360> suitable<00:02:07.689> for<00:02:07.930> younger<00:02:08.079> students<00:02:08.590> and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
more suitable for younger students and

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.229 
more suitable for younger students and
they<00:02:09.039> might<00:02:09.249> not<00:02:09.429> all<00:02:09.639> suit<00:02:09.909> your<00:02:10.090> particular

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
they might not all suit your particular

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.119 
they might not all suit your particular
teaching<00:02:11.049> style<00:02:11.349> but<00:02:11.769> they<00:02:11.829> don't<00:02:11.950> give<00:02:12.040> you

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
teaching style but they don't give you

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.050 
teaching style but they don't give you
something<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.519> about<00:02:12.669> they're<00:02:12.909> a<00:02:12.939> good

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
something to think about they're a good

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.020 
something to think about they're a good
starting<00:02:13.450> point

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
starting point

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.000 
starting point
first<00:02:14.450> I'm<00:02:14.569> going<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.810> cover<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.200> noisemakers

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
first I'm going to cover is noisemakers

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.920 
first I'm going to cover is noisemakers
and<00:02:16.190> noisemakers<00:02:17.150> come<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.420> all<00:02:17.540> sorts<00:02:17.870> of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
and noisemakers come in all sorts of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.750 
and noisemakers come in all sorts of
shapes<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.590> sizes<00:02:18.800> but<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.220> one<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.370> use<00:02:19.730> when

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
shapes and sizes but the one I use when

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.160 
shapes and sizes but the one I use when
I'm<00:02:20.120> doing<00:02:20.360> workshops<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.990> when<00:02:21.080> I'm

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
I'm doing workshops and when I'm

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.090 
I'm doing workshops and when I'm
teaching<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.010> bugle<00:02:22.430> horn<00:02:23.709> now<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.800> bugle

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
teaching is a bugle horn now the bugle

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.800 
teaching is a bugle horn now the bugle
horn<00:02:25.190> is<00:02:25.400> effective<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:25.970> two<00:02:26.150> reasons<00:02:26.569> one

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
horn is effective for two reasons one

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.809 
horn is effective for two reasons one
it's<00:02:27.590> quite<00:02:27.830> loud<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.400> does<00:02:28.550> get<00:02:28.700> their

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
it's quite loud so it does get their

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.210 
it's quite loud so it does get their
attention<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.959> other<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:31.040> little

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
attention and the other it's a little

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.040 
attention and the other it's a little
bit<00:02:31.310> silly<00:02:31.520> it's<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.790> bit<00:02:31.910> humorous<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
bit silly it's a bit humorous and that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.780 
bit silly it's a bit humorous and that
takes<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.470> sting<00:02:33.770> out<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:34.310> getting<00:02:34.430> their

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
takes the sting out of getting their

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.820 
takes the sting out of getting their
attention<00:02:35.360> because<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.110> are<00:02:36.230> constantly

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
attention because if you are constantly

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.140 
attention because if you are constantly
shouting<00:02:37.280> at<00:02:37.370> them<00:02:37.489> telling<00:02:37.790> them<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:37.970> look

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
shouting at them telling them to look

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.640 
shouting at them telling them to look
this<00:02:38.330> way<00:02:38.540> listen<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.080> me<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.260> want<00:02:39.560> your

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
this way listen to me I want your

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.729 
this way listen to me I want your
attention<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:41.000> kind<00:02:41.270> of<00:02:41.330> nags<00:02:41.780> them<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.260> get

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
attention it kind of nags them you get

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.260 
attention it kind of nags them you get
them<00:02:42.860> down<00:02:43.040> there<00:02:43.340> get<00:02:43.640> annoying<00:02:43.850> they<00:02:44.150> get

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
them down there get annoying they get

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.690 
them down there get annoying they get
frustrated<00:02:44.420> they<00:02:44.780> get<00:02:44.900> sick<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.110> hearing<00:02:45.319> you

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
frustrated they get sick of hearing you

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.009 
frustrated they get sick of hearing you
so<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.820> noisemaker<00:02:47.239> is<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.690> way<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.900> getting

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
so the noisemaker is a way of getting

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.180 
so the noisemaker is a way of getting
attention<00:02:48.200> without<00:02:48.560> you're<00:02:48.830> constantly

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
attention without you're constantly

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.590 
attention without you're constantly
shouting<00:02:49.340> at<00:02:49.610> them<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.360> can<00:02:50.480> use

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
shouting at them and you can use

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.850 
shouting at them and you can use
different<00:02:50.750> noisemakers<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.560> can<00:02:51.709> use

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
different noisemakers you can use

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.820 
different noisemakers you can use
symbols<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.030> can<00:02:53.180> use<00:02:53.390> shakers<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.709> use

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
symbols you can use shakers you can use

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.340 
symbols you can use shakers you can use
cowbells<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.610> use<00:02:55.760> tambourines<00:02:56.360> any<00:02:56.989> kind<00:02:57.290> of

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
cowbells you use tambourines any kind of

musical instrument or even just clapping
and<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.330> can<00:02:59.540> assign<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.019> different

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
and you can assign a different

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.960 
and you can assign a different
noisemaker<00:03:00.950> for<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.280> different<00:03:01.519> phase<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:01.880> the

noisemakers<00:03:08.120> very<00:03:08.569> effective<00:03:08.959> for<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.140> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
noisemakers very effective for that the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.110 
noisemakers very effective for that the
second<00:03:10.160> one<00:03:10.250> we're<00:03:10.340> going<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.489> look<00:03:10.610> at<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:10.970> a

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
second one we're going to look at is a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.840 
second one we're going to look at is a
routine<00:03:11.690> my<00:03:12.350> routines<00:03:12.830> are<00:03:13.100> incredibly

routine my routines are incredibly

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.759 
routine my routines are incredibly
effective<00:03:14.330> if<00:03:14.510> they're<00:03:14.690> done<00:03:14.870> right<00:03:14.900> if<00:03:15.410> you

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
effective if they're done right if you

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.009 
effective if they're done right if you
teach<00:03:16.130> your<00:03:16.430> routines<00:03:16.910> if<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.300> reinforce

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
teach your routines if you reinforce

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.870 
teach your routines if you reinforce
them<00:03:18.350> if<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.829> embed<00:03:19.220> them<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.579> make<00:03:19.700> them

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
them if you embed them and make them

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.550 
them if you embed them and make them
habitual<00:03:20.540> for<00:03:20.750> your<00:03:20.870> students<00:03:21.350> what<00:03:21.500> you

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
habitual for your students what you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.289 
habitual for your students what you
effectively<00:03:22.040> do<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.579> train<00:03:22.940> them<00:03:23.150> to

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
effectively do is you train them to

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.810 
effectively do is you train them to
respond<00:03:24.019> in<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.320> certain<00:03:24.769> way<00:03:25.010> kind<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.700> like

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
respond in a certain way kind of like

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.850 
you can see what I mean I'll assign the
role<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:33.459> Shusher<00:03:34.630> xuxa<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:36.380> different

members<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.850> group<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.230> their<00:03:39.500> job<00:03:39.799> to

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
members of a group and it's their job to

get the group quiet on my behalf to get
to<00:03:42.799> do<00:03:42.920> my<00:03:43.100> job<00:03:43.130> basically<00:03:43.609> getting<00:03:43.970> their

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
to do my job basically getting their

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.020 
to do my job basically getting their
attention<00:03:44.450> for<00:03:44.570> me<00:03:45.070> so<00:03:46.070> when<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.310> call<00:03:46.579> shushes

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
attention for me so when I call shushes

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.920 
attention for me so when I call shushes
the<00:03:47.840> xuxa's<00:03:48.320> will<00:03:48.680> stand<00:03:48.980> up<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.340> they<00:03:49.459> will

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
the xuxa's will stand up and they will

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.750 
the xuxa's will stand up and they will
shush<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.109> rest<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.500> group<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.430> gentle

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
shush the rest of the group and a gentle

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.759 
shush the rest of the group and a gentle
hush<00:03:53.000> tends<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.750> descend<00:03:54.140> on<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.410> whole<00:03:54.560> group

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
hush tends to descend on the whole group

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.349 
hush tends to descend on the whole group
it's<00:03:55.100> actually<00:03:55.340> surprisingly<00:03:55.820> effective<00:03:56.090> and

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
it's actually surprisingly effective and

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.270 
it's actually surprisingly effective and
the<00:03:56.420> reason<00:03:56.690> why<00:03:56.810> it's<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.049> effective<00:03:57.320> is<00:03:57.709> the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
the reason why it's so effective is the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.180 
the reason why it's so effective is the
people<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.850> assign<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.359> role<00:03:59.600> to<00:03:59.959> tend<00:04:00.859> to<00:04:01.010> be

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
people I assign that role to tend to be

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.699 
people I assign that role to tend to be
the<00:04:01.459> ringleaders<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:02.600> group<00:04:02.870> they<00:04:03.440> tend

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
the ringleaders in the group they tend

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.500 
the ringleaders in the group they tend
to<00:04:03.769> be<00:04:03.920> those<00:04:04.100> strong<00:04:04.519> personalities<00:04:05.299> that

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
to be those strong personalities that

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.060 
to be those strong personalities that
need<00:04:05.810> attention<00:04:06.260> they're<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.680> ones<00:04:06.829> that<00:04:06.920> are

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
need attention they're the ones that are

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.800 
need attention they're the ones that are
generally<00:04:07.850> usually<00:04:08.180> causing<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.690> most

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
generally usually causing you the most

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.880 
generally usually causing you the most
problems<00:04:09.320> they're<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.590> ones<00:04:09.739> that<00:04:09.769> are

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
problems they're the ones that are

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.800 
problems they're the ones that are
always<00:04:10.130> acting<00:04:10.459> up<00:04:10.549> and<00:04:10.700> always<00:04:10.820> arguing<00:04:11.239> the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
always acting up and always arguing the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.610 
always acting up and always arguing the
reason<00:04:12.019> why<00:04:12.079> they're<00:04:12.230> doing<00:04:12.320> that<00:04:12.470> is<00:04:12.560> because

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
reason why they're doing that is because

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.710 
reason why they're doing that is because
they<00:04:12.890> need<00:04:13.160> some<00:04:13.640> form<00:04:13.910> of<00:04:13.970> empowerment<00:04:14.630> they

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
they need some form of empowerment they

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.050 
they need some form of empowerment they
need<00:04:14.900> some<00:04:15.170> form<00:04:15.410> of<00:04:15.470> attention<00:04:16.039> so<00:04:16.729> you<00:04:16.760> give

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
need some form of attention so you give

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.729 
need some form of attention so you give
them<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.359> attention<00:04:17.900> in<00:04:18.049> an<00:04:18.200> appropriate

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
them that attention in an appropriate

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.860 
them that attention in an appropriate
way<00:04:18.769> by<00:04:19.370> giving<00:04:19.519> them<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.820> responsibility<00:04:20.720> and

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
way by giving them a responsibility and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.210 
way by giving them a responsibility and
it's<00:04:20.989> surprising<00:04:21.410> how<00:04:21.500> often<00:04:21.680> they<00:04:21.950> do

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
it's surprising how often they do

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.800 
it's surprising how often they do
respond<00:04:22.669> positively<00:04:22.849> to<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.630> they<00:04:23.690> do

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
respond positively to that and they do

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.990 
respond positively to that and they do
act<00:04:23.990> on<00:04:24.140> your<00:04:24.260> behalf

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
act on your behalf

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000 
act on your behalf
the<00:04:26.000> other<00:04:26.120> reason<00:04:26.360> it's<00:04:26.479> effective

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
the other reason it's effective

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.230 
the other reason it's effective
because<00:04:27.250> obviously<00:04:27.400> with<00:04:27.670> those<00:04:27.820> people<00:04:28.060> be

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
because obviously with those people be

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.970 
because obviously with those people be
in<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.390> ringleaders<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.440> other<00:04:29.620> students

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
in the ringleaders the other students

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.680 
in the ringleaders the other students
naturally<00:04:30.280> tend<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.910> follow<00:04:31.120> them<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.420> do<00:04:31.540> as

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
naturally tend to follow them and do as

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.990 
naturally tend to follow them and do as
they<00:04:31.840> say<00:04:31.870> anyway<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:33.100> routine<00:04:33.430> that<00:04:33.490> routine

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
they say anyway so routine that routine

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.880 
they say anyway so routine that routine
works<00:04:34.240> really<00:04:34.450> really<00:04:34.570> well<00:04:34.780> another<00:04:35.590> routine

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
works really really well another routine

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.190 
works really really well another routine
you<00:04:36.040> might<00:04:36.280> try<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.150> hands<00:04:37.600> up<00:04:37.810> routine

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
you might try is the hands up routine

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.570 
you might try is the hands up routine
and<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:38.470> would<00:04:38.590> explain<00:04:38.920> to<00:04:39.070> your<00:04:39.190> students

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
and you would explain to your students

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.510 
and you would explain to your students
when<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.060> put<00:04:40.360> my<00:04:40.480> hands<00:04:40.900> up<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:42.190> see<00:04:42.460> me

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
putting my hand up that means it's time

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.050 
putting my hand up that means it's time

to have their hand up then there's a

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.890 
to have their hand up then there's a
consequence<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.860> follows<00:05:06.600> and<00:05:07.600> you'll<00:05:07.780> get

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
consequence that follows and you'll get

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.060 
consequence that follows and you'll get
some<00:05:08.080> students<00:05:08.380> who<00:05:08.440> put<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.650> hands<00:05:08.890> up<00:05:09.010> in

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
some students who put the hands up in

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.590 
some students who put the hands up in
the<00:05:09.160> carry<00:05:09.370> on<00:05:09.520> talking<00:05:09.760> well<00:05:10.150> that's<00:05:10.300> doubly

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
the carry on talking well that's doubly

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.850 
the carry on talking well that's doubly
insulting<00:05:11.290> so<00:05:11.410> you're<00:05:11.530> building<00:05:11.650> a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
of the simplest ones is the traffic

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.360 
of the simplest ones is the traffic
lights<00:05:22.420> reminder<00:05:23.260> now<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:23.950> is<00:05:24.040> a<00:05:24.070> small

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
lights reminder now this is a small

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.560 
lights reminder now this is a small
version<00:05:24.730> of<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:24.880> traffic<00:05:25.180> lights<00:05:25.330> what<00:05:25.480> you

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
version of the traffic lights what you

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.880 
version of the traffic lights what you
would<00:05:25.660> have<00:05:25.720> is<00:05:25.840> much<00:05:26.050> bigger<00:05:26.290> cards<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.830> you

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
would have is much bigger cards and you

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.230 
would have is much bigger cards and you
might<00:05:27.040> want<00:05:27.190> to<00:05:27.220> cut<00:05:27.400> them<00:05:27.520> into<00:05:27.610> circle<00:05:28.090> so

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
might want to cut them into circle so

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.610 
might want to cut them into circle so
they<00:05:28.390> do<00:05:28.450> actually<00:05:28.690> look<00:05:29.050> like<00:05:29.080> traffic

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
they do actually look like traffic

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.620 
they do actually look like traffic
lights<00:05:29.850> basically<00:05:30.850> it<00:05:31.090> works<00:05:31.180> like<00:05:31.330> this

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
lights basically it works like this

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.990 
lights basically it works like this
you've<00:05:32.200> got<00:05:32.440> green<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.070> when<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.280> green<00:05:33.550> card

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
you've got green and when the green card

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.460 
you've got green and when the green card
is<00:05:34.180> up<00:05:34.300> on<00:05:34.420> the<00:05:34.540> wall<00:05:34.660> that<00:05:34.960> means<00:05:35.110> noise

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
is up on the wall that means noise

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.230 
is up on the wall that means noise
levels<00:05:35.800> are<00:05:35.890> fine<00:05:36.130> noise<00:05:36.430> levels<00:05:36.730> perfectly

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
levels are fine noise levels perfectly

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.350 
levels are fine noise levels perfectly
acceptable<00:05:37.600> carry<00:05:37.900> on<00:05:38.050> working<00:05:38.170> wonderful<00:05:39.360> if

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
acceptable carry on working wonderful if

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.090 
acceptable carry on working wonderful if
noise<00:05:40.600> levels<00:05:40.900> get<00:05:41.020> too<00:05:41.200> high<00:05:41.440> then<00:05:41.860> you<00:05:41.950> might

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
noise levels get too high then you might

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.260 
noise levels get too high then you might
put<00:05:42.280> a<00:05:42.310> warning<00:05:42.550> on<00:05:42.730> the<00:05:42.850> board<00:05:43.030> and<00:05:43.180> that's

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
put a warning on the board and that's

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.540 
put a warning on the board and that's
your<00:05:43.570> amber<00:05:44.140> traffic<00:05:44.890> light<00:05:45.040> or<00:05:45.070> in<00:05:45.280> this<00:05:45.370> case

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
your amber traffic light or in this case

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.830 
your amber traffic light or in this case
yellow<00:05:45.820> because<00:05:46.030> we<00:05:46.150> have<00:05:46.240> got<00:05:46.390> a<00:05:46.420> number<00:05:46.510> card

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
yellow because we have got a number card

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.990 
yellow because we have got a number card
and<00:05:47.530> when<00:05:47.650> students<00:05:48.040> see<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.280> amber<00:05:48.580> card<00:05:48.820> up

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
and when students see the amber card up

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.820 
and when students see the amber card up
then<00:05:49.180> they<00:05:49.300> know<00:05:49.450> it's<00:05:49.690> time<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:50.080> be<00:05:50.200> be<00:05:50.590> wary

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
then they know it's time to be be wary

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.860 
then they know it's time to be be wary
and<00:05:51.100> start<00:05:51.400> dropping<00:05:52.300> noise<00:05:52.450> levels<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:52.840> bit

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
and start dropping noise levels a bit

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.570 
and start dropping noise levels a bit
but<00:05:53.470> if<00:05:53.560> they<00:05:53.650> carry<00:05:53.920> on<00:05:54.100> if<00:05:54.220> they<00:05:54.310> get<00:05:54.430> too

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
but if they carry on if they get too

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.040 
but if they carry on if they get too
high<00:05:54.760> you<00:05:54.820> explain<00:05:55.330> to<00:05:55.480> them<00:05:55.600> that<00:05:55.780> when<00:05:55.900> the

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
high you explain to them that when the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.500 
high you explain to them that when the
red<00:05:56.260> card<00:05:56.590> is<00:05:56.770> up<00:05:56.920> as<00:05:57.580> soon<00:05:57.850> as<00:05:57.970> that<00:05:58.030> red<00:05:58.240> card

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
red card is up as soon as that red card

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.990 
red card is up as soon as that red card
goes<00:05:58.750> up<00:05:58.960> they<00:05:59.320> have<00:05:59.530> 30<00:05:59.860> seconds<00:06:00.370> to<00:06:00.550> stop

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
goes up they have 30 seconds to stop

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.150 
goes up they have 30 seconds to stop
talking<00:06:01.330> and<00:06:01.690> be<00:06:01.960> looking<00:06:02.230> this<00:06:02.350> way<00:06:02.410> and<00:06:03.100> we

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
talking and be looking this way and we

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.470 
talking and be looking this way and we
stop<00:06:03.370> the<00:06:03.490> activity<00:06:03.910> and<00:06:04.030> we<00:06:04.090> start<00:06:04.360> again

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
stop the activity and we start again

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.780 
stop the activity and we start again
from<00:06:05.140> green<00:06:05.410> once<00:06:05.650> we've<00:06:05.770> got<00:06:05.890> them<00:06:05.980> quiet<00:06:06.280> so

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
from green once we've got them quiet so

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.370 
from green once we've got them quiet so
that's<00:06:06.940> one<00:06:07.150> way<00:06:07.270> of<00:06:07.360> using<00:06:07.510> visual<00:06:07.840> reminders

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
that's one way of using visual reminders

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.120 
that's one way of using visual reminders
and<00:06:08.500> again<00:06:08.710> visual<00:06:09.490> reminders<00:06:09.970> just<00:06:10.000> take<00:06:10.690> a

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
and again visual reminders just take a

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.260 
and again visual reminders just take a
take<00:06:12.130> away<00:06:12.160> your<00:06:12.460> need<00:06:12.700> to<00:06:12.820> be<00:06:12.910> using<00:06:13.090> your

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
take away your need to be using your

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.040 
take away your need to be using your
voice<00:06:13.450> all<00:06:13.720> the<00:06:13.750> time<00:06:14.340> next<00:06:15.340> we've<00:06:15.580> got<00:06:15.610> the

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
voice all the time next we've got the

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.630 
voice all the time next we've got the
unexpected<00:06:17.050> and<00:06:17.290> the<00:06:17.800> unexpected<00:06:18.430> is

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
unexpected and the unexpected is

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.570 
unexpected and the unexpected is
absolutely<00:06:19.390> guaranteed<00:06:20.340> to<00:06:21.340> get<00:06:21.490> the

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
absolutely guaranteed to get the

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.540 
absolutely guaranteed to get the
attention<00:06:21.820> of<00:06:22.210> any<00:06:22.810> group<00:06:23.530> because<00:06:24.280> it<00:06:24.400> works

attention of any group because it works

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.610 
attention of any group because it works
like<00:06:24.790> this<00:06:24.970> your<00:06:25.900> students<00:06:26.290> are<00:06:26.380> used<00:06:26.500> to

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
like this your students are used to

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.170 
like this your students are used to
coming<00:06:26.830> into<00:06:27.010> the<00:06:27.190> room<00:06:27.370> and<00:06:27.610> seeing<00:06:27.940> things
