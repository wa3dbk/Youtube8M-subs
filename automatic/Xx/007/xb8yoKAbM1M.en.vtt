00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
monsters inc and I know Pixar can be hit

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.210 
monsters inc and I know Pixar can be hit
or<00:00:47.839> miss<00:00:47.960> with<00:00:48.230> their<00:00:48.379> sequels<00:00:48.739> but<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.070> is<00:00:49.190> a

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
or miss with their sequels but this is a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.280 
or miss with their sequels but this is a
prequel<00:00:49.670> it's<00:00:49.970> different<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.080> I<00:00:51.110> was

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
prequel it's different and so I was

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.720 
prequel it's different and so I was
really<00:00:51.530> curious<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.890> see<00:00:51.920> what<00:00:52.220> exactly<00:00:52.610> they

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
really curious to see what exactly they

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.380 
really curious to see what exactly they
would<00:00:52.879> do<00:00:52.970> with<00:00:53.120> it

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
would do with it

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.060 
would do with it
and<00:00:53.540> I<00:00:53.660> have<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.900> say<00:00:54.110> I<00:00:54.350> thought<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:54.980> was

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
and I have to say I thought it was

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.220 
and I have to say I thought it was
fantastic<00:00:55.220> now<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.120> have<00:00:56.360> to<00:00:56.510> make<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:56.839> clear

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
fantastic now I have to make this clear

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.380 
fantastic now I have to make this clear
it<00:00:57.379> is<00:00:57.500> definitely<00:00:57.949> not<00:00:58.100> on<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:58.909> scale<00:00:59.360> of

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
it is definitely not on the scale of

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.420 
it is definitely not on the scale of
Monsters<00:00:59.989> Inc<00:01:00.140> or<00:01:00.379> other<00:01:00.619> Pixar<00:01:01.010> movies<00:01:01.280> in

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
Monsters Inc or other Pixar movies in

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.430 
Monsters Inc or other Pixar movies in
general<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:02.000> think<00:01:02.210> for<00:01:02.330> that<00:01:02.360> matter<00:01:02.600> but<00:01:03.170> it

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
general I think for that matter but it

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.950 
general I think for that matter but it
kind<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:03.949> felt<00:01:04.250> smaller<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.299> at<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.810> same

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
kind of felt smaller but at the same

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.050 
kind of felt smaller but at the same
time<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:06.530> didn't<00:01:06.860> feel<00:01:07.040> like<00:01:07.100> less<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.790> felt

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
time it didn't feel like less it felt

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.330 
time it didn't feel like less it felt
very<00:01:08.270> very<00:01:08.869> substantial<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.650> very<00:01:10.040> very

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
very very substantial and very very

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.609 
very very substantial and very very
enjoyable<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.390> was<00:01:11.570> completely<00:01:12.080> into<00:01:12.530> it

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
enjoyable and I was completely into it

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.870 
enjoyable and I was completely into it
the<00:01:12.710> entire<00:01:12.920> time<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.430> definitely<00:01:13.549> doesn't

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
the entire time it definitely doesn't

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.370 
the entire time it definitely doesn't
have<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.180> emotional<00:01:14.659> impact<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:15.229> other

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
have the emotional impact that other

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.719 
have the emotional impact that other
Pixar<00:01:15.710> films<00:01:15.979> have<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:16.400> I<00:01:16.430> think<00:01:16.640> it's

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
Pixar films have and so I think it's

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.760 
Pixar films have and so I think it's
really<00:01:16.880> more<00:01:17.119> for<00:01:17.270> kids<00:01:17.450> but<00:01:18.080> regardless<00:01:18.560> of

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
really more for kids but regardless of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.929 
really more for kids but regardless of
that<00:01:18.799> there<00:01:19.100> were<00:01:19.220> definitely<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.580> few<00:01:19.700> parts

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
that there were definitely a few parts

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.580 
that there were definitely a few parts
where<00:01:20.119> I<00:01:20.150> was<00:01:20.479> wondering<00:01:21.260> what<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.439> hell's

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
where I was wondering what the hell's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.440 
where I was wondering what the hell's
gonna<00:01:21.680> happen<00:01:21.799> next<00:01:22.189> I<00:01:22.400> was<00:01:22.549> surprised<00:01:22.970> I<00:01:23.270> was

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450

the plot and the story and the writing

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.520 
the plot and the story and the writing
which<00:01:35.360> like<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:35.630> said<00:01:35.660> definitely<00:01:36.320> felt

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
which like I said definitely felt

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.530 
which like I said definitely felt
smaller<00:01:36.920> but<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.250> didn't<00:01:37.580> mean<00:01:37.760> it<00:01:38.060> felt

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
smaller but that didn't mean it felt

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.570 
smaller but that didn't mean it felt
like<00:01:38.630> there<00:01:38.780> was<00:01:38.900> less<00:01:39.170> content<00:01:40.100> or<00:01:40.220> less<00:01:40.400> to

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
in it even though like I said it's just

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.990 
in it even though like I said it's just
on<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:54.680> smaller<00:01:54.980> scale<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.460> like<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.700> fact<00:01:55.850> that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
on a smaller scale I like the fact that

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.340 
on a smaller scale I like the fact that
it<00:01:56.060> didn't<00:01:56.270> really<00:01:56.300> use<00:01:56.630> monsters<00:01:57.080> Inc<00:01:57.229> as<00:01:57.320> a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
it didn't really use monsters Inc as a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.540 
it didn't really use monsters Inc as a
crutch<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.800> didn't<00:01:57.979> really<00:01:58.040> tread<00:01:58.430> on

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
crutch and it didn't really tread on

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.160 
crutch and it didn't really tread on
Monsters<00:01:58.970> Inc<00:01:59.120> either<00:01:59.360> in<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.780> sense<00:01:59.990> that

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
Monsters Inc either in the sense that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.230 
Monsters Inc either in the sense that
this<00:02:00.350> story<00:02:00.740> doesn't<00:02:01.430> really<00:02:01.760> affect

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
this story doesn't really affect

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.060 
this story doesn't really affect
Monsters<00:02:02.780> Inc<00:02:02.960> obviously<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.800> know<00:02:03.890> there

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
Monsters Inc obviously you know there

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.290 
Monsters Inc obviously you know there
are<00:02:04.130> characters<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.640> relationships<00:02:04.700> that

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
are characters and relationships that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.690 
are characters and relationships that
develop<00:02:05.420> through<00:02:05.990> into<00:02:06.409> monsters<00:02:06.800> Inc<00:02:06.979> but<00:02:07.490> it

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
develop through into monsters Inc but it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.979 
develop through into monsters Inc but it
felt<00:02:07.970> like<00:02:08.060> its<00:02:08.209> own<00:02:08.330> thing<00:02:08.629> and<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.959> really

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
felt like its own thing and it really

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.719 
felt like its own thing and it really
felt<00:02:09.379> like<00:02:09.649> even<00:02:09.890> if<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.220> didn't<00:02:10.459> know<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
felt like even if you didn't know the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.979 
felt like even if you didn't know the
characters<00:02:11.060> from<00:02:11.120> monsters<00:02:11.480> Inc<00:02:11.659> they<00:02:11.780> felt

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
characters from monsters Inc they felt

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.720 
characters from monsters Inc they felt
very<00:02:12.049> well<00:02:12.379> developed<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.340> character

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
very well developed and the character

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.460 
very well developed and the character
arc<00:02:13.940> was<00:02:14.239> great<00:02:14.450> even<00:02:14.810> though<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.200> said<00:02:15.440> I

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
arc was great even though like I said I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.809 
arc was great even though like I said I
think<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:15.799> is<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> little<00:02:16.069> bit<00:02:16.250> more<00:02:16.400> for<00:02:16.580> kids

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
think this is a little bit more for kids

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.979 
think this is a little bit more for kids
I<00:02:17.090> don't<00:02:17.150> think<00:02:17.269> parents<00:02:17.569> will<00:02:17.720> be<00:02:17.810> let<00:02:17.959> down

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
I don't think parents will be let down

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.300 
I don't think parents will be let down
because<00:02:18.319> there<00:02:18.620> are<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.739> lot<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:18.980> laughs<00:02:19.190> in

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
because there are a lot of laughs in

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.470 
because there are a lot of laughs in
general<00:02:19.640> there's<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.819> lot<00:02:19.879> of<00:02:20.030> heart<00:02:20.239> as<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
general there's a lot of heart as the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.149 
general there's a lot of heart as the
movie<00:02:20.690> progresses<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.799> college

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
movie progresses and the college

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.830 
movie progresses and the college
atmosphere<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.760> frat<00:02:23.030> atmosphere<00:02:23.510> all<00:02:23.690> of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
atmosphere the frat atmosphere all of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.869 
atmosphere the frat atmosphere all of
that<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.170> think<00:02:24.319> was<00:02:24.830> done<00:02:25.010> pretty<00:02:25.220> well<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.700> so

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
that I think was done pretty well and so

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.039 
that I think was done pretty well and so
I<00:02:25.909> think<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.299> anyone<00:02:26.629> that<00:02:26.810> went<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.019> college

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
I think that anyone that went to college

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.199 
I think that anyone that went to college
will<00:02:27.500> appreciate<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.159> and<00:02:28.280> find<00:02:28.940> things<00:02:29.060> to

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
will appreciate that and find things to

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.670 
will appreciate that and find things to
laugh<00:02:29.360> at<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.659> they<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:29.930> relate<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.560> new

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
laugh at that they can relate to the new

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.080 
laugh at that they can relate to the new
characters<00:02:31.129> were<00:02:31.310> all<00:02:31.459> great<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.940> only

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
characters were all great but the only

job with making the characters look
younger<00:03:03.290> because<00:03:03.500> obviously<00:03:03.770> it's<00:03:04.250> many<00:03:04.610> many

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
younger because obviously it's many many

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.280 
younger because obviously it's many many
years<00:03:05.060> prior<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.330> Monsters<00:03:05.840> Inc<00:03:05.990> and<00:03:06.230> it

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
years prior to Monsters Inc and it

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.780 
years prior to Monsters Inc and it
wasn't<00:03:06.470> obvious<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.160> was<00:03:07.250> kind<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.430> subtle

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
wasn't obvious it was kind of subtle

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.000 
wasn't obvious it was kind of subtle
however<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.660> could<00:03:08.959> tell<00:03:09.290> while<00:03:09.590> watching<00:03:09.800> it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
however you could tell while watching it

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.290 
however you could tell while watching it
that<00:03:10.160> they<00:03:10.250> were<00:03:10.310> younger<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:10.850> felt<00:03:11.150> that

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
that they were younger just felt that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.000 
that they were younger just felt that
way<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:12.230> really<00:03:12.260> liked<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.680> fact<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:12.890> it
