take a cardboard box and lay these face
side<00:04:30.319> down<00:04:30.560> on<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.860> cardboard<00:04:31.520> box<00:04:31.729> and

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
side down on the cardboard box and

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.820 
side down on the cardboard box and
they'll<00:04:32.659> dry<00:04:32.870> out<00:04:32.900> even<00:04:33.259> faster<00:04:33.409> that's<00:04:33.710> how

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
genetic diversity check that out

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.929 
genetic diversity check that out
a<00:05:14.050> white<00:05:15.050> seeded<00:05:15.529> sunflower<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.550> black<00:05:16.729> one

a white seeded sunflower and a black one
single<00:05:17.930> head<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.409> think<00:05:19.339> that's<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.610> most

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
single head I think that's the most

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:20.999

important<00:05:20.150> thing<00:05:20.180> it's<00:05:20.389> a<00:05:20.449> single<00:05:20.810> head

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
important thing it's a single head

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.429 
important thing it's a single head
single<00:05:22.009> heads<00:05:22.159> you<00:05:22.249> get<00:05:22.339> bigger<00:05:22.550> heads<00:05:23.439> versus

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
single heads you get bigger heads versus

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.050 
single heads you get bigger heads versus
a<00:05:24.650> bunch<00:05:25.039> of<00:05:25.129> little<00:05:25.279> tiny<00:05:25.550> nothings<00:05:28.060> yeah

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
a bunch of little tiny nothings yeah

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.040 
a bunch of little tiny nothings yeah
birds<00:05:29.930> like<00:05:30.139> making<00:05:30.409> birds<00:05:30.620> can<00:05:30.800> have<00:05:30.979> these

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050
