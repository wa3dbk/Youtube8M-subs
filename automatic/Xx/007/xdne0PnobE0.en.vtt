00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.140 
then I went into incline dumbbell press
inc<00:02:38.030> these<00:02:38.300> are<00:02:40.030> 55<00:02:41.030> s<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.390> think<00:02:42.730> got<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:43.910> for

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
inc these are 55 s I think got this for

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.500 
inc these are 55 s I think got this for
about<00:02:44.330> 16<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.110> think<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.770> then<00:02:46.030> after<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.180> I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
about 16 I think and then after this I

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.650 
about 16 I think and then after this I
did<00:02:47.750> another<00:02:48.380> set<00:02:48.800> for<00:02:49.100> 12<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.760> then<00:02:50.000> my<00:02:50.630> third

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
did another set for 12 and then my third

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:43.190 
did another set for 12 and then my third
set<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.410> 10

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.400

I<00:04:06.550> personally<00:04:07.090> like<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:09.040> had<00:04:09.190> a

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
I personally like it and I had a

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.900 
I personally like it and I had a
45-pound<00:04:10.090> plate<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.980> was<00:04:12.130> banging<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
45-pound plate and I was banging the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.120 
45-pound plate and I was banging the
plate<00:04:13.300> on<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.630> bottom<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.080> floor<00:04:14.260> so

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
plate on the bottom of the floor so

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.229 
plate on the bottom of the floor so
after<00:04:15.460> this<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.940> instead<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.840> 45<00:04:17.290> I<00:04:17.320> took<00:04:18.239> to

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
after this I instead of a 45 I took to

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.370 
after this I instead of a 45 I took to
35<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:20.080> 25<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.830> five<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.400> just<00:04:21.850> my<00:04:22.300> OCD<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:23.350> I

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
35 to 25 and a five I just my OCD so I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.160 
35 to 25 and a five I just my OCD so I
could<00:04:24.030> equal<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.120> out<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.390> hundred<00:04:25.630> i<00:04:25.930> think

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
could equal it out to a hundred i think

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.880

i<00:04:26.230> got<00:04:26.350> like<00:04:27.450> either<00:04:28.450> four<00:04:28.900> or<00:04:28.930> six<00:04:29.410> reps<00:04:29.680> with

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890
