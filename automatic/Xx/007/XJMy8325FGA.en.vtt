00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.580
 well guys I'm matt revolution 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.550
 no one here to comment on this one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 more on the map new town obviously me 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
 I can do the 100 most alone in this one 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.059
 map because as you know I like it 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.660
 more zombies so multiplayer is not 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.580
 that dear so much more winning anyway 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.920
 for me it's practically a thing 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.080
 impossible not done on the look town ne 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.150
 I'm glad it was a group with mine 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.949
 friends 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.070
 so if you want to switch to their channels 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.129
 then I will put them in another description 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.219
 what I wanted to ask you to subscribe to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.430
 my second channel that I did it 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.649
 the other day and is called xv al mat e 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.809
 so guys in that channel maybe there 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.969
 I will upload video I don't know with which 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.100
 frequency will load you log 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.230
 in short, stuff like that in short 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.160
 I do not even know what to charge us are 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.890
 just to have it and I don't know with which 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.530
 frequency I will upload videos because in short 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.850
 we see from time and from what that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.740
 what to load so sign up for xv 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.460
 to the mat that in any case found in 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.899
 description after talking about the game 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.220
 then I was playing with a group of 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:27.740
 four people drink rom 6 2 not 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.390
 recognizes where look town demolition 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.220
 there is another friend of mine who was going to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.830
 do a hundred more but in the end it is not 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.970
 I succeeded for a few occasions instead 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:42.200
 passed well not so much but it is not 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.000
 same as weapons I used the pdv he used 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.250
 the most of him after so long because he has 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.630
 said let's try it I know they had it 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.289
 detuned 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.830
 in fact it is not the same as the point of sale that 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.159
 once upon a time but it was ok anyway 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.909
 always give that one in the end 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.119
 especially also because of many 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.579
 big bullets at 50 so yes 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.469
 manage to kill more enemies without 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.969
 load every three seconds 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.239
 it's not that I always charge every three 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:15.700
 seconds however I used the pdv with 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.410
 quick extraction and quick charger 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.930
 that I advise you to put also 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.350
 because they really become the weapons 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:29.970
 they really become creatures then like 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.650
 rewards I used the counterattack wavi the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.590
 in attack fulminant and the helicopter 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.290
 stealth I always tend to use 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.980
 low rewards because if I use those 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.010
 high then I die later I get that is me 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.960
 incazzo and therefore probably if I used 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.570
 other rewards this game is not there 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.750
 it ended because I was pissed off before or that 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.590
 I'll be able to take them and make a killing 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.520
 even worse if I don't think oh God or 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.620
 that I don't know I left the game because if 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.270
 they kill me when I 'm less 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.360
 an engraving I tend to ad 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.790
 incazzarsi in short abandon the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.400
 consequently not a match 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.590
 I would have finished anyway it seems to me 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.810
 having called two or three helicopters 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.230
 not even many have I made a sacred anymore 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.420
 directly with weapons since I have 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.690
 also took advantage of the sport between 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.300
 to be able to do many illusions 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:33.780
 in fact towards the end you will see type 2 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:38.310
 sixfold in succession the game will end in 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.190
 parity ode to us did not care anyway 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.680
 I think I'm going ahead a little because god 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.780
 von I'm here to comment 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.300
 twenty minutes of game, that is, not over 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.720
 not even fucking tell the class anyway 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:59.580
 in addition to pdv I used in usa or ghost 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.820
 jackal and my unique skill my 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.260
 unique because in short that I often use 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.220
 Phantom is actually not needed 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.950
 a lot though having used the class so not 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.800
 I didn't have time to change them then 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.760
 our this then uses the c4 a lot 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.900
 that flash is powerful and special grenade 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.780
 bang i guess it's not that it didn't help much 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:28.250
 however guys nothing the game is 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.470
 this I didn't play much at 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.690
 multiplayer played this I made a 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.630
 nod view though if you like it if 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.330
 like these games i will try the most 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.480
 often to do them even if it is not 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.220
 a hundred more maybe 50 more when 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.480
 did more well on some map on 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.000
 some other map and then I will bring them 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.950
 even those if you don't mind 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.460
 and oh well now we are waiting for the 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.200
 buy and bari map and so I think of 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.900
 make you from many videos on that map 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.990
 so the multiplayer maybe I'll show 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.270
 only the 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.280
 the new maps, among others, the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.280
 review of summit not me 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.530
 would hate to play it since it is 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.020
 one of the maps that I liked about 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.020
 more even than black ops 1 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.830
 so guys now I'll go to the 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.510
 end 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.670

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.940

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.740

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.629
 unearthed charge launched 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.490

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.529
 and unarmed charges 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.450
 the start waiting for orders 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.590
 the allied stealth helicopter on the way 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:07:04.270

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:05.800

 a life bomb defused 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.600
 a hand 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.560
