00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
wallet in the EPI but like I said

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.400

because this one has tons and tons of
space<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.870> that's<00:03:09.870> why<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> made<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> decision

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
space and that's why I made a decision

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.650
