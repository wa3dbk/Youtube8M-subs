00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.269
 hello very good a few at all how are you 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.750
 how are you coming back in a new world 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:14.290
 a new world the third in particular of 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.650
 plants vs zombies we will start the first 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.949
 level I do not know if we will continue at night 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.640
 of the second world so let's see 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.859
 who awaits us what new plants we 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.720
 will give what new zombies will attack us 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.779
 so we started 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.540
 ok we see the pool appears from there 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.870
 it seems that the zombies desist from 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.960
 attack you from the front they go to 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.890
 back garden and above you can not use 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.480
 the mushrooms to call the matter because 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.079
 they sleep 10 days 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.309
 It is worth it is worth many plants not the 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:58.390
 we can use is not wonderful 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.269
 no no it's wonderful i 'm going to see you see 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.580
 What are some children? 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.650
 new with a float and we can only 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.630
 we have to use the new plant that 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.850
 it allows us to plant on it if not 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.330
 I remember badly over 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:21.330
 of the water and we will be and the daddy peas 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 Noel 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.700
 this strawberry 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.469
 the sunflower if not bad we go 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.899
 the repeater and throws peas team 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.539
 the complete in the team that what 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.399
 we can use this at the end in the 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.189
 carnivorous plant that does not finish me 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.140
 convince me and let's start 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.870
 plant the sunflowers at the bottom of the whole 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 they start producing it does not happen like the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.200
 solar mushrooms that could they were going 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.810
 growing up and costing us less these 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.990
 producing always equal cost 50 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.119
 suns and llos come soon will come 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.630
 are already already well the first one in fact 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.720
 the first one comes, let's launch 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.190
 payment with which has time to activate 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.370
 there we have it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.850
 We also raised above the water and 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.890
 we planted the leaf above the water yet 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.340
 I do not remember the name so forgive me 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.450
 for this I am green in the name of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.450
 this new plant 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.830
 come perfect there comes the first 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.440
 will come another let's plant the sunflower 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.510
 Well the next is greatest 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.600
 garden I do not think so but that is more 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.120
 big 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.120
 u and two plates come one less fast the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.940
 puma dad and who are activated we have the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.700
 enough enough maybe suns of 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.730
 leftovers from leftovers more than from 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.860
 leftovers we are going to plant and the instant as 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.489
 I put all goes well above 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.159
 the other by chance let's go let's go 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:09.390
 let's go small I'll give you a plate bk 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:12.310
 courtyards from around there come another and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.550
 there are moments here 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.780
 that is making them go slower 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.950
 there we have them come on let's go let's go 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.630
 the easy easy moment this first 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.760
 level of the third world we are 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.650
 getting used to the mechanics come from 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.910
 the bright ones have to be already starts to 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.810
 be harder others 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.360
 come on let's go small let's go I do not know if 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.190
 will come more zombies if they will come for the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:46.260
 water but we will plant just in case 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.019
 maybe on the float key float 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.290
 and I put in case if it does not come look 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.290
 there we have spent is what we are going 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.560
 in the covered area voucher we are coming for 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.349
 up comes over the som ikhana 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.720
 how are we going to plant more than the peas 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.850
 fast from your friend 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.530
 in the middle in the middle I want want 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.290
 be warned I do not want to get caught 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.320
 by surprise if they come around for something 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.590
 will be the pool for something they will put 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.490
 little leaves, so if not, do not 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.800
 I understand let's come, we have it 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.080
 It's worth it now, just fine, it's already my 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:34.409
 faces as care has been taken 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.659
 well covered area let's go now we'll put 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:41.409
 repeaters are very expensive we can launch 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:43.180
 and sanders is going to be counting because the 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.259
 celestial goal we leave it there marginalized 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.120
 in case 30,000 zombies look at us at once 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.909
 come bring small allow 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.370
 implement milestones we are indeed 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:56.370
 arriving at the end of the wave 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.620
 just a wave to me I like me 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.590
 be the long levels there are very many 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.410
 waves we are going to put here be careful 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.600
 that comes down below also zombie face 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.960
 with water for now easy situation 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.040

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.690
 I know how many places have given us their own 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.270
