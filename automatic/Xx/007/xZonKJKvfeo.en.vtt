00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.400
 how to upgrade to version 4.2 on 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.740

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.650
 open odin and press the reset button 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:26.470
 then we put in the box pda the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.900
 file that we download now we turn on 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.240
 the phone in download mode for 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.820
 we press the volume button below 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.010
 home and the ignition at the same time 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.160
 until you exit this screen then 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.380
 we give volume up to continue 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.750
 already having the order ready we connect the 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.750
 phone to the pc with the usb cable 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.399

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.399
 we indicate in the box com 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.340
 well now the only thing that needs to be done 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.410
 is to press the start button so that 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.560

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.180
 abstain steps will have no problem 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.190

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.190
 load the current positive files 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.930

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.930

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.770

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.770
