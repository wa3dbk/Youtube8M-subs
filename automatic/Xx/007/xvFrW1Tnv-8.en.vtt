00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Today I'm going to teach a fast way. 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.330
 easy and very cheap way to make your 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.400
 own piggy bank and more 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.740
 This little body can be broken after 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.740
 for you to rescue your economy 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.539
 I said it was very cheap so you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.150
 will spend more or less three reais to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.220
 make your body will need water and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.900
 practically for free and a bit of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.060
 toilet paper that will steal your 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.309
 bathroom of a bladder left over from 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.250
 some opponent and a pack of 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.320
 plaster this one I paid two thousand reais 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.450
 on me cents 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.340
 Ideally, Jesus is like that here. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.899
 for fast plaster 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.579
 The first thing I'll do is fill 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.980
 a little bit the bixiga leaving a little 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.020
 more than one orange 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 [Music] 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.379
 I'll cover the bladder with a little 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.300
 of toilet paper 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.010
 so I'll prepare the plaster place 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.989
 four tablespoons of plaster and I'm putting 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.789
 a small amount of water to form a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.550
 folder with this consistency that is 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.619
 There, I 'm going through this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.860
 paste around the toilet paper 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.540
 making a layer of plaster not be afraid 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.640
 to make a layer a little more 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.560
 half the bladder now needs to wait 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.720
 it is necessary to harden to turn 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 bladder and do the other half do not 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 I need to be very worried because 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.479
 this is the fast plaster so it goes 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 hard for about 15 minutes in the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.740
 total will take about three 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:34.619
 whole layers of plaster and country 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:36.540
 little pending I have already put the last 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 layer she's hardening so now 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.110
 I'm going to look at my finger and come here. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.840
 above to keep the record well 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.329
 neighbor out about half an hour 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.250
 I already have here practically a new one of 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.409
 Jesus and to make this a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.600
 little you need to use a little 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.850
 more plaster and an ability to 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:08.239
 sculptor 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:08.239
 [Music] 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.480
 Our little one was born now. 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.160
 people make a rip to 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.780
 put the money gives to make some tea 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.330
 with anything I'll use one 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.040
 you feel that the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.360
 bladder burst if you will not 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.550
 put an order later 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.820
 [Music] 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.710
 the last step is to decorate a little bit myself 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.450
 I will use the gouache to paint and I will use 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.700
 a little bit of paper pen 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.700
 Let's do a little style though. 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.939
 [Music] 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.110
 this one is our cuddly and evil 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:11.580
 plaster pig 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:11.580
 [Music] 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.620
 Hmm 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.170
 [Music] 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.560
 good before we do the terrible 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.910
 draw our terrible withdrawal from 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.450
 piggy's money 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.380
 let's understand a little detail 1 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.270
 x 1 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.500
 if you're going to do your homework at home 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.750
 you will realize that Jesus has a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.240
 consistency it begins to 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.190
 harden very fast much faster 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.930
 than if you had stirred with clay 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.900
 and it's no good if you put more 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.020
 water and will harden anyway 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.990
 this is because the plaster it is called sulfate 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.290
 of calcium sulphate this is the picture here 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.360
 calcium is cea and calcium sulfate 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.390
 when he is in shape like this 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.520
 gypsum he has the equivalent of 6 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.550
 molecule of water next to it 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.800
 calcium sulphate m hydrated in me 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.550
 it means, therefore, who calls the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.350
 half of hemisphere land but when 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.840
 We put water on your wetsuit. 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.690
 calcium in hydrate it starts to 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.720
 absorb water and form another structure. 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.190
 Calcium sulphate of hydrate ie 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.700
 for each molecule of calcium sulphate 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.130
 there are two of water and this starts the 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.990
 form a network of very 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.600
 And that's what makes the plaster 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.970
 getting hard then it's getting absorbed 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.410
 water and getting much more for future 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.280
 This is no use if you put more 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.140
 Water 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.320
 You can not stop this. 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.320
 hydration 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.190
 prepares it is now time 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:05.139
 [Music] 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.069
 But this starts here you find in the 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.069
 world manual 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.920
 [Music] 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.930
 Good if you liked the piggy do not 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.270
 forget to joke in the video here 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.670
 rumor has taken a lot of work to do this 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.860
 little but very cool me neither 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.890
 even when it comes to admitting a 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.080
 working head if you 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.430
 Do you like these videos with coins said 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.070
 nothing here I'm leaving the video of 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.500
 bridge of coins is a very crazy bridge 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.770
 built with 10 cent coins 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.170
 the bridge as the whole inside the 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.830
 port all human I know to do the 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.980
 bridge 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.380
 there is a timely time on this side here I 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.230
 I will leave a challenge that I made that is 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.940
 how to balance several currencies one in 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.250
 top of the other you can go to 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.720
 four hours 15 to another as challenge is 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:13.319
 very cool 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:13.319
