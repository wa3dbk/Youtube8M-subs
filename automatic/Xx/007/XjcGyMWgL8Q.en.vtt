00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 jo people I sign up here again 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.410
 a new episode of the betty news 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.970
 back and of course the gym is today 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.939
 again, and he has it all 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 exciting info about battlefield 4 here 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.090
 there should be more dlcs and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.580
 you can act with it, he says totally 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.170
 exciting so maybe then it has 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.030
 So noticed was the last weeks 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.469
 It's hot with the speculation 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.420
 All rumors and everything I have now 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.399
 so around the life after final stood in 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.410
 Battlefield 4 has shot and what you guys 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.270
 say last night it was finally 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.340
 So far in the battlelog stood a new one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.170
 Contribute the trick to the beautiful 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.379
 title of the way to the future of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.850
 Battlefield 4 and I know I believe 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.500
 we got a little bit more 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.510
 Introduced below you realize I am 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.219
 a little bit disappointed by 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.420
 will the content of article link 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.359
 probably in the video description 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.129
 find my art below the videos 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.739
 that's about as much as it does 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 after finals, then something else will come 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.060
 promise you there as fast as possible 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.740
 to clarify it but we can still 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 do not say exactly what is coming now and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.909
 how much and not when but it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.869
 Something else is coming and then it is still 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.210
 a survey with it 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.650
 Do you just want to wear this around here ? 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.420
 best ok 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.640
 the survey is the best and you can 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.020
 you vote what you want to have that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.189
 If you have an old map 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.380
 wanted something battlefield 2 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.540
 Battlefield 3 actually out of all betty 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.729
 divide four then you can tell which 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.799
 maps you would like to have and her 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.210
 so can force and act with it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.189
 that's not so bad that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.619
 offer of dice I would say that 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.850
 agrees with one or two maps in the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.310
 lists are listed already exist 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.259
 in battlefield 4 in the sector 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.689
 So if I have gold for forms I should 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.610
 example, and I have now 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.079
 in the live stream from now on probably yesterday 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.700
 even now with this sometimes life yes 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.759
 just live in my stream on this 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 beautiful recording here we have 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.190
 I said I have only now 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.930
 the cards 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.100
 I also picked out or clicked 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 really know because I have a few 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.580
 balls do not play and for that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.380
 not a little stupid things like that 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.790
 I can take the battlefield 42 there 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.560
 really do not remember all the cards 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.880
 quite honestly makes no 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.720
 sense 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.490
 Overall, however, I find these 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.640
 Quite cool I just had it with it 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.200
 calculated that specifically now at the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.550
 first part of the now hopefully then 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.170
 Coming out soon, I guess, yes 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.420
 personally then at the beginning of the year 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.830
 january / february sometime i would have 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.510
 thought that for the cards already 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.710
 be firm because the will and shall 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.320
 Therefore already know what had asked 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.090
 So it was probably so that david earl and 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.880
 probably already knows more logically 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.860
 finally worked out at dice but he 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.020
 also hoped he receives more today 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.160
 but he was not allowed to announce 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.940
 that's probably what his bosses have 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.530
 then decided 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.870
 that may not be so frank yet 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.670
 be announced and therefore I think so 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.740
 there is already more than we now 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.920
 already backyard know the absolutely right 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.760
 ok so the big one 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.470
 Announced bang is now unfortunately 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.310
 this place failed and you can 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.140
 Now just hope that it 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.640
 continues as fast as possible and that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.680
 We will not be back for another month 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.090
 or two months because so to speak at the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.850
 short leashes are held but me 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.370
 I think there will be something but we 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.170
 have a few news from the zte 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.730
 or the us tour selected 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.739
 and a thing of it I find 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.270
 personally super horny nothing with it 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.400
 I'll start telling you something 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.500
 there will be in the ce now and that 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.340
 will be at my official car balancer 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.380
 worked 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.570
 at the moment there are plug ins for the pc 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.800
 with which the whole is realizable but 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.230
 this is probably going to happen now, too 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.050
 official side is supported think 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.670
 I do not have bad then everybody 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.140
 Combat helicopter the revised flight 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.489
 get physics have the one yes 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.590
 bit changed for the Chinese 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.750
 heli, now that's for everyone else 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.209
 helios available in the cd and comes 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.760
 then soon in the main game then 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.709
 is there a new jet flight physics and 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.470
 Although that is not the case now 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.180
 More of these 301 knots must hold around the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.370
 to cultivate a perfect circle 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.200
 no, this time it is now that one ever 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.360
 the faster you get, the bigger you get 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.370
 the radius of the circle you fly 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.739
 and that honestly changes bottom 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.360
 jet pilot everything and change the whole 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.200
 there far and from that I'm the real one 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.250
 a little tense 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.140
 and I'm a bit too 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.940
 critical of what that is because I found 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.840
 that was quite good now that was since 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.670
 Battlefield 3 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.169
 in my opinion, now and now 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.850
 I can change that again 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.579
 a bit hard but okay 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.410
 we'll just wait and see if we can 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.340
 the hit brand now individually 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.930
 to adjust 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.760
 that means you can see the sizes and the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.190
 change colors and you can even own 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.960
 hit marker at hedge or deadly 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.370
 Adjusting how to turn it off 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.600
 hotline for example knows that is one 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.520
 make hatchet and then you get 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.979
 red hit marca if you want that 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.570
 or you stop in kiel and get 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.010
 a blue one can be so adjusted 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.930
 As you like you can feel the color 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.880
 choose the size of everything 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.200
 I like that very much, especially one 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.060
 does not always look down on the 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 Kilfitt and you shoot then maybe 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.729
 a little longer on the opponent 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.650
 as is actually necessary if you are 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.210
 Now then stop has a mark and 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.400
 I killed the enemy, it's one 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.020
 colored hit market then you see that 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.950
 In any case, that much faster 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.900
 I like it very much 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.880
 then you can also see the sizes and 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.139
 Experienced and the colors of the red dots 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.180
 adjust now or 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.710
 that is yet to come and there you can 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.330
 then really choose if you really want to 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.100
 wants to have a red dot or one 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.800
 green dot or a yellow dot or in 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.500
 purple dot or maybe everything exactly 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.720
 exactly and last it will be 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.880
 of course, continue to be a cd for the 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.800
 Consoles worked when that comes now 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.360
 if that comes now that is still one 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.430
 bit in the stars david earl and 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.289
 he said it is a paper war 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.500
 as you can not imagine him 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:35.400
 he even has to meet on this 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.440
 in cologne said that in principle with the 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.800
 work is done but that 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.650
 specifically the contractors so speak 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.330
 Sony and Microsoft are amazing 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.280
 paper still want to have done 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.099
 before you give it to the users 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.030
 So that's in principle now in the 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.669
 principle not to dice 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.349
 or electronic arts the 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.639
 especially interesting point now 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.110
 not the airplane that's for sure 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.729
 One thing you have to wait for 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.900
 as it really comes complete with 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.760
 But in it is especially the fitmacher 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.680
 personally I find the most interesting 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.300
 when I first saw it 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.070
 already had the first videos to do so 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.539
 I said the ece, yes I need 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.610
 not really but if you like that 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.750
 think about it if you think so 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.550
 set that for example 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.560
 displayed when you get one 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.940
 deadly occurred with a color because one 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.900
 one headshot ends up in another 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.470
 color does not always have to be deadly 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.599
 his 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.740
 and if you are normal then 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.320
 So it's true that it speaks 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.760
 then purposefully 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.050
 different from then would have 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.410
 you actually if you take it 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.210
 thoughtfully get notified in 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.500
 which moment you how much now 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.760
 impact on the opponent really 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.110
 has distributed so that a bit 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.370
 more feedback from the server lingering below 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.600
 the stalls gets so I think so 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.460
 the most exciting point will be there 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.330
 I think that too I like everyone 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.890
 very good, too 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.990
 and otherwise, of course, I'm looking forward to it 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.820
 on the coming content even if we 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.410
 do not know what it is so right 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.970
 diligently from her you may also like 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.680
 my comments are what you write for 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.810
 you want to have maps again you only write 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.280
 so 23 cleans a whole list 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.990
 and then I always think I mean 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.610
 nice overview fight what do you have 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.140
 because besides I voted earlier 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.760
 tuned for so many things but on 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.400
 Most I would really like about that 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.020
 cards from the monastery dlc specially ciba 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.720
 tower and of course the user channels 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.250
 card standard of the tdm that are so mine 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.350
 Real all time favorites all 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.540
 other cards talk about there 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.830
 It certainly enough people there who 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.780
 So decide for something 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.850
 my recommendation clearly deeper mourning 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.020
 and team deathmatch of moher canals and 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.080
 neuchâtel it's such an extensive one 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.730
 card because you can use every mode on it 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.500
 ok yes then i would say today 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.030
 again by next week, it is 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.280
 Jim, maybe there will be 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.450
 new information about the new maps too 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.800
 if I do not believe it will 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.390
 probably take a while now 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.830
 In any case, look at him by the 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.080
 left is in the description of the link 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.300
 to the blog is in the description where you 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.680
 vote and that's it 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.450
 of course, the gym gets the last word 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.430
 My name is more quest and I am 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.840
 now out 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.160
 my name is khan and so was actually 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.180
 I at the end of videos only some 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.770
 mischief to no one interested 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.120
 That's why I should thank you at this point 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.290
 for watching and see you next 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.070
 week on a canal again pure skin 

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.070
 until then georgiers
