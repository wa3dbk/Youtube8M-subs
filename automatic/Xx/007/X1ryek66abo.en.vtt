00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
if it's two achit it's not itchy yet but

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.580 
if it's two achit it's not itchy yet but
it's<00:04:51.390> it's<00:04:51.600> really<00:04:51.720> painful<00:04:51.930> my<00:04:52.230> back<00:04:52.410> is

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
really stiff and it's usually located

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.900 
really stiff and it's usually located
near<00:04:55.320> your<00:04:55.500> spine<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.040> then<00:04:56.160> makes<00:04:56.580> its<00:04:56.760> way

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
near your spine and then makes its way

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.450 
near your spine and then makes its way
on<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.930> left<00:04:57.960> or<00:04:58.230> right<00:04:58.260> side<00:04:58.560> on<00:04:58.800> me<00:04:59.190> it's<00:04:59.340> the

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
on the left or right side on me it's the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
on the left or right side on me it's the
right<00:04:59.610> side<00:04:59.790> right<00:04:59.910> now<00:05:00.090> because<00:05:00.330> that's

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
right side right now because that's

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.480 
right side right now because that's
where<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.720> nerve<00:05:00.870> damages<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.560> shingles<00:05:02.340> it

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
where the nerve damages and shingles it

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.430 
where the nerve damages and shingles it
affects<00:05:02.760> your<00:05:02.910> nerves<00:05:03.180> apparently<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.050> it

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
affects your nerves apparently and it

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.780 
affects your nerves apparently and it
damaged<00:05:04.770> your<00:05:04.890> nerves<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.400> can<00:05:05.550> have

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
damaged your nerves and it can have

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.960 
damaged your nerves and it can have
long-term<00:05:06.180> effects<00:05:06.900> but<00:05:07.380> since<00:05:07.710> I'm<00:05:08.700> younger

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
long-term effects but since I'm younger

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.670 
long-term effects but since I'm younger
I'm<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.210> little<00:05:09.420> luck<00:05:09.570> here<00:05:09.600> because<00:05:10.230> if<00:05:10.410> you're

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
I'm a little luck here because if you're

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.200 
I'm a little luck here because if you're
older<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.160> takes<00:05:11.370> longer<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:11.670> your<00:05:11.910> nerves<00:05:12.030> to

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
older it takes longer for your nerves to

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.430 
older it takes longer for your nerves to
heal<00:05:12.390> so<00:05:12.600> I'm<00:05:12.660> really<00:05:12.840> hoping<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.290> doesn't

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
heal so I'm really hoping it doesn't

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.470 
heal so I'm really hoping it doesn't
have<00:05:13.590> any<00:05:13.740> long-term<00:05:13.980> effects<00:05:14.430> because<00:05:15.120> this

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
have any long-term effects because this

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.900 
have any long-term effects because this
pain<00:05:16.169> on<00:05:16.440> my<00:05:16.560> arm<00:05:16.740> it's<00:05:17.010> actually<00:05:17.250> not<00:05:17.550> paying

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
pain on my arm it's actually not paying

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.909 
pain on my arm it's actually not paying
it's<00:05:18.210> actually<00:05:18.630> my<00:05:18.780> nerves<00:05:19.020> tricking<00:05:19.560> my<00:05:19.710> arm

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
it's actually my nerves tricking my arm

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:20.490 
it's actually my nerves tricking my arm
into<00:05:20.160> think

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
into think

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.440 
into think
it's<00:05:20.650> pain<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.130> people<00:05:21.820> are<00:05:21.910> saying<00:05:22.120> shingles

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
it's pain and people are saying shingles

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.210 
it's pain and people are saying shingles
is<00:05:22.600> lethal<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.110> all<00:05:23.350> this<00:05:23.560> because<00:05:23.740> of<00:05:24.070> the

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
is lethal and all this because of the

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.070 
is lethal and all this because of the
damage<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.640> nerves<00:05:24.910> honestly<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.690> case<00:05:25.870> i

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
damage to nerves honestly the case i

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.600 
catch it that early i like literally
four<00:05:32.110> days<00:05:32.320> three<00:05:32.620> days<00:05:32.710> in<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.250> notice<00:05:33.520> the

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
four days three days in I notice the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.710 
four days three days in I notice the
spots<00:05:33.820> and<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.060> instead<00:05:34.390> I<00:05:34.420> went<00:05:34.510> to<00:05:34.630> the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
spots and I instead I went to the

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.450 
spots and I instead I went to the
doctors<00:05:34.990> as<00:05:35.140> soon<00:05:35.350> as<00:05:35.560> we<00:05:35.860> found<00:05:36.010> out<00:05:36.160> it<00:05:36.340> was

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
doctors as soon as we found out it was

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.670 
doctors as soon as we found out it was
what<00:05:37.120> we<00:05:37.270> thought<00:05:37.480> it<00:05:37.630> was<00:05:37.720> shingles<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.260> had

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
what we thought it was shingles and had

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.870 
what we thought it was shingles and had
a<00:05:38.710> hunch<00:05:38.950> I<00:05:39.190> should<00:05:39.460> have<00:05:39.550> gone<00:05:39.640> to<00:05:39.700> the

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
a hunch I should have gone to the

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.430 
a hunch I should have gone to the
doctors<00:05:40.150> right<00:05:40.270> away<00:05:40.480> because<00:05:40.660> it<00:05:40.930> probably

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
doctors right away because it probably

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.020 
doctors right away because it probably
won't<00:05:41.710> even<00:05:41.800> gotten<00:05:42.070> spots<00:05:42.340> I<00:05:42.550> probably

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
won't even gotten spots I probably

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.940 
won't even gotten spots I probably
wouldn't<00:05:43.390> be<00:05:43.960> in<00:05:44.080> this<00:05:44.200> much<00:05:44.380> pain<00:05:44.410> because<00:05:44.860> I

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
wouldn't be in this much pain because I

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.530 
wouldn't be in this much pain because I
have<00:05:45.040> these<00:05:45.190> meds<00:05:45.430> that<00:05:45.670> have<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.090> take<00:05:46.270> three

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
have these meds that have to take three

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.450 
have these meds that have to take three
times<00:05:46.750> a<00:05:46.870> day<00:05:46.900> these<00:05:47.200> pills<00:05:47.500> got<00:05:48.100> take<00:05:48.250> it<00:05:48.370> for

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
times a day these pills got take it for

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.610 
times a day these pills got take it for
about<00:05:48.550> a<00:05:48.670> week<00:05:48.850> so<00:05:49.300> at<00:05:49.360> least<00:05:49.480> I<00:05:49.720> know<00:05:49.780> now<00:05:49.960> what

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
about a week so at least I know now what

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.440 
about a week so at least I know now what
the<00:05:50.770> hell<00:05:50.920> is<00:05:51.040> going<00:05:51.220> on<00:05:51.280> with<00:05:51.430> my<00:05:51.580> arm<00:05:51.760> and<00:05:52.240> I'm

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
the hell is going on with my arm and I'm

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.430 
the hell is going on with my arm and I'm
really<00:05:52.690> hoping<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:53.020> doesn't<00:05:53.140> last<00:05:53.320> long

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
really hoping it doesn't last long

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.200 
really hoping it doesn't last long
