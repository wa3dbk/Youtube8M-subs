there with for the SATA and power cables
that<00:01:26.310> connection<00:01:27.090> needs<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:27.750> line

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that connection needs to actually line

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.109 
that connection needs to actually line
up<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.770> vent<00:01:29.100> holes<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.700> that's<00:01:29.909> where

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
up with the vent holes so that's where

you that's how you know what side goes

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.999 
you that's how you know what side goes
on<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.600> let's<00:01:33.900> get<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> hard<00:01:34.920> drive

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
on which so let's get the hard drive

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.980 
on which so let's get the hard drive
mounted<00:01:40.820> alright<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.689> you're<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.930> to
