00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 of youtube had now shown him the 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.270
 furious castle the spanish version 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.280
 of the castle class at least to see 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.910
 a first visualization of what is 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.500
 at stake and something about the heroes 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.780
 the types of heroes classes there are 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.380
 medical we're going to start with that as 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.810
 you will see here 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 figure in green the ordinary heroes in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.990
 blue the happy heroes this is one of the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.110
 last aggregates of ojén tritón and the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.980
 heroes legends that has been added 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.980
 in the last week what would be the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
 Atlantic 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.179
 he is sovereign here 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.769
 but that kind of stars here and in a 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.559
 deferred star in this cold of 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.530
 shining implies that you get every 20 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.430
 levels have the possibility of the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.229
 improvement 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.300
 this is to raise the range and that 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.059
 You can keep raising the level like this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.649
 appear up to 180 as indicated by 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.379
 new stars that can reach 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.110
 be used and is what appears in the 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.140
 last dungeon at least other children 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.729
 him 180 euros listed there we're going to 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.460
 show them at least one of the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.470
 dungeons achievement more difficult but something 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.850
 pretty simple in which you can 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.170
 get to follow 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.170
 and some heroes 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.020
 also in the other version of the game and 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.159
 we calculate that this is also 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.850
 the lightning that works a little better 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.580
 can 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.110
 harm other heroes and enough to 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.360
 ahead in this case the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.350
 pretty easy training this 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.350
 way not always from the beginning 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.570
 because he kill himself is not something 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.720
 to carry out a premeditated action by 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:06.940
 the player but you have to refrain from 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:10.789
 that the game is provided by the user 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.870
 now they see how I was seeing the damage that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.120
 generate the ray is only level 3 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.069
 this is missing the improvement improvement pretty 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.049
 broad 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.389
 with which in a little I calculate that 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.019
 it's going to be problem it's pretty 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:30.829
 simple the game itself has new 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.840
 things to entertain yourself is not something that 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.969
 can not be easily bored 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.730
 It has a much better system of heroes 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.950
 in other cases I can not deny that with 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.030
 the four games as you will have seen in 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.870
 the start of the screen which were 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.870
 very similar 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:56.130
 beaches plans we are going to protect the hero 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.820
 many in this case but you will have to 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.950
 attack then some other user 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.319
 basically 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:09.230
 is a single in this gift to see from 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:13.629
 get what would be a little more than 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.629
 levels and experience in this case 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:22.790
 I think it 's pretty good 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.470
 in some aspects but apparently yes and 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.670
 encompassed what is the whole dungeon to a 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.220
 Price a little high for simply 540 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.560
 of experience and as you see below 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.410
 which is the objective of the experience that 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.220
 take the little what you earn find 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.390
 what are the dungeons is quite 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.230
 poor 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.430
 that amount of hours we are going to show 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.430
 which would 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:01.670
 a bit of the sand plus at least 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.860
 highlighted lately but 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.130
 let's hope it continues like this 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.300
 let's see to use the advantage that would be 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.300
 the its course 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.120
 I'm going to show it, I have it but it's with the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.940
 high movement speed 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.019
 in this case the preparation for that 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.019
 It also has a 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.070
 a figure unasur unfortunately not 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.070
 I had an eye but they had to 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.570
 some can be a champion according to milk 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.440
 I'm visualizing there's a catch 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.600
 so much is still narrowly won in 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.940
 this case but there is an advantage that they are 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.930
 they had all the other users in this 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.410
 basically, I am new 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.210
 and I have low levels it's not because 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.720
 be new but for lack of time that 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.120
 in this case, the time of 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.930
 experience in the game due to the fact 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.320
 that will not be here to see 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.650
 the maximum of five games in the 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.400
 dungeons every 20 minutes it recharges and 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.490
 in this heart as you will see is with 30 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.710
 minutes to be able to acquire 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.169
 a new chance to play in the sand 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.300
 therefore it is quite advantage in 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.909
 some users which 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.810
 not the use of excuses but justly 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.810
 for all 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.260
 just an arena with three levels 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.260
 much higher now good that's 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.730
 basically the prohibited as you will see 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.360
 informants who had movements of 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.419
 speed 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:02.159
 here in this case it's pretty good at 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:05.639
 the 4 of 58 80% of energy this one also 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.830
 has to weaken a bad translation to 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.259
 another name here we also have 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.659
 weaken better range in this case 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.159
 we also have rehabilitate and departures 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.620
 for the energy with what you start 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.349
 it serves in a game and unfortunately 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.249
 in starts in the skiff or revived 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.969
 but they serve nothing 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.459
 in this case 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.639
 revive if it serves because this united 

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:31.229
 quite another plus with revive 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:37.259
 basically I do not have one in this case in 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:40.589
 an assassin with this style runs 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:42.980
 really fast here we have another 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:48.290
 more contractive 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:50.960
 at level 2 high weaken and here the 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.300
 level 3 of strokes weighs very well this is 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.640
 basically what they wanted to go 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.350
 showing the game I'm going to continue 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.300
 uploading videos I hope you have 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.150
 liked if you want to know something about the 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.040
 game simply send a message 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.110
 write here in the same video then 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.360
 any question I will be 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.190
 responding with another video or in the 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.910
 same answers that I can get to 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:17.500
 abide by the respect that we have 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.500
 thanks for the video goodbye
