gun that I'm not completely used to this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.819 
gun that I'm not completely used to this
was<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> first<00:00:52.289> games<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.710> was

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
was one of the first games as I was

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
was one of the first games as I was
using<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> scorpion<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.180> hadn't<00:00:54.480> really

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
using the scorpion and I hadn't really

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.260 
using the scorpion and I hadn't really
used<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> previous<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.760> knew<00:00:57.090> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
used it previous to this so I knew that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.819 
used it previous to this so I knew that
the<00:00:57.360> scorpion<00:00:57.780> had<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> recoil<00:00:58.559> I

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the scorpion had a lot of recoil I

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
the scorpion had a lot of recoil I
wasn't<00:00:59.250> sure<00:00:59.399> how<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:00:59.940> play<00:01:00.210> with

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.020 
wasn't sure how I was gonna play with
that<00:01:00.510> because<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> wasn't<00:01:01.170> used<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
that because I wasn't used to it and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.889

into<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.500> unfortunately<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.520> did<00:01:47.670> not

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
into that is unfortunately we did not

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120 
into that is unfortunately we did not
win<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> game<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.869> lost<00:01:49.049> by<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:49.439> 20<00:01:49.770> points

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
win this game we lost by about 20 points

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.499 
win this game we lost by about 20 points
I<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:50.970> starting<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> make<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I think and we're starting to make a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
I think and we're starting to make a
comeback<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> end<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:53.430> was<00:01:53.549> really

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
comeback at the end but it was really

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.980 
comeback at the end but it was really
hard<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.060> us<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.390> make<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> comeback<00:01:54.899> because

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
hard for us to make the comeback because

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
hard for us to make the comeback because
we<00:01:55.200> were<00:01:55.290> running<00:01:55.530> out<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.310> also

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
we were running out of time and also

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.840 
we were running out of time and also
because<00:01:57.540> my<00:01:58.500> teammates<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.280> could<00:01:59.670> not

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
because my teammates really could not

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.510 
because my teammates really could not
hold<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.140> wasn't<00:02:01.469> sitting<00:02:01.710> at<00:02:02.009> me<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
hold be if I wasn't sitting at me the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.120 
hold be if I wasn't sitting at me the
entire<00:02:02.549> time<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.479> couldn't<00:02:04.140> hold<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.680> so

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
entire time we couldn't hold it and so

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.679 
entire time we couldn't hold it and so
what<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.399> was<00:02:05.579> actually<00:02:05.759> trying<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.360> towards

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
what I was actually trying to do towards

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.540 
what I was actually trying to do towards
the<00:02:06.869> end<00:02:07.020> which<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.829> what<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> would<00:02:08.190> recommend

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the end which is what I would recommend

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.160 
the end which is what I would recommend
that<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> guys<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.599> guys<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.899> having

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
that you guys do if you guys are having

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.250 
that you guys do if you guys are having
trouble

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
trouble

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.479 
trouble
when<00:02:11.349> you're<00:02:11.470> playing<00:02:11.650> solo<00:02:11.920> if<00:02:12.129> your<00:02:12.250> team's

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
when you're playing solo if your team's

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.670 
when you're playing solo if your team's
having<00:02:12.790> trouble<00:02:13.090> holding<00:02:13.629> be<00:02:14.049> or<00:02:14.200> capturing

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
having trouble holding be or capturing

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.009 
having trouble holding be or capturing
be<00:02:14.890> what<00:02:15.430> I'd<00:02:15.549> recommend<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.120> do<00:02:16.329> is<00:02:16.780> try

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
be what I'd recommend that you do is try

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.589 
be what I'd recommend that you do is try
and<00:02:17.110> push<00:02:17.470> up<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.860> far<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.400> possible<00:02:18.939> into<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
and push up as far as possible into the

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.690 
and push up as far as possible into the
enemy<00:02:19.900> squad<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.010> don't<00:02:21.220> really<00:02:21.519> want<00:02:21.670> to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
enemy squad and you don't really want to

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.190 
enemy squad and you don't really want to
go<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.239> like<00:02:22.360> flip<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.900> or<00:02:22.989> anything

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
go in there to like flip it or anything

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.720 
go in there to like flip it or anything
like<00:02:23.349> that<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.739> just<00:02:23.769> want<00:02:24.129> to<00:02:24.159> try<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.549> keep

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
like that you just want to try and keep

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.759 
like that you just want to try and keep
them<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.510> their<00:02:25.810> spawn<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.349> want<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.620> keep

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
them in their spawn you want to keep

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.860 
them in their spawn you want to keep
them<00:02:27.069> looking<00:02:27.579> for<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.299> your<00:02:28.390> spawn<00:02:28.659> you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
them looking for you and your spawn you

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.270 
them looking for you and your spawn you
want<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.079> keep<00:02:29.170> killing<00:02:29.620> them<00:02:29.739> in<00:02:29.829> their<00:02:29.980> spawn

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
want to keep killing them in their spawn

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.259 
want to keep killing them in their spawn
you<00:02:30.879> want<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.780> basically<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:33.159> guess<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> best

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
you want to basically I guess the best

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.580 
you want to basically I guess the best
way<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.480> say<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.840> is<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.079> want<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.409> take

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
way to say this is you want to take

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.410 
way to say this is you want to take
their<00:02:35.799> attention<00:02:35.890> as<00:02:36.340> much<00:02:36.370> away<00:02:36.849> from<00:02:37.060> B<00:02:37.269> as

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
their attention as much away from B as

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.270 
their attention as much away from B as
possible<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.440> want<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.680> keep<00:02:39.099> their

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
possible you want to keep their

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.190 
possible you want to keep their
attention<00:02:39.370> back<00:02:39.849> near<00:02:40.120> their<00:02:40.239> spawn<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.810> keep

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
attention back near their spawn and keep

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.839 
attention back near their spawn and keep
them<00:02:41.349> as<00:02:41.470> far<00:02:41.709> away<00:02:41.799> from<00:02:41.890> B<00:02:42.159> as<00:02:42.250> possible<00:02:42.730> so

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
them as far away from B as possible so

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.819 
them as far away from B as possible so
that<00:02:42.970> your<00:02:43.090> teammates<00:02:43.540> can<00:02:43.840> then<00:02:44.290> go<00:02:44.440> try<00:02:44.500> and

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
that your teammates can then go try and

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.770 
that your teammates can then go try and
capture<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.310> flag<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.909> so<00:02:46.359> that's<00:02:46.569> what<00:02:46.720> I

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
capture the flag and so that's what I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.960 
capture the flag and so that's what I
ended<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:47.170> trying<00:02:47.379> to<00:02:47.530> do<00:02:47.799> after<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.940> first

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
ended up trying to do after in the first

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.599 
ended up trying to do after in the first
round<00:02:49.480> which<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.170> cut<00:02:50.349> most<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.739> out<00:02:50.859> but<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
round which I cut most of it out but the

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:52.920 
round which I cut most of it out but the
first<00:02:51.819> time<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.000> died<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.329> bunch<00:02:52.599> of<00:02:52.720> times

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
first time I died a bunch of times

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.220 
first time I died a bunch of times
because<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.379> was<00:02:53.530> trying<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.760> get<00:02:54.909> B<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.599> my

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
because I was trying to to get B and my

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.720 
because I was trying to to get B and my
team<00:02:56.440> really<00:02:56.590> wasn't<00:02:56.829> helping<00:02:57.220> me<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:57.549> kept

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
team really wasn't helping me and I kept

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.750 
team really wasn't helping me and I kept
getting<00:02:57.819> c4<00:02:58.389> off<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.690> flag<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.349> so<00:03:00.040> rather

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
getting c4 off the flag and so rather

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.460 
getting c4 off the flag and so rather
than<00:03:01.060> continue<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.569> do<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.139> just

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
than continue to do that and just

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.530 
than continue to do that and just
basically<00:03:03.190> bang<00:03:03.639> my<00:03:03.819> head<00:03:03.849> against<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.299> wall

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
basically bang my head against the wall

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.860 
basically bang my head against the wall
and<00:03:04.750> not<00:03:05.019> make<00:03:05.769> any<00:03:05.799> progress<00:03:06.190> on<00:03:06.519> B<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:07.090> decided

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
and not make any progress on B I decided

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.420 
and not make any progress on B I decided
to<00:03:08.049> try<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.409> get<00:03:08.560> some<00:03:08.709> kill<00:03:08.920> streaks<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
to try and get some kill streaks in the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.520 
to try and get some kill streaks in the
air<00:03:09.609> push<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:10.120> into<00:03:10.239> their<00:03:10.480> spawn<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.170> trying

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
air push up into their spawn and trying

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.770 
air push up into their spawn and trying
to<00:03:11.590> hold<00:03:11.680> them<00:03:11.829> back<00:03:11.980> as<00:03:12.129> much<00:03:12.280> as<00:03:12.340> possible

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
to hold them back as much as possible

especially on a map like this where
there's<00:04:58.199> long<00:04:58.409> lines<00:04:58.439> sight<00:04:58.889> up<00:04:59.009> the

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
there's long lines sight up the

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.740 
there's long lines sight up the
right-hand<00:04:59.520> side<00:04:59.729> there's<00:05:00.270> a<00:05:00.330> long<00:05:00.509> line<00:05:00.719> of

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
right-hand side there's a long line of

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.029 
right-hand side there's a long line of
sight<00:05:00.960> up<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.169> middle<00:05:01.379> by<00:05:01.469> B<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.860> there's<00:05:01.979> a

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
sight up the middle by B and there's a

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.619 
sight up the middle by B and there's a
long<00:05:02.159> line<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.400> sight<00:05:02.669> up<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.210> left<00:05:03.419> by<00:05:03.539> that

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
long line of sight up the left by that

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.450 
long line of sight up the left by that
little<00:05:03.779> apartment<00:05:04.349> building<00:05:04.680> over<00:05:04.860> there<00:05:04.979> and

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
little apartment building over there and

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.490 
little apartment building over there and
so<00:05:05.909> I<00:05:05.939> found<00:05:06.150> myself<00:05:06.270> dying<00:05:06.750> from<00:05:07.050> those<00:05:07.199> spots

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
so I found myself dying from those spots

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.080 
so I found myself dying from those spots
all<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.009> time<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.669> it<00:05:08.759> was<00:05:08.879> really

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
all the time and it was really

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.490 
all the time and it was really
frustrating<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.719> I<00:05:09.900> couldn't<00:05:10.199> move<00:05:10.319> around

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
frustrating that I couldn't move around

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.830 
frustrating that I couldn't move around
the<00:05:10.710> map<00:05:10.830> like<00:05:11.069> I<00:05:11.189> wanted<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.909> especially

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
the map like I wanted to and especially

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.659 
the map like I wanted to and especially
when<00:05:13.139> playing<00:05:13.349> with<00:05:13.439> an<00:05:13.590> SMG<00:05:13.919> it's<00:05:14.250> hard<00:05:14.520> to

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
when playing with an SMG it's hard to

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.399 
when playing with an SMG it's hard to
win<00:05:14.849> gunfights<00:05:15.060> with<00:05:15.599> those<00:05:15.719> long<00:05:15.990> lines<00:05:16.169> of

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
win gunfights with those long lines of

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.329 
win gunfights with those long lines of
sight<00:05:16.589> UAV

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339 
sight UAV

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.519 
sight UAV
so<00:05:17.460> what<00:05:17.729> I<00:05:17.759> started<00:05:17.849> to<00:05:18.180> do<00:05:18.419> is<00:05:18.689> use<00:05:19.080> smoke

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
so what I started to do is use smoke

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.649 
so what I started to do is use smoke
grenade<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.189> c4<00:05:20.669> and<00:05:20.969> basically<00:05:21.479> what

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
grenade in the c4 and basically what

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.209 
grenade in the c4 and basically what
that<00:05:21.689> allows<00:05:22.020> me<00:05:22.229> to<00:05:22.259> do<00:05:22.469> is<00:05:22.499> throw<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.009> smoke

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
that allows me to do is throw the smoke

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.980 
that allows me to do is throw the smoke
grenade<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.729> between<00:05:24.060> me<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.300> whoever's

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
grenade in between me and whoever's

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.079 
grenade in between me and whoever's
camping<00:05:25.469> and<00:05:25.979> then<00:05:26.159> it<00:05:26.249> allows<00:05:26.400> me<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.699> rush<00:05:26.879> up

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
camping and then it allows me to rush up

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:29.029 
camping and then it allows me to rush up
towards<00:05:27.449> them<00:05:27.629> and<00:05:27.839> use<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.199> c4<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.740> try<00:05:28.889> and

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
towards them and use the c4 to try and

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.010 
towards them and use the c4 to try and
take<00:05:29.189> them<00:05:29.339> out<00:05:29.460> of<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.610> camp<00:05:30.029> spot<00:05:30.330> while

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
take them out of that camp spot while

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.200 
take them out of that camp spot while
they<00:05:31.050> can't<00:05:31.439> see<00:05:31.770> me<00:05:31.949> and<00:05:32.189> you<00:05:32.729> know<00:05:32.819> sometimes

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
they can't see me and you know sometimes

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.790 
they can't see me and you know sometimes
guys<00:05:33.300> do<00:05:33.659> have<00:05:33.779> sites<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.199> allow<00:05:34.500> them<00:05:34.710> to

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
guys do have sites that allow them to

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.290 
guys do have sites that allow them to
see<00:05:34.979> you<00:05:35.069> through<00:05:35.279> the<00:05:35.370> smoke<00:05:35.639> and<00:05:35.969> that's

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
see you through the smoke and that's

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.640 
see you through the smoke and that's
really<00:05:36.509> unfortunate<00:05:37.199> but<00:05:37.289> that's<00:05:37.439> pretty

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
really unfortunate but that's pretty

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.279 
really unfortunate but that's pretty
rare<00:05:37.979> as<00:05:38.159> well<00:05:38.399> and<00:05:38.870> usually<00:05:39.870> you<00:05:40.020> end<00:05:40.050> up

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
rare as well and usually you end up

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.019 
rare as well and usually you end up
winning<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.680> gunfights<00:05:41.129> or<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.759> at<00:05:41.879> least

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
winning the gunfights or you at least

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:43.189 
winning the gunfights or you at least
have<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.210> better<00:05:42.419> chance<00:05:42.479> at<00:05:42.870> winning<00:05:42.899> the

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
have a better chance at winning the

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.389 
have a better chance at winning the
gunfight<00:05:43.589> than<00:05:43.770> you<00:05:43.830> did<00:05:43.979> before

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:44.399 
gunfight than you did before

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.329 
gunfight than you did before
so<00:05:44.789> I<00:05:45.029> would<00:05:45.479> really<00:05:45.689> recommend<00:05:45.839> smoke<00:05:46.439> on<00:05:46.680> I

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
so I would really recommend smoke on I

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.249 
so I would really recommend smoke on I
use<00:05:47.580> it<00:05:47.699> on<00:05:47.759> all<00:05:48.000> maps<00:05:48.210> but<00:05:48.599> definitely<00:05:49.169> on

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
use it on all maps but definitely on

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.999 
use it on all maps but definitely on
Plaza<00:05:49.589> Yemen<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.789> overflow<00:05:51.529> and<00:05:52.529> also<00:05:52.800> check

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
Plaza Yemen and overflow and also check

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.040 
Plaza Yemen and overflow and also check
out<00:05:53.159> the<00:05:53.250> Scorpion<00:05:53.669> Evo<00:05:53.939> has<00:05:54.419> a<00:05:54.479> lot<00:05:54.689> of<00:05:54.779> recoil

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
out the Scorpion Evo has a lot of recoil

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.200 
out the Scorpion Evo has a lot of recoil
but<00:05:55.319> it's<00:05:55.439> mostly<00:05:55.710> up<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.129> down<00:05:56.279> so<00:05:56.879> you<00:05:56.969> can

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
but it's mostly up and down so you can

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.329 
but it's mostly up and down so you can
control<00:05:57.750> it<00:05:57.930> pretty<00:05:58.169> easily<00:05:58.379> and<00:05:58.889> it<00:05:59.069> kills

00:05:59.329 --> 00:05:59.339 
control it pretty easily and it kills

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:01.369 
control it pretty easily and it kills
very<00:05:59.669> quickly<00:06:00.029> and<00:06:00.569> with<00:06:00.839> that<00:06:00.930> laser<00:06:01.139> sight

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
very quickly and with that laser sight

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.040 
very quickly and with that laser sight
it<00:06:01.500> also<00:06:01.620> has<00:06:01.889> really<00:06:02.339> good<00:06:02.580> hipfire<00:06:03.089> so<00:06:03.449> with

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
it also has really good hipfire so with

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.379 
it also has really good hipfire so with
that<00:06:04.139> being<00:06:04.319> said<00:06:04.439> guys<00:06:04.740> 103<00:06:05.520> kills<00:06:05.819> on<00:06:06.240> the

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
that being said guys 103 kills on the

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.360 
that being said guys 103 kills on the
map<00:06:06.539> Yemen<00:06:06.930> unfortunately<00:06:07.710> we<00:06:07.800> lost<00:06:07.919> but<00:06:08.339> I

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
map Yemen unfortunately we lost but I

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.210 
map Yemen unfortunately we lost but I
hope<00:06:08.520> you<00:06:08.639> enjoy<00:06:08.849> it<00:06:08.909> anyways
