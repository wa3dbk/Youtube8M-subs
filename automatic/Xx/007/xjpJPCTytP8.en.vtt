switch<00:04:32.000> so<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.420> can<00:04:32.480> turn<00:04:32.630> your<00:04:32.960> electricity

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
switch so you can turn your electricity

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.650 
switch so you can turn your electricity
on<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.890> off<00:04:34.010> when<00:04:34.670> it's<00:04:34.820> closed<00:04:35.090> the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
on and off when it's closed the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.540 
on and off when it's closed the
electricity<00:04:36.200> flows<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.710> when<00:04:36.860> it's<00:04:36.980> open<00:04:37.280> the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
electricity flows and when it's open the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.910 
electricity flows and when it's open the
electricity<00:04:38.090> doesn't<00:04:38.300> flow<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:39.560> can<00:04:39.590> have<00:04:39.800> as

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
electricity doesn't flow you can have as

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.500 
electricity doesn't flow you can have as
many<00:04:40.070> pins<00:04:40.370> as<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:40.580> want<00:04:40.820> on<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.090> switch<00:04:41.270> but

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
many pins as you want on the switch but

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.960 
many pins as you want on the switch but
we<00:04:41.630> only<00:04:41.750> need<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.050> use<00:04:42.080> two<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.380> them<00:04:42.970> after

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
we only need to use two of them after

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.550 
we only need to use two of them after
you<00:04:44.060> glue<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.300> switch<00:04:44.600> on<00:04:44.780> now<00:04:45.140> it's<00:04:45.290> time<00:04:45.440> to

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
you glue the switch on now it's time to

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.530 
you glue the switch on now it's time to
connect<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.890> wires<00:04:46.070> do<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.030> remember<00:04:47.300> the

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
connect the wires do you remember the

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.900 
connect the wires do you remember the
5,600<00:04:48.320> ohm<00:04:48.440> resistor<00:04:48.890> leg<00:04:49.070> we're<00:04:49.640> going<00:04:49.670> to

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
5,600 ohm resistor leg we're going to

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.210 
5,600 ohm resistor leg we're going to
need<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.210> connect<00:04:50.510> that<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.900> switch

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
need to connect that to the switch

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.380 
need to connect that to the switch
connect<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.310> resistor<00:04:52.700> leg<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.060> any<00:04:53.210> of<00:04:53.330> the

connect the resistor leg to any of the
things<00:04:53.600> that<00:04:53.780> you<00:04:53.840> want

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
things that you want

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.140 
things that you want
however<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.340> wire<00:04:55.490> that's<00:04:55.700> going<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.030> be

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
however the wire that's going to be

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.180 
however the wire that's going to be
leaning<00:04:56.450> out<00:04:56.570> must<00:04:56.900> be<00:04:57.140> adjacent<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:58.010> pin

leaning out must be adjacent to the pin

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.240 
leaning out must be adjacent to the pin
that<00:04:58.760> means<00:04:59.090> it<00:04:59.240> must<00:04:59.330> be<00:04:59.450> side<00:04:59.690> by<00:04:59.840> side<00:05:00.250> okay

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
that means it must be side by side okay

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.710 
that means it must be side by side okay
now<00:05:01.280> it's<00:05:01.640> time<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.880> connect<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.210> device<00:05:02.540> to

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
now it's time to connect the device to

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.810 
now it's time to connect the device to
sponges<00:05:03.500> by<00:05:03.620> using<00:05:03.830> alligator<00:05:04.370> clips<00:05:04.610> but

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
sponges by using alligator clips but

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.460 
sponges by using alligator clips but
first<00:05:05.030> we<00:05:05.300> need<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.540> make<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.720> wire<00:05:05.900> longer<00:05:06.290> so

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
first we need to make the wire longer so

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.350 
first we need to make the wire longer so
it<00:05:06.620> can<00:05:06.770> reach<00:05:06.920> our<00:05:07.130> head<00:05:07.310> from<00:05:07.880> somewhere

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
it can reach our head from somewhere

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.720 
it can reach our head from somewhere
such<00:05:08.510> as<00:05:08.720> your<00:05:09.200> pocket<00:05:09.380> so<00:05:10.040> what<00:05:10.370> we're<00:05:10.550> going

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
such as your pocket so what we're going

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.610 
such as your pocket so what we're going
to<00:05:10.820> do<00:05:11.030> is<00:05:11.240> we're<00:05:11.450> going<00:05:11.480> to<00:05:11.720> attach<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:12.290> long

to show you a technique to make sure
that<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.450> wire<00:05:29.630> doesn't<00:05:29.930> fall<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:31.430> can<00:05:31.580> be

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
that the wire doesn't fall and it can be

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.300 
that the wire doesn't fall and it can be
used<00:05:31.850> on<00:05:31.970> any<00:05:32.150> alligator<00:05:32.660> clip<00:05:33.100> now<00:05:34.100> what<00:05:34.250> you

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
used on any alligator clip now what you

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.500 
used on any alligator clip now what you
want<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.550> do<00:05:34.700> is<00:05:34.880> you<00:05:34.970> want<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.240> take<00:05:35.390> the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
want to do is you want to take the

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.480 
want to do is you want to take the
uninsulated<00:05:35.990> part<00:05:36.470> of<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.800> copper<00:05:37.100> wire<00:05:37.280> and

uninsulated part of the copper wire and

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.950 
uninsulated part of the copper wire and
you<00:05:37.580> want<00:05:37.730> to<00:05:37.820> double<00:05:38.120> coil<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:38.480> around

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
you want to double coil it around

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.650 
you want to double coil it around
alligator<00:05:39.650> clip<00:05:39.860> by<00:05:40.460> doing<00:05:40.820> this<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.300> copper

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
alligator clip by doing this the copper

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.909 
alligator clip by doing this the copper
and<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.900> alligator<00:05:42.350> clip<00:05:42.590> will<00:05:42.740> touch

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
and the alligator clip will touch

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.500 
and the alligator clip will touch
meaning<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.490> electricity<00:05:43.970> will<00:05:44.120> transfer

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
meaning the electricity will transfer

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.640 
meaning the electricity will transfer
and<00:05:44.720> the<00:05:45.020> wire<00:05:45.169> will<00:05:45.320> not<00:05:45.470> fall<00:05:45.650> off

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.100 

I<00:05:49.940> think<00:05:50.940> you<00:05:51.000> have<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.270> wire<00:05:51.449> attached<00:05:51.870> to

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
I think you have the wire attached to

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.050 
I think you have the wire attached to
the<00:05:52.229> alligator<00:05:52.680> clip<00:05:52.949> all<00:05:53.160> you<00:05:53.610> need<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:53.910> do

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
the alligator clip all you need to do

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.300 
the alligator clip all you need to do
next<00:05:54.240> is<00:05:54.540> connect<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.199> to<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.470> sponge<00:05:55.710> now

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
next is connect it to the sponge now

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.070 
next is connect it to the sponge now
make<00:05:56.520> sure<00:05:56.550> you<00:05:56.850> just<00:05:57.060> very<00:05:57.360> tightly<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:57.900> that

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
make sure you just very tightly so that

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.790 
make sure you just very tightly so that
the<00:05:58.380> electricity<00:05:58.800> actually<00:05:59.419> transfers<00:06:00.800> after

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
the electricity actually transfers after

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.560 
the electricity actually transfers after
this<00:06:01.979> all<00:06:02.220> you<00:06:02.400> need<00:06:02.460> to<00:06:02.669> do<00:06:02.850> is<00:06:03.030> put<00:06:03.419> on

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
this all you need to do is put on

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.110 
this all you need to do is put on
saltwater<00:06:04.050> on<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.500> sponges<00:06:04.889> and<00:06:05.070> we're<00:06:05.910> ready

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
saltwater on the sponges and we're ready

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.779 
saltwater on the sponges and we're ready
to<00:06:06.270> test<00:06:06.830> now<00:06:07.830> it's<00:06:08.009> time<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:08.220> measure<00:06:08.550> the

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
to test now it's time to measure the

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.879 
to test now it's time to measure the
amount<00:06:09.120> of<00:06:09.180> electricity<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.960> tDCS<00:06:10.440> device

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
amount of electricity the tDCS device

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.800 
amount of electricity the tDCS device
gives<00:06:11.310> out<00:06:11.490> so<00:06:11.789> that<00:06:11.970> we<00:06:12.090> don't<00:06:12.300> shock<00:06:12.660> our

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
gives out so that we don't shock our

from<00:06:45.770> boxes<00:06:46.220> as<00:06:46.340> my<00:06:47.090> hair<00:06:47.360> is<00:06:47.539> too<00:06:47.690> long<00:06:47.840> to<00:06:47.990> do

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
from boxes as my hair is too long to do

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.980 
from boxes as my hair is too long to do
so<00:06:48.139> so<00:06:48.949> the<00:06:49.039> first<00:06:49.280> step<00:06:49.460> is<00:06:49.669> to<00:06:50.210> place<00:06:50.539> the

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
so so the first step is to place the

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.950 
so so the first step is to place the
negative<00:06:51.680> sponge<00:06:51.949> on<00:06:52.220> your<00:06:52.460> right<00:06:52.729> shoulder

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
negative sponge on your right shoulder

the left side of the head where he puts
it<00:07:02.020> this<00:07:02.650> is<00:07:02.830> the<00:07:02.920> positive<00:07:03.160> sponge<00:07:03.730> after<00:07:04.080> you

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
it this is the positive sponge after you

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.080 
it this is the positive sponge after you
simultaneously<00:07:05.440> place<00:07:06.160> both<00:07:06.370> sponges<00:07:06.910> where

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
simultaneously place both sponges where
