00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.099
 good to start we have one and a half 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.139
 cup of oat flakes what I'm going to 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.789
 to do is to process them until they are well 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.789
 ground that looks like a flour 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.240
 I'm putting the coconut flour 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.310
 so that they are free of gluten but 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 same if you consume it if you do not have 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.200
 problem you can change the flour 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.560
 coconut if you do not get it by flour 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.599
 wheat or white flour 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.059
 and I 'm going to add also half 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.399
 teaspoon of salt I'm using salt 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.910
 pink or any type of salt that 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.520
 have 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.850
 I will also put half a teaspoon 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.600
 of baking soda and a spoonful 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 of baking powder 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.030
 we mix it well 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.720
 because in a larger bowl I will empty 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.880
 the mixture I had from the flours 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.480
 I'm going to add a cup of sugar 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.480
 brunette 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 half a cup of organic coconut oil or 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.220
 extra virgin oil i use from this one 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.030
 for egg substitute use a 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.940
 teaspoon cornstarch to mix with 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 two tablespoons of water and I'll empty it 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.820
 in the mix we move everything very well 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.590
 to integrate it 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.250
 I also add a trickle of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.740
 vanilla like a teaspoon 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.259
 [Music] 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.420
 and I also added three teaspoons of 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.520
 Apricot jam you can use 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.500
 of any type of jam and what 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.500
 we mix to integrate it very well 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.229
 but I have a handful of blueberries 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.020
 dry that I'm going to chop as much as 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.810
 can and a bitter chocolate tablet 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.810
 I am using this brand in the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.159
 ingredients tells me that he has no milk 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.340
 I still take the picture to make it look 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.119
 well because here almost not 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.689
 and I 'll also put it in pieces 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.689
 little ones 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.310
 I added 5 teaspoons more 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 jam stick well to the masita 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.120
 and it goes well in chocolatitos 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.269
 crushed just use half 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.230
 bar of chocolate and blueberries it 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.230
 I keep mixing 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.950
 I make little balls and I put them in a 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.709
 jr tray with waxed paper and 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.599
 crushed to form the cookie and the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.489
 I'm going to put the oven preheated to 180 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.489
 degrees for 15 minutes 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.800
 since they knew a little golden 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.050
 the borders means that they are already 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.400
 they're going to be sharp but there's no 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.860
 problem you have to leave them like this 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.700
 already used once they are cold 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.320
 they're going to get that hard and they're ready 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.120
 I hope you liked this recipe 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.160
