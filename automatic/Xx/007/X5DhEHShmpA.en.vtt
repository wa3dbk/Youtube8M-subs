00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
gate and they made their system good for

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
gate and they made their system good for
third-party<00:01:51.360> developers<00:01:51.930> they<00:01:52.409> made<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> a

system yet it's the most powerful system
out<00:02:44.819> there<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.590> eventually<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.680> took<00:02:46.890> them

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
out there and eventually it took them

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.400 
out there and eventually it took them
almost<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.519> couple<00:02:48.000> years<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.810> couple<00:02:49.319> of

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
almost like a couple years a couple of

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.280 
almost like a couple years a couple of
years<00:02:49.890> me<00:02:50.310> know<00:02:51.030> more<00:02:51.269> like<00:02:51.450> three<00:02:51.810> years<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.200> I

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
years me know more like three years if I

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.470 
years me know more like three years if I
think<00:02:52.349> about<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:53.310> them<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.730> really<00:02:54.000> turn

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
think about it for them to really turn

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.839 
think about it for them to really turn
the<00:02:54.750> fortunes<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.530> PlayStation<00:02:56.250> 3<00:02:56.489> around

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
the fortunes of the PlayStation 3 around

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.630 
the fortunes of the PlayStation 3 around
but<00:02:57.660> they<00:02:57.840> did<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.470> not<00:02:58.920> only<00:02:58.950> did<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.489> do

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
but they did it and not only did they do

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.319 
but they did it and not only did they do
it<00:03:00.030> they<00:03:00.180> actually<00:03:00.810> outsold<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:02.099> Xbox<00:03:02.610> 360

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
it they actually outsold the Xbox 360

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.650 
it they actually outsold the Xbox 360
not<00:03:03.569> by<00:03:03.810> much<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.200> they<00:03:04.709> did<00:03:05.090> now<00:03:06.090> looking<00:03:06.540> at

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
not by much but they did now looking at

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.870 
not by much but they did now looking at
the<00:03:06.780> eighth<00:03:06.930> generation<00:03:07.280> where<00:03:08.280> Microsoft

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
the eighth generation where Microsoft

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.850 
the eighth generation where Microsoft
learned<00:03:09.450> from<00:03:09.630> their<00:03:09.780> mistakes<00:03:10.170> far<00:03:10.650> quicker

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
learned from their mistakes far quicker

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.089 
learned from their mistakes far quicker
than<00:03:11.099> Sony<00:03:11.549> did<00:03:11.819> with<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> PlayStation<00:03:12.269> 3

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
than Sony did with the PlayStation 3

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.630 
than Sony did with the PlayStation 3
maybe<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.549> Xbox<00:03:15.120> one<00:03:15.390> will<00:03:15.900> catch<00:03:16.230> up<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
maybe the Xbox one will catch up to the

maybe the Xbox one will catch up to the
PlayStation<00:03:18.239> 4<00:03:18.269> I'm<00:03:18.959> not<00:03:19.260> guaranteeing<00:03:19.590> this

will happen but you never know I mean
think<00:03:23.069> about<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.430> right<00:03:23.609> now

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
think about it right now

third-party<00:03:30.030> wise<00:03:30.209> most<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.989> same<00:03:31.230> damn

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
third-party wise most of the same damn

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580 
third-party wise most of the same damn
games<00:03:31.859> for<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.030> it's<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:34.049> compelling
