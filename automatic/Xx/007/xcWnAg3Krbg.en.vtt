00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
it's it's a difficult one when you've

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.550 
it's it's a difficult one when you've
got<00:02:31.340> through<00:02:31.580> quality<00:02:32.000> halves<00:02:32.560> realistically

is<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.769> half<00:02:33.950> back<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.430> we<00:02:35.090> have<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.420> pretty

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
is a half back and we have to pretty

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600 
is a half back and we have to pretty
good<00:02:35.780> effect<00:02:36.200> so

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
good effect so

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.990 
good effect so
the<00:02:38.610> utility<00:02:39.270> value<00:02:40.490> is<00:02:41.490> obviously<00:02:41.880> still

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the utility value is obviously still

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.700 
the utility value is obviously still

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
don't know i'd imagine it will be but

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.850 
don't know i'd imagine it will be but
yeah<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.150> couldn't<00:04:24.600> tell<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.800> know

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
yeah I couldn't tell you that you know

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.560 
yeah I couldn't tell you that you know
is<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.430> different<00:04:26.790> much<00:04:26.910> different<00:04:27.330> playing

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
is it different much different playing

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.940 
is it different much different playing
not<00:04:27.960> many<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.230> these<00:04:28.290> boys<00:04:28.530> would<00:04:28.710> have<00:04:28.800> played

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
not many of these boys would have played

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.980 
not many of these boys would have played
under<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.220> closed<00:04:29.430> roof<00:04:29.670> before<00:04:29.990> expecting

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
under a closed roof before expecting

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.390 
under a closed roof before expecting
anything<00:04:31.170> different<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.710> think<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.070> few<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.250> them

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
anything different I think a few of them

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.300 
anything different I think a few of them
have<00:04:32.520> actually<00:04:32.730> in<00:04:33.480> Nolan<00:04:33.840> yeah<00:04:34.170> I<00:04:34.500> couldn't

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
have actually in Nolan yeah I couldn't

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.980 
have actually in Nolan yeah I couldn't
tell<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.460> how<00:04:35.670> many<00:04:35.700> but<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.060> think<00:04:36.270> in<00:04:36.480> state

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
tell you how many but I think in state

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.870 
tell you how many but I think in state
of<00:04:37.020> origin<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:38.190> they've<00:04:38.370> been<00:04:38.460> all<00:04:38.610> playing

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
of origin and they've been all playing

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.980 
of origin and they've been all playing
for<00:04:39.030> quite<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.240> while<00:04:39.420> I<00:04:39.480> think<00:04:39.630> there's<00:04:39.930> been

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
for quite a while I think there's been

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.640 
for quite a while I think there's been
at<00:04:40.560> least<00:04:40.620> one<00:04:40.920> game<00:04:41.100> that<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.370> know

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
at least one game that I know

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.600 
at least one game that I know
under<00:04:42.190> roof<00:04:42.419> so<00:04:44.070> look<00:04:45.070> there<00:04:45.280> is<00:04:45.430> some

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
under roof so look there is some

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.370 
under roof so look there is some
difference<00:04:45.759> obviously<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.930> noise<00:04:47.110> factor

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
difference obviously the noise factor

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.879 
difference obviously the noise factor
will<00:04:47.710> be<00:04:47.740> 12<00:04:48.460> they<00:04:49.060> reckon<00:04:49.449> the<00:04:50.020> ground<00:04:50.470> sweats

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
will be 12 they reckon the ground sweats

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.040 
will be 12 they reckon the ground sweats
by<00:04:51.130> that<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.340> mean<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.610> gets<00:04:52.000> very<00:04:52.060> very<00:04:52.449> warm

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
by that I mean it gets very very warm

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.270 
by that I mean it gets very very warm
inside<00:04:53.320> with<00:04:53.770> 40<00:04:54.160> or<00:04:54.280> 45<00:04:54.580> thousand<00:04:55.150> people<00:04:56.280> so

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
inside with 40 or 45 thousand people so

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.770 
inside with 40 or 45 thousand people so
in<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.550> ground<00:04:57.789> funny<00:04:58.090> enough<00:04:58.300> gets<00:04:58.539> a<00:04:58.630> little

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
in the ground funny enough gets a little

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.360 
in the ground funny enough gets a little
slippery<00:04:59.139> and<00:04:59.410> you'd<00:04:59.680> think<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.039> roof<00:05:00.220> would

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
slippery and you'd think the roof would

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.219 
slippery and you'd think the roof would
beyond<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.940> stop<00:05:01.150> at<00:05:01.330> that<00:05:01.509> but<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.870> apparently

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
beyond to stop at that but it apparently

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.490 
beyond to stop at that but it apparently

it<00:05:31.960> doesn't<00:05:32.260> mean<00:05:32.350> you<00:05:32.470> won't<00:05:32.650> like<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.979> file

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
it doesn't mean you won't like the file

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.360 
it doesn't mean you won't like the file
but<00:05:34.530> it's<00:05:35.530> about<00:05:35.620> getting<00:05:35.830> away<00:05:36.039> to<00:05:36.099> a<00:05:36.220> good

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
but it's about getting away to a good

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.980 
but it's about getting away to a good
confidence<00:05:36.880> start<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.419> I<00:05:37.599> think<00:05:37.660> that's

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
confidence start and I think that's

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.409 
confidence start and I think that's
important<00:05:38.470> for<00:05:38.590> us<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:38.949> also<00:05:39.729> it<00:05:40.060> keeps<00:05:40.300> you

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
important for us and also it keeps you

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.820 
important for us and also it keeps you
on<00:05:40.509> the<00:05:40.630> side<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:41.020> draw<00:05:41.199> where<00:05:41.530> you're<00:05:41.680> not

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
on the side of the draw where you're not

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.750 
on the side of the draw where you're not
likely<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.520> run<00:05:42.759> into<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:44.259> other<00:05:44.760> powerhouse

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
likely to run into the other powerhouse

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.540 
likely to run into the other powerhouse
in<00:05:46.000> New<00:05:46.180> Zealand<00:05:46.599> who<00:05:47.099> were<00:05:48.099> playing<00:05:48.220> on<00:05:48.460> the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550

other<00:05:48.580> side<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.970> drawer<00:05:49.120> so<00:05:49.150> if<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:50.050> lose<00:05:50.260> to

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
other side the drawer so if you lose to

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.589 
other side the drawer so if you lose to
England<00:05:50.889> likely<00:05:51.250> you're<00:05:51.610> likely<00:05:51.789> to<00:05:51.970> meet<00:05:52.419> new
