 Elista in the market were 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.380
 in this regard with the opening buffets two 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.019

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.230
 by the way headache last thing 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.399
 will be 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:17.489
 was destroyed in 1959 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.119
 at the cost of a claim it was also in the city 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.609
 Medvezhiegorsk Karelian I personally 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.310
 he was also visited by the view 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.949
 two years old 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.419
 at the station zykov 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.140
 to the brain of genius 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.770
 the most was 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.770
 but my friend 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.660
 but I am not a historian and there are those who are very 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.060
 surprised when we don't know 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.810
 headaches 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.810
 the main future 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.190
 it's dangerous 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.770
 old signboard preserved 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.450
 nineteenth century 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.420
 the main will be they were buffet yanao 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.290
 large stations and hubs 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.810
 week may be there 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.040
 such station 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.360
 because there are water compounds 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.000
 ways 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.490
 mistress with garbage 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 and is iron toronto well done 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.750
 there 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.030
 remains from amazon removed well on st turn 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.930
 stupid 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.590
 Well, we put this year 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.470
 therefore, such is preserved 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.280
 and just a pantry 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.980
 and in this topic station point 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.690
 they of course 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.070
 rubles Vova very poorly supplied 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.200
 why 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.320
 because procurement care 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.060
 lay on the station warden 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.730
 and his main 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.900
 function was 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.049
 to provide horses to 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.350
 in rome as a result of this movement 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.090
 among the seized sweat 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.270
 by rank 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.540
 the percentage of delaying some gain 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.850
 give it to the first who 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.310
 must be kept in mind 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.870
 and therefore 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.250
 Vova this side 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.689
 additional autonomy power 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:10.829
 illegal immigrants 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.179
 Pushkin says 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.349
 price list there 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.340
 when this very room is cold and 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.370
 soon in hungry 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.279
 that is, it was one two 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:22.769
 dish failure 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.769
 maybe I might not be cold 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.829
 there is bread and 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.269
 what place in the cabin is herring 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.959
 that is, it doesn't spoil 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.109
 and the fact that already for tickets 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.709
 and so Pushkin and maybe when 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.799
 some 10 years later 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.719
 in 2010 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.249
 among do 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.239
 baptismal measures at each station 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.279
 tract 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.839
 and taverns after 100 years of development 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.839
 author after the abolition of serfdom 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:58.899
 and now 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.859
 by not lived he could have sailed 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.239
 because if you know we have everything 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.109
 great 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.979
 his so to speak 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.389
 friend 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.139
 Kalashnikov drinking companion at all 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.139
 all juice 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:19.519
 the percentage was and 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.489
 such a public is not for his name common 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.349
 filmed as club food 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.479
 clubs have already been 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.489
 English club and English 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.729
 he existed his end 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.859
 eighteenth century there too it was possible 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.489
 go eat 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.550
 what to change 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.119
 those who had wonderful 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.659
 and home 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.430
 m3 and passed just that exquisitely 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.449
 because 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.599
 they cooked there 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.369
 chefs calculate more often and falsification 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:52.020
 but the consumers themselves were no longer 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.020
 ten fifteen people 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.110
 Of course, that amount could be 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.020
 answer each individually that is 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.079
 it is homemade food but cooked mass 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.319
 highly qualified and guided 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.849
 why is it the same 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.359
 this remnant is preserved 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.449
 in our wait for afghanistan 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.419

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.289
 40 minutes he takes it cold warms up 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.520
 which was cooked the day before yesterday 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.090
 This project is Turkey 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.939
 but the merchant's club 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.539
 the club was only 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.059
 after the revolution 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.189
 diesel fifth year after the first Russian 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:36.020
 revolution 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.620
 on the eve of the first world war 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.569
 Bodjinsky tenth 1 st year was 1 opening 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.599
 Petersburg 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.679
 as well as merchants walking on red star ii 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.719
 but such a big come out again 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.269
 where it was impossible to beat the dishes scandal 

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:56.059
 had 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.550
 have a good experience 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.979
 it was charged only 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.490
 and quite 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.039
 new russia 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.120
 as they say on the site 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.439
 that's why 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.379
 basically and writes 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.980
 does not mean yeti restaurant 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.650
 to write 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.330
 exquisite real Russian there 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.360
 they 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.569
 in the nineties 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.240
 coloring active developed 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.530
 I am Russian countries on the basis of these factions they 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.919
 developed 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.759
 so say here is a classic 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.210
 and glue such as tobacco Russian cuisine 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.699
 but before that until May 8 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.370
 nineties 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.370
 the first 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.870
 ten years 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.860
 because the wartime sang already in 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.469
 Wednesday 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:47.939
 and wartime 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:49.699
 World War I 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.729
 under 17 years old 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.289
 the existence 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.129
 normal good 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.490
 Russian cuisine was in history 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.490
 everything else in transition 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.260
 Yes, and should make a reservation of the day 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.950
 station up to two years why were they 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.530
 for 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.669
 and I was fine for Russia 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.669
 in Russia, after all, it was not there 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.629
 that in all countries constantly added 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:19.969
 and the debate here we are reading novels 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:20.759
 failed 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:21.750
 percent 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.000
 medieval france hematoma 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.099
 We believe that already 17 years 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.740
 everything is there or 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.309

 there recognized the total weight of gold were 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.340

 anticipating and with them all who have already had the day 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.749
 we did not have and did not have inns

 more and in Poland was sown after 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.710
