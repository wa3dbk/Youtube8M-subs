in this video the one for lower pressure
washers<00:01:58.430> seem<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.760> follow<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.060> lot<00:01:59.210> better<00:01:59.450> than

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320

washers seem to follow a lot better than
the<00:02:00.470> other<00:02:00.650> one<00:02:00.860> um<00:02:01.460> with<00:02:01.970> my<00:02:02.000> clean<00:02:02.390> force

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
the other one um with my clean force

the other one um with my clean force
1800<00:02:03.470> electric<00:02:04.220> pressure<00:02:04.370> washer<00:02:04.700> which<00:02:05.060> I

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
1800 electric pressure washer which I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.090 
1800 electric pressure washer which I
think<00:02:05.900> has<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.080> working<00:02:06.350> pressure<00:02:06.800> of<00:02:06.980> around

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
think has a working pressure of around

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.260 
think has a working pressure of around
1300<00:02:08.060> psi<00:02:09.250> but<00:02:10.250> either<00:02:10.460> one<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.820> fine<00:02:10.850> they

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
1300 psi but either one is fine they

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.990 
1300 psi but either one is fine they
both<00:02:11.480> get<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.690> job<00:02:11.990> done<00:02:12.880> thanks<00:02:13.880> for

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
both get the job done thanks for
