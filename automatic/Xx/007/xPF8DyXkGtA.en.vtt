to the side here's the mouse put that to
the<00:02:05.030> side<00:02:05.440> somewhere<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.530> can't<00:02:06.800> see<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.190> and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
the side somewhere you can't see it and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.190 
the side somewhere you can't see it and
here's<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.810> mouse<00:02:10.540> it<00:02:11.540> has<00:02:11.810> some<00:02:11.990> weight<00:02:12.140> to

here's the mouse it has some weight to

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.710 
here's the mouse it has some weight to
it<00:02:12.380> but<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:12.830> not<00:02:13.040> too<00:02:13.370> heavy<00:02:13.580> which<00:02:14.570> is

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
it but it's not too heavy which is

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.150 
it but it's not too heavy which is
always<00:02:14.900> good<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.290> as<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.800> ticker<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:17.330> this

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
always good and as this ticker it's this

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.450 
always good and as this ticker it's this
whoa

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
whoa

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.610 
whoa
so<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.390> guess<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.870> doesn't<00:02:21.080> need<00:02:21.230> batteries

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
so I guess it doesn't need batteries

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.560 
so I guess it doesn't need batteries
that<00:02:22.370> could<00:02:22.670> be<00:02:22.910> bad<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.170> could<00:02:24.350> be<00:02:24.470> good

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
that could be bad that could be good

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.150 
that could be bad that could be good
probably<00:02:26.570> bad<00:02:26.990> Oh<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.560> lights<00:02:27.740> up<00:02:27.950> that's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
probably bad Oh like it lights up that's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.220
