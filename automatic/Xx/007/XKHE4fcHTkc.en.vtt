00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
background and there's the RAM of it so

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.300 
background and there's the RAM of it so
you<00:05:54.480> can<00:05:54.750> keep<00:05:55.440> right<00:05:55.650> if<00:05:55.770> I<00:05:55.830> trying<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.130> fast

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
you can keep right if I trying to fast

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.450 
you can keep right if I trying to fast
and<00:05:56.580> faster<00:05:56.990> so<00:05:57.990> this<00:05:58.470> is<00:05:58.650> just<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:59.040> vertical

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
and faster so this is just the vertical

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.450 
and faster so this is just the vertical
thing<00:05:59.700> to<00:06:00.530> just<00:06:01.530> make<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.770> go<00:06:01.890> faster

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
thing to just make it go faster

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.670 
thing to just make it go faster
