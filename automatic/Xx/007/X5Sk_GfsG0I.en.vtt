00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
built this pathway and they didn't put

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.580 
built this pathway and they didn't put
these<00:00:40.890> bars<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
these bars in and this was like the
