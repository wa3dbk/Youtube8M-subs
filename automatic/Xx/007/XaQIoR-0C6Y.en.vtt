it in this case and all you need to do
is<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:16.920> open<00:03:17.069> up<00:03:17.340> these<00:03:17.430> little<00:03:17.549> vents<00:03:18.060> on

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
is just open up these little vents on

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.610 
is just open up these little vents on
either<00:03:18.299> side<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.110> does<00:03:19.290> get<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.470> last

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
either side so that it does get a last

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.710 
either side so that it does get a last
bit<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.830> airflow<00:03:20.190> you've<00:03:20.970> also<00:03:21.090> got<00:03:21.360> access

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
bit of airflow you've also got access

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.539 
bit of airflow you've also got access
when<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.989> open<00:03:22.380> these<00:03:22.470> little<00:03:22.709> vents<00:03:22.950> up<00:03:23.069> to

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
when you open these little vents up to

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.789 
when you open these little vents up to
inputs<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.209> outputs<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.959> you've<00:03:25.410> also<00:03:25.530> got

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
inputs and outputs and you've also got

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.470 
inputs and outputs and you've also got
on<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.950> other<00:03:25.980> side<00:03:26.250> here<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.670> little<00:03:27.150> bit<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.420> a

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
on the other side here a little bit of a

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.289 
on the other side here a little bit of a
charging<00:03:27.959> socket<00:03:28.530> there<00:03:28.890> as<00:03:29.040> well<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:30.090> those

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
charging socket there as well and those

charging socket there as well and those
can<00:03:30.540> stay<00:03:30.750> up<00:03:30.900> lots<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.320> pockets<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.829> can<00:03:31.980> drop

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
can stay up lots of pockets you can drop

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.430 
can stay up lots of pockets you can drop
stuff<00:03:32.430> into<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.600> let's<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:33.900> take<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:34.109> out<00:03:34.350> in

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
stuff into but let's just take it out in

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.920 
stuff into but let's just take it out in
the<00:03:34.500> actual<00:03:34.620> case<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.280> for<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.489> second<00:03:35.930> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the actual case here for a second and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.349 
the actual case here for a second and
we'll<00:03:37.230> put<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.769> one<00:03:37.890> side<00:03:38.150> because<00:03:39.150> this

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
we'll put that to one side because this

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.729 
we'll put that to one side because this
is<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.660> unit<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.230> I'll<00:03:40.350> just<00:03:40.470> turn<00:03:40.680> this

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
is the unit here and I'll just turn this

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.000 
is the unit here and I'll just turn this
off<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.370> we'll<00:03:42.329> just<00:03:42.450> take<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.780> out<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.920> you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
off and we'll just take that out so you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.610 
off and we'll just take that out so you
can<00:03:44.130> see<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.489> really<00:03:44.819> really<00:03:45.150> solid<00:03:45.450> one<00:03:46.440> thing

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
can see is really really solid one thing

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.530 
can see is really really solid one thing
I<00:03:46.709> absolutely<00:03:46.980> love<00:03:47.640> about<00:03:47.670> this<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.239> this

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
I absolutely love about this is this

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.740 
I absolutely love about this is this
thing<00:03:48.720> here<00:03:48.989> so<00:03:49.470> we<00:03:49.590> can<00:03:49.769> take<00:03:50.069> off<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:51.569> main

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
thing here so we can take off the main

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.520 
thing here so we can take off the main
head<00:03:52.190> leaving<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.459> battery<00:03:53.819> here<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.840> if<00:03:55.200> I'm

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
head leaving the battery here so if I'm

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.229 
head leaving the battery here so if I'm
traveling<00:03:56.130> or<00:03:56.280> I'm<00:03:56.370> storing<00:03:56.850> if<00:03:56.940> I'm<00:03:57.060> not

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
traveling or I'm storing if I'm not

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.280 
traveling or I'm storing if I'm not
using<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.660> for<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> while

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
using it for a while

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.170 
using it for a while
invariably<00:03:59.069> I<00:03:59.160> can<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> little<00:03:59.670> bit<00:03:59.850> clumsy

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
invariably I can be a little bit clumsy

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.819 
invariably I can be a little bit clumsy
and<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.630> can<00:04:00.750> get<00:04:00.900> some<00:04:01.500> things<00:04:01.680> like<00:04:01.769> this

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
and it can get some things like this

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.500 
and it can get some things like this
could<00:04:02.010> get<00:04:02.160> knocked<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.150> could<00:04:03.329> end<00:04:03.420> up

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
could get knocked so it could end up

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.960 
could get knocked so it could end up
getting<00:04:03.660> switched<00:04:04.079> on<00:04:04.350> when<00:04:05.250> it's<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.579> storage

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
getting switched on when it's in storage

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.949 
getting switched on when it's in storage
or<00:04:06.060> when<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.420> back<00:04:06.569> of<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.780> cars

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
or when it's in the back of the cars

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.660 
or when it's in the back of the cars
moving<00:04:07.290> around<00:04:07.470> now<00:04:08.100> that's<00:04:08.220> not<00:04:08.370> going<00:04:08.609> to

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
moving around now that's not going to

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.460 
moving around now that's not going to
drain<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.000> battery<00:04:09.030> what<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.049> can<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.319> with

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
drain the battery what you can do with

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.900 
drain the battery what you can do with
this<00:04:10.590> unit<00:04:10.889> is<00:04:10.980> take<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.519> head<00:04:11.700> off

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
this unit is take the head off

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.629 
this unit is take the head off
turn<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:12.750> around<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.019> other<00:04:13.109> way<00:04:13.400> then<00:04:14.400> lock

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
turn it around the other way then lock

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.270 
turn it around the other way then lock
it<00:04:14.670> down<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.299> then<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:15.989> won't<00:04:16.109> turn<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
it down and then it won't turn on so the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.680 
it down and then it won't turn on so the
battery<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:17.789> always<00:04:17.970> going<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.150> remain<00:04:18.389> nice

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
battery is always going to remain nice

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.629 
battery is always going to remain nice
and<00:04:18.720> fully<00:04:19.079> charged<00:04:19.440> in<00:04:19.590> between<00:04:20.250> traveling

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
and fully charged in between traveling

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.840 
and fully charged in between traveling
around<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:22.560> let's<00:04:23.250> have<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.490> look<00:04:23.580> I've<00:04:23.729> got

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
around so let's have a look I've got

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.370 
around so let's have a look I've got
some<00:04:23.970> technical<00:04:24.360> specs<00:04:24.720> say<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.080> just<00:04:25.200> lean

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
some technical specs say if I just lean

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.290 
some technical specs say if I just lean
forward<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.830> grab<00:04:26.039> some<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.310> these<00:04:26.400> here<00:04:26.610> like

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
forward and grab some of these here like

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.480 
forward and grab some of these here like
I<00:04:27.330> said<00:04:27.539> I<00:04:27.600> will<00:04:27.810> going<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.260> put<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:28.919> link<00:04:29.190> up<00:04:29.370> on

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
I said I will going to put a link up on

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.580 
I said I will going to put a link up on
to<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.700> site<00:04:30.419> about<00:04:30.690> this<00:04:30.810> but<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.380> give<00:04:31.530> you

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
to the site about this but it's give you

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.980 
to the site about this but it's give you
an<00:04:31.650> idea<00:04:31.800> then<00:04:32.159> this<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.700> claims<00:04:33.240> here<00:04:33.539> you<00:04:33.659> can

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
an idea then this it claims here you can

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.490 
an idea then this it claims here you can
you<00:04:34.230> 1,200<00:04:35.190> flashes<00:04:35.670> from<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.360> 300<00:04:36.930> watt<00:04:37.080> second

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
you 1,200 flashes from a 300 watt second

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.800 
you 1,200 flashes from a 300 watt second
head<00:04:37.680> that's<00:04:37.980> a<00:04:38.250> lot<00:04:38.630> especially<00:04:39.630> if<00:04:39.720> you're

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
head that's a lot especially if you're

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.360 
head that's a lot especially if you're
going<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.020> be<00:04:40.080> using<00:04:40.350> Ally<00:04:40.710> meat<00:04:40.950> from<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.190> day

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
going to be using Ally meat from the day

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.860 
going to be using Ally meat from the day
so<00:04:41.910> you're<00:04:42.000> going<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.150> have<00:04:42.270> keep<00:04:42.630> down<00:04:42.840> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
so you're going to have keep down the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.590 
so you're going to have keep down the
uses<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.010> flash<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.520> minimum<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.570> that

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
uses of the flash to a minimum so that

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.210 
uses of the flash to a minimum so that
you're<00:04:45.780> only<00:04:45.840> goat<00:04:46.140> of<00:04:46.350> your<00:04:46.800> getting<00:04:47.070> your

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
you're only goat of your getting your

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.940 
you're only goat of your getting your
shots<00:04:47.940> bang<00:04:48.420> on<00:04:48.600> exposure<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.260> every<00:04:49.650> single

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
shots bang on exposure so every single

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.140 
shots bang on exposure so every single
bit<00:04:50.100> of<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.250> flash<00:04:50.460> coming<00:04:50.700> out<00:04:50.820> of<00:04:50.880> here<00:04:51.060> is

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
bit of a flash coming out of here is

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.950 
bit of a flash coming out of here is
going<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.330> be<00:04:51.420> one<00:04:51.570> that's<00:04:51.720> going<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.900> be

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
going to be one that's going to be

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.380 
going to be one that's going to be
creating<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.380> picture<00:04:52.710> for<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.700> but<00:04:54.270> to

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
creating a picture for you and but to

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.720 
creating a picture for you and but to
give<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.540> an<00:04:54.660> idea<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.200> said<00:04:56.100> three<00:04:56.460> hundred

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
give you an idea I said three hundred

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.730 
give you an idea I said three hundred
three<00:04:56.880> USB<00:04:57.330> sockets<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.110> can<00:04:58.260> be<00:04:58.350> connected<00:04:58.560> to

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
three USB sockets it can be connected to

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.950 
three USB sockets it can be connected to
an<00:04:58.830> external<00:04:58.890> storage<00:04:59.640> battery<00:05:00.150> supply

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
an external storage battery supply

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.190 
an external storage battery supply
energy<00:05:01.200> for<00:05:01.380> even<00:05:01.680> longer<00:05:02.150> on<00:05:03.150> this<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.690> tons

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
energy for even longer on this this tons

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.630 
energy for even longer on this this tons
tons<00:05:04.560> of<00:05:04.740> stuff<00:05:04.890> on<00:05:05.010> here<00:05:05.130> but<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.280> suppose<00:05:05.490> one

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
tons of stuff on here but I suppose one

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.560 
tons of stuff on here but I suppose one
of<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.790> things<00:05:05.940> people<00:05:06.000> want<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.360> know<00:05:06.450> about

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
of the things people want to know about

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.130 
of the things people want to know about
is<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.020> price<00:05:07.290> this<00:05:07.980> is<00:05:08.780> 669<00:05:09.780> pounds

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
is the price this is 669 pounds

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.250 
is the price this is 669 pounds
including<00:05:10.290> v80<00:05:11.070> now<00:05:11.820> you<00:05:11.880> might<00:05:12.120> go<00:05:12.300> that's<00:05:13.170> a

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
including v80 now you might go that's a

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.140 
including v80 now you might go that's a
lot<00:05:13.410> of<00:05:13.530> money<00:05:13.680> at<00:05:13.890> first<00:05:14.310> but<00:05:14.670> think<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.060> it

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
lot of money at first but think of it

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.390 
lot of money at first but think of it
this<00:05:15.240> way<00:05:15.450> like<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.110> said<00:05:16.320> at<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.470> start<00:05:16.710> you're

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
this way like I said at the start you're

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.840 
this way like I said at the start you're
using<00:05:17.670> your<00:05:18.030> studio<00:05:18.570> flashes<00:05:19.430> outdoors<00:05:20.430> so

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
using your studio flashes outdoors so

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.400 
using your studio flashes outdoors so
you've<00:05:21.000> no<00:05:21.210> longer<00:05:21.570> got<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.810> have<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.020> expense

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
you've no longer got to have the expense

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.500 
you've no longer got to have the expense
of<00:05:22.590> buying<00:05:22.770> extra<00:05:23.100> lighting<00:05:23.670> just<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.330> be<00:05:24.420> on

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
of buying extra lighting just to be on

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.300 
of buying extra lighting just to be on
location<00:05:25.140> with<00:05:25.170> so<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.740> think<00:05:25.800> when<00:05:26.070> you<00:05:26.130> sort

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
location with so I think when you sort

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.010 
location with so I think when you sort
of<00:05:26.340> weight<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.730> that<00:05:26.910> way<00:05:27.120> it<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.750> quite<00:05:27.990> a

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
of weight it that way it is quite a

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.930 
of weight it that way it is quite a
saving<00:05:28.530> but<00:05:29.100> let's<00:05:29.220> just<00:05:29.400> show<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.640> one<00:05:29.910> more

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
saving but let's just show you one more

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.880 
saving but let's just show you one more
thing<00:05:30.150> before<00:05:30.540> we<00:05:30.780> finish<00:05:31.050> wrap<00:05:31.410> up<00:05:31.560> on<00:05:31.710> this

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
thing before we finish wrap up on this

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.700 
thing before we finish wrap up on this
it's<00:05:32.100> just<00:05:32.130> turn<00:05:32.430> this<00:05:32.610> on<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:33.320> it<00:05:34.320> powered<00:05:34.650> up

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
it's just turn this on so it powered up

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.350 
it's just turn this on so it powered up
I'm<00:05:34.890> going<00:05:34.980> to<00:05:35.040> bring<00:05:35.160> this<00:05:35.340> head<00:05:35.640> down<00:05:35.940> just<00:05:36.270> a

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
I'm going to bring this head down just a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.510 
I'm going to bring this head down just a
little<00:05:36.390> bit<00:05:36.600> here<00:05:36.960> now<00:05:37.170> this<00:05:38.010> is<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.250> like<00:05:38.430> I

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
little bit here now this is a like I

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.630 
little bit here now this is a like I
said<00:05:38.550> it's<00:05:38.790> a<00:05:38.850> 600<00:05:39.420> watt<00:05:39.450> per<00:05:39.780> second<00:05:40.170> head

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
said it's a 600 watt per second head

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.980 
said it's a 600 watt per second head
let's<00:05:41.640> just<00:05:41.820> bring<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.150> down<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.750> I'm<00:05:42.870> going

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
let's just bring it down and I'm going

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.190 
let's just bring it down and I'm going
to<00:05:43.020> just<00:05:43.170> put<00:05:43.470> this<00:05:43.710> right<00:05:44.510> up<00:05:45.510> to<00:05:45.960> full<00:05:46.170> power

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
to just put this right up to full power

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.060 
to just put this right up to full power
so<00:05:46.740> let's<00:05:46.890> just<00:05:47.070> take<00:05:47.280> it<00:05:47.310> right<00:05:47.790> at<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.120> top

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
so let's just take it right at the top

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
so let's just take it right at the top
wait<00:05:50.070> for<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.310> beep<00:05:50.340> so<00:05:50.760> that<00:05:50.880> it's<00:05:51.000> always

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
wait for the beep so that it's always

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.900 
wait for the beep so that it's always
recycled<00:05:51.780> so<00:05:52.680> now<00:05:52.830> I'm<00:05:52.890> gonna<00:05:52.980> take<00:05:53.160> off<00:05:53.400> just

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
recycled so now I'm gonna take off just

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.520 
recycled so now I'm gonna take off just
do<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> test<00:05:54.480> flash<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:54.990> you'll<00:05:55.080> hear<00:05:55.230> from<00:05:55.260> the

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
do a test flash and you'll hear from the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.370 
do a test flash and you'll hear from the
beep<00:05:55.800> how<00:05:56.580> quickly<00:05:56.910> it<00:05:57.060> recycles<00:05:57.420> 600<00:05:58.260> watt

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
beep how quickly it recycles 600 watt

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.750 
beep how quickly it recycles 600 watt
seconds<00:06:00.620> fully<00:06:01.620> recharged<00:06:02.070> so<00:06:02.340> you<00:06:02.430> can<00:06:02.550> see

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
seconds fully recharged so you can see

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.340 
seconds fully recharged so you can see
this<00:06:02.910> hardly<00:06:03.150> any<00:06:03.450> delay<00:06:03.870> you're<00:06:04.020> going<00:06:04.170> to<00:06:04.230> be

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
this hardly any delay you're going to be

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.020 
this hardly any delay you're going to be
there<00:06:04.620> so<00:06:05.100> you're<00:06:05.250> not<00:06:05.280> having<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.700> kind<00:06:05.910> of

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
there so you're not having to kind of

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.900 
there so you're not having to kind of
like<00:06:06.210> take<00:06:06.660> a<00:06:06.690> shot<00:06:07.050> count<00:06:07.950> to<00:06:08.130> 5<00:06:08.340> seconds<00:06:08.760> or

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
like take a shot count to 5 seconds or
