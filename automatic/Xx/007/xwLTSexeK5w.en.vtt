00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
pretty easy if you asked me just take

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.410 
pretty easy if you asked me just take
your<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.469> doing<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.160> aim<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> head

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
your time doing it and aim for the head

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.170 
your time doing it and aim for the head
of<00:00:54.570> course<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.710> maybe<00:00:56.489> it'll<00:00:56.699> take<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:57.030> hour

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
of course so maybe it'll take an hour

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
of course so maybe it'll take an hour
maybe<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:57.989> bit<00:00:58.289> longer<00:00:58.440> i<00:00:58.649> don't<00:00:58.920> know

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
maybe a little bit longer i don't know

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.240 
maybe a little bit longer i don't know
depending<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.550> how<00:00:59.609> accurate<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
depending on how accurate you are and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.549 
depending on how accurate you are and
this<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.460> actually<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:03.000> exclusive<00:01:03.719> weapon<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this was actually a exclusive weapon to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.730 
this was actually a exclusive weapon to
dice<00:01:05.519> members<00:01:05.939> only<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.380> why<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
dice members only so that's why it's a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.429 
dice members only so that's why it's a
new<00:01:07.860> weapon<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> us<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:09.060> them<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.600> they

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
new weapon to us and not them and they

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
new weapon to us and not them and they
have<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.860> two<00:01:11.100> other<00:01:11.280> weapons<00:01:11.729> i<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
have like two other weapons i think it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910

is that are exclusive to them which is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
is that are exclusive to them which is

would only be maps and a vehicle or
maybe<00:01:45.570> two<00:01:46.009> because<00:01:47.009> they're<00:01:47.159> also<00:01:47.430> don't<00:01:47.820> add

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
maybe two because they're also don't add

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
that's of course if you play with a

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.680 
that's of course if you play with a
pistol<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.470> lot<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.040> I'm<00:03:13.790> sure<00:03:14.030> people<00:03:14.210> will<00:03:14.480> at

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
pistol a lot so I'm sure people will at

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.300 
pistol a lot so I'm sure people will at
the<00:03:14.810> start<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.530> then<00:03:15.620> it'll<00:03:15.800> drop<00:03:16.070> off

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
the start of it and then it'll drop off

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.030 
the start of it and then it'll drop off
that's<00:03:16.970> what<00:03:17.120> usually<00:03:17.270> happens<00:03:17.750> anyway<00:03:18.080> so

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
that's what usually happens anyway so

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.220 
that's what usually happens anyway so
I'm<00:03:19.460> sure<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.060> pistol<00:03:20.600> will<00:03:20.690> be<00:03:20.810> kind<00:03:21.020> of<00:03:21.050> fun

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
I'm sure the pistol will be kind of fun

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.590 
I'm sure the pistol will be kind of fun
not<00:03:21.440> sure<00:03:21.590> if<00:03:21.710> it<00:03:21.770> will<00:03:21.830> be<00:03:21.890> overpowered<00:03:22.600> maybe

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
not sure if it will be overpowered maybe

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.390 
not sure if it will be overpowered maybe
a<00:03:23.690> little<00:03:23.870> bit<00:03:24.110> maybe<00:03:24.770> not<00:03:25.010> it'll<00:03:25.250> be<00:03:25.370> a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
a little bit maybe not it'll be a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.280 
a little bit maybe not it'll be a
surprise<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:26.180> course<00:03:26.210> since<00:03:26.690> they<00:03:27.050> just

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
surprise of course since they just

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.290 
surprise of course since they just
released<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.460> out<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.670> nowhere<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:29.030> guess

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
released it out of nowhere I guess

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.240 
released it out of nowhere I guess
because<00:03:30.050> I<00:03:30.290> haven't<00:03:30.470> heard<00:03:30.710> a<00:03:30.800> thing<00:03:30.830> about<00:03:31.010> it

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
because I haven't heard a thing about it

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.100 
because I haven't heard a thing about it
and<00:03:32.030> I'll<00:03:32.120> thing<00:03:32.270> anybody<00:03:32.630> else<00:03:32.750> really<00:03:32.930> has

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
and I'll thing anybody else really has

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.770 
and I'll thing anybody else really has
