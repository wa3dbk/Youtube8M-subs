 the Germans and also the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.150

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.830
 Castilians in Santa Fe is the third 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.560
 Most populated city in the province 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.570
 behind the rosary and the capital the name 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.240
 was attributed by the founder in honor of 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.290
 rafael to rodrÃ­guez left maybe 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.840
 popularly it is known as the pearl 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.940
 West Beauty and sustained 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.740
 growth of the city make it 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.990
 stands out among its neighbors especially 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.060
 for its boulevards its buildings and its 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.550
 countless green spaces thought 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.170
 for the recreation of the family the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.209
 layout of the city is a checkerboard 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.130
 with a central square of four apples 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.470
 of extension and four bolivars that 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.510

 its neighbors is not located on a river 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.110
 although it has a strategic location 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.120
 since it is in the corridor of 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.519
 routes that leave the sea its temperate climate 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.590
 its high degree of urbanization and its 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.480
 strategic location make it 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.610
 a must visit of the territory 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:32.980
