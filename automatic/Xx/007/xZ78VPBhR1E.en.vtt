00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
where was before and I went like

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
exploring a whole lot of the land that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.290 
exploring a whole lot of the land that
got<00:00:48.020> lost<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:49.040> took<00:00:49.340> me<00:00:49.370> a<00:00:49.579> while<00:00:49.880> to<00:00:49.940> get

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
got lost and it took me a while to get

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.410 
got lost and it took me a while to get
back<00:00:50.360> here<00:00:51.310> it's<00:00:52.310> it's<00:00:52.640> not<00:00:52.970> pretty<00:00:53.149> late

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
where I am so this probably won't be

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.410 
where I am so this probably won't be
that<00:00:56.180> long<00:00:56.570> of<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:56.870> video<00:00:57.850> but<00:00:58.850> either<00:00:59.180> way

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
that long of a video but either way

so<00:01:17.790> guys<00:01:17.969> I<00:01:18.210> guess<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:20.219> do<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.320> wait

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
so guys I guess what we can do is wait

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.160 
so guys I guess what we can do is wait
out<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.829> night<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> I'll<00:01:24.390> resume<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.899> video

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
not exactly back to day but while I was

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.899 
not exactly back to day but while I was
waiting<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.869> day<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.530> did<00:01:34.950> find<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.460> little

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
waiting for day I did find this little

waiting for day I did find this little
cave<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.829> decided<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.520> should<00:01:38.700> start<00:01:38.939> taping

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
cave and I decided I should start taping

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.730 
cave and I decided I should start taping
because<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.929> think<00:01:39.990> would<00:01:40.319> be<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> lot<00:01:40.710> more

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
