00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
first thing we'll notice about Stefano

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.290 
first thing we'll notice about Stefano
is<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.290> he<00:00:28.439> has<00:00:28.619> taken<00:00:29.070> off<00:00:29.189> anything<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
is that he has taken off anything that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
is that he has taken off anything that
was<00:00:30.419> on<00:00:30.480> his<00:00:30.630> body<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.020> might<00:00:31.169> contain<00:00:31.590> metal

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
was on his body that might contain metal

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.100 
was on his body that might contain metal
so<00:00:32.340> he's<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.579> wearing<00:00:32.970> his<00:00:33.060> watch<00:00:33.329> he's<00:00:33.960> not

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
so he's not wearing his watch he's not

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
so he's not wearing his watch he's not
wearing<00:00:34.320> his<00:00:34.470> belt<00:00:34.800> he's<00:00:35.160> not<00:00:35.340> wearing<00:00:35.610> his

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
wearing his belt he's not wearing his
glasses<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.420> he's<00:00:36.720> also<00:00:36.870> taking<00:00:37.350> his<00:00:37.470> shoes

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
glasses and he's also taking his shoes

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
glasses and he's also taking his shoes
off<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.880> shoes<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.360> contain<00:00:39.750> small

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
off because your shoes can contain small

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.049 
off because your shoes can contain small
bits<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.320> metal<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.739> well<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.730> really

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
bits of metal as well this is really

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
bits of metal as well this is really
important<00:00:42.539> because<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.320> you're<00:00:43.620> wearing<00:00:43.769> any

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
important because if you're wearing any

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.580 
important because if you're wearing any
metal<00:00:44.399> when<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.579> go<00:00:44.820> into<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.570> MiG<00:00:45.960> system<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
metal when you go into the MiG system it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.000 
metal when you go into the MiG system it
won't<00:00:46.800> work<00:00:46.949> properly<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.719> next<00:00:48.899> step<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
won't work properly so the next step is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.369 
won't work properly so the next step is
for<00:00:50.190> us<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.460> attach<00:00:50.730> these<00:00:51.000> five<00:00:51.359> little<00:00:51.839> coils

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
for us to attach these five little coils

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.930 
for us to attach these five little coils
to<00:00:52.739> stefanos<00:00:53.219> forehead

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to stefanos forehead

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.639 
to stefanos forehead
they're<00:00:54.420> very<00:00:54.600> small<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.929> we<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.350> attach

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
they're very small and we just attach

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.590 
they're very small and we just attach
them<00:00:55.859> with<00:00:55.920> tape<00:00:56.280> three<00:00:56.999> of<00:00:57.120> them<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.390> across

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
them with tape three of them go across

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840 
them with tape three of them go across
the<00:00:57.839> top<00:00:58.019> of<00:00:58.140> his<00:00:58.260> forehead<00:00:58.530> there<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.249> one

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the top of his forehead there and one

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.119 
the top of his forehead there and one
behind<00:01:00.390> each<00:01:00.749> ear<00:01:03.050> so<00:01:04.050> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.890> going

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
behind each ear so you can see I'm going

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
behind each ear so you can see I'm going
to<00:01:05.250> stick<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.300> with<00:01:06.450> sticky<00:01:06.810> tape

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
to stick this on just with sticky tape

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
to stick this on just with sticky tape
like<00:01:07.440> that<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.800> it's<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.040> easy<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> take<00:01:08.760> off

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
like that so it's very easy to take off

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.870 
like that so it's very easy to take off
after<00:01:09.570> we're<00:01:09.690> finished<00:01:10.190> okay<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.700> goes

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the first one there we go I'm going to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:28.060 
the first one there we go I'm going to
pop<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> down<00:01:18.840> behind<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.290> ear

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
goggles are an important part of the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.060 
goggles are an important part of the
next<00:01:42.870> step<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:43.200> we're<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.650> do<00:01:43.800> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
next step that we're going to do the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.800 
next step that we're going to do the
other<00:01:44.160> thing<00:01:44.400> we<00:01:44.520> need<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
other thing we need is this which is a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.750 
other thing we need is this which is a
special<00:01:46.290> tool<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.160> to<00:01:47.190> measure<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
special tool that we use to measure the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.760 
special tool that we use to measure the
position<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.390> stefanos<00:01:48.870> head<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> the

position of all those little coils that

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.080 
position of all those little coils that
we've<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.690> stuck<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.460> first<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.820> all<00:01:53.910> I'm
