grommet<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:29.280> fully<00:02:29.580> seated<00:02:29.880> that'll<00:02:30.150> keep<00:02:30.239> up

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
grommet is fully seated that'll keep up

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.540 
grommet is fully seated that'll keep up
water<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.959> dust<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.410> everything<00:02:31.739> looks<00:02:32.430> like

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
water and dust and everything looks like

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.540 
water and dust and everything looks like
I<00:02:32.670> got<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:32.850> real<00:02:33.030> good<00:02:33.150> seal<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.550> simply

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
I got a real good seal and then simply

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.090 
I got a real good seal and then simply
going<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.880> line<00:02:36.060> up<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> holes<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:40.100> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
going to line up the holes and the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.750 
going to line up the holes and the
taillight<00:02:41.430> pushes<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.760> three

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
taillight pushes in just like so three

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.300 
taillight pushes in just like so three
more<00:02:44.940> nuts<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.750> back<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.160> which

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
more nuts on the back a one of which

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.310 
more nuts on the back a one of which
I'll<00:02:47.519> install<00:02:47.940> with<00:02:48.299> an<00:02:48.480> 11<00:02:48.989> millimeter

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
I'll install with an 11 millimeter

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.400 
I'll install with an 11 millimeter
wrench<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.150> other<00:02:51.269> two<00:02:51.600> with<00:02:51.959> an<00:02:52.110> 11

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
wrench and the other two with an 11

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.440 
wrench and the other two with an 11
millimeter<00:02:52.560> deep<00:02:52.950> socket<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:54.060> I'm<00:02:54.299> almost

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
millimeter deep socket and I'm almost

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.060 
millimeter deep socket and I'm almost
done<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.930> last<00:02:55.049> step<00:02:55.350> would<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.680> plug<00:02:55.890> in

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
done the last step would be to plug in

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.740 
done the last step would be to plug in
the<00:02:56.190> electrical<00:02:56.610> connector<00:02:57.000> right<00:02:57.180> here<00:02:57.239> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the electrical connector right here and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.009 
the electrical connector right here and
you<00:02:58.320> literally<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:59.180> line<00:03:00.180> up<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.540> groove

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
you literally just line up the groove

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.620 
you literally just line up the groove
and<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.220> clicks<00:03:02.459> right<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.790> I'll<00:03:03.150> put<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
and it clicks right in I'll put the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.390 
and it clicks right in I'll put the
plastic<00:03:04.200> splash<00:03:04.500> guard<00:03:04.739> back<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.160> trunk

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
plastic splash guard back in the trunk

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.970 
plastic splash guard back in the trunk
and<00:03:05.519> we're<00:03:05.670> all<00:03:05.790> done
