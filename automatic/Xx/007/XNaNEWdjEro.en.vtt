if<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> even<00:01:23.970> pushed<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.509> even<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:25.049> bit

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
if you even pushed out even a little bit

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
if you even pushed out even a little bit
longer<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.220> want<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:26.670> bit

longer if you want to get a little bit

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.630 
longer if you want to get a little bit
risky<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> little<00:01:28.110> bit<00:01:28.290> farther<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.860> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
risky go out a little bit farther and it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819 
risky go out a little bit farther and it
creates<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.150> nice<00:01:30.329> big<00:01:30.570> angle<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
creates a very nice big angle you get a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.280 
creates a very nice big angle you get a
wide<00:01:32.430> variety<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:33.060> different<00:01:33.299> viewing<00:01:33.900> angles

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
wide variety of different viewing angles

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.289 
wide variety of different viewing angles
so<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:35.040> has<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> glare<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.790> always<00:01:36.000> just

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so one has a glare you can always just

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.450 
so one has a glare you can always just
switch<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.770> also<00:01:37.920> fold<00:01:38.340> this

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
switch it up now you can also fold this

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120 
switch it up now you can also fold this
back<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> good<00:01:39.540> typing<00:01:40.409> angle<00:01:40.560> just

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
back and have a good typing angle just

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.969 
back and have a good typing angle just
like<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:43.140> bit<00:01:43.229> bouncy<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
like so is a little bit bouncy when you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.100 
like so is a little bit bouncy when you
type<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.579> sometimes<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.720> go<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
type in sometimes when you go up to the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
type in sometimes when you go up to the
edge<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.560> does<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:46.979> annoying<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.970> is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
edge it does get annoying because it is

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.380 
edge it does get annoying because it is
just<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.259> too<00:01:49.560> bouncy<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:51.240> could

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
just a little bit too bouncy you could

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
just a little bit too bouncy you could
also<00:01:51.540> flip<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.170> over<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> other<00:01:52.680> side<00:01:52.950> if

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
also flip it over to the other side if

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.710 
also flip it over to the other side if
you<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> create<00:01:53.670> another<00:01:54.000> beam<00:01:54.270> angle

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you want to create another beam angle

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.530 
you want to create another beam angle
like<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:56.250> case<00:01:56.460> does<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.729> block<00:01:57.119> any<00:01:57.390> of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
like so this case does not block any of

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.929 
like so this case does not block any of
the<00:01:57.630> ports<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.740> even<00:01:59.100> has<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> cutout<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.880> the

the ports it even has a cutout for the

really protects your iPad even if you

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.580 
really protects your iPad even if you
happen<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:33.180> fold<00:02:33.480> up<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.930> case<00:02:34.139> and<00:02:34.170> you

happen to not fold up the case and you

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.649 
happen to not fold up the case and you
time<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.859> drop<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.489> it's<00:02:36.359> most<00:02:36.569> likely

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
time to drop like this it's most likely

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.059 
time to drop like this it's most likely
that<00:02:36.930> nothing<00:02:37.379> is<00:02:37.469> going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> happen<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:38.010> your

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
that nothing is going to happen to your

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.240 
that nothing is going to happen to your
iPad<00:02:38.549> or<00:02:38.760> your<00:02:38.939> iPad<00:02:39.540> screen<00:02:39.780> which<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.709> what

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
iPad or your iPad screen which is what

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.559 
iPad or your iPad screen which is what
are<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.400> worried<00:02:41.609> about<00:02:41.669> most<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.419> that's

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
are you worried about most and that's

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.849 
are you worried about most and that's
the<00:02:42.659> reason<00:02:42.749> why<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.139> get<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.409> case<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.799> the

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
the reason why you get a case in the

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.800 
the reason why you get a case in the
first<00:02:44.010> place<00:02:44.189> and<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.239> have<00:02:45.419> them<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.719> go

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
first place and if you have them and go

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.470 
first place and if you have them and go
like<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.109> just<00:02:46.319> wrap<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.650> up<00:02:47.090> I'd<00:02:48.090> say

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
like this and just wrap it up I'd say

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.059 
like this and just wrap it up I'd say
absolutely<00:02:48.689> nothing<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.409> happen<00:02:49.620> to

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
absolutely nothing is going to happen to

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.750 
absolutely nothing is going to happen to
your<00:02:50.189> iPad<00:02:50.489> if<00:02:50.669> you<00:02:50.760> turn<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.090> drop<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:52.760> this

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
your iPad if you turn to drop it this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.580 
your iPad if you turn to drop it this
case<00:02:54.000> does<00:02:54.359> have<00:02:54.569> flexibility<00:02:55.139> because<00:02:55.319> it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
case does have flexibility because it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.199 
case does have flexibility because it
does<00:02:56.069> separate<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.609> little<00:02:56.760> bit<00:02:57.000> from<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
does separate a little bit from the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.530 
does separate a little bit from the
leather<00:02:57.510> itself<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.319> both<00:02:58.530> sides<00:02:59.510> but<00:03:00.510> I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
leather itself on both sides but I

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.849 
leather itself on both sides but I
really<00:03:00.900> wish<00:03:01.109> you<00:03:01.319> could<00:03:01.349> take<00:03:01.560> out<00:03:01.680> these

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
really wish you could take out these

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.589 
really wish you could take out these
little<00:03:02.040> pads<00:03:02.340> are<00:03:02.549> here<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.909> connect<00:03:03.269> both

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
little pads are here that connect both

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.119 
little pads are here that connect both
cases<00:03:03.900> together<00:03:04.169> and<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.620> wish<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.889> can<00:03:05.010> use

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
cases together and I wish you can use

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.709 
cases together and I wish you can use
this<00:03:05.250> separately<00:03:05.699> that'd<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.419> pretty<00:03:06.599> cool

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
this separately that'd be pretty cool

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.899 
this separately that'd be pretty cool
because<00:03:07.139> then<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.560> could<00:03:07.709> use<00:03:07.919> the<00:03:08.730> little

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
because then you could use the little

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.459 
because then you could use the little
bad<00:03:09.120> case<00:03:09.419> when<00:03:09.629> you<00:03:09.659> want<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.139> when<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.349> want

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
bad case when you want and when you want

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.080 
bad case when you want and when you want
full<00:03:10.709> protection<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.370> could<00:03:11.519> easily<00:03:11.969> just

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
full protection you could easily just

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.970 
full protection you could easily just
slip<00:03:12.359> it<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.629> but<00:03:13.169> unfortunately<00:03:13.319> these

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
slip it in but unfortunately these

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.890 
slip it in but unfortunately these
little<00:03:14.250> Stoppers<00:03:14.730> are<00:03:14.939> glued<00:03:15.269> down<00:03:15.480> and

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
little Stoppers are glued down and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.319 
little Stoppers are glued down and
unless<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.010> want<00:03:17.159> to<00:03:17.250> break<00:03:17.639> apart<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.030> case

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
unless you want to break apart the case

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.479 
unless you want to break apart the case
and<00:03:18.599> ruin<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.199> you're<00:03:20.069> not<00:03:20.189> going<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.459> able

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
and ruin it you're not going to be able

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.969 
and ruin it you're not going to be able
to<00:03:20.699> use<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.239> function<00:03:21.650> one<00:03:22.650> thing<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.859> point
