look at that is it's a lot of the stuff

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.520 
look at that is it's a lot of the stuff
that<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.299> do<00:01:50.509> have<00:01:50.720> them<00:01:50.840> do<00:01:51.049> is<00:01:51.170> repetitive

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
that we do have them do is repetitive

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.219 
that we do have them do is repetitive
right<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.430> take<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.030> food<00:01:53.329> into<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.780> animals

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
right I take the food into the animals

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.569 
right I take the food into the animals
and<00:01:54.350> I'm<00:01:54.470> giving<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.009> them<00:01:55.159> in<00:01:55.220> different

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
and I'm giving it to them in different

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.330 
and I'm giving it to them in different
areas<00:01:56.470> but<00:01:57.470> that's<00:01:57.680> because<00:01:57.890> it's

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
areas but that's because it's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.429 
areas but that's because it's
repetitiveness<00:01:59.060> they<00:01:59.630> know<00:01:59.840> what<00:02:00.049> I'm<00:02:00.170> there

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
repetitiveness they know what I'm there

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.590 
repetitiveness they know what I'm there
for<00:02:00.770> it's<00:02:01.040> not<00:02:01.220> because<00:02:01.549> I'm<00:02:01.700> roughhousing<00:02:02.119> or

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600
