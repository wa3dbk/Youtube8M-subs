into the groove of this plate here so i

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.069 
into the groove of this plate here so i
definitely<00:01:55.880> recommend<00:01:56.119> at<00:01:56.540> least<00:01:56.570> picking<00:01:57.020> up

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
definitely recommend at least picking up

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.630 
definitely recommend at least picking up
one<00:01:57.259> color<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:58.009> white<00:01:58.159> one<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.460> just

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
one color like the white one is just

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.389 
one color like the white one is just
kind<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.970> universal<00:01:59.570> color<00:01:59.719> so<00:02:00.310> looks<00:02:01.310> like

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
kind of a universal color so looks like

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.880 
kind of a universal color so looks like
that<00:02:01.700> now<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:02.719> take<00:02:02.930> your<00:02:03.140> little<00:02:03.259> scraper
