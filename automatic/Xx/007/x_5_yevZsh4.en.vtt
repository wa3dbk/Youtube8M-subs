00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
today we are learning how to do aerials

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.599 
today we are learning how to do aerials
and<00:00:02.540> back<00:00:03.540> tucks<00:00:04.009> first<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.190> have<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.430> know

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
lefty so this is the curve real and you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.580 
lefty so this is the curve real and you
have<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.509> know<00:00:15.630> how<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> one-handed

you<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.790> go<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.850> hot<00:00:39.030> places<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.750> then<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
you and I go and hot places and then you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.130 
you and I go and hot places and then you
jump<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> circle<00:00:43.200> back<00:00:43.469> backwards<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
jump and do a circle back backwards and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.590 
jump and do a circle back backwards and
kick<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> try<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.820> long<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> can

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.130 
kick and try to go as long as you can
and<00:00:49.940> when<00:00:50.940> you're<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> aerial<00:00:51.690> starting

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and when you're in the aerial starting

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.430 
and when you're in the aerial starting
its<00:00:52.460> don't<00:00:53.460> try<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
its don't try to go like this because it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.660 
its don't try to go like this because it
makes<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> reach<00:00:56.250> towards<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
makes you want to reach towards the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.240 
makes you want to reach towards the
ground<00:00:56.820> try<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> side<00:00:58.410> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
ground try going like on the side so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
ground try going like on the side so
this<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> what<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> looks<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.289> when

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this is kind of what it looks like when

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.700 
this is kind of what it looks like when
you're<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.770> learning

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.440 

but<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:06.950> right<00:01:07.640> at<00:01:07.759> the<00:01:07.909> end<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.119> want<00:01:08.299> to

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
but you right at the end you want to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.880 
but you right at the end you want to
push<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.259> ground<00:01:09.440> because<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:09.740> don't

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
push to the ground because you don't

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.910 
push to the ground because you don't
want<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.100> hurt<00:01:10.369> yourself<00:01:10.600> but<00:01:11.600> try<00:01:12.350> going<00:01:12.710> like

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
want to hurt yourself but try going like

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.070 
want to hurt yourself but try going like
this<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.280> helps<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.670> get<00:01:14.119> in<00:01:14.240> here<00:01:14.270> now

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
this that helps you get in here now

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.649 
this that helps you get in here now
we're<00:01:15.290> on<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.710> aerial<00:01:16.130> stage<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:16.850> can<00:01:17.030> do<00:01:17.479> it

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
we're on the aerial stage you can do it

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.539 
we're on the aerial stage you can do it
on<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.840> map<00:01:18.140> or<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:18.799> on<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.040> grass<00:01:19.220> if<00:01:19.399> you're

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
on a map or just on the grass if you're

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:28.280 
on a map or just on the grass if you're
comfortable<00:01:19.759> doing<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.140> here's<00:01:21.530> my<00:01:21.619> area

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.040 

and<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.190> how<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.730> an<00:01:29.880> aerial<00:01:30.330> now<00:01:30.810> it's

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
and that's how you do an aerial now it's

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.470 
and that's how you do an aerial now it's
time<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.410> back<00:01:31.560> tucks<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.280> couple<00:01:33.270> key<00:01:33.450> things

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
time for back tucks a couple key things

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.030 
time for back tucks a couple key things
you<00:01:33.870> need<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.080> learn<00:01:34.260> about<00:01:34.440> doing<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.860> back

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you need to learn about doing your back

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.100 
you need to learn about doing your back
tuck<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.880> keep<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.150> stomach<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.690> really

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
tuck is to keep your stomach and really

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
tuck is to keep your stomach and really
tight<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> instead<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.880> outward<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
tight and instead of going outward you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.720 
tight and instead of going outward you
want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.870> go<00:01:39.990> upward<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.800> make<00:01:41.160> sure<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> jump

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
want to go upward and make sure you jump

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.630 
want to go upward and make sure you jump
as<00:01:41.850> high<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.660> air<00:01:42.690> as<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.050> can<00:01:43.260> a<00:01:43.640> key

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
as high in the air as you can a key

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
as high in the air as you can a key
thing<00:01:44.880> before<00:01:45.240> doing<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.780> tuck<00:01:46.080> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
thing before doing your back tuck and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.230 
thing before doing your back tuck and
back<00:01:46.770> handspring<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.640> back<00:01:47.790> limber

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
back handspring is your back limber

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.820 
back handspring is your back limber
which<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.290> basically<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:50.550> in<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.910> backbend

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
which is basically going in a backbend

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.140 
which is basically going in a backbend
but<00:01:52.830> instead<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.190> kicking<00:01:53.340> off<00:01:53.580> with<00:01:53.729> one<00:01:53.940> feet

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
but instead of kicking off with one feet

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.940 
but instead of kicking off with one feet
like<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> back<00:01:54.960> walkover<00:01:55.200> kick<00:01:55.770> off

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
like you do for a back walkover kick off

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.700 
like you do for a back walkover kick off
the<00:01:56.130> both<00:01:56.400> feet<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.240> her<00:01:57.710> about

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the both feet like you do her about

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.060 
the both feet like you do her about
cancer<00:01:59.570> now<00:02:00.570> once<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.200> your<00:02:01.410> fastback

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
cancer now once you do your fastback

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.980 
cancer now once you do your fastback
lumber<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.119> keep<00:02:03.360> piecing<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.840> together
