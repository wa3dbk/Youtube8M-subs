00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
said you you were on the right path

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.350 
said you you were on the right path
right<00:02:02.640> track<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.659> here's<00:02:04.380> something<00:02:04.799> you

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
right track but here's something you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.210 
right track but here's something you
didn't<00:02:06.360> understand<00:02:07.049> when<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> pressure<00:02:07.890> wash

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
didn't understand when you pressure wash

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.059 
didn't understand when you pressure wash
it<00:02:08.459> pressure<00:02:09.030> wash<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.390> stucco<00:02:10.170> very<00:02:10.770> well

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
it pressure wash the stucco very well

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.430 
it pressure wash the stucco very well
pressure<00:02:11.610> wash<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.480> where<00:02:12.629> it's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
pressure wash it so where it's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.590 
pressure wash it so where it's
looks<00:02:13.710> brand-new<00:02:14.130> pressure-wash<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.270> stairs

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
looks brand-new pressure-wash the stairs

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.630 
looks brand-new pressure-wash the stairs
and<00:02:15.870> pressure<00:02:16.080> watch<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:17.280> once<00:02:17.520> you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and pressure watch this then once you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.820 
and pressure watch this then once you
pressure<00:02:17.940> wash<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.480> then<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.590> back

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
pressure wash that then you can go back

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.610 
pressure wash that then you can go back
with<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.280> great<00:02:20.610> stuff<00:02:21.060> fill<00:02:21.990> all<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.410> up

going to look like a mushroom what you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.960 
going to look like a mushroom what you
do<00:02:27.210> then<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:28.050> take<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> trial<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.730> take<00:02:29.940> a

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
do then you take a trial you take a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.970 
do then you take a trial you take a
child<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.480> cut<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.190> here<00:02:33.020> here<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
child and you cut it here here on the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.930 
child and you cut it here here on the
sides<00:02:35.540> cut<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.100> get<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.310> mushroom

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
sides cut it and you get that mushroom

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.260 
sides cut it and you get that mushroom
effect<00:02:39.600> off<00:02:39.840> now<00:02:40.170> it's<00:02:40.410> sealed<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.970> stuff

watertight<00:02:49.650> whatever<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> can't<00:02:50.580> see

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
watertight whatever there I can't see

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.830 
watertight whatever there I can't see
what's<00:02:50.970> there<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.300> don't<00:02:51.420> know<00:02:51.570> if<00:02:51.660> there's

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
what's there I don't know if there's

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.440 
what's there I don't know if there's
wood<00:02:52.020> rot<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.530> assume<00:02:53.040> there<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.460> but<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.420> looks

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
wood rot I assume there is but it looks

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.200 
wood rot I assume there is but it looks
like<00:02:54.690> solid<00:02:55.140> concrete<00:02:55.590> also<00:02:55.830> could<00:02:56.790> be<00:02:56.910> put<00:02:57.090> on

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
like solid concrete also could be put on

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.940 
like solid concrete also could be put on
a<00:02:57.450> piece<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.720> flat<00:02:58.050> wood<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.410> they<00:02:58.470> formed<00:02:58.800> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
a piece of flat wood and they formed it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.640 
a piece of flat wood and they formed it
anyway<00:02:59.640> go<00:03:00.330> as<00:03:00.480> thick<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.990> can<00:03:01.020> with<00:03:01.470> this

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
anyway go as thick as you can with this

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.890 
anyway go as thick as you can with this
then<00:03:01.950> cut<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.250> all<00:03:02.400> off<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.330> here's<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.750> last

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
then cut it all off and here's the last

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.250 
then cut it all off and here's the last
tip<00:03:04.260> guys<00:03:04.580> go<00:03:05.580> with<00:03:05.730> an<00:03:05.850> acrylic<00:03:06.210> product<00:03:07.020> say

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
tip guys go with an acrylic product say

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.750 
tip guys go with an acrylic product say
like<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.770> mean<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.490> BMI<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.750> use

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
like I mean this is BMI you can use

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.730 
like I mean this is BMI you can use
stucco<00:03:11.760> flex<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.570> use<00:03:12.690> Carson's

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
stucco flex you can use Carson's

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.170 
stucco flex you can use Carson's
Stowe<00:03:14.750> drive<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:16.130> perixx<00:03:17.130> there's<00:03:17.490> so<00:03:17.850> many

Stowe drive it perixx there's so many

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.590 
Stowe drive it perixx there's so many
different<00:03:18.720> types<00:03:18.960> of<00:03:19.260> acrylics<00:03:19.740> so<00:03:20.390> okay<00:03:21.390> once

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
different types of acrylics so okay once

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600 
different types of acrylics so okay once
you've<00:03:21.810> cleaned<00:03:22.260> all<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.500> off<00:03:22.800> then<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.340> use

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
you've cleaned all that off then you use

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.860 
you've cleaned all that off then you use
one<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.850> these<00:03:24.000> products<00:03:24.540> there<00:03:24.690> use<00:03:24.840> a

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
one of these products there use a

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.740 
one of these products there use a
Hawking<00:03:25.260> trial<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:26.280> spread<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:26.790> spread<00:03:27.630> it

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
Hawking trial you spread this spread it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.710 
Hawking trial you spread this spread it
here<00:03:27.780> shred<00:03:28.710> it<00:03:28.860> here<00:03:29.160> spread<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.940> here<00:03:29.970> read

here shred it here spread it here read

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.130 
here shred it here spread it here read
it<00:03:30.750> here<00:03:31.170> then<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.950> take<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.130> float<00:03:32.460> now<00:03:33.360> with

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
it here then you take a float now with

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.560 
it here then you take a float now with
the<00:03:34.260> float<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.700> does<00:03:35.910> take<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.180> bit<00:03:36.300> of

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
the float and this does take a bit of

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.960 
the float and this does take a bit of
practice<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.860> feather<00:03:38.280> everything<00:03:38.820> in

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
practice you just feather everything in

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.240 
practice you just feather everything in
right<00:03:39.690> here<00:03:39.960> where<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.230> wall<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.920> feather

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
right here where the wall is you feather

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.790 
right here where the wall is you feather
that<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.640> feather<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.300> in<00:03:42.420> feather<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.530> and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
that in feather it in feather it in and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.240 
that in feather it in feather it in and
that<00:03:44.280> will<00:03:44.459> give<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> fix<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.720> about

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
that will give you a fix of about

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.760 
that will give you a fix of about
