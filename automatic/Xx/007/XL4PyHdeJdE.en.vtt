00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.429
 and his name is perseus per assist ten 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.670
 week old is a hangover of the breed 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.160
 Scottish fold and is my hangover 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.660
 we have the last week of breeders 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
 I'm picked up from bremen 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.170
 super happy already in the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.150
 cuddly hour we had there I have 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.359
 totally in love with this character 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.699
 i am the clique and so cute and he 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.849
 a general is such a cute little one 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.719
 Very soft coat, I am absolutely 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.120
 fascinated by this hangover I have one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.980
 for half a year with my husband 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 argued talk wailing complained 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.760
 and what i did so i got one 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.770
 cat get behind me then 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.360
 many cats have been racing and being there 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.030
 this little guy came out 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.850
 He now determines our daily routine 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 powerful so everything is pretty much over that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.719
 I would not have thrown any heaps 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.520
 thought that's going on that morning 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.890
 gets up and actually we are then 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.020
 daily storm make only our first 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.180
 The thing is now completely flat 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.339
 because if I'm going to get up now 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 I first tell the cat what to eat then 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.210
 I go with him to the litter box because that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.070
 currently only works if you sit there 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.320
 and therefore still looks pretty small 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 and that became pretty big and that he was 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.770
 a little bit anxious then ours 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.110
 sleep is completely disturbed sleeping 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.850
 the piece is not so there all three 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.490
 until four hours of the watch but 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.409
 cobbler or schnorr there or puts in 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.860
 the face off or not at all 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.860
 in the bed is allowed 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.950
 all a bit with us in the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.289
 Habituation phase and I wanted you 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.670
 just officially this hangover 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.289
 Now imagine that probably 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.659
 more videos soon sets of them 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.280

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.890

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.159

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.390
