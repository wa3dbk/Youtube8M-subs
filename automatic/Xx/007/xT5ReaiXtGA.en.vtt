00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the fact that it's we made out of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.139 
the fact that it's we made out of
plastic<00:01:47.070> versus<00:01:47.460> real<00:01:47.610> leather<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
plastic versus real leather because it
