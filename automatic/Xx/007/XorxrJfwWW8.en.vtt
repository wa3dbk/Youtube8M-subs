got big three inch pipes and I heard a
sound<00:00:28.410> clip<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:31.340> YouTube<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.700> sounded<00:00:33.030> ok

sound clip on YouTube and it sounded ok

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.790 
sound clip on YouTube and it sounded ok
it's<00:00:33.540> kind<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> hard<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.020> tell<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.469> it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it's kind of hard to tell on that it

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.440 
it's kind of hard to tell on that it
sounded<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.160> little<00:00:35.280> little<00:00:35.760> raspy<00:00:36.000> er<00:00:36.239> than

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
sounded a little little raspy er than

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.340 
sounded a little little raspy er than
stock<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.059> installed<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:40.230> was

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
stock but so I installed it that was

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.380 
stock but so I installed it that was
very<00:00:41.160> unhappy<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.719> booming

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
very unhappy with it it is a booming

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
very unhappy with it it is a booming
very<00:00:45.390> loud<00:00:45.629> exhaust<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.219> started<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
very loud exhaust it just started to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.430 
very loud exhaust it just started to
drive<00:00:48.210> me<00:00:48.360> nuts<00:00:48.390> especially<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> highway

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
drive me nuts especially on the highway

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.130 
drive me nuts especially on the highway
just<00:00:52.440> wasn't<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:52.920> sound<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.870> called<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
just wasn't a good sound I called and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.979 
just wasn't a good sound I called and
complained<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.539> flowmaster<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.750> sent

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
complained to flowmaster and they sent

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.410 
complained to flowmaster and they sent
me<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.530> resonator<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> guy<00:01:00.030> said<00:01:00.270> this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
me a a resonator and the guy said this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.270 
me a a resonator and the guy said this
should<00:01:01.579> clean<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> sound<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
should clean up the sound a bit the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.590 
should clean up the sound a bit the
problem<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.880> resonator<00:01:06.360> was

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
problem was is that the resonator was

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620 
problem was is that the resonator was
too<00:01:06.780> big<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.200> fit<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> mid<00:01:07.920> pipe<00:01:08.420> was<00:01:09.420> too

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
too big to fit in the mid pipe was too

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.050 
too big to fit in the mid pipe was too
long<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:13.580> went<00:01:14.580> around<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.970> eBay<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:17.060> bought

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
long so I went around on eBay I bought

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
long so I went around on eBay I bought
the<00:01:18.240> stainless<00:01:18.869> steel<00:01:19.170> short<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.100> was

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the stainless steel short one that was

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.499 
the stainless steel short one that was
about<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> only<00:01:20.580> thing<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.909> could<00:01:20.970> fit<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
about the only thing I could fit in that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.649 
about the only thing I could fit in that
pipe<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:25.250> toned<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:27.000> ever<00:01:27.390> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
pipe and it toned it down just ever so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.260 
pipe and it toned it down just ever so
slightly<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:28.229> still<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.799> very<00:01:29.270> disappointed

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
slightly I still was very disappointed

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260 
slightly I still was very disappointed
with<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> sound<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.460> this<00:01:32.460> spring<00:01:32.729> half<00:01:33.119> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
with the sound and this spring half of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.120 
with the sound and this spring half of
the<00:01:33.329> winter<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.380> ready<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> tear<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the winter I was about ready to tear the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.390 
the winter I was about ready to tear the
exhaust<00:01:35.490> off<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.600> an<00:01:36.720> OEM<00:01:37.400> exhaust

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
exhaust off and go with an OEM exhaust

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.679 
exhaust off and go with an OEM exhaust
but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> took<00:01:39.030> another<00:01:39.270> look<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
but I took another look at the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.609 
but I took another look at the
flowmaster<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:41.150> by<00:01:42.150> cutting<00:01:42.630> sections<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
flowmaster and by cutting sections of

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.399 
flowmaster and by cutting sections of
pipe<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.790> way<00:01:44.909> basically<00:01:45.509> back<00:01:45.810> taking

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
pipe all the way basically back taking

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.560 
pipe all the way basically back taking
what<00:01:47.280> real<00:01:47.430> estate<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> could<00:01:48.090> straight<00:01:48.360> pipe

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
what real estate I could straight pipe

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
what real estate I could straight pipe
real<00:01:48.780> estate<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
real estate out of the out of the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.719 
real estate out of the out of the
exhaust<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.329> it'll<00:01:51.630> fit<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.700> mainly<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
exhaust as it'll fit it in mainly I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
exhaust as it'll fit it in mainly I
ended<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.090> cutting<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.020> tailpipe<00:01:55.470> quite<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
ended up cutting the tailpipe quite a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.760 
ended up cutting the tailpipe quite a
bit<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:57.570> know<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.810> hard<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.229> there<00:01:58.469> in

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
bit you know it's hard to see there in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.149 
bit you know it's hard to see there in
order<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.280> this<00:02:00.380> resonator<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.649> let<00:02:01.950> me<00:02:01.979> go

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
order to get this resonator in let me go

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.350 
order to get this resonator in let me go
down

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.510 

you<00:02:06.020> can<00:02:06.170> see<00:02:06.410> his<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.920> resonator<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.399> was

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
you can see his the resonator and I was

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.870 
you can see his the resonator and I was
just<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:11.270> know<00:02:11.300> by<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:12.140> offset<00:02:12.620> here<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:12.980> cut

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
just you know by this offset here I cut

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.520 
just you know by this offset here I cut
whatever<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.450> could<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.840> probably<00:02:15.200> took<00:02:15.410> a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
whatever I could I probably took a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.510 
whatever I could I probably took a
little<00:02:15.680> bit<00:02:15.890> too<00:02:16.130> much<00:02:16.340> off<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.310> took<00:02:19.310> what

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
little bit too much off but I took what

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.370 
little bit too much off but I took what
I<00:02:19.550> could<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:22.130> get<00:02:22.280> at<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.870> get<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.140> thing

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
I could to get at the to get this thing
