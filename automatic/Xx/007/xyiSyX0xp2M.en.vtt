00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.460
 hello everyone today I would like to share 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.890
 with you an application that is 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.960
 quite interesting good more than 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.830
 application it is a module for the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.439
 installer exposed and this module is going 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.710
 to allow to have open more than 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.480
 one window at a time in the same in the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.309
 Same terminal screen 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.830
 then as I said it is necessary 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.900
 have the installer xbox that is to say 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.510
 it is necessary to have the rooted 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.449
 terminal then from the installer 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.540
 exposed what you can do is go to the 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:49.030
 download section and here then 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.089
 we simply give it to look for the name 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.729
 of this module is x multi windows 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:59.549
 then for example if you simply 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.549
 you write multi windows 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.600
 and we give it to look for since you no longer 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.470
 would appear here then just what 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.630
 we selected and we should give 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.369
 download once downloaded 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.490
 we would simply go to the section of 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.570
 modules and activate it and both so that 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.299
 work once activated what needs to be 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.740
 do is restart the terminal and in this 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.479
 case when I have it installed already 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.079
 I'm started so I'm going to teach you 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.899
 how to activate it and how to configure 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:35.289
 then once restarted you can already 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:39.380
 execute it we just select it 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.460
 and here the configuration is very simple 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.670
 we just give it to the side bar settings 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.290
 we can increase the thickness of the bar 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.909
 the bar will appear here in the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.159
 side and it will show us all the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.040
 applications that we have preset 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.330
 to use with this application and 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.740
 these applications as we can 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.899
 determine here where you put app settings 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.939
 here we can go selecting the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.040
 applications that we want to show 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.799
 in the bar to share the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.539
 screen I for example added these 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.150
 but well we just give you the button 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.819
 of at and we can go selecting in the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.530
 that interests us but good for this 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.930
 proof I'm going to stay with these and 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.610
 then just once 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.970
 selected we have to give open 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.340
 side back 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.110
 then well we will not give change what 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.420
 The only thing that must be done is to move the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.810
 lateral from left to right then 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.970
 we simply move and see that we 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.160
 the bar appears with two applications 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.740
 that we have determined previously 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.910
 so, for example, I want to open the 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.860
 chrome I make good skewer on the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.570
 icon and it gives us two options a 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.070
 show it on the top or 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.100
 lower for example we give the party 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.230
 higher 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.050
 and here we see what for example 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.030
 I want to open the play store or the 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.120
 browser file word play store and you 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.489
 I give to the bottom 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.049
 then we see that we already moves us 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.780
 show the two screens at the same 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.599
 time if we want to hide the bar then 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.849
 we do the same 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.090
 we move forgiveness we move on the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.340
 Same direction from left to right 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.069
 and we see that he hides it and here because 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.220
 we have the two windows showing us 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.800
 the applications that we want at the same 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.840
 weather 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.200
 and then again if we want 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.450
 change it we move we appear in the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.430
 selection menu we select the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.530
 application that we want and we send it 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.950
 then to the part of the screen that 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.950
 we want 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.629
 and good 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.140
 when we get tired we simply give 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.180
 here and we would close the application 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.129
 then as you see it is very easy to 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.950
 use remember that it is necessary to have 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:57.150
 rooted the phone I installed the 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.370
 installer exposed and the truth then it is 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.920
 an application that is still in 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.900
 I develop an early phase but then 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.879
 so far the tests that I have done is 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.670
 quite functional although I suppose 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.830
 will continue to improve I know eventually nothing 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.540
 that's it if you liked the video 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.579
 as always do not forget to hit the like and 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.079
 do not forget to subscribe too many 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.079
 thank you for your time a greeting
