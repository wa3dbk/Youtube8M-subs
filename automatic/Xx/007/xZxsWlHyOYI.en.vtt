00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
to record things that are wrong that I'm

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.610 
to record things that are wrong that I'm
recording<00:00:03.510> what's<00:00:03.810> wrong<00:00:03.990> with<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.290> knitting

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
recording what's wrong with the knitting

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.860

machine<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:05.009> ordered<00:00:05.430> first<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.450> all<00:00:06.569> what<00:00:06.839> I

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
machine I ordered first of all what I

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.720 
machine I ordered first of all what I
notice<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.560> try<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.830> put<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.160> carriage<00:00:08.519> on

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
notice is I try to put the carriage on

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.839 
notice is I try to put the carriage on
and<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.750> hits<00:00:10.320> into<00:00:10.650> something<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.429> which<00:00:11.670> I

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
and it hits into something on which I

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.650 
and it hits into something on which I
saw<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.480> right<00:00:12.840> here<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.920> lip<00:00:14.480> should<00:00:15.480> be

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
saw that right here this lip should be

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.900 
saw that right here this lip should be
inside<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> case<00:00:16.740> which<00:00:17.160> meant<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.490> someone

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
inside the case which meant that someone

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.090 
inside the case which meant that someone
pried<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.420> case<00:00:18.630> open<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.289> did<00:00:19.470> not<00:00:19.619> put<00:00:19.949> it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
pried the case open and did not put it

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.599 
pried the case open and did not put it
back<00:00:20.310> properly<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:22.320> go<00:00:22.529> over<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.220> here

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
back properly then we go over to here

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.599 
back properly then we go over to here
which<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.449> photo<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.189> reason<00:00:26.519> I

which was in the photo and the reason I

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.339 
which was in the photo and the reason I
ordered<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> machine<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.109> looked

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
ordered the machine is that it looked

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.620 
ordered the machine is that it looked
pristine<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.279> clean<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> photo<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.510> I'll

this should be straight look at how

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.250 
this should be straight look at how
quick<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:56.059> it's<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.780> after<00:00:58.230> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
quick it is it's and this is after I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.610 
quick it is it's and this is after I
tried<00:00:58.680> bending<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.579> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.050> longer

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
tried bending it back this is the longer

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.590 
tried bending it back this is the longer
comb<00:01:03.049> which<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.290> even<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:04.860> crooked<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> it's

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
comb which is even more crooked and it's

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.410 
comb which is even more crooked and it's
also<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.070> full<00:01:08.340> length<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> machine

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
also not the full length of the machine

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
also not the full length of the machine
look<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.260> notches<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
look at the little notches there it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
look at the little notches there it
doesn't<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.360> full<00:01:12.659> length<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
doesn't go the full length of the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.590 
doesn't go the full length of the
machine<00:01:13.770> which<00:01:14.070> means<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.790> can't<00:01:15.210> knit

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
machine which means that I can't knit

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.690 
machine which means that I can't knit
the<00:01:15.960> full<00:01:16.200> length<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> machine<00:01:17.189> without

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the full length of the machine without

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.480 
the full length of the machine without
the<00:01:18.030> proper<00:01:18.420> equipment<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.200> also<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:20.040> four

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.880 
let's do it now as you can see there's
big<00:02:18.670> gaps<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.990> pattern<00:02:20.500> where

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
big gaps in the pattern where

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.010 
big gaps in the pattern where
something's<00:02:21.880> wrong<00:02:22.090> with<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.420> timing<00:02:22.840> belt

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
something's wrong with the timing belt

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.470 
something's wrong with the timing belt
or<00:02:23.260> something<00:02:23.500> but<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.640> pattern<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.240> not

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
or something but the pattern is not

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.230 
or something but the pattern is not

this latch is not broken things were

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.390 
this latch is not broken things were
floating<00:03:19.269> around<00:03:19.390> this<00:03:20.290> time<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:21.070> machine

floating around this time the machine

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.170 
floating around this time the machine
was<00:03:21.610> pract

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
was pract

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.020 
was pract
very<00:03:22.570> nicely<00:03:22.959> properly<00:03:23.920> in<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.280> good<00:03:24.489> box<00:03:24.760> with

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
very nicely properly in a good box with

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
a lot of packing material but obviously

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.009 
a lot of packing material but obviously
previous<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:30.100> shipping<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.060> me<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.780> had

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
previous to shipping it to me it had

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.530 
previous to shipping it to me it had
gotten<00:03:32.290> damaged<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:34.060> had<00:03:34.299> not<00:03:34.480> been

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
gotten damaged and it had not been

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.199 
gotten damaged and it had not been
checked<00:03:35.170> because<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:36.250> punch<00:03:36.489> card<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:36.940> one<00:03:37.090> of

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
checked because the punch card is one of

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.479 
checked because the punch card is one of
the<00:03:37.299> basic<00:03:37.840> basic<00:03:38.350> things<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.010> machine

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
the basic basic things of this machine

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.380 
the basic basic things of this machine
so<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.570> in<00:03:41.019> fact<00:03:41.049> broken<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:41.920> am<00:03:42.060> shipping<00:03:43.060> it

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
so it is in fact broken I am shipping it

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.590 
so it is in fact broken I am shipping it
back<00:03:43.600> I<00:03:43.959> firmly<00:03:44.650> believe<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.940> dealer<00:03:46.390> is

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
back I firmly believe that the dealer is

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.569 
back I firmly believe that the dealer is
responsible<00:03:47.350> for<00:03:47.380> shipping<00:03:47.769> me<00:03:48.070> a<00:03:48.100> broken

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
responsible for shipping me a broken

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.660 
responsible for shipping me a broken
machine<00:03:48.760> when<00:03:49.180> he<00:03:49.360> claimed<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.350> was<00:03:50.670> in

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
machine when he claimed it was in

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.220 
machine when he claimed it was in
working<00:03:52.150> condition<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.870> came<00:03:53.049> with<00:03:53.200> a

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
working condition and came with a

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.289 
working condition and came with a
guarantee<00:03:53.829> which<00:03:54.100> did<00:03:54.370> not<00:03:54.610> come<00:03:54.970> with<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
guarantee which did not come with the

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.020 
guarantee which did not come with the
machine<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:56.290> it's<00:03:56.530> completely<00:03:57.030> completely

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
machine so it's completely completely

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.930 
machine so it's completely completely
false<00:03:58.299> information<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.380> sale<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:00.040> that

false information on the sale and that

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.360 
false information on the sale and that
is<00:04:01.299> why<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.540> am<00:04:02.079> trying<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.650> send<00:04:02.860> it<00:04:02.950> back<00:04:03.130> in

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
is why I am trying to send it back in

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.610 
is why I am trying to send it back in
trying<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.790> get<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:04.120> replacement<00:04:04.660> machine<00:04:05.350> and
