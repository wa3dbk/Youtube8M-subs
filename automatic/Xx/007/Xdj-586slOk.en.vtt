 the psd good the first thing we're going to 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.790
 to do is move the plane folder that is 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.840
 inside the ball to be dictated to the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.510
 psoe dip balls folder

 Y 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.160
 which is in valls and if they have the ball 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.870
 plan to replace it and ready if you do not 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.870
 have they have to add it to the map 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.840
 note the plane ball comes by default in 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.690
 the deep weight and it's a white ball yo 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.730
 I put the ball files of the 2014 Pes 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.950
 inside the plane folder for 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.350
 replace it and not have to modify the 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.750
 mac balls so to choose the 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.390

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:23.300
