only<00:00:32.520> major<00:00:32.700> benefit<00:00:33.090> gained<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
only major benefit gained from it is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.880

that<00:00:33.780> while<00:00:33.930> leaning<00:00:34.079> over<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.649> get<00:00:34.829> an

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that while leaning over you do get an

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
that while leaning over you do get an
accuracy<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> weapons<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.420> it's

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
accuracy of this with a weapons so it's

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.940 
accuracy of this with a weapons so it's
actually<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.020> offensive<00:00:37.590> strategy

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
actually more of an offensive strategy

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
actually more of an offensive strategy
than<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> defensive<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.300> only<00:00:39.450> other

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
than it is a defensive one my only other

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.790 
than it is a defensive one my only other
complaint<00:00:39.719> about<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> game<00:00:40.320> system<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
complaint about the game system is a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.900 
complaint about the game system is a
minor<00:00:41.010> one<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.430> that's<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:41.790> you're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
minor one and that's that when you're

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.490 
minor one and that's that when you're
resurrected<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.690> really<00:00:43.020> disorienting

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
resurrected it's really disorienting

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.830 
resurrected it's really disorienting
your<00:00:44.129> character<00:00:44.430> gets<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.879> turns<00:00:45.270> around<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
your character gets up turns around and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.000 
your character gets up turns around and
sometimes<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> doesn't<00:00:46.320> seem<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.920> were

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
sometimes it doesn't seem like you were

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.680 
sometimes it doesn't seem like you were
facing<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> direction<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.700> were<00:00:47.760> before<00:00:47.940> so

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
facing the direction you were before so

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.790 
facing the direction you were before so
you<00:00:48.750> lose<00:00:48.899> track<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> where<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.469> enemies<00:00:49.770> are

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
