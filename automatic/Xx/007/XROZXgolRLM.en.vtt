00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:17.420
 the magnetic resonance stimulation with the 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.760
 vita leiferde are at the 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.560
 Magnetic resonance stimulation supported 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.630
 a magnetic field the cells of the body 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.100
 in the activation of the vital 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.230
 basic functions man consists of 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.599
 about 70 million such cells 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.219
 each of them is a small power plant 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.360
 that provides us with energy 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.670
 responsible for the energy supply 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.600
 the mitochondria are, so to speak 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.609
 represent the powerhouses of the cell 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.980
 so that they can generate energy 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.440
 nutrients and vital substances as well as oxygen in 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.260
 enter the cell and waste products 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.510
 can exit for the work 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.729
 this cell metabolism are in addition to the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.139
 natural earth magnetic field too 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.899
 body's own magnetic fields 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:04.760
 co-responsible are these weakened 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.020
 The metabolism of the cells can not do any more 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.020
 work optimally 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.330
 The body loses energy 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.090
 special magnetic resonance stimulation with 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.280
 on the other hand , it strengthens the vita life r system 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.290
 the cell metabolism and increases with it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.290
 the general vitality of the body 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.520
 the basic effect is 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.500
 always the same 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 By activating the metabolism 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.450
 Become different body functions like 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.490
 For example, improves blood circulation 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.880
 The body can become faster 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.880
 regenerate 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.870
 a weakened cell metabolism leads 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.900
 in the capillary walls of the blood vessels 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.690
 to a strong storage of water 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.020
 they torment and the blood can only 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.340
 still slowly clumping through it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.740
 the blood cells 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.410
 it comes to the so-called money roll 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.180
 phenomenon 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.250
 Clumped blood cells may be less 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.410
 absorb oxygen and thus also 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.580
 less of it to the organs and ins 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.580
 transport tissue 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.020
 a special pulsating magnetic field like 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.120
 is the vita life r system generated 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.350
 improves cell metabolism 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.390
 extends the capillary and 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.800
 allows the blood body more 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.830
 to absorb oxygen 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.930
 The consequence of the whole body is getting better 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.870
 perfused and oxygenated 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.400
 the eu feedback means that data out 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.260
 measured for the body and for the body 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.980
 Control of the program available 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.830
 be made 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.080
 the vita life r system uses these 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.330
 revolutionary technology for the 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.050
 individualization of magnetic resonance 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.489
 stimulation at the vita life bio feedback 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.410
 is mainly the so-called 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.600
 Heart rhythm variance measured 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.610
 because unlike many people believe 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.860
 does not completely beat our heart 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.200
 regularly in a healthy person 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.750
 the pulse rate constantly changes 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.030
 a certain percentage of these 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.709
 Variation in heart rate leaves 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.519
 conclusions about the current state 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 body and the vita control unit 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.230
 life r- systems evaluates the body 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.000
 measured data and sets the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.850
 Result immediately in the dosage of 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.370
 magnetic field so the system reacts 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.160
 always in real time on the current 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.739
 the physical condition of each body 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.030
 application of the vita life r system 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.290
 with the individual 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.230
 needs of the user 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.810
 the aula only with her applies the vita 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.060
 life r -system ancient knowledge from the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.489
 traditional Chinese medicine to 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.100
 China has been around for centuries 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.109
 found out that every organ of the 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.549
 Body for about two hours a day 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.100
 is particularly active 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.739
 so has the lungs of three to five 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.400
 In the morning, your active phase is the kidney 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.100
 from 17 to 19 o'clock by an innovative 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.530
 Technology is the vita life r system 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.180
 this biological daily rhythm in 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.700
 its twelve fully automatic 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.739
 standard programs around that is the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.780
 magnets but stimulation to everyone 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.090
 Daytime optimal on the body 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.620
 also agreed from the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.359
 the natural medicine is known 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.269
 activating effect of colors and 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.280
 Sound on the body over the organ clock 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.710
 vita life has the color and tone 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.200
 stimulation with magnetic resonance 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.570
 stimulation synchronize with light 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.550
 sound and magnetic field go nature and 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.530
 technology an optimal connection to the 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:39.220
 holistic health care 1 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.220
