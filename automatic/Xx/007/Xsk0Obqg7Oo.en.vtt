00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.170
 online and welcome here 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:13.320
 sing 1970 with the benchmark test for 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 ipad iphone 4 and of course the iphone 5 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.920
 So stay tuned, look what's up 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.080
 every case to the end because there 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
 I still have an interesting question 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.539
 just a lot of fun 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.990
 Now it's off color on the left side 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.789
 on there we have the iphone 5 for this 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.590
 net for those who know it very well 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.570
 want 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.460
 the only one with the a6 chip from apple 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.630
 besides we have the iphone 4 with 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.070
 this sketch and last but not least 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.739
 we have the catch here 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.440
 to let that happen 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.789
 the original ipad mitte this set with 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.710
 there too we leave the old a4 chip there 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.570
 the benchmark run after 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.889
 Of course that will take a little while now 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.859
 we run on the left side 

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:13.350
 already the first result on the iphone 5 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:17.219
 an overall score of 1626 floating 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.099
 point is at 2,100 12 access streams 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:28.829
 947 then we have here on the right 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:32.479
 page an overall score of 386 that is 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.479
 of course a massive difference 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:41.639
 and then we have one here at ipad 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:43.829
 total value of 470 I have one 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:45.640
 benchmark fetishists among you have 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.800
 This video like this way so 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.070
 I also like facebook updates 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.380
 or twitter, etc. like to share 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.360
 Also , of course, only nice when in 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.970
 Add this video to the spoiled ones 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.610
 and very important and interesting for 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.470
 me, of course, the comments what 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.850
 do you think of such benchmark test 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.190
 they are not the meaningful ones 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.289
 meaningful 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.810
 Of course, the last question is still to be answered 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.910
 clarify what we will do next a case 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.730
 review an app review or what was there 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.390
 a close-up writes the comments 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.140
 and then first today until then and until 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.140
 clearly see you in the mix video 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.140
 first
