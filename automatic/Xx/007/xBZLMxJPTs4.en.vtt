00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.240
 I am because I did 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.319
 Endo 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.190
 It is a place to explain malignancy irritated 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.990
 I will let you shoot the video that it is good 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.449
 please look 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.990
 I decided basketball 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.159
 Hadano city but 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.159
 Support stereotypes 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.509
 In the city 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.829
 there 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.079
 Come here 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.320
 I called in the form like this 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.450
 Regional Allowance Center is the last in the Center for Saga 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.700
 That's about 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.540
 this 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.540
 There are also people who can get it out 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.200
 There are 10,000 units in popular flash 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.150
 It was in a state of being tempted to have it here 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.030
 And because there was 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.050
 Through something 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350
 But a goal 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.550
 This is smart 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.700
 Will 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 I made a hole in the garage and told me to stuff it 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.730
 When not usually used 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.760
 This is not what this is if you put a lid 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.600
 This is dangerous and not here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 I wonder if it's recent 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.470
 When I'm small, I'm going to leave these too 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 So this is to be with the best chefs 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.930
 It is a feature that the popular water enters before this 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.370
 This is york such as vinyl cover exchange and expectation 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.270
 To do 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.600
 For me 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.810
 It's nice to tell me inside of the anchor's boka here 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.870
 I'm doing 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.160
 Continuous throwing 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.100
 Hey here 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 I'll process it and put a lid on the back 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.070
 This is always always one in my heart 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.430
 It went quite 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.780
 Fixed position 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.540
 I still continued 12 of the current cat that it is considerable 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.560
 But 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.740
 If this is it, I will be a little impressed with Passini 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.330
 there is a possibility 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.769
 Fukuchiyama's rod hole carpenter pointed out 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.139
 Revival 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
 But I want to give 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.749
 Any 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.109
 There are many people using only this 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.359
 This is fine if you don't care 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.359
 It has been pointed out that we will do it recently 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.790
 Drugs I'm satisfied with it here 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.479
 Have installed 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.169

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.709
 Thin skin 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.139
 Recent years 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.139
 People who use 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.629
 If it is this 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.659
 This time primrose British University 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.679
 Because there is little oil residue 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.589
 This is why so many 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.499
 Asian cup 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.449
 Many say by all means
