guess

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.240 
guess
and<00:04:26.760> let<00:04:26.940> there's<00:04:27.300> some<00:04:27.510> more<00:04:27.630> fans<00:04:28.250> right

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
and let there's some more fans right

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.820 
and let there's some more fans right
over<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.770> then<00:04:31.770> we<00:04:32.430> have<00:04:32.700> like<00:04:32.730> some

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
over there and then we have like some

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.770 
over there and then we have like some
length<00:04:34.830> seats<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:35.460> know<00:04:36.090> that's<00:04:36.420> supposed<00:04:36.690> to

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
length seats I know that's supposed to

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.680 
length seats I know that's supposed to
be<00:04:36.810> about<00:04:37.050> but<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.880> guess<00:04:38.880> it<00:04:39.150> doesn't<00:04:39.630> really

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
be about but I guess it doesn't really

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.500 
be about but I guess it doesn't really
