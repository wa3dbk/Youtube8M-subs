 the first novelty is that we have reached 500 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.300
 thousand enrolled on youtube 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.789

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 another novelty is the bench only if you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.740
 perceive the last bench comparing 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.290
 here with more or less that monitor 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.970
 so large in size 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.189
 now it's like this, so we have a 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.080
 very large workbench too large for 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.580

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.590

 Car talk poor so come one 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.799
 first step of this recipe 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.689
 remembering that all the videos are here 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.520
 in the video description on youtube as 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.640
 You already know how it is that our 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.000
 First to make tapioca cubs 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.860
 to do is a utopia of a way to lead 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.090
 the refrigerator to form the cubes is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.750
 We went to wake up and do the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.640
 cubs 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.439
 before visiting how do we 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.670
 Take care our milk is fine 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.159
 hot third 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.840
 we will play is granulated tapioca 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.579
 that it is not that tapioca that you buy 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.189
 the Tuesday market in paper ready 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.259
 who plays in front of him does that too 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.720
 sells on the market but she stands there on the side 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.119
 from the street 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.860
 of wheat near the flour understood me 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.890
 I copied from yoki and I will talk more than you 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.020
 find it is tapioca itapipoca granulate is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.150
 easy to find any market then 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.920
 very hot night we put here 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.020
 graduate tapioca 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.480
 It's very easy, the personal recipe. 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.120
 They will enjoy the cheese 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.370
 I said and careful not you did not speak 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.110
 Your finger because it means I think 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.690
 I understand that, I'll tell you both. 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.510
 then take care that your 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.000
 grated or closed cheese against that 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.910
 cheese curd that comes a little bit knows 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.630
 make it on the fire and then you say it takes away 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.170
 stir and thin here and now salt and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.150
 pepper to taste you put the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.459
 that about a teaspoon you 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.490
 be with reference and then you move 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.080
 You can see that it is about to start getting 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.750
 more to ask is why dinho 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.030
 tapioca will suck all milk this here 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.850
 will form a mass almost a mass 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.470
 cake right and then we will do me 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.540
 I'll play some more here, I'll just 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.200
 to give a fuller better day 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.600
 I like it or be the next step 8 hours 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.390
 I've already moved a lot as it is texture 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.610
 it becomes much more consistent no longer 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.440
 Net is also pity is that we will 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.870
 to make people form one take one 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.570
 glass refractory with is paper 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.680
 film on that transparent paper if you 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.360
 it can not be aluminum foil 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.670
 There is also problem 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.500
 and then you throw all your mixture over 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.540
 Let's take a game over here and 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.360
 Now, let's finish the paper. 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.360
 film above it and not the 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.900
 pressed to make a pressure on the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.940
 her to stay totally 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.890
 leaning against our new club in our 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.980
 club that is not silly yet 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.489
 and then pressing and signing for 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.340
 revealing all the tapioca will stay like this 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.200
 completely level so now it goes 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.970
 take the refrigerator and leave at least 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.010
 three hours in the refrigerator to give a 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.660
 mouth and we can cut the 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.700
 Cubes let's talk the truth 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.280
 I have not left you three years already. 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.389
 I left 40 minutes in the freezer 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.919
 so if you have 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.739
 soon you can also do this on 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.139
 his house he becomes a 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.360
 tapioca is that we will make 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.509
 Now cut squares is the only 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.729
 cutting aspirin here only cuts the 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.659
 and after making the squares 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.039
 It is very easy to do and there it is. 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.539
 that is done after all the 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.699
 their squares and will keep the 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.029
 squares the pieces so that there 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:45.669
 you make fried put the oil until 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:48.039

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.740
 will get unpunished version of the oil and he 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.409
 will stay afloat looks you visit a 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.020
