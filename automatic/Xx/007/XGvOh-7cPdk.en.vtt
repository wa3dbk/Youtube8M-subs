you see which direction to put those I
tried<00:01:17.639> to<00:01:17.759> simplify<00:01:17.969> it<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.509> actually

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
tried to simplify it it's actually

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.330 
tried to simplify it it's actually
pretty<00:01:19.020> easy<00:01:19.109> to<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.560> together<00:01:19.679> and<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> cut

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
pretty easy to put together and it cut

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.550

and<00:01:43.380> then<00:01:43.740> I've<00:01:44.009> assembled<00:01:44.279> the<00:01:44.549> trees

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
and then I've assembled the trees

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.489 
and then I've assembled the trees
already<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.389> just<00:01:45.509> put<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:46.020> tiny<00:01:46.289> bit<00:01:46.469> of

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
already I just put a little tiny bit of

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.370 
already I just put a little tiny bit of
adhesive<00:01:46.679> at<00:01:47.099> the<00:01:47.189> top<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> trunks<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
adhesive at the top of the trunks and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.609 
adhesive at the top of the trunks and
glued<00:01:49.380> them<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> tree<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.359> I<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.469> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
glued them to the tree and I like the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.109 
glued them to the tree and I like the
trunk<00:01:52.799> showing<00:01:53.279> of<00:01:53.520> course<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> could<00:01:53.999> put

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
trunk showing of course you could put

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.519 
trunk showing of course you could put
them<00:01:54.270> behind<00:01:54.359> but<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.749> think<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.319> some

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:55.529 
them behind but I think they had some

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:57.529 
them behind but I think they had some
character<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.819> I'm<00:01:56.969> gonna<00:01:57.149> start<00:01:57.389> by<00:01:57.509> putting

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
character so I'm gonna start by putting

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.289 
character so I'm gonna start by putting
the<00:01:57.810> middle<00:01:58.169> one<00:01:58.349> in<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> place<00:01:59.759> first<00:02:00.209> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the middle one in for a place first the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.589 
the middle one in for a place first the
largest<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.340> again<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:02.999> just<00:02:03.119> gonna<00:02:03.270> put

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
largest one and again I'm just gonna put

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.380 
largest one and again I'm just gonna put
some<00:02:03.899> glue<00:02:04.619> from

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
that right there down and just put that

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.080 
that right there down and just put that
right<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.780> middle<00:02:12.490> or<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.520> can<00:02:13.970> do

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
