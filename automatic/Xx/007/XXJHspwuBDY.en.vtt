00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430

star<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.720> raid<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.710> 40%<00:01:32.070> looking<00:01:32.939> at<00:01:33.060> what

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
star on this raid so 40% looking at what

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.280 
star on this raid so 40% looking at what
else<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.720> do

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
else we can do

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.319 
else we can do
again<00:01:34.860> golems<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.549> wizards<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> bottom

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
again golems and wizards on the bottom

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.670 
again golems and wizards on the bottom
are<00:01:36.450> soaking<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.020> bunch<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.259> buildings<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
are soaking up a bunch of buildings and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.170 
are soaking up a bunch of buildings and
getting<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.009> ton<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> damage<00:01:38.579> done<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
getting a ton of damage done to get this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.140 
getting a ton of damage done to get this
to<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.390> 50%<00:01:39.770> Queen<00:01:40.770> still<00:01:41.040> has<00:01:41.400> her<00:01:41.610> ability

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
to that 50% Queen still has her ability

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
to that 50% Queen still has her ability
on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.570> right-hand<00:01:43.110> side<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> think<00:01:43.829> we

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
on the right-hand side so I think we

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.100 
on the right-hand side so I think we
should<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.640> good<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.299> pop<00:01:45.540> her<00:01:45.659> ability

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
should be good as I pop her ability

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
should be good as I pop her ability
right<00:01:46.259> now<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.310> final<00:01:47.640> couple<00:01:47.820> of

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
right now and the final couple of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.749 
right now and the final couple of
buildings<00:01:48.149> will<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.750> 50%<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.520> again

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
buildings will go down for 50% so again

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.219 
buildings will go down for 50% so again
I<00:01:50.939> only<00:01:51.119> got<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> couple<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.840> percentage<00:01:52.170> points

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I only got a couple of percentage points

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.569 
I only got a couple of percentage points
at<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> beginning<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> Queen

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
at the beginning with the Queen

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730 
at the beginning with the Queen
hopefully<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.840> next<00:01:55.049> raid<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.530> we

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
hopefully on this next raid that I do we

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.100 
hopefully on this next raid that I do we
can<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.430> bit<00:01:56.880> more<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.479> after

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
can get just a little bit more and after

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
can get just a little bit more and after
my<00:01:58.380> golems<00:01:58.710> take<00:01:58.920> down<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.280> Tesla<00:01:59.520> right

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
my golems take down this Tesla right

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.770 
my golems take down this Tesla right
here<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.299> ahead<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.540> end<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
here I'm going to go ahead and end the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.399 
here I'm going to go ahead and end the
battle<00:02:00.930> two<00:02:01.320> stars<00:02:01.880> 54%<00:02:03.049> definitely<00:02:04.049> sloppy

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
battle two stars 54% definitely sloppy

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
battle two stars 54% definitely sloppy
but<00:02:04.770> still<00:02:05.250> was<00:02:05.579> interesting<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
but still was interesting to see the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.999 
but still was interesting to see the
Queen<00:02:06.689> take<00:02:06.930> care<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.229> those<00:02:07.320> first<00:02:07.560> couple<00:02:07.799> of

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
Queen take care of those first couple of

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.380 
Queen take care of those first couple of
buildings<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> very<00:02:08.759> beginning<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
buildings in the very beginning of the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.900 
buildings in the very beginning of the
raid<00:02:09.599> all<00:02:09.869> right<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.200> next<00:02:10.470> base<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.459> this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
raid all right so next base here this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.550 
raid all right so next base here this
one<00:02:12.090> actually<00:02:12.300> looks<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.020> better

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
one actually looks a lot better

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.020 
one actually looks a lot better
so<00:02:13.680> one<00:02:14.010> thing<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.370> want<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.610> do<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:14.940> you're

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so one thing you want to do when you're

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.180 
so one thing you want to do when you're
using<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:15.420> strategy<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.500> find<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.890> part<00:02:17.099> of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
using this strategy is to find a part of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.559 
using this strategy is to find a part of
the<00:02:17.250> base<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.459> isn't<00:02:18.000> really<00:02:18.150> highly

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
the base that isn't really highly

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.970 
the base that isn't really highly
defended<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.170> want<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.380> find<00:02:19.500> something<00:02:19.890> with

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
defended you want to find something with

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.470 
defended you want to find something with
a<00:02:20.010> couple<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.370> archer<00:02:20.670> towers<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> couple<00:02:21.390> of

mortars and for this guy right here he

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.130 
mortars and for this guy right here he
is<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> perfect<00:02:24.090> base<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.480> attack<00:02:24.810> with<00:02:24.989> these

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
is a perfect base to attack with these

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.780 
is a perfect base to attack with these
healers<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.130> I'm<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.310> gonna<00:02:26.430> go<00:02:26.580> ahead<00:02:26.640> and

at 52% right now looks like we got two
stars<00:04:04.530> against<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.040> base<00:04:05.280> we<00:04:05.519> got<00:04:05.639> about<00:04:05.819> 17

I'm<00:04:09.810> definitely<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.230> noob<00:04:10.440> at<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.709> strategy

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
I'm definitely a noob at this strategy

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.620 
I'm definitely a noob at this strategy
I've<00:04:11.310> seen<00:04:11.519> some<00:04:11.730> people<00:04:11.850> get<00:04:12.150> 3<00:04:12.389> stars

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
I've seen some people get 3 stars

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.629 
I've seen some people get 3 stars
against<00:04:12.930> maxed<00:04:13.260> out<00:04:13.350> bases<00:04:13.769> which<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.130> insane

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
against maxed out bases which is insane

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.979 
against maxed out bases which is insane
but<00:04:14.850> I'm<00:04:14.940> gonna<00:04:15.030> try<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.329> out<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.510> little<00:04:15.870> bit

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
but I'm gonna try it out a little bit

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.229 
but I'm gonna try it out a little bit
more<00:04:16.289> and<00:04:16.530> try<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.340> watch<00:04:17.549> some<00:04:17.760> videos<00:04:17.789> and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
more and try to watch some videos and

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.759 
more and try to watch some videos and
learn<00:04:18.389> how<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.630> pros<00:04:18.989> seem<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.410> use<00:04:19.590> it

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
learn how the pros seem to use it

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.170 
learn how the pros seem to use it
because<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.100> seems<00:04:20.519> like<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.700> really<00:04:21.030> fun

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
because it seems like a really fun

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.120 
because it seems like a really fun
strategy<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.080> first<00:04:22.320> time<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.740> saw<00:04:22.919> someone

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
strategy the first time I saw someone

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.600 
strategy the first time I saw someone
using<00:04:23.550> healers<00:04:23.909> up<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.300> Titan<00:04:24.659> League<00:04:24.810> my

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
using healers up and Titan League my

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.670 
using healers up and Titan League my
it<00:04:25.699> was<00:04:25.909> absolutely<00:04:26.659> blown<00:04:26.900> because<00:04:27.439> I

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
it was absolutely blown because I

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.959 
it was absolutely blown because I
thought<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.949> healers<00:04:28.250> were<00:04:28.400> probably<00:04:28.789> the

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:28.969 
thought the healers were probably the

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.570 
thought the healers were probably the
most<00:04:29.150> useless<00:04:29.419> trip<00:04:29.750> our<00:04:29.990> troop<00:04:30.259> ever<00:04:30.530> up<00:04:31.400> in

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
most useless trip our troop ever up in

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.890 
most useless trip our troop ever up in
Titan<00:04:31.909> league<00:04:32.060> but<00:04:32.300> some<00:04:32.509> people<00:04:32.780> are
