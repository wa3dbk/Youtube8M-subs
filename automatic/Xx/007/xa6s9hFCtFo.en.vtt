 I present to you is rather stayed have 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.500
 unpacked the new box sfr so that 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.330
 I received the hand 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:22.230
 so here's the collar is so a little 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:24.180
 hollow so right now we're going 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.770
 proceed to unpacking so from the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.290
 news 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.750
 sfr box so it went from there of 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.910
 banished just remove the plastic is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 everything but that's it 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.980
 there I removed the tester so this is 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.580
 parcel wing actually 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.160
 overlay focused in fact must 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.700
 that I remove this thing quickly is 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.790
 made 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.500
 that gives us parcel superimpose we're going 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.610
 see all there is in the first 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.420
 parcel so it's gone we're just at the 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.920
 light there is better so we'll see 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.710
 what's in the first package so 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.770
 I want to open that's what there is in 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:16.450
 the first packages what is a little the 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:20.170
 trick trickster therefore start 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:25.930
 things start small and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:31.860
 boot stuff so here's the booklet 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:36.720
 boot too so we are the cd 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:42.000
 what a gentleman here is help 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:48.780
 use and facilities 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.660
 then that's the soul is the neufbox 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:59.740
 yes I know she is very short 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:02.050
 that's it mister sfr see the lie to all 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.520
 the ethernet cable connection stuff 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.090
 this cable 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:15.870
 I do not know all of them so here we go 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:20.680
 the nave then the ana is the taking 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.330
 Ethernet cables and all cables 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.170
 what we have all the Kabyle 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.599
 in following a red card and this is 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.720
 well, we'll go and see what's 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.230
 in the second package 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.230
 structural work 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.900
 I'm going to play the game open and we're 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.620
 find and continue 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.519
 so here is the second parcel presents itself 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:03:01.480
 in this form so there too in 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:03.819
 quest use the ca it yes it's 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.849
 the decoder the tv decoder 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.160
 so actually in the first in the 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.440
 first carton there was the ninebox a 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.329
 saw all the cables and that's a bit 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.010
 for that it a little bit small and 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.069
 compared to the big ones so there are the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.209
 decoders in Cairo so that's what 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.600
 allows to watch a channel 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.510
 that's how I am so orange one 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.239
 the effects of the act of avoiding forgiveness and 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.489
 the livebox 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:40.000
 here and we would see that all of 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:41.639
 why we did a double 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.260
 scart socket 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.260
 that will happen inside the TV 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.930
 we want an ethernet cable 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:04.410
 a second cannabis ethernet cable 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:12.110
 come back and there they can then the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:18.840
 a cable is not too much companies 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:21.750
 planel than the other then the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.210
 it's a little trick wait i'll 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.850
 unpack that these are industries like 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.950
 that's not good enough for what 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.940
 you plug it like that but hey I 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:38.520
 do not know too short that there are batteries 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:44.850
 for the order I believe alas we at the 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:51.180
 order as soon as possible with the logo 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:56.400
 sfr sea ​​power and the chain we go 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:05:05.990
 compare to the order 2.6 out of years so 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:05.990
 she a little tense just this day 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:16.280
 I told you now 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.910
 I was saying 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.910
 compared to the orange order 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.830
 you see the difference it's like 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:34.150
 iphone 5 and iphone 4s good but that 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:41.129
 it's a little more than me via her of the 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:41.129
 differences from Cairo 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.789
 then downstairs baala the famous decoder 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:51.099
 the famous decoder of voo take it out of 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:54.009
 there and we find ourselves immediately with 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.729
 the famous music aram l go we see 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.520
 there the decoder 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:03.259
 I joly you rather simple start 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.839
 did not see him kill the debate here he is 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.949
 Savalli it is rather pretty and the joy 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:11.259
 see not too well it's marked it's 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.259
 do it 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:24.049
 So here is the sfr button 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:29.119
 to turn it on sd card or something a 

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:33.319
 long-term power cable have known 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:36.069
 place to change back sfr en suite 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.069
 behind 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:47.890
 but we all have all the wires and 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:53.120
 cables of hdmi audio stuff all that so 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:55.130
 that's all for this unpacking yes 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.140
 that's all for this unpacking and the 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:02.090
 new ninebox of sfr they are 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:04.580
 formulated decoder so that's good if 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:09.710
