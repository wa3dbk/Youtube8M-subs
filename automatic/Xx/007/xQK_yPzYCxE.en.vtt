00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 so I promised that one too 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.839
 very short insight here from ours 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.460
 commentators boot from sat 1 gives that 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.219
 is a gigantic look here with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.030
 livestream really just topped by 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.680
 this is the robert hoffmann look 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.960
 our production manager still sees 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.730
 better than the look behind in the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.410
 stadium so crawls in a bed 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.789
 Surprisingly, I operate 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.189
 during the transfer later too 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 facebook and twitter 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.199
 these are our monitors for the fit for 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.480
 the signal that we accompany 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:39.390
 then we press ours 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.010
 Cooperation is possible now 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 do not hold so there we sit then 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.020
 Equally sensational as our table with 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.410
 the hero again league out it is 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 really sensational that is outstanding 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.930
 is that cool because then would be ours 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.989
 colleagues from the usa the whole yes 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.989
 the whole 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.190
 started so own this is the cow 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.540
 that helps us and that you believed that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.210
 I really talk to you afterwards 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 is the bus again 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.090
 I'm looking forward to being piggy 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.520
 this game equals us too 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.360
 usually a big story 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.500
 one or the other maybe 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.540
 registered voice is a bit 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.850
 It could be different with the buschi because 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.060
 the braids palate that easily 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.410
 swollen 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.010
 climate no idea how that again 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.650
 has come 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.840
 but it does not matter now comes the 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.850
 plug stupid saying therefore I do 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.460
 at this point very quickly 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:50.600
 nice going on what else the back 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:53.420
 colleague that's really the madness so 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.070
 So again the view under the goods 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.840
 two minutes of impressions here 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.550
 our commentator book in new jersey 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.820
 the bed live stream 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.450
 I'm so hot for this game 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.450
