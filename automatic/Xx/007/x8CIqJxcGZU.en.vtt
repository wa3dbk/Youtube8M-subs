yeah<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.739> I'm<00:02:33.160> trying<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.520> think<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.819> what<00:02:33.970> to

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
yeah so I'm trying to think of what to

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.750 
yeah so I'm trying to think of what to
say<00:02:34.510> about

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
say about

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.190

the other color anyway it comes in two
colors<00:02:48.079> I<00:02:48.260> can't<00:02:48.470> think<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.769> other<00:02:48.980> color

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220
