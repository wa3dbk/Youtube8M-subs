 hey today but i like these nice world cup nails 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.589
 for you and and was recently in the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.700
 comments very often asked of god wants 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.040
 you are one 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 no we only deal with products 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.280
 of a work 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.900
 well it almost succeeded 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.760
 of course you can do this stuff 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.170
 all can be found at essence 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.109
 most products that I have used 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.060
 are therefore also of essence and yes both 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.800
 budgetary or as of one with me 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.260
 hope you like it and stay 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.820
 then especially look for it to dot 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.130
 I use the essence hup 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 holland very connection and since there 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.360
 I don't have an orange roof in it from cat 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.910
 choose my coach a de high 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.200
 caught and now I'm all going to be dots 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.120
 put on my nails 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.710
 apply a bit of varnish to one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.270
 paletje this can also be done on a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.390
 piece of paper or a little bit 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.390
 aluminium foil 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.129
 Then I pick up my best into with 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.140
 a thick point and we then I dab in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.789
 the paint 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.680
 and so I'm going to put dots on my 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.500
 nails 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 I also do to the other what color 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.710
 now the blue color and I just go 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.580
 put dots and I make sure that I 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.860
 don't go over the red dots and take care 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.460
 it quite so soon a dot 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.460
 whole 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.260
 when all dots are so finished I go 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.270
 dry my night as well 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.340
 before I continue stamping 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.600
 but of course they are really like that already 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.310
 very nice so it 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.170
 of course you can also do them that way 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.300
 also stamping to budget-proof me 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.040
 use infinity nails image plate and 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.050
 this is number 20 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.360
 and from that you chose this path and chose temple 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.640
 say the dot pattern but I will 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.610
