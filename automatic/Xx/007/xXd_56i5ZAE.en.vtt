I've played this map and I actually have
the<00:00:11.070> texture<00:00:11.550> pack<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.059> now<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.860> didn't<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:14.040> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the texture pack on now I didn't have it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.240 
the texture pack on now I didn't have it
on<00:00:14.370> before<00:00:14.670> for<00:00:15.240> some<00:00:15.450> reason<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.139> didn't<00:00:17.010> work

or something but now i have it on so the
textures<00:00:19.920> will<00:00:20.160> look<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.550> little<00:00:20.699> bit

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880

okay<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.930> test

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
okay I'm going to go to the test

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.530 
okay I'm going to go to the test
chambers<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.990> looks<00:01:37.200> pretty<00:01:37.560> intense

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
chambers so this looks pretty intense

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
chambers so this looks pretty intense
commence<00:01:39.540> testing<00:01:40.079> okay<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> guess<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.340> down

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
commence testing okay I guess we go down

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.380 
commence testing okay I guess we go down
here

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.790 

okay<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.020> should<00:01:45.229> probably<00:01:45.320> turn<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.680> music

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
okay I should probably turn that music

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.670 
okay I should probably turn that music
down<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.190> little<00:01:46.400> bit<00:01:46.810> because<00:01:47.810> people<00:01:48.260> get<00:01:48.440> mad

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
down a little bit because people get mad

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.410 
down a little bit because people get mad
at<00:01:48.890> me<00:01:49.600> okay<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:52.520> will<00:01:52.640> now<00:01:52.760> enter<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.119> hub

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
at me okay so you will now enter the hub

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.620 
at me okay so you will now enter the hub
here<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.200> will<00:01:54.350> go<00:01:54.619> through<00:01:54.650> or<00:01:55.610> here<00:01:56.479> you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.960 
here you will go through or here you
will<00:01:56.840> test<00:01:57.320> through<00:01:57.650> three<00:01:58.220> tests<00:01:58.520> courses

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
will test through three tests courses

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.350 
will test through three tests courses
for<00:01:59.330> buttons<00:01:59.750> to<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.590> remaining<00:02:01.040> tests<00:02:01.520> each

just something different looks like we
got<00:05:36.909> some<00:05:37.060> wood<00:05:37.539> or<00:05:37.569> something<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:38.199> don't<00:05:38.259> know

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
got some wood or something I don't know

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.499 
got some wood or something I don't know
what<00:05:38.710> that<00:05:38.860> is<00:05:38.889> I'm<00:05:39.819> not<00:05:40.030> used<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.300> this

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
what that is I'm not used to this

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.520 
what that is I'm not used to this
texture<00:05:41.110> pack<00:05:41.349> so<00:05:42.960> it's<00:05:43.960> kind<00:05:44.199> of<00:05:44.289> hard<00:05:44.440> to

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
texture pack so it's kind of hard to

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.249 
texture pack so it's kind of hard to
tell<00:05:45.599> there's<00:05:46.599> something<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.650> their<00:05:49.259> break

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
tell there's something of their break

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:57.900 
tell there's something of their break
this<00:05:50.440> block

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.970 

you
