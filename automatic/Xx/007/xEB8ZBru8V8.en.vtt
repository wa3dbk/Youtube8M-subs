00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.649
 and the legend of the obvious ones of Guanajuato 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.480
 of course the mummies of 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.070
 Guanajuato have to be in the city 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.680
 of Guanajuato when we started 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.210
 conceptualize that guanajuato we gave ourselves 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.220
 account that the guanajuato that we 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.050
 we wanted to portray that imaginary that 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.019
 we have Guanajuato that did not exist 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.950
 200 years ago and then that's why we 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.830
 we went with the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.450
 and we took on the task of making a 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.910
 iconographic research a 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.360
 investigation on site that would give us 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.720
 give us that dimension and it was when 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.000
 University of Guanajuato supported us and 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.420
 he opened the doors of the institution 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.420
 to be able to start doing that 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 investigation 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.790
 it's the only thing I know how to do mom did not want 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.460
 forever nothing small happens 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.570
 today and I return if to be able to trace 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.710
 a trace of the city 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.930
 we had access to several maps 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.760
 photographs and several maps of ago 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.190
 two hundred three hundred years for 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.880
 understand a little how that city was 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:19.810
 the library of the university 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.729
 gave us access so we could see and 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.640
 we could do small 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.939
 drawings of how those were precisely 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.850
 that trace of the city I was 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.409
 looking as well as the postcards what 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.030
 that what we know to avoid 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.860
 as good 4 what is it that had to be 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.420
 is what what existed at that time 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.340
 we found that there were several places 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.060
 and several churches that he who were there 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.850
 the art department we are looking for 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.770
 it was sought to make an abstraction of the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.200
 The Plaza de San Roque in the Plaza de San 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.909
 Fernando from the Plaza de la Paz of the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.710
 AlhÃ³ndiga de granaditas of its manifolds 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.030
 alleys corner of the company 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.759
 and see how to try to make a recreation 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.340
 of those places the closest thing to 1800 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.869
 obviously if there is an abstraction there is 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.489
 an interpretation of those places 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.780
 we just do not think they are 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.080
 exactly as we are 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.230
 portraying finally you can 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.130
 it's also the university has access to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.820
 several several images where they looked 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.640
 the dresses and the clothes that are made 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.510
 at that time we tried how to be kong 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.880
 for being a family movie 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.380
 entertainment for current people not 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.960
 make a very historical review 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.660
 deep is that entertainment not 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.150
 we want we do not want to give chair of how 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.950
 was when 4c 200 years however if 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.160
 we needed to touch the ground and see 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.910
 our ours the reality of that 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.910
 from that era
