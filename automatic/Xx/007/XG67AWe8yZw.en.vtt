00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.089
 help video today I want you one 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.730
 very simple version on the guitar 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.730
 by knockin on heaven's door at 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.870
 This really very easy and above all 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.870
 suitable for beginners 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.690
 so you only have three chords and we have 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.480
 We'll catch you first 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:46.290
 the d accord little finger down on 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.420
 the necks side in the third and the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.699
 third finger here the means the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.890
 Middle the ring finger one side 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.800
 about it also in the third bunch then here 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.300
 the second finger at the top of the third 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.949
 Bund and the first finger the pact her 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.740
 and underneath a nonsense page 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:10.750
 under it in the second bund so next 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.000
 the d to let the third finger 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.640
 lie down with everyone else and pack 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.520
 the first here on the second page 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:26.020
 the third at the bottom of the brightest 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:29.170
 and lastly we have the c to the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.049
 first finger here on the first bunch 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.619
 on the second page the second finger 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:40.390
 here on the first of motives 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.750
 pages in the second bund and the den 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.220
 third finger in the third bunch on the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.090
 middle of the deep 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.090
 and that sounds like that 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.200
 so the suggestion is at the song 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.000
 really very easy with the above and at 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640
 the d so in the first two 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.810
 chords would have to play the same 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:17.160
 and so played as follows 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.830
 down three times 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.470
 down and once high and the first 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.470
 game took a break and then 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.280
 if then made the last big 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.840
 then changes into the court of b 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.840
 So that's what it's all about 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:54.540
 and then comes that the c and there plays 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:54.540
 then down so down 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.780
 makes it slow again 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.430
 and then comes back up front 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.430
 through again 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.720
 a series version but good for beginners 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.040
 yes I hope the video failed us 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.430
 will not forget and until the 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.430
 next time
