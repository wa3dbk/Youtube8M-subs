so<00:00:44.070> let's<00:00:44.280> start<00:00:44.580> for<00:00:44.850> from<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.020> thing<00:00:46.320> here

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
so let's start for from this thing here

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.850 
so let's start for from this thing here
the<00:00:48.870> dobro<00:00:49.110> we've<00:00:49.650> gotta<00:00:54.350> know<00:00:55.350> where<00:00:55.620> we've

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the dobro we've gotta know where we've

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.760 
the dobro we've gotta know where we've
got<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> name<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> presets<00:00:57.770> inferior

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
got the name of the presets inferior

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
got the name of the presets inferior
without<00:00:59.130> the<00:00:59.310> letter<00:00:59.520> B<00:00:59.820> which<00:01:00.090> means<00:01:00.330> that<00:01:00.570> if

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
without the letter B which means that if

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.310 
without the letter B which means that if
this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.900> a<00:01:01.080> preset<00:01:04.280> testing

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:21.109 

so<00:01:10.180> in<00:01:11.180> here

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:45.060 

which<00:01:21.840> speeches<00:01:22.439> song

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.410 

the<00:01:47.530> fire<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:50.090> let's<00:01:50.330> render<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.870> compression

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
the fire so let's render the compression

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.040 
the fire so let's render the compression
here<00:01:53.420> with<00:01:53.660> daca<00:01:54.400> why<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.540> third<00:01:56.540> loop<00:01:56.870> is

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
here with daca why the third loop is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.580 
here with daca why the third loop is
always<00:01:57.640> because<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.790> have<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.120> tell<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.600> that

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
always because I have to tell you that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.760 
always because I have to tell you that
here<00:02:01.250> we've<00:02:01.460> got<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.000> signal<00:02:02.900> path<00:02:03.110> starting

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
here we've got the signal path starting

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.980 
here we've got the signal path starting
from<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:04.160> one<00:02:04.370> dose<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:06.580> me<00:02:07.580> puts<00:02:07.850> my<00:02:08.510> dance

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
from the one dose the me puts my dance

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.390 
from the one dose the me puts my dance
on<00:02:09.260> the<00:02:09.380> first<00:02:09.679> note<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:12.230> go<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.770> boosting

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
on the first note we go to the boosting

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.210 
on the first note we go to the boosting
compressor

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
compressor

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.690 
compressor
and<00:02:15.310> from<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.970> third<00:02:16.450> loop<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:17.830> actually<00:02:18.280> we

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
and from the third loop we actually we

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.780 
and from the third loop we actually we
go<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.330> amp<00:02:19.510> input<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.440> say<00:02:20.740> man<00:02:21.430> from

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
go to the amp input so I say man from

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.660 
go to the amp input so I say man from
the<00:02:22.260> loops<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.950> sack<00:02:24.750> sands<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:26.590> go<00:02:26.800> to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the loops and the sack sands we go to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.860 
the loops and the sack sands we go to
the<00:02:27.790> return<00:02:28.210> of<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.780> laundry<00:02:29.380> for<00:02:33.870> cable

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
the return of the laundry for cable

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.330 
the return of the laundry for cable
methods<00:02:35.230> right<00:02:35.650> okay

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
methods right okay

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.260 
methods right okay
so<00:02:37.000> we<00:02:37.300> go<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:38.050> here<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:39.220> artists<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.820> boxes

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
so we go in here with artists on boxes

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.800 
so we go in here with artists on boxes
and<00:02:40.900> then<00:02:41.140> from<00:02:41.440> out<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.010> return<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.400> their<00:02:42.810> so

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and then from out the return of their so

00:02:43.810 --> 00:03:11.640 
and then from out the return of their so
if<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.800> want<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.280> use<00:02:45.490> for<00:02:45.520> cable<00:02:46.090> methods<00:03:10.650> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
if we want to use for cable methods so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:34.260 
if we want to use for cable methods so
anyway<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.640> GCP<00:03:13.360> there's<00:03:14.230> no

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.740 

so<00:03:35.270> what<00:03:35.870> more<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.580> expression<00:03:38.060> methylene

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
so what more is the expression methylene

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.190 
so what more is the expression methylene
boats<00:03:39.050> so<00:03:39.860> we<00:03:40.250> make<00:03:40.730> an<00:03:40.940> expression<00:03:41.270> better<00:03:41.690> so

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
boats so we make an expression better so

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.070 
boats so we make an expression better so
if<00:03:42.320> we<00:03:42.560> collect<00:03:42.710> any<00:03:43.100> expression<00:03:43.820> yeah<00:03:44.750> we

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
if we collect any expression yeah we

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.920 
if we collect any expression yeah we
used<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.100> recommend<00:03:46.430> some<00:03:47.030> expression<00:03:47.720> better

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
used to recommend some expression better

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.530 
used to recommend some expression better
spots<00:03:48.350> is<00:03:48.830> still<00:03:49.100> evaluating<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:50.090> we'll<00:03:50.270> tell

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
spots is still evaluating so we'll tell

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.330 
spots is still evaluating so we'll tell
you<00:03:50.570> buddy<00:03:50.900> -<00:03:51.260> oh<00:03:51.680> yeah<00:03:52.720> we've<00:03:53.720> got<00:03:53.930> three

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
you buddy - oh yeah we've got three

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.800 
you buddy - oh yeah we've got three
stereo<00:03:55.340> outs<00:03:55.850> for<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.600> amp<00:03:56.840> controls<00:03:57.490> so<00:03:58.810> it

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
stereo outs for the amp controls so it

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.800 
stereo outs for the amp controls so it
gives<00:04:00.080> us<00:04:00.320> six<00:04:00.920> realize<00:04:01.490> right<00:04:02.240> for<00:04:02.600> EM

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
gives us six realize right for EM

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.250 
gives us six realize right for EM
control<00:04:03.320> we've<00:04:04.310> got<00:04:04.610> median<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:05.810> PD<00:04:06.020> outs

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
control we've got median and PD outs

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.250 
control we've got median and PD outs
right<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:07.490> you<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.850> control<00:04:08.209> your<00:04:08.300> GST<00:04:09.020> for

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
right so you can control your GST for

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.820 
right so you can control your GST for
through<00:04:09.680> another<00:04:10.010> MIDI<00:04:10.370> device<00:04:11.680> we<00:04:12.680> could

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
through another MIDI device we could

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.220 
through another MIDI device we could
control<00:04:13.160> all<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.610> switches<00:04:13.880> interact<00:04:14.450> with

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.400 

and<00:04:18.230> other<00:04:18.500> brands

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.020 

yeah<00:04:26.410> yeah<00:04:26.740> this<00:04:27.040> is<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:28.890> problem<00:04:29.890> okay<00:04:30.490> here

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
yeah yeah this is a problem okay here

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.080 
yeah yeah this is a problem okay here
we've<00:04:31.210> got<00:04:31.420> the<00:04:31.660> possibility<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:33.190> switch<00:04:33.340> on

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
we've got the possibility to switch on

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.360 
we've got the possibility to switch on
the<00:04:34.180> ground<00:04:34.480> control<00:04:35.020> garage<00:04:35.380> for<00:04:35.740> Biological

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
the ground control garage for Biological

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.590 
the ground control garage for Biological
GC<00:04:37.090> yet<00:04:37.390> I<00:04:38.100> think<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.490> we<00:04:40.060> have<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.360> check

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
GC yet I think that we have to check

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.920 
GC yet I think that we have to check
this<00:04:40.780> out<00:04:41.050> with<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.440> GRC<00:04:41.950> for<00:04:42.220> okay<00:04:42.910> they<00:04:43.780> have

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
this out with the GRC for okay they have

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.070 
this out with the GRC for okay they have
their<00:04:44.140> own<00:04:44.460> they<00:04:45.460> have<00:04:45.700> their<00:04:45.880> own<00:04:45.910> interface

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080
