00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.149

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.539
 03 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.249
 at the top of the insulation applied 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.249

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.770
 between sawdust 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.390
 in winter the door of the winterer is often open therefore 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.829
 worth metal mesh so that the mouse does not 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.829
 lost 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.640
 for example it doesn't work 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.140
 about four or so 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.860
 five meters 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 always fit 148 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.020
 the ceiling is low enough literally 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.220
 two meters 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.950
 done in the ceiling 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.640
 you may know mine 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 which will regulate 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.060
 air inflow air outflow 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.490
 air flow is provided or 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.010
 through the door 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.220
 and additionally I have an underground 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.480
 laid pipe does not come out 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.670
 over here 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090
 if covered with metal mesh 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.210
 how would fresh air come in winter 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.470
 there is a pipe etc. 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.490
 how will scold 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.620
 regiment of lemongrass 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.950
 earthy 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.310
 but sandy 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.280
 I'm here level rose 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.720
 it has two layers of roofing material as waterproofing 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.490
 to 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.270
 the good of their land did not come here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.760
 winter man 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.390
 it turns out 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.610
 wintering effective 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 wooden 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.490
 Kiev no stove street walls 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 but they are thick up to 40 centimeters thick 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.980
 and additionally no different 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.680
 here is a window 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.359
 which i just come forward 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.759
 although a surcharge and pillow 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.459
 I do not use it 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 that's what it is about lemongrass 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.439
 comfortable enough 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.439
 sunny wintering certainly doesnâ€™t compare 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.949
 when to the streets 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.589
 already minus 40 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.759
 10 but or we are stronger than frost 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.759
 I close the doors of winter houses 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.809
 trust is done too 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:43.549
 come know ice such a hole with 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.699
 metal mesh and can also 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.699
 regulate a stream of air 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.789
 in this room naturally too 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.869
 much warmer than outside difference 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.159
 is about ten degrees the answer 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.899
 on the street minus 20 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.989
 then it's only ten minutes past twelve and 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.499
 it is clear that 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.419
 Monica is easier to handle everywhere. 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.829
 keeping the temperature 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.089
 know no extra 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.859
 I do not use heat for years 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.719
 what do the volumes do 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.939
 premises 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.259
 so 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.999
 minuses wintez never happens 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.799
 Lenin 24a bed plus 24 degrees 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.709
 in general, that's all 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.399
