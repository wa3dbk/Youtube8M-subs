00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
formed on its own so what I do is I just

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.710

the nail is and I already did that and
all<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.290> did<00:00:53.409> because<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.040> has<00:00:54.159> a<00:00:54.190> self-adhesive

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
the crack is way down here and because I

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.030
