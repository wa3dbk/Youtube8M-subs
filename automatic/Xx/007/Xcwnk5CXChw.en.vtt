00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
could come in to the wind and find out

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.339 
could come in to the wind and find out
where<00:05:11.000> I<00:05:11.029> was<00:05:11.180> because<00:05:11.389> where<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.110> was<00:05:12.199> hidden

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
where I was because where I was hidden

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.439 
where I was because where I was hidden
behind<00:05:13.129> the<00:05:13.400> branches<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:13.819> was<00:05:14.029> behind<00:05:14.240> the

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
behind the branches that was behind the

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.089 
behind the branches that was behind the
boughs<00:05:14.599> of<00:05:14.629> the<00:05:14.839> trees<00:05:15.080> here<00:05:15.259> he<00:05:15.800> couldn't

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
boughs of the trees here he couldn't

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.290 
boughs of the trees here he couldn't
make<00:05:16.219> out<00:05:16.430> what<00:05:16.460> was<00:05:16.669> going<00:05:16.909> on<00:05:17.029> he<00:05:17.150> couldn't

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
make out what was going on he couldn't

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.029 
make out what was going on he couldn't
exactly<00:05:17.629> pinpoint<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.409> sound<00:05:18.620> with<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.830> wind

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
exactly pinpoint the sound with the wind

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.249 
exactly pinpoint the sound with the wind
as<00:05:19.219> well<00:05:19.339> so<00:05:20.060> he<00:05:20.210> was<00:05:20.360> working<00:05:20.719> his<00:05:20.810> way<00:05:20.870> around

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
as well so he was working his way around

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.100 
as well so he was working his way around
and<00:05:21.560> then<00:05:22.430> as<00:05:22.550> soon<00:05:22.699> as<00:05:22.759> he<00:05:22.909> got<00:05:23.120> our<00:05:23.300> wind<00:05:23.509> he

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
and then as soon as he got our wind he

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.269 
and then as soon as he got our wind he
would<00:05:24.229> have<00:05:24.319> been<00:05:24.439> off<00:05:24.560> so<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:24.830> didn't<00:05:25.189> have

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:25.279 
would have been off so I didn't have

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.399 
would have been off so I didn't have
long<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:25.879> unfortunately<00:05:26.659> took<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.199> shot

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
long and unfortunately took the shot

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.959 
long and unfortunately took the shot
just<00:05:27.439> as<00:05:27.770> he<00:05:27.889> went<00:05:27.979> out<00:05:28.129> of<00:05:28.250> camera<00:05:28.460> view<00:05:28.699> yeah

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:28.969 
just as he went out of camera view yeah

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.559 
just as he went out of camera view yeah
unfortunately<00:05:29.870> that's<00:05:30.289> the<00:05:30.500> way<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.740> can<00:05:30.889> go

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
unfortunately that's the way it can go

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.059 
unfortunately that's the way it can go
we<00:05:32.569> might<00:05:32.779> have<00:05:32.930> missed<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.199> shot<00:05:33.409> but<00:05:33.800> Roy

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
we might have missed the shot but Roy

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.649 
we might have missed the shot but Roy
didn't<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.729> we'll<00:05:34.849> endeavor<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.330> get<00:05:35.449> some

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
didn't and we'll endeavor to get some
