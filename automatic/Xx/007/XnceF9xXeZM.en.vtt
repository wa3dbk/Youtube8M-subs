 the asteroid with a diameter of 70 has failed 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.050
 miles named matilda will crash 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.400

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.410

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.590
 if you do n't feel like it that you like me 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.290
 by dismissing that is necessary 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.460
 as I said next week the 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.460

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.020
 of illnesses if it is recalled anyway 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.530

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.530

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.870
 it affects just who you are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.150
 take everything and she is gone 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.990
 was the first we go to look for it must 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150

 you know her birthday today 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.610
 just that he didn't say it before 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.880
 it cannot be true as it was 25 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.500
 miles beyond the grateful limits could not 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.850
 show some good heart to give to mine 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.320
 friend the chance to find love again 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.890
