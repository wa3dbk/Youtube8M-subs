00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
right now to begin transformation I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.229 
right now to begin transformation I
don't<00:00:59.890> know<00:01:00.070> if<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:00.280> do<00:01:00.340> it<00:01:00.550> in<00:01:00.670> order<00:01:00.850> but<00:01:01.090> this

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
don't know if I do it in order but this

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.580 
don't know if I do it in order but this
is<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.510> order<00:01:01.809> that<00:01:01.840> I<00:01:02.019> do<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:02.670> um<00:01:04.590> usually

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
is the order that I do it um usually

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.660 
is the order that I do it um usually
just<00:01:06.010> kind<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.370> pull<00:01:06.610> these<00:01:06.820> apart<00:01:08.159> his<00:01:09.159> arms

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
lift them up and you gotta flip them

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.429 
lift them up and you gotta flip them
around<00:01:14.820> cuz<00:01:15.820> gotta<00:01:16.600> get<00:01:16.810> him<00:01:16.900> out<00:01:17.049> of<00:01:17.080> truck

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.600 
around cuz gotta get him out of truck
mode<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.950> heading<00:01:18.250> into<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.580> robot<00:01:18.909> mode

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
mode and heading into the robot mode

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.670 
mode and heading into the robot mode
then<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.759> flip<00:01:22.210> him<00:01:22.509> out<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.079> his<00:01:23.200> head<00:01:23.350> comes

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
then you flip him out so his head comes

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.359 
then you flip him out so his head comes
out<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:23.920> little<00:01:24.040> see<00:01:26.820> he's<00:01:27.820> really<00:01:28.329> easy<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.840> do

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
out a little see he's really easy to do

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.039 
out a little see he's really easy to do
that's<00:01:30.369> why<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:30.670> works<00:01:30.850> for<00:01:31.030> simple<00:01:31.450> minded<00:01:31.810> me
