00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.819
 femme bispo de souza moraes is from that 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.970
 issue continuing that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.490
 study of the motherboard issue that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.960
 does not care so much for noting that this 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:21.449
 board asus a g31 app 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.789
 it has a led that indicates that the voltage 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.859
 distant neighborhood or is the first source 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.330
 power is by bye and it is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.490
 connected 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 not the whole motherboard has that code 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.079
 here funk that means that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.630
 is in the mode below 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.750
 first source it is activated 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.649
 she is here with you the stock is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.710
 underneath it notes that here are the two 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.059
 pins where I turn power button 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.329
 so what I 'm going to do I have one 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.140
 3.3 volts 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.050
 Ok lift up here you can see I already 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:07.049
 I already had three if you guys care 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:18.240
 here three thousand volts screen and when I 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:20.340
 close the contact there already appeared the image 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.170
 who gave the first biblical then what 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.070
 happens when I close all three goals 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.600
 This little one for your food. 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.979
 this traffic here is ok food 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.520
 of this transit 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.380
 if I will observe that to make the lie 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.640
 here in pina do I have an attention of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:53.220
 4 when 2011 gold that is sure if I went 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.660
 until the plate here on the green wire 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 I'll have attention here next 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.750
 zero 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:08.910
 Okay, the next one saying so I'm going 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:14.580
 turn off the machine now 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.680
 I got my attention right there on the green pine 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.740
 it will get around 5 volts 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.810
 it is normal that 5 volts ok then the machine 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.260
 who is waiting for the power command 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.340
 will make new guide benckiser the command 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.090
 of attention power drops to near zero 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.010
 Okay then it means what the source 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.709
 she's normal that she has both 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.490
 first voltages which is 3.3 volts here 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.280
 on the power button pin and she has the 5 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.290
 volts also that the necessary attention 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.720
 to the source are too much does not mean 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.620
 that the source she is in perfect 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.920
 conditions 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.739
 ok then normal power supply and the board powering 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.060
 O normally shown to you now 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.060
 another without operating system
