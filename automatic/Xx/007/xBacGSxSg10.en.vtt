00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.040
 so I have to go back and forth the name like, for example, fonts one 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.309
 can choose 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.419
 Type 1 32 active center type 3 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.719
 and we are 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.600
 once the complete font has changed quite interesting 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.550
 Houghton Steel was still changing, so it's a bit mobile 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.569
 be back after 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.499
 Taste around 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:25.740
 change 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.859
 transition effects set to HUS 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.199
 quite different 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.140
 Phone setting 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.230
 Navigation can be activated 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.840
 the censorship position 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.940
 and so on and so on in him once soft yes you told me if you 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.970
 the music recognition that Chelsea did 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.659
 In the meantime you activate a victory 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.659
 Run piece that is very familiar inside 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.020
 communities 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.820
 once you have to pull the connection that case you have to 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.560
 his 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.560
 Fritz box 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.690
 Vol Live has Clooney is now the list 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.700
 For example, here we can enter this 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.990
 and then associate with it maybe it's gonna be, so to speak 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.330
 gimmick 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
 you can just a little bit 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.960
 but numbers 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.800
 go out of the fact 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.160
 the whole thing has to be on the way 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
 Not only Uwe will speak picture 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.680
 not yet 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.680
 or the radio, of course, only in conjunction with the one with a headset 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.440
 Excellent latest sanctions 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.160
 Video Editor Games and more 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.860
 the austerity plans and diet already from the iPhone 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 Bluetooth, of course 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.240
 synchronize as such 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.490
 then take it once 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.380
 to stop 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.539
 to deserve him with shots Peaches on top of it are wifi the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.329
 Of course, Dolores Petersen is not an existing painting style 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.189
 Donut displayed 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.180
 As a hundred years, mim would have very important tasks to play poker around 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.020
 interesting is that you have to do tasks still have what to do 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.859
 del-tor 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:25.799
 calculator 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.349
 and bills 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.349
 and percent Hirches and probably also from home 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.289
 because of the red card 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.729
 All in all a very nice one 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.779
 It is very nice to have danced 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.949
 i find myself very much to my person i decided better like no 900 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.359
 which I already tested 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.589
 I think that they capture the light that his view is even more elegant 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.589
 it also from the processing ago super 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.579
 Hangover again done a great job telling me 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.849
 that of Markus Wasse the 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.490
 bake and a sanction if I'm on it Trucker I have here for a short time 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.439

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.049
 Invest in addition to hits 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.379
 or Vans keep activist task manager that means I can do two 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.040
 or run three or more applications side by side mp3-player 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.029
 Internets and percent 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:22.719
 Böhm, for example, calculates similar calculators 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.899
 works too 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.419
 especially good things for me 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.659
 Since Samsung has made a small step forward to my iPhone 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:32.509
 example 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:36.029
 the münsterische one says that such interferences the 9 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.259
 as I said you can here 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.259
 The three screens customers can exploit attract few 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.769
 Put parts on it 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.799
 and in total 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.579
 the mermaids with screen 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.849
 and already it is normal pants or what must 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.849
 for example, rest 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:01.449
 Well there you can use the screen individually for themselves as I said a very 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.969
 great handling 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.829
 a little bit of saliva Gmain be two gigawatts I believe preinstalled 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.879
 then you have to reinstall the rest over a sd card 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.669
 who is not a problem 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.219
 wifi received 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.269

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.379
 you have no problems with 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.770
 voters again all before again requests is free then you are 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.080
 no costs assuming all own network 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.900
 m Internet cafés and so on could for 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.969
 Costs arise 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.399

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.600
 in the open air and comments and 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.020
