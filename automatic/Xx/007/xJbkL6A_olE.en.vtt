16<00:02:45.810> mm<00:02:46.910> close<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.530> eight<00:02:49.530> hours<00:02:49.860> all<00:02:50.010> together

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
16 mm close to eight hours all together

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.280 
out I'd say eating a half to nine that's
where<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.430> hurt<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.780> as<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:24.130> go<00:03:24.310> down<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:26.110> a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
where it hurt and as you go down just a

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.580 
where it hurt and as you go down just a
little<00:03:26.319> s<00:03:26.739> this<00:03:27.069> area<00:03:27.459> was<00:03:27.670> uh<00:03:28.500> wasn't<00:03:29.500> that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
little s this area was uh wasn't that

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.470 
little s this area was uh wasn't that
bad<00:03:29.860> I'd<00:03:30.220> say<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:30.730> was<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.860> six<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.069> half<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
bad I'd say it was a six and a half to

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.589 
bad I'd say it was a six and a half to
seven<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.769> thing<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:36.610> uh<00:03:36.640> was

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
seven the thing that that uh was

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.020 
seven the thing that that uh was
different<00:03:38.019> was<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.800> healing<00:03:39.280> time<00:03:39.519> this

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
different was the healing time this

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.420 
different was the healing time this
would<00:03:40.209> scab<00:03:40.510> up<00:03:40.660> really<00:03:40.989> bad<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:42.220> thought

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
would scab up really bad and I thought

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.590 
would scab up really bad and I thought
it<00:03:42.580> was<00:03:42.670> going<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.880> actually<00:03:43.150> take<00:03:43.299> out<00:03:43.450> all

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
it was going to actually take out all

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.300 
it was going to actually take out all
the<00:03:43.750> ink<00:03:43.870> but<00:03:44.200> they<00:03:44.319> actually<00:03:44.709> ended<00:03:44.920> up<00:03:45.069> being

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
the ink but they actually ended up being

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.759 
the ink but they actually ended up being
really<00:03:45.549> good<00:03:45.750> but<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.200> took<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.590> while<00:03:47.620> to

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
really good but this took a while to

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.259 
really good but this took a while to
heal<00:03:48.160> just<00:03:48.600> FYI<00:03:49.739> that's<00:03:50.739> uh<00:03:51.100> Clark<00:03:51.760> Kent<00:03:52.030> you
