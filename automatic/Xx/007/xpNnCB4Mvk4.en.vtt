00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and then I use the ziplock bag to pipe

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
and then I use the ziplock bag to pipe
in<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.409> mixture<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.670> spoon<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> in

with<00:02:24.090> layer<00:02:24.300> cakes<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.080> pop<00:02:25.230> mine<00:02:25.410> into

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
with layer cakes I like to pop mine into

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.740 
with layer cakes I like to pop mine into
the<00:02:25.740> freezer<00:02:26.069> for<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:26.580> an<00:02:26.970> hour<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.569> so

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the freezer for about an hour or so so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.660 
the freezer for about an hour or so so
they're<00:02:27.900> actually<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> little<00:02:28.709> bit<00:02:28.890> firm<00:02:29.340> to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
they're actually a little bit firm to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.400 
they're actually a little bit firm to
work<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.360> find<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.050> stops<00:02:31.260> them<00:02:31.380> from

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
work with I find that it stops them from

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.960 
work with I find that it stops them from
crumbling<00:02:31.920> when<00:02:32.130> they're<00:02:32.250> really<00:02:32.550> freshly

crumbling when they're really freshly

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.000 
crumbling when they're really freshly
made<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.810> now<00:02:33.959> I'm<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.260> taking<00:02:34.410> my<00:02:34.590> serrated

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
made so now I'm just taking my serrated

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.190 
made so now I'm just taking my serrated
edge<00:02:35.250> knife<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.760> I'm<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:35.940> cutting<00:02:36.420> along

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
edge knife and I'm just cutting along

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.930 
edge knife and I'm just cutting along
sort<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.560> three<00:02:37.800> at<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.980> time<00:02:38.010> because<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.580> really

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
sort of three at a time because I really

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
sort of three at a time because I really
want<00:02:39.120> these<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.420> all<00:02:39.600> be<00:02:39.810> nice<00:02:40.290> even<00:02:40.590> layers

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
want these to all be nice even layers

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.860 
want these to all be nice even layers
and<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:41.700> pretty<00:02:42.030> important<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.690> they're

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and it's pretty important that they're

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.330 
and it's pretty important that they're
all<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.560> same<00:02:43.800> height<00:02:44.069> for<00:02:44.310> our

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
all about the same height for our

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.250 
all about the same height for our
checkerboard<00:02:44.880> effect<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.300> work<00:02:45.450> once<00:02:46.050> you've

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
checkerboard effect to work once you've

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.960 
checkerboard effect to work once you've
cut<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.560> tops<00:02:46.830> off<00:02:47.010> them<00:02:47.160> all<00:02:47.280> flip<00:02:47.670> them<00:02:47.850> over

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
cut the tops off them all flip them over

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.430 
cut the tops off them all flip them over
and<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.450> see<00:02:48.480> because<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.140> nonstick

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
and you can see because of that nonstick

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.560 
and you can see because of that nonstick
spray<00:02:49.830> you've<00:02:50.310> got<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.519> little<00:02:50.970> bit<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.269> brown

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.640 
here I put a fair bit on because then
we're<00:05:56.280> going<00:05:56.430> to<00:05:56.520> use<00:05:56.760> a<00:05:56.970> ruler<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:58.139> really

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.290 
we're going to use a ruler to really
smooth<00:05:59.039> it<00:05:59.220> off<00:05:59.370> you<00:05:59.789> can<00:05:59.940> use<00:06:00.060> an<00:06:00.180> offset

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
smooth it off you can use an offset

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.909 
smooth it off you can use an offset
spatula<00:06:00.870> but<00:06:00.960> because<00:06:01.229> it's<00:06:01.380> such<00:06:01.530> a<00:06:01.560> tall

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
spatula but because it's such a tall

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.500 
spatula but because it's such a tall
