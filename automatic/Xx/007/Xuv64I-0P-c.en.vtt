00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.660
 sperm is produced 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:15.000
 thank you first of all 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.920
 ask why do you need it with 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.070
 first large quantities probably you 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.140
 wanted to ask 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.050
 which products will i most of all 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.970
 feel like a man then this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 completely different conversation and so let's 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.619
 let's talk about what is our essence 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.390
 sexual nutrition means so we all 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.239
 remember first that way to the heart 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.489
 men lies through his stomach therefore 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.960
 ladies don't forget to feed your 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.260
 halves that's why because you can 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.050
 highlight and two major components 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.390
 even three that how using 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.579
 nutritional influential masculine 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.610
 component of men so the first moment 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.780
 what does a man need to 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.280
 testosterone is formed to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.010
 generally feel like a man and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.600
 where the clouds for the male forces mean it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.390
 there will be proteins and carbohydrates vitamins 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.450
 mineral elements and of course fat and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.950
 here are all those who are there to dry in the gym 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.530
 sits us abundantly 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.630
 without a fat diet for the purpose of losing weight and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.360
 minimizes the amount of fat diet 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.180
 make it extremely wrong to eat 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.700
 eat wisely need to choose what to eat 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.520
 but absolutely fat and it is impossible to clean fats it 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.970
 what then testosterone is made of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.700
 and if you will be very systematic 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.320
 constantly sit on hippo cholesterol during 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.960
 a low fat diet you very soon 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.110
 make a hormonal imbalance 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.490
 therefore, fats should be ingested 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.860
 it was the first important component 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.100
 the second important ingredient is nutrition 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.579
 man must be high-calorie all 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.320
 This is generally the main whale 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.299
 the only one worth everything 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.930
 the rest if a man will eat 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.260
 only weed 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.460
 I give it a barley cooked and in a pile 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.580
 dots without salt sugar and oilless 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.330
 that very soon he has his whole exchange 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.370
 substances and all of it in general 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.160
 the driving force will be vital directed 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.770
 to maintain this driving force with him 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.780
 there will be no forces not that on sex 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.550
 no matter what 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.260
 somehow hold out so as not to fall 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.870
 so the power of men should be 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.080
 high-calorie and third moment 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.620
 the most favorite I think so is for the sake of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.140
