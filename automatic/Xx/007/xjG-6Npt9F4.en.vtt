happens<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.460> let's<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
happens you know let's get out of the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.709 
happens you know let's get out of the
frost<00:00:52.860> circle<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.670> will<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.390> floor

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
frost circle that will be on the floor

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.110 
frost circle that will be on the floor
because<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.320> will<00:00:55.530> ease<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> lot<00:00:56.789> between

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
because that will ease you a lot between

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.470 
because that will ease you a lot between
between<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.109> three<00:00:58.379> K<00:00:58.590> damage<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
between two and three K damage so it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
between two and three K damage so it
really<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.170> sucks<00:01:01.260> when<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.070> not

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.910 
really really sucks when you get not
when<00:01:03.090> don't<00:01:03.420> notice<00:01:03.870> them<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.559> die

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
when don't notice them and you die

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070 
when don't notice them and you die
because<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.250> these<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.270> annoying<00:01:06.570> in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
because of these that's just annoying in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.520 
because of these that's just annoying in
this<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.460> able<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.970> around<00:01:09.530> 350
