00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.210
 levers are also the showstoppers 2015 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.490
 and now we actually have that 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.559
 upstream in the hand that is in principle 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.570
 a very compact pc as you can see 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.119
 Fits he would be relative in my big 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.860
 hand is definitely a look becomes too 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.160
 say an extreme computing that is 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.420
 what intel as a small new pc generation 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.769
 bringing to market is for the desktop 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.759
 but mainly for the living room 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.080
 just this one 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.519
 There are still a few villas in it 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.660
 a bit better equipped that 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.310
 here is mainly the streaming 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.410
 So machine is intended for netbooks a 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.540
 similar tip has been used in 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.129
 the case in the internet so one 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.899
 virtual ossi in it is not an atom 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.120
 but a celeron that had the 29 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.500
 57 o'clock is a very simple one 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.530
 outfit two gigabytes 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.910
 RAM 32 GB flash memory da 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.680
 then you hear that all for 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.699
 spring is because it is all about 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.440
 therefore content from the internet 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.820
 to play and not just that 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.590
 to save things on it or own 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.559
 to play movies on the profit 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.660
 but just the part as 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.289
 They used more , so to speak, with windows 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.790
 in that case 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.150
 we have the on and off switch here 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.370
 of course two usb 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.870
 a key of the normal note that 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.210
 is in it today and on the 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.250
 back there is a power connection 2 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.050
 display connections once hdmi in full 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.820
 size and a displayport in full 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.070
 size so that next to the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.150
 Customers then display two displays 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.470
 i think i'm even in chat 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.240
 switch then we have two more 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.190
 more usb ports is enough 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.390
 proper connection provided the internet 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.100
 Connection ensures the fast 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.630
 Internet connection would even have children 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.640
 with internet there is also wlan there 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.020
 in it and bluetooth comes to it then 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.460
 the headphone jack is there 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 no sense if the order will not come off 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.610
 if my presentation uses to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.979
 Example in the shop window or similar 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.510
 and up here is the fan exit 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.940
 because the calculator gets down here 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.290
 from the base the air around the cpu too 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.660
 cool that is of course with the nice 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.220
 or the brazil chip that is not quite 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.080
 so brave but hp probably uses 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 just the same housing design as 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.979
 in the larger model and on the right 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.800
 there are still some pages left alive 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.360
 a full micro sd 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.640
 the map is there so full size 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.440
 in the case so that you also have media 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.670
 get on it if you want that one 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.720
 a quick look at the hp stream of the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.520
 470 dollars in the market starts 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.140
 soon and soon in europe 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.180
 Of course all clear is mostly about a 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.530
 Worldwide represented product all water 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.240
 we do not know how much europe costs 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.210
 Exactly but I would type that we 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.440
 move us at 180 to 200 euros what 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.090
 actually quite good you that for as 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.890
 a little bit pc respectively 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.480
 his office desktops 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.810
 That was a quick look at the steam 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.580
 at the ces 2015 at the schuster president 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.960
 and i was and for monarchis and if 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.480
 you said what we do on the 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.400
 channel because thumb up high subscribe 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.750
 follow on facebook twitter and google + 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.220

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.900
