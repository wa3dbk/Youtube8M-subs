for Christmas okay so let's start with

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.490 
for Christmas okay so let's start with
the<00:00:08.700> cord<00:00:09.000> in<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.179> jack<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> jack<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.469> a

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
the cord in the jack so the jack is a

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.039 
the cord in the jack so the jack is a
standard<00:00:11.280> 3.5<00:00:12.650> millimeter<00:00:13.650> jack<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:15.049> three

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
standard 3.5 millimeter jack and three

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.320 
standard 3.5 millimeter jack and three
rings<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.590> third<00:00:16.890> ring<00:00:17.220> third<00:00:17.850> black<00:00:18.060> ring

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
rings the third ring third black ring

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.140 
rings the third ring third black ring
there<00:00:18.510> means<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.960> has<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> microphone<00:00:19.830> input<00:00:20.150> so

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
there means it has a microphone input so

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.849 
there means it has a microphone input so
let's<00:00:21.359> go<00:00:21.570> up<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> cord<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> cord<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
let's go up the cord the cord is a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.250 
let's go up the cord the cord is a
pretty<00:00:23.160> good<00:00:23.400> quality<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:24.119> feels<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
pretty good quality it feels like the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.390 
pretty good quality it feels like the
same<00:00:25.560> type<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.949> material<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> commercial

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
same type of material that a commercial

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.710 
same type of material that a commercial
extension<00:00:29.400> cord<00:00:29.670> would<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.910> made<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
extension cord would be made of just a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
extension cord would be made of just a
lot<00:00:30.929> thinner<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.880> it's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
lot thinner so it would be like it's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.810 
lot thinner so it would be like it's
strong<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.350> feel<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> string<00:00:35.160> okay

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
strong you can just feel the string okay

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
strong you can just feel the string okay
so<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.480> kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.930> hard<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> see

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
so I know this is kind of hard to see

and if you're looking at a lot at it in
the<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.509> angle<00:01:34.520> see<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.210> like

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the right angle see there we go like

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.620 
the right angle see there we go like
that<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.079> see<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:39.119> pretty

severe however you can just go like that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
severe however you can just go like that
I<00:01:42.960> thought<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> would<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> uniform<00:01:44.250> look

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
I thought it would be a uniform look

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.609 
I thought it would be a uniform look
kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:44.939> those<00:01:45.210> wild<00:01:45.689> beige<00:01:45.930> couches

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
kind of like those wild beige couches

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
kind of like those wild beige couches
alright<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.280> another<00:01:47.369> handy<00:01:47.790> feature<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.210> this

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
alright so another handy feature of this

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.090 
alright so another handy feature of this
is<00:01:48.570> how<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> rolls<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.890> can

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
is how it rolls up like that you can

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.460 
is how it rolls up like that you can
easily<00:01:50.490> fit<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.880> somewhere<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.290> go

like that go like that and now it is the
full<00:01:55.860> size<00:01:56.100> headphone<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
full size headphone so right here we

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.380 
full size headphone so right here we
have<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.530> left<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.159> white<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.119> is

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
have the left is white and the right is

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.080 
have the left is white and the right is
red<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.460> side<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.909> don't

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
red so if it's like this side you don't

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.179 
red so if it's like this side you don't
even<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.540> them<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.710> you

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
even see them you see it like that you

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.639 
even see them you see it like that you
know<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:06.149> how<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.509> goes<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.350> pretty

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
know that's how it goes and it's pretty

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.339 
know that's how it goes and it's pretty
easy<00:02:07.759> now<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> side<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.020> do

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
easy now on the side so you see they do

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.809 
easy now on the side so you see they do
expand

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
expand

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.170 
expand
and<00:02:11.939> that<00:02:12.150> goes<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.569> both<00:02:13.290> sides<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.640> they<00:02:14.909> can

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
and that goes for both sides so they can

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.890 
and that goes for both sides so they can
get<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:16.459> pretty<00:02:17.459> big<00:02:17.670> size<00:02:17.909> can<00:02:18.329> fit<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> huge

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
get a pretty big size can fit a huge

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.520 
get a pretty big size can fit a huge
