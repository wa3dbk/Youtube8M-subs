00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.210

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.230
 the following is the poor urban been 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.230
 taken away from the poor 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:14.110

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.510

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.180
 ops and confirm because since it's going to 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.580
 start the cross 2 in a little bit and in a 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.750
 video black ops talk about what you think 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.750

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.250

 double I will say the triple 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.159
 so 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.159
 it would be a luxury 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.580
 beware of the h 6 that less total fear 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.269
 I'm very concentrated very little we see 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.030

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.090

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.350
 concentrate and try to save you 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.920
 thoughts 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.920
 with these 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.800
 Spanish 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 nervous 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.290
 it kills me 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:46.610
 how do you have an opportunity avoid failing 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:50.210
 because if it does not happen what happens the enemy 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.880

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.270

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.270

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.970
 the time the h 6 with a point so that you 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.160
 the dream that people had 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.639
 hello I put house in a simple package 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.740
 the serious instructions 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.740

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.700

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.430
 that this frank compared to the rest 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.290
 I like that I like 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.970
 example the bar and the other although it 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.970
 my mathematicians do the bolt 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.880
 I think it's very good 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.840
 do not 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.550
 we do not start to say that you 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.510
 recipes 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.510
 but if we steal it 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.200
 jackson 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.610

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.780
 that red this drink he was talking about 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.980

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.920
 giant with him yes you do too 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.060
 just saw the easiest now to do 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.060
 clicks for my point of view 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.030
 with this franc for example with 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.630
 any other is a matter of taste in 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.630
 question of everything 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.040
 and a lot 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.669
 they have already put a caustic sms 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:50.460
 the highest we will put small fast 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:53.419
 so many here in the background is that all well 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.419
 is that everyone here 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.440
 they catch me 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.440
 do not 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.470
 two 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.500
 a few days before 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:23.969
 just like doing time 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:26.159
 good for nothing is what you read one 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:29.069
 frank that I like quite a lot ago 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:31.020
 little hits marquez 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:32.309
 it's pretty easy to manage it to do 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.719
 that you use a lot of nothing for example better 

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:35.879
 that for example I embargo that something else 

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:37.979
 well this tried to make a market already 

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:39.870
 I will try some one series of crisis and 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:41.129
 things like that or if there were some delivered 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.080
 some text that I have made some prisoner 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:45.949
 you also do not want no or if it has been 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:50.159
 in the pure miracle that came to me once 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:51.809
 try I already generate it and nothing many 

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:53.339
 I hope all of you enjoy again and another 

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:57.589
 favorite helps a lot and see you the 

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:57.589
