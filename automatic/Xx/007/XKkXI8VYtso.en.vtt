00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.470
 Hello 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.820
 there are so many people convinced that the world is going badly than once 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.829
 that was how the terrible facts are now and so on and so forth 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.710
 here it is true that today there are absolutely shocking events 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.999
 but we must realize that 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:22.449
 before 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.449
 worse 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.189
 I along with we michele dotti if we have realized this book it is not true that 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.189
 everything is worse for the Italian missionary editor 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.569
 and in this book he collects a series of data 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:41.779
 scientific statistics etc. that prove just the opposite 

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:47.349
 despite appearances, the world is improving, aiming for millions and 

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:49.050
 millions of years think that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.309
 once at the origins of life on planet earth 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 there is only one of the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.590
 of asexual unicellular organisms did not make love pescara a 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.899
 multiplying it splits euros into two they were splitting that it didn't have to be one 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.300
 very nice thing 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.549
 only later 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.149
 millions and millions of years. out 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.649
 assessed reproduction which is one thing 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.799
 amazing and then we arrived 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.230
 to what sex is for us today, which is a very high end thing 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.130
 but beyond this, if you ask us, it is like things 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.380
 i really am 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.080
 we will find out that 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.290
 the Roman empire was a place of aberration and horror 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.490
 and when we also go to see are 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.119
 of the themes that you are there but not certain 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.580
 as an indicator of deterioration 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.170
 crime against pedophilia 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.690
 prostitution 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.670
 then we go on to verify what happened 50 60 years ago and we discover that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.359
 also in this case 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.620
 the situation was worse 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.620
 that is, we register today 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.090
 of the horror of some news stories 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.359
 once I wasn't even registered 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.850
 it was normal 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.320
 than in casinos in Italy 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.549
 rsi and to ask how it works price to be able to deflect is one 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.670
 the twelve year old girl 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.400
 it was normal 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.670
 because the maid the maid was raped by her master 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.010
 re and was not normal but not even perceived as something 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.979
 terrible 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:31.919
 just think about that 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:39.729
 until 1956 the Italian cassation reiterated the husband's right to 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:45.459
 beating his wife moderately this tells us what the level of violence was 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.990
 terrible if we take any indicator 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.080
 also the relative indicators the terrible topic of hunger in the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.820
 world 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.419
 we love 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.629
 and the fact that I'm getting better I'm saying that today we live in a world 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.960
 wonderful attention I am saying that today new people are hungry 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.659
 of the one I died in the 60s 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.790
 I'm saying that the possibility for someone who is born today in the third world 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.329
 to have a different life is sooo bigger than the one she was 50 years old 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.930
 in all these decades it makes all the people who are committed to good 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.780
 of the world 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.760
 for progress to the content of great results 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.049
 I believe it is important to say it 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.629
 slowly with enormous difficulty we are improving the situation in the world e 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.750
 this should give us hope 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.500
 and should give us the desire to do more work for 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.150
 a further change to get out of this world that is still horrible but 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.799
 it's not as horrible as it used to be 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.409
 the mechanism by which you so hard to get this idea through is that the 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:57.389
 newspapers 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.159
 televisions milk 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.919
 they love to tell disasters the horror norm against positive facts instead 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.730
 and then there is another element the people who have 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.819
 at my age or a few more years 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.279
 it is clear that he remembers with emotion when he was young 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.260
 balance in the body in good health 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.630
 it seems to you that then things were better but because you were young but 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.620
 this is not' 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.059
 a scientific fact 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:29.900
 echo this book we made is full of data from 

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:32.899
 statistics that show that things are not right 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.960
 sea ​​indeed hand 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.979
 better 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.409
 which I repeat does not mean that we must be satisfied with what we have 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.120
 today 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.129
 but 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.369
 that we can work to change reality even further
