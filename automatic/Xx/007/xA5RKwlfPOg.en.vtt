unveiling this morning of probably the
most<00:00:09.809> revolutionary<00:00:10.440> thing<00:00:10.559> I've<00:00:10.860> seen<00:00:11.160> from

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:11.640 
most revolutionary thing I've seen from

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.400 
most revolutionary thing I've seen from
the<00:00:11.910> show<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.360> far<00:00:12.600> it<00:00:12.690> may<00:00:12.810> be<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.140> the<00:00:13.170> show

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the show so far it may be for the show

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.340 
the show so far it may be for the show
and<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.680> is<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.190> corn<00:00:14.940> head<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.390> is<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:16.199> can

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
and that is a corn head that is you can

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.990 
and that is a corn head that is you can
actually<00:00:16.379> go<00:00:16.680> across<00:00:16.769> the<00:00:17.189> roads<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.820> the

actually go across the roads or with the
heroes<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:19.200> still<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.470> development

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
heroes and it's still in development

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.830 
heroes and it's still in development
stages<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:20.580> coming<00:00:20.880> soon<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.420> we'll

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
stages but it's coming soon and we'll

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.990 
stages but it's coming soon and we'll
need<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.170> everything<00:00:23.160> from<00:00:23.310> lodged<00:00:23.580> corn

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
need it for everything from lodged corn

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.660 
need it for everything from lodged corn
when<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.300> find<00:00:24.510> more<00:00:24.660> population<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.670> drilled

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
when we find more population to drilled

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.510 
when we find more population to drilled
corn<00:00:27.000> any<00:00:27.660> direction<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.380> eros<00:00:28.680> spacing<00:00:29.250> so

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
corn any direction in eros spacing so

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.959 
corn any direction in eros spacing so
really<00:00:30.240> neat<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:31.440> us<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:32.399> couple<00:00:32.609> of

the<00:00:38.489> independent<00:00:39.059> concept<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:39.929> corn<00:00:40.170> head

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the independent concept of the corn head

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.479 
the independent concept of the corn head
is<00:00:40.469> something<00:00:40.769> that<00:00:40.859> most<00:00:41.010> people<00:00:41.129> notice

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
is something that most people notice

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.059 
is something that most people notice
right<00:00:41.789> away<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> truly<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.289> a<00:00:43.319> concept

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:44.069 
right away but it truly is a concept

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:45.709 
right away but it truly is a concept
corn<00:00:44.339> head<00:00:44.550> we're<00:00:44.699> not<00:00:44.850> selling<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.420> corn

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
corn head we're not selling this corn

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.930 
corn head we're not selling this corn
head<00:00:45.929> now<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.889> don't<00:00:47.010> plan<00:00:47.249> to<00:00:47.460> introduce<00:00:47.609> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
head now we don't plan to introduce it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.059 
head now we don't plan to introduce it
for<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.299> least<00:00:48.420> three<00:00:48.719> years<00:00:48.899> into<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.679> market

for at least three years into the market

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.239 
for at least three years into the market
but<00:00:50.639> it's<00:00:50.789> been<00:00:50.969> under<00:00:51.179> development<00:00:51.329> for

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
but it's been under development for

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.709 
but it's been under development for
about<00:00:53.249> eight<00:00:53.399> years<00:00:53.429> now<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.089> we've<00:00:54.239> invested

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
about eight years now and we've invested

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.949 
about eight years now and we've invested
over<00:00:54.839> four<00:00:55.199> million<00:00:55.379> dollars<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.039> point

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:56.959 
over four million dollars to this point

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:00.110 
over four million dollars to this point
our<00:00:57.959> code<00:00:58.199> name<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> product<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.249> VC<00:00:59.789> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
our code name for the product was VC and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.119 
our code name for the product was VC and
the<00:01:00.389> first<00:01:00.659> one<00:01:00.839> was<00:01:00.989> vc<00:01:01.379> 1<00:01:01.589> and<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:01.859> we're<00:01:02.039> on

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the first one was vc 1 and now we're on

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.420 
the first one was vc 1 and now we're on
vc<00:01:02.579> 7<00:01:03.119> and<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.170> our<00:01:04.350> vc10<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.190> what<00:01:05.309> we're

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
vc 7 and we think our vc10 is what we're

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.460 
vc 7 and we think our vc10 is what we're
going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> introduce<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> market<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.320> as

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
going to introduce to the market but as

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.200 
going to introduce to the market but as
you<00:01:07.590> pointed<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> things<00:01:09.090> it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you pointed out one of the things it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.660 
you pointed out one of the things it
does<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.440> independent<00:01:10.440> it's<00:01:11.040> independent<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
does is independent it's independent of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330 
does is independent it's independent of
the<00:01:11.790> row<00:01:11.910> spacing<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.690> can<00:01:12.870> harvest<00:01:13.200> 15<00:01:13.830> 20

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the row spacing so we can harvest 15 20

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.120 
the row spacing so we can harvest 15 20
30<00:01:14.550> inch<00:01:14.790> rows<00:01:15.140> most<00:01:16.140> farmers<00:01:16.620> though<00:01:16.830> have

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
30 inch rows most farmers though have

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
30 inch rows most farmers though have
dedicated<00:01:17.700> themselves<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.450> particular<00:01:18.720> row

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
dedicated themselves to a particular row

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.470 
dedicated themselves to a particular row
so<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.800> feature<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.490> itself<00:01:20.850> isn't<00:01:21.150> where

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
so that feature in itself isn't where

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.370 
so that feature in itself isn't where
the<00:01:21.600> true<00:01:21.810> benefit<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.610> as<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.380> working

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the true benefit is as we see working

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.050 
the true benefit is as we see working
with<00:01:25.530> companies<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.010> pioneer<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.700> Monsanto

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
with companies like pioneer in Monsanto

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.700 
with companies like pioneer in Monsanto
and<00:01:27.420> some<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.750> largest<00:01:28.020> corn<00:01:28.350> growers

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and some of the largest corn growers

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.820 
and some of the largest corn growers
across<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> nation<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:31.050> quest<00:01:31.740> for

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
across the nation we see a quest for

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.310 
across the nation we see a quest for
higher<00:01:32.130> yields<00:01:32.640> over<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.690> last<00:01:33.870> few<00:01:34.140> decades

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
higher yields over the last few decades

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.530 
higher yields over the last few decades
we've<00:01:34.740> seen<00:01:34.950> massive<00:01:35.220> increases<00:01:35.790> we're

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
we've seen massive increases we're

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.720 
we've seen massive increases we're
averaging<00:01:36.720> around<00:01:37.050> 170<00:01:37.890> bushels<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> we

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
averaging around 170 bushels now and we

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.300 
averaging around 170 bushels now and we
expect<00:01:39.090> 200<00:01:40.050> bushels<00:01:40.470> plus<00:01:40.800> by<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> year

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
expect 200 bushels plus by the year

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.180 
expect 200 bushels plus by the year
twenty<00:01:41.580> 20<00:01:41.940> so<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.990> start<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.770> harvest

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
twenty 20 so as we start to harvest

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.040 
twenty 20 so as we start to harvest
these<00:01:44.310> massive<00:01:44.940> crops<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
these massive crops we see that the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.690 
these massive crops we see that the
conventional<00:01:46.620> concept<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> corn<00:01:47.400> headers

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
conventional concept of corn headers

enough we have too much trash on the
corn<00:01:52.890> head<00:01:53.270> we<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.420> very<00:01:54.690> huge<00:01:55.110> variances

one<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.370> morning<00:01:56.610> things<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.090> flowing

one in the morning things are flowing
well<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.870> by<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.050> afternoon<00:01:58.340> there's<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.400> lot

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
well but by the afternoon there's a lot

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.950 
well but by the afternoon there's a lot
of<00:01:59.670> chatter

so<00:02:02.560> we're<00:02:02.770> trying<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.130> accommodate<00:02:03.430> where<00:02:03.940> we

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
so we're trying to accommodate where we

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.960 
so we're trying to accommodate where we
see<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.540> direction<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:05.320> corn<00:02:06.159> growing<00:02:06.549> this

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
see the direction of corn growing this

we're<00:02:29.140> trying<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.620> Wolfgang's<00:02:30.250> from<00:02:30.430> Germany

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
we're trying to Wolfgang's from Germany

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.030 
we're trying to Wolfgang's from Germany
from<00:02:30.970> our<00:02:31.390> Factory<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:31.780> Germany<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.739> he<00:02:32.920> has

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
from our Factory in Germany and he has

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.320 
from our Factory in Germany and he has
different<00:02:33.340> challenges<00:02:33.730> around<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.150> world

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
different challenges around the world

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.420 
different challenges around the world
and<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:35.260> not<00:02:35.410> only<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.709> North<00:02:35.950> American

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
and so it's not only the North American

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.830 
and so it's not only the North American

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
corn grower that we've had in mind but

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.310 
corn grower that we've had in mind but
it's<00:02:38.080> elsewhere<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.209> complete<00:02:41.140> what

it's elsewhere just to complete what

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.900 
it's elsewhere just to complete what
you're<00:02:41.470> saying<00:02:41.800> eight<00:02:42.100> years<00:02:42.400> that's<00:02:42.610> correct

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
you're saying eight years that's correct

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.790 
you're saying eight years that's correct
maybe<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.300> little<00:02:43.420> longer<00:02:43.720> than<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.350> started

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
maybe a little longer than we started

maybe a little longer than we started
buildings<00:02:45.430> he<00:02:45.610> said<00:02:46.530> there<00:02:47.530> were<00:02:47.620> little<00:02:47.830> lot

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
buildings he said there were little lot

buildings he said there were little lot
of<00:02:49.350> stupid<00:02:50.350> ideas<00:02:50.650> what<00:02:51.130> we<00:02:51.280> say<00:02:51.519> in<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
of stupid ideas what we say in the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.180 
of stupid ideas what we say in the
development<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:52.870> if<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.140> don't<00:02:53.380> do<00:02:53.800> stupid

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
development but if you don't do stupid

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.250 
development but if you don't do stupid
ideas<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.060> don't<00:02:55.300> get<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.720> these<00:02:55.989> results

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
ideas you don't get to these results

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.370 
ideas you don't get to these results
what<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:57.010> over<00:02:57.040> here<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.670> think<00:02:58.480> we<00:02:59.290> at

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
what we have over here I think we at

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.500 
what we have over here I think we at
least<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.769> seven<00:03:00.160> right<00:03:00.370> now<00:03:00.400> we<00:03:00.910> see<00:03:01.060> 10<00:03:01.269> I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
least in seven right now we see 10 I

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.180 
least in seven right now we see 10 I
think<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.840> be<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.200> right<00:03:02.380> direction<00:03:02.590> and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
think and be on the right direction and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.509 
think and be on the right direction and
we<00:03:04.120> have<00:03:04.269> tested<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.840> machine<00:03:05.280> over<00:03:06.280> the

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
we have tested this machine over the

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.870 
we have tested this machine over the
past<00:03:07.049> they<00:03:08.049> are<00:03:08.140> let's<00:03:08.350> say<00:03:08.730> seven<00:03:09.730> eight

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
past they are let's say seven eight

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.880 
past they are let's say seven eight
years<00:03:09.910> in<00:03:10.420> each<00:03:10.570> country<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> world<00:03:11.410> South

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
years in each country of the world South

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.590 
years in each country of the world South
Africa<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.340> really<00:03:12.760> completely<00:03:13.150> different

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
Africa is really completely different

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.569 
Africa is really completely different
than<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.930> United<00:03:14.320> States<00:03:14.530> they<00:03:15.160> were<00:03:15.310> always

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
than the United States they were always

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.100 
than the United States they were always
up<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.299> 90<00:03:16.690> inch<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.670> they<00:03:19.329> looking<00:03:19.840> always

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
up to 90 inch and so they looking always

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.009 
up to 90 inch and so they looking always
for<00:03:20.350> some<00:03:20.950> different<00:03:21.430> kind<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:22.019> planting

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
for some different kind of planting

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.319 
for some different kind of planting
systems<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.620> know<00:03:23.799> they<00:03:24.040> plan<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:24.310> 90<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:24.940> 60

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
systems you know they plan on 90 and 60

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.080 
systems you know they plan on 90 and 60
in<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.660> plan<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.110> 36<00:03:26.680> then<00:03:27.130> they<00:03:27.280> played<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.640> 22

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
in the plan on 36 then they played in 22

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.539 
in the plan on 36 then they played in 22
and<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.390> next<00:03:28.630> row<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:28.870> 90<00:03:29.380> again<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.040> all

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
and the next row is 90 again and all

and the next row is 90 again and all
these<00:03:30.850> ideas<00:03:31.030> what<00:03:31.420> farmers<00:03:31.690> try<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.959> do<00:03:32.170> we

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
these ideas what farmers try to do we

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.940 
these ideas what farmers try to do we
try<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.220> get<00:03:33.790> solutions<00:03:34.329> at<00:03:34.510> four<00:03:34.950> yeah

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
try to get solutions at four yeah

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.229 
try to get solutions at four yeah
there's<00:03:36.220> there's<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.640> lot<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.820> different<00:03:37.150> ways

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
there's there's a lot of different ways

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.360 
there's there's a lot of different ways
you<00:03:37.269> can<00:03:37.420> modify<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.959> machine<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:39.220> we've

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
you can modify this machine so we've

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.770 
you can modify this machine so we've
