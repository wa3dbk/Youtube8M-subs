00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.330
 dear friends welcome to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.770
 magnificent sea yacht palma to sochi 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.230
 under the flag of autoradio 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.200
 every day from here from the Kiev pier 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.340
 train station she departs for a magnificent 3 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.340
 hour river walk 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.450
 this boat is unique in that it arrived to 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.190
 us specifically and sochi and she is the only 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.190
 sea on all the Moscow River 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.970
 our city is extremely beautiful and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.720
 surprisingly it looks exactly from the water 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.190
 It seems to me that to show Moscow 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.010
 it is necessary to take a ride on the ship 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.440
 autoradio yet it certainly is for us it 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.420
 a way to enable people without 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 which we don't exist as a radio 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.450
 having rested the author's grandfather in general is certainly not 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.280
 the ship is an aircraft carrying cruiser having 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.710
 great strategic value for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.140
 future edema broadcasting because 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.470
 that he overcomes unhindered 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.790
 water spaces despite all market 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.570
 and macroeconomic indicators 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.220
 international setting 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.229
 this is a very good project he gives 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.630
 opportunity to listen to visit 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.229
 the ship in the summer season is beautiful 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.229
 Moscow River 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.880
 Here's how to put it really 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.370
 it is impossible not to admire 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.770
 this and of course the greatest 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.800
 the pleasure here is the left half 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.620
 rather along the right nature this park 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.950
 probably yes like conv love park 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.080
 bitter 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.060
 look at the cork there we understand that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.820
 we are in Moscow but at the same time now 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.240
 but as if on vacation, and this is the whole 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.240
 the buzz 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.100
 wind the sun for somehow more 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.710
 removed from the ground is completely different here 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.420
 state of feeling like right there very much 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:32.990
 calm is different here and in the street 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.910
 just under 40 or 3d + 100 probably 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.890
 it seems to me the most optimal 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.890
 solutions to relax on the water 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.269
 I daughters tray and we took the war itself 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.450
 although of course her schedule is not very 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.549
 difficult thank you struck for tearing away from 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.140
 production is included even now we 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.390
 traveling on the Moscow River 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.370
 and look at the city and very different 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.510
 eyes completely different look very cool 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.510
 thank you autoradio 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.200
 now will be my favorite place in 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.190
 Moscow is ready to appear in such places 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.319
 much more often 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.840
 something new is opening up 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.810
 which is never a video and from this 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.640
 probably even better hope 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.330
 that it will be much more frequent 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.370
 such meetings 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.349
 great pleasure huge mouth here 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.220
 a lot of friends is a nice cutter 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:44.290
 permanently accomplish the dynamics you constantly 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.920
 you are in motion and you are full of different 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.549
 impressions 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.549
 this is very 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.190
 not 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.560
 strattera
