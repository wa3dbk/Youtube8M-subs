00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.250 
happen but it did it just takes a lot
longer<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.530> some<00:02:14.069> reason<00:02:14.400> with<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.700> type<00:02:15.000> of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
longer for some reason with this type of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.059 
longer for some reason with this type of
stuff<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.620> use<00:02:16.830> brake<00:02:17.129> cleaner<00:02:17.239> or

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
stuff so you can use brake cleaner or

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.440 
stuff so you can use brake cleaner or
you're<00:02:20.069> gonna<00:02:20.160> use<00:02:20.459> lacquer<00:02:20.760> thinner<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.390> I

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
you're gonna use lacquer thinner but I

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.380 
you're gonna use lacquer thinner but I
think<00:02:21.750> since<00:02:22.110> as<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.519> see<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.940> basically

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
think since as you can see it basically

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.500 
think since as you can see it basically
just<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.739> peeling<00:02:26.069> off<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.670> lot<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.849> places<00:02:27.120> I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
just is peeling off in a lot of places I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
just is peeling off in a lot of places I
don't<00:02:27.569> think<00:02:27.810> I'll<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.019> able<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.230> show<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
don't think I'll be able to show you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.780 
don't think I'll be able to show you
what<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.069> lacquer<00:02:29.280> thinner<00:02:29.640> does<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.299> of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
what the lacquer thinner does it kind of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.910 
what the lacquer thinner does it kind of
gets<00:02:32.790> rid<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.510> different<00:02:33.930> way<00:02:34.110> but

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
gets rid of it in a different way but

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.240 
gets rid of it in a different way but
either<00:02:35.310> way<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:37.110> I'll<00:02:37.319> just<00:02:37.590> sit<00:02:37.799> here<00:02:37.830> with<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
either way so I'll just sit here with a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.550 
either way so I'll just sit here with a
rag<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.910> try<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.269> peel<00:02:39.870> some<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.319> off

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
rag and try and peel some of this off

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.390 
rag and try and peel some of this off
and<00:02:42.260> then<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.380> should<00:02:43.530> look<00:02:43.680> brand-new<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
and then it should look brand-new and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.860 
and then it should look brand-new and
I'll<00:02:44.519> show<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:44.910> what<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.390> looks<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.660> and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
