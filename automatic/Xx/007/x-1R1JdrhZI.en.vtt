00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
though Walcott did breakthrough I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.609 
though Walcott did breakthrough I
thought<00:01:33.659> he<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> pace<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
thought he was going to get the pace to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.780 
thought he was going to get the pace to
get<00:01:34.770> ahead<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.159> centre-back<00:01:35.579> but

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
get ahead of a centre-back but

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
get ahead of a centre-back but
unfortunately<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.420> could<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> shot<00:01:37.560> off
