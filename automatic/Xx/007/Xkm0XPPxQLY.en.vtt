one in particular it is kind of like the
same<00:00:58.640> material<00:00:59.640> as<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.850> side<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.600> iphone

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
same material as the side of the iphone

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.009 
same material as the side of the iphone
4<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.410> made<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.820> basically<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
4 is made of and it's basically all the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
4 is made of and it's basically all the
way<00:01:04.110> around<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.070> exactly<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> same

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
way around it's not exactly the same

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.390 
way around it's not exactly the same
color<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.600> looks<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.100> it's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
color but it looks like it so it's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.580 
color but it looks like it so it's
really<00:01:08.580> cool<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.689> also<00:01:09.869> does<00:01:10.170> come<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
really cool it also does come with the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679 
really cool it also does come with the
home<00:01:10.830> button<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.310> i<00:01:11.460> think<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.299> home

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
home button but i think that the home

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.170 
home button but i think that the home
button<00:01:12.900> black<00:01:13.260> looks<00:01:13.530> better<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.939> really

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
button black looks better so it really

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.700 
button black looks better so it really
gives<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.450> cool<00:01:15.659> look<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> actually<00:01:16.439> kind<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
gives a cool look and actually kind of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.179 
gives a cool look and actually kind of
looks<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.600> white<00:01:18.600> iphone<00:01:18.780> 4<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> can

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
looks like the white iphone 4 so you can

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.350 
looks like the white iphone 4 so you can
see<00:01:20.310> right<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> goes<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.240> way

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
see right here it goes all the way

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.510 
see right here it goes all the way
around<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.470> skin<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.310> around

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
around and this is a skin going around

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.390 
around and this is a skin going around
because<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.479> looks<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.080> normal<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.220> see

experiences with them here we have the
white<00:01:40.130> carbon<00:01:41.130> fiber<00:01:41.430> these<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:42.299> very

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
white carbon fiber these are very very

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.399 
white carbon fiber these are very very
similar<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.670> carbons<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.020> have

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
similar to the I carbons that I have

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.499 
similar to the I carbons that I have
reviewed<00:01:46.590> before<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.610> haven't<00:01:48.149> tried<00:01:48.329> this

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
reviewed before I haven't tried this

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.630 
reviewed before I haven't tried this
because<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> was<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.079> excited<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.560> try<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.009> one

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
because I was so excited to try this one

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.420 
because I was so excited to try this one
right<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> um<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.250> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
right here so um I really like that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.240 
right here so um I really like that
these<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.659> stick<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.350> well<00:01:55.560> they

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
these just stick on so well they

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.770 
these just stick on so well they
actually<00:01:56.430> stick<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> little<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.329> better<00:01:57.479> than

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
actually stick a little bit better than

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
actually stick a little bit better than
the<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.200> carbons<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.820> reviewed

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the I carbons that I have reviewed

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.139 
the I carbons that I have reviewed
before<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:01.140> much<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.649> hate<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.399> say<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> really

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
before as much as I hate to say I really

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.330 
before as much as I hate to say I really
like<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.540> carbons<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.710> these<00:02:04.890> stick<00:02:05.159> better

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
like I carbons but these stick better

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.389 
like I carbons but these stick better
