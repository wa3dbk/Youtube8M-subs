00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
find this helpful so first of all you'll

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.100 
find this helpful so first of all you'll
take<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:09.030> X<00:01:09.960> Y<00:01:10.110> Z<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.950> Xyz<00:01:11.430> monster<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.960> is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
take an X Y Z in Xyz monster and this is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
take an X Y Z in Xyz monster and this is
as<00:01:13.229> simple<00:01:13.409> literally<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:14.430> simple<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
as simple literally as simple as it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.080 
as simple literally as simple as it
seems<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.630> number<00:01:18.630> ten<00:01:18.869> illuminate

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
seems so this is number ten illuminate

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.060 
seems so this is number ten illuminate
and<00:01:21.439> what<00:01:22.439> happens<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.189> says<00:01:23.930> one<00:01:24.930> level<00:01:25.350> 1

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and what happens is it says one level 1

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
and what happens is it says one level 1
or<00:01:26.369> 3<00:01:26.670> level<00:01:26.970> 4<00:01:27.000> monsters<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> shows

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
or 3 level 4 monsters and then it shows

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.149 
or 3 level 4 monsters and then it shows
the<00:01:28.860> effect<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.540> means<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.159> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the effect so what that means is you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.240 
the effect so what that means is you
have<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.460> 3<00:01:33.000> level<00:01:33.720> 4<00:01:33.930> monsters<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.009> right

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
have to have 3 level 4 monsters so right

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.880 
have to have 3 level 4 monsters so right
here<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:36.119> 2<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> thought<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.439> two<00:01:37.650> at

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
here I have 2 I thought it was two at

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
here I have 2 I thought it was two at
first<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.310> didn't<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:38.790> read<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:40.049> it's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
first I didn't actually read it but it's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.760 
first I didn't actually read it but it's
three<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> don't<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.520> that's<00:01:41.790> why<00:01:41.970> um<00:01:42.770> but

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
three I don't use this that's why um but

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
three I don't use this that's why um but
this<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.399> -<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:44.850> find<00:01:45.240> one

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
this is actually - but you just find one

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.160 
this is actually - but you just find one
more<00:01:45.630> level<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.430> level<00:01:47.899> you'd<00:01:48.899> find

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
more level you know the level you'd find

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
more level you know the level you'd find
one<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> those<00:01:49.799> you'd<00:01:50.070> find<00:01:50.310> three<00:01:50.640> of

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
one more of those you'd find three of

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.469 
one more of those you'd find three of
these<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.450> you'd<00:01:54.450> have

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
these and what you do is you'd have

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.179 
these and what you do is you'd have
let's<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.439> two<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> field

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
let's say you have two on the field

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.090 
let's say you have two on the field
right<00:01:57.110> this<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.590> your<00:01:58.649> Extra<00:01:59.070> Deck

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
right this would be in your Extra Deck

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.700 
right this would be in your Extra Deck
numbers<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.030> synchros<00:02:00.719> both<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> extra

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
numbers and synchros both on the extra

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.959 
numbers and synchros both on the extra
deck<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:04.409> let's<00:02:05.070> say<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.310> had<00:02:05.430> two<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:05.880> you

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
deck so let's say you had two then you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.389 
deck so let's say you had two then you
had<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.540> level<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.799> place<00:02:08.099> that

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
had one more level for you place that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.820 
had one more level for you place that
then<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.149> detach<00:02:09.539> these<00:02:09.929> you'd<00:02:10.229> stack<00:02:10.590> them

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
then you detach these you'd stack them

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.370 
then you detach these you'd stack them
like<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.940> then<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.870> third

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
like this and then the third

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.820 
like this and then the third
and<00:02:13.650> then<00:02:14.070> you'd<00:02:14.220> put<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:14.730> top<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.180> what

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and then you'd put this on top and what

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.040 
and then you'd put this on top and what
every<00:02:16.830> Xyz<00:02:17.280> monster<00:02:17.550> has<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.330> an<00:02:18.450> effect<00:02:18.810> with

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
every Xyz monster has is an effect with
