00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello me it's elodie I'm here 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.960
 president of the association since 2012 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.580
 so that is a small year 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.700
 probably the youngest president 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.750
 who was in this choir I believe 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.580
 so the choir is the rainbow 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.410
 swingers it's a university choir 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.300
 which has been around for a good 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.410
 years before we were affiliated with the kke 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.600
 uc and so we are a choir that has 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.789
 already a lot of singers we are more 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.710
 a hundred this year students 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.240
 French and foreigners that's what we 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.160
 likes students of employees 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.569
 everyone of all levels of everything 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.719
 age and that's what makes our wealth 

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:37.789
 that's why we like it 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.039
 me it's me these manias and I'm the 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.440
 responsible party tables for the choir 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.269
 and especially in fact I'm part of it 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.239
 for a long time my name is 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.120
 habib sy mexican and it's my tenth 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.819
 year here in the choir I love 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.299
 singing I've been singing since ever since 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.449
 small 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:58.879
 so it was really interesting for me 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.600
 and I believe that since the first 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.020
 repetition I fell in love with 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.620
 the choir because the super ejection 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.790
 nice and it's a kind of family and 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.550
 a really really nice atmosphere me 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.940
 I love this choir I find 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.230
 really too much fun the number of 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.540
 times when I arrived 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.410
 he is really depressed tired at the beginning 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.300
 repeat and I'm leaving hmh and I'm 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:36.210
 tell everything and I tear dakar and 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.450
 the mind always stays like that too 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.740
 nice and very nice hello so I 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 am neither the head of hadji 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.930
 the choir director for me is a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.460
 group is very lively both end 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.100
 as a group 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.220
 people who are in his very open 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.040
 and want to discover things 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.050
 are starters for all 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.940
 experiences there are concerts 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.170
 weird they are starting offers 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.130
 staged they have come here 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.260
 to sing but they are starting 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.510
 all the same but at the same time 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.600
 living too because it's never the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.370
 same people if there is a lot of 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.450
 people who constantly arrive and I 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.430
 find it very pleasant 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.400
 finally difficult to manage but very 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.060
 nice because humanly it's 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.110
 very interesting 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.090
 this is a group that is 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 humanly and very interestingly I have a 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.690
 group of players studying morning in 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.830
 this choir me I found 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.270
 friends of super good friends you get 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.090
 found every Wednesday for 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.570
 the moment from 18h to 20h at the arch 2 on 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.690
 the campus 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.580
 it can change what we like to do 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.430
 it's singing songs of all 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.090
 origins of all the languages â€‹â€‹of all 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.340
 styles 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.990
 the first step is to find a 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.310
 repertoire that suits them and me 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.020
 agree once we've found 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.190
 repertoire we build shows 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.450
 for me the idea is not concerts 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.620
 and shows earlier that is to say 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.980
 with a staging there 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.540
 or 1 in any case we also work on 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.220
 the visual aspect because for me it's 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.659
 very important and I believe they there 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.709
 were risi adhere much better than 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.870
 other hearts they are pretty dynamic 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.510
 over there then here during 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.950
 repetitions my main job that does not 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.280
 does not tell himself what I 'm going to say it had to 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.620
 do this terrain but also their 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.510
 to learn the songs for me it's 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.950
 really the business card of 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.230
 rainbow saissac know it's not that 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.829
 concerts there are things going on 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.970
 hear and see there are universes 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.650
 so I guess if you like this 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.870
 video is that you are more or less 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.250
 interested in what we do then if 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.900
 you are interested already as a 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.190
 spectator could come to see us in 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.260
 concert it will give you a good idea 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.150
 what we do and if you are still 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.069
 more interested in becoming a choir singer 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.840
 and whatever your level your 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.640
 originate your age or whatever 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.250
 anything can always come 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.900
 to see us we accept everyone to little 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.170
 near to the inca at any moment of 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.209
 year 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.579
 you can find us on the networks 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.739
 our email address and we even 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.109
 a phone can reach us 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.730
 and the idea for me especially is that 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.639
 during those two hours we learn is 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.579
 advance but consumes 10 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.960
 musically month the choir that 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.720
 bring me joy 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.000
 this choir she brings me a lot 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.010
 joy I saw him as an appointment 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.080
 it's habdomadaire but it's even more 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.390
 that we spend time singing 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.000
 spend time seeing each other we establish 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.350
 projects it's super interesting and the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.990
 more it's really at the moment of 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.840
 concerts when we find ourselves there especially 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.030
 we are 70 80 on stage we release a 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.470
 energy that is really huge and I 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.720
 finds that the feeling from the point of view 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.890
 of the chorister is something that 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.590
 really like and that's what pushes me 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.790
 to stay in the choir for now 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.710
 and I think it's really a 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.750
 sharing between the singers and also 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.920
 with the audience everyone etc at small 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.460
 I have everyone in this same 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.050
 energy 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.450
 it's really something magical 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.850
 that we do not find importance if you 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.700
 want to sing if you want you want 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.130
 meet very nice people if you 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.980
 want to have fun 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.060
 if you want to learn sundance chains 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.710
 and our language 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:08.580
 you can come and I believe that and you 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.580
 do not want to regret it 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.920
 and
