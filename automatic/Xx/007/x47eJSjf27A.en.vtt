00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
hello again okay in this tutorial we're

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.200 
hello again okay in this tutorial we're
going<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.680> talk<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.100> adding<00:00:06.000> hair<00:00:06.710> and<00:00:07.710> this

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
going to talk about adding hair and this

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.330 
going to talk about adding hair and this
maneuver<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.750> be<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.370> more<00:00:11.630> advanced

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
maneuver is going to be a more advanced

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.770 
maneuver is going to be a more advanced
tutorial<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.670> because<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.599> little

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
tutorial just because it's it's a little

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.310 
tutorial just because it's it's a little
bit<00:00:15.900> harder<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:17.609> maneuver<00:00:18.170> you're<00:00:19.170> going

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
bit harder to to maneuver you're going

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.759 
bit harder to to maneuver you're going
to<00:00:19.380> create<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.680> couple<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:21.380> couple<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.439> copies

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
to create a couple of a couple of copies

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.859 
to create a couple of a couple of copies
of<00:00:22.920> your<00:00:23.070> background<00:00:23.580> layer<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.000> you're

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
of your background layer and you're

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.339 
of your background layer and you're
going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> work<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> very<00:00:26.010> top<00:00:26.250> one

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
going to work with the very top one

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.150 
going to work with the very top one
because<00:00:28.349> you're<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> need<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.980> add<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
because you're going to need to add a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.999 
because you're going to need to add a
layer<00:00:29.400> mask<00:00:29.689> in<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:30.990> bit<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.349> work<00:00:31.859> with

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
layer mask in a little bit so work with

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.580 
layer mask in a little bit so work with
the<00:00:32.099> top<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.809> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:33.960> you're<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> use

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the top one and then you're going to use

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.319 
the top one and then you're going to use
your<00:00:34.739> clone<00:00:35.070> tool<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.370> you're<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
your clone tool and you're going to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.160 
your clone tool and you're going to
click<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:37.340> some<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.430> her<00:00:38.579> hair<00:00:38.640> click<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.690> right

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
click on some of her hair click on right

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
click on some of her hair click on right
there<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> then<00:00:42.149> you're<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
there and then you're just going to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.250 
there and then you're just going to
start<00:00:43.020> cloning<00:00:45.320> her<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.340> obviously

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
start cloning her here and obviously

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.090 
start cloning her here and obviously
we're<00:00:52.260> gonna<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.770> back<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> paint

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
we're gonna have to go back in and paint

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.279 
we're gonna have to go back in and paint
her<00:00:56.100> back<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:58.190> but<00:00:59.510> that's<00:01:00.510> how<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.719> start<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
her back in but that's how you start it

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.650 
her back in but that's how you start it
and<00:01:02.190> you're<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> create<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.390> layer<00:01:03.629> mask

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and you're going to create a layer mask

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.580 
and you're going to create a layer mask
just<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.479> what<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.689> does<00:01:07.260> what

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
just like that and what this does what

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
just like that and what this does what
the<00:01:07.680> layer<00:01:07.830> mask<00:01:08.040> does<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> allows<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the layer mask does is it allows you to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.000 
the layer mask does is it allows you to
pull<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.250> underneath<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> you're

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
pull in what is underneath it so you're

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.880 
pull in what is underneath it so you're
going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> make<00:01:14.310> sure<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.580> that's<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.939> black

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
going to make sure that that's on black

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.800 
going to make sure that that's on black
and<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.880> paint<00:01:18.270> her<00:01:18.479> back

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and you're going to just paint her back

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.459 
and you're going to just paint her back
in<00:01:23.479> just<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.630> that

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.149 

you<00:01:28.469> should<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:28.920> very<00:01:28.950> careful<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.850> it's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
you should be very careful with it it's

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.469 
you should be very careful with it it's
it's<00:01:32.159> kind<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.520> hard<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> obviously

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it's kind of hard to do and obviously

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.289 
it's kind of hard to do and obviously
this<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.289> takes<00:01:34.829> some<00:01:35.069> time<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.549> you're

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this this takes some time so you're

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.319 
this this takes some time so you're
going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.719> take<00:01:36.960> very<00:01:37.969> just<00:01:38.969> be<00:01:39.090> very

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
let's go a little bit more of her hair

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.789 
let's go a little bit more of her hair
right<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.569> we<00:02:00.079> have<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.200> go<00:02:01.319> back<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.679> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
right there we have to go back in and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.180 
right there we have to go back in and
kind<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.159> mess<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:06.649> but<00:02:07.649> yeah<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:08.099> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
kind of mess with that but yeah like I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.390 
kind of mess with that but yeah like I
said<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.399> kind<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> difficult<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.400> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
said it's kind of a difficult one to to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.880 
said it's kind of a difficult one to to
maneuver<00:02:13.400> but<00:02:14.400> once<00:02:14.579> you<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.910> hang<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.209> it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
maneuver but once you get the hang of it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.300 
maneuver but once you get the hang of it
you'll<00:02:16.890> get<00:02:17.099> it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.309 

let's<00:02:20.310> pull<00:02:20.819> down<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.180> opacity<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.110> one

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
let's pull down the opacity and that one

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.890 
let's pull down the opacity and that one
come<00:02:22.709> off<00:02:22.860> get<00:02:23.730> rid<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.940> some<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> color<00:02:24.629> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
come off get rid of some of the color in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:38.210 
come off get rid of some of the color in
there<00:02:32.750> okay<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.799> make<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> mistake

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.180 
there okay and if you make a mistake
just<00:02:38.459> pull<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.940> back<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.239> white<00:02:39.859> paint<00:02:40.859> it<00:02:41.010> back

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
just pull it back to white paint it back

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.850 
just pull it back to white paint it back
in

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.780 

you<00:02:47.860> seem<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.430> little<00:02:48.610> bit<00:02:50.400> someone<00:02:51.400> takes<00:02:51.670> a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
you seem a little bit someone takes a

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.530 
you seem a little bit someone takes a
little<00:02:52.090> walk

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.180 

let's<00:02:58.540> harden<00:02:59.050> our<00:02:59.170> brush<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.440> little<00:02:59.800> bit<00:02:59.950> so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
let's harden our brush a little bit so

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.110 
let's harden our brush a little bit so
that<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.690> doesn't<00:03:01.690> give<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.989> fuzzy<00:03:02.440> effect

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
that it doesn't give that fuzzy effect

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:20.580 
that it doesn't give that fuzzy effect
you<00:03:04.800> pull<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.890> opacity<00:03:06.160> back<00:03:06.400> up<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:17.459> rat<00:03:19.590> is

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
you pull the opacity back up a rat is

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.530
