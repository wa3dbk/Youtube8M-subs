00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.230 

all<00:03:02.920> right<00:03:03.100> then<00:03:03.490> we're<00:03:03.580> going<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.760> have<00:03:03.910> James

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
all right then we're going to have James

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.570 
all right then we're going to have James
lat<00:03:04.570> B<00:03:04.840> flat<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.260> E<00:03:05.350> flat<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.810> half<00:03:08.580> and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
lat B flat and E flat up to half and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.050 
lat B flat and E flat up to half and
then<00:03:09.760> see<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.330> why<00:03:10.540> don't<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.870> fly<00:03:11.020> together

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
then see you why don't you fly together

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.370 
then see you why don't you fly together
and<00:03:13.060> then<00:03:14.020> down<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.590> flat<00:03:15.010> D<00:03:15.190> flat<00:03:15.220> after

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
and then down to a flat D flat after

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.450 
and then down to a flat D flat after
then<00:03:17.380> we're<00:03:17.470> going<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.650> have<00:03:17.770> a<00:03:17.980> flat<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.400> E

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
then we're going to have a flat and E

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.650 
then we're going to have a flat and E
flat<00:03:18.640> together<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.480> then<00:03:20.050> flip<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.410> F<00:03:21.660> what

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
flat together and then flip it to F what

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.480 
flat together and then flip it to F what
we<00:03:22.750> did<00:03:22.900> right<00:03:23.020> here<00:03:23.290> okay<00:03:23.590> kind<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:23.980> gives<00:03:24.430> it

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
we did right here okay kind of gives it

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.230 
we did right here okay kind of gives it
that<00:03:24.550> little<00:03:24.790> kind<00:03:25.060> of<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.180> country<00:03:25.600> homey<00:03:25.930> feel

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
that little kind of a country homey feel

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.090 
that little kind of a country homey feel
so<00:03:28.240> a<00:03:28.270> flattening<00:03:28.810> flight<00:03:28.990> together<00:03:29.140> blue<00:03:29.860> can

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
so a flattening flight together blue can

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.830 
so a flattening flight together blue can
do<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.760> same<00:03:30.970> thing<00:03:31.180> here<00:03:31.420> but<00:03:31.570> do<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.750> an

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
do the same thing here but do it an

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.190 
do the same thing here but do it an
octave<00:03:31.960> higher<00:03:32.850> okay<00:03:33.850> if<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.960> don't<00:03:35.080> like

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
octave higher okay if you don't like

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.670 
octave higher okay if you don't like
this<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.130> can<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.520> play<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:37.510> D<00:03:38.020> flat<00:03:38.230> chord<00:03:38.530> D

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
this you can just play a D flat chord D

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.410 
this you can just play a D flat chord D
flat<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.130> they<00:03:39.220> fly<00:03:39.400> together<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:40.120> then<00:03:40.210> play

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
flat and they fly together and then play

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.880 
flat and they fly together and then play
it<00:03:40.450> again<00:03:40.690> up<00:03:40.840> here<00:03:41.020> you<00:03:41.920> have<00:03:43.710> all<00:03:44.710> right

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:55.170 
it again up here you have all right
instead<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.310> them<00:03:47.640> all<00:03:48.640> right<00:03:54.000> let's<00:03:55.000> give

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
instead of them all right let's give

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.150 
instead of them all right let's give
them<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.420> low<00:03:55.600> E<00:03:55.840> flat

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
them a low E flat

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.870 
them a low E flat
up<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.760> be<00:03:57.910> flat<00:03:58.210> and<00:03:58.660> up<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.140> e<00:03:59.380> flat<00:03:59.880> then

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
up to be flat and up to this e flat then

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.850 
up to be flat and up to this e flat then
we're<00:04:00.970> going<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.150> have<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.480> flat<00:04:01.810> E<00:04:02.020> flat<00:04:02.200> G<00:04:02.650> flat

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
we're going to have a flat E flat G flat

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.240 
we're going to have a flat E flat G flat
together<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.600> then<00:04:05.260> back<00:04:05.440> down<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.800> low<00:04:05.980> D

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
together and then back down the low D

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.690 
together and then back down the low D
flat<00:04:06.580> up<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.720> flat<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.410> then<00:04:08.950> up<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.280> define

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
flat up to a flat and then up to define

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.760 
flat up to a flat and then up to define
a<00:04:09.730> nap<00:04:09.970> together<00:04:10.180> I'm<00:04:11.170> going<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.380> keep<00:04:11.560> going
