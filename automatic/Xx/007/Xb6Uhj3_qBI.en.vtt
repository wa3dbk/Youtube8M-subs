doing pretty crappy here and cheating a
bit<00:01:26.729> house<00:01:27.090> codes<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.600> say<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
bit house codes you could say but this

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.590 
bit house codes you could say but this
was<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.130> first<00:01:29.159> attempt<00:01:29.789> at<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.940> race<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.390> about

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
was my first attempt at a race and about

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.699 
was my first attempt at a race and about
at<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> time<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.649> Year<00:01:32.060> awards<00:01:33.319> is<00:01:34.319> Kimi

at the time to the Year awards is Kimi

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:41.750 
at the time to the Year awards is Kimi
räikkönen<00:01:35.340> next<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.209> Montoya

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.630 

and<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.720> multicolored<00:01:43.320> track<00:01:43.710> isn't<00:01:44.160> exactly

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and the multicolored track isn't exactly

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.510 
and the multicolored track isn't exactly
a<00:01:44.730> cakewalk<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:46.280> tight<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.580> punishing<00:01:48.210> needle

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
a cakewalk in tight and punishing needle

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.680 
a cakewalk in tight and punishing needle
but<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.700> looks<00:01:50.910> very<00:01:51.000> nice

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
but it looks very nice

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.770 
but it looks very nice
which<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.960> why<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:53.180> there<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.210> many

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
which is why I think there are many

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.010 
which is why I think there are many
modes<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.440> gameplay<00:01:55.860> there's<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.540> long<00:01:57.540> career

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
modes of gameplay there's a long career

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.730 
modes of gameplay there's a long career
that<00:01:58.440> spent<00:01:58.800> several<00:01:59.160> years<00:01:59.420> you<00:02:00.420> rise<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.560> as

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that spent several years you rise up as

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.580 
that spent several years you rise up as
a<00:02:01.830> rookie<00:02:02.130> driver<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.640> eventually<00:02:03.030> become

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
a rookie driver and eventually become

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.470 
a rookie driver and eventually become
but<00:02:04.590> true<00:02:05.090> but<00:02:06.230> world<00:02:07.230> champion<00:02:10.850> but<00:02:11.850> really

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
but true but world champion but really

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.030 
but true but world champion but really
it's<00:02:12.600> just<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.050> much<00:02:13.170> fun<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.800> race

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's just so much fun to just race

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.820 
it's just so much fun to just race
around<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.640> whatever<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:18.600> game<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.050> cause

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
challenging being left one sim but it's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.450 
challenging being left one sim but it's
accessible<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.340> anyone<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.100> put<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.430> a

line they're my favorites I also kind of

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.320 
line they're my favorites I also kind of
like<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:55.890> angular<00:02:56.459> one<00:02:56.850> over<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
like that we it's angular one over the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.520 
like that we it's angular one over the
shoulder<00:02:57.780> pads<00:02:58.550> first<00:02:59.550> it's<00:03:00.180> quite<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
shoulder pads first it's quite a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.680 
shoulder pads first it's quite a
different<00:03:01.530> angle<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.250> nice<00:03:03.090> way<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.360> see

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
different angle and a nice way to see

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.210 
different angle and a nice way to see
racers<00:03:04.610> like<00:03:08.480> pit<00:03:09.480> stops<00:03:09.810> are<00:03:10.110> accurate<00:03:10.890> and

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
racers like pit stops are accurate and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.350 
racers like pit stops are accurate and
fun<00:03:11.640> too

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
fun too

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.420 
fun too
it's<00:03:13.200> sort<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.350> like<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.530> mini<00:03:13.800> game<00:03:14.070> or<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
it's sort of like a mini game or a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.110 
it's sort of like a mini game or a
QuickTime<00:03:14.880> event<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.560> suppose<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.800> can<00:03:16.920> say

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
QuickTime event I suppose you can say
