00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
hair on the straws so with this I could

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.319 
hair on the straws so with this I could
just<00:00:39.360> put<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:40.340> play<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:41.879> bit

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
just put it on play with it a little bit

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.529 
just put it on play with it a little bit
and<00:00:42.719> I'm<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.710> door<00:00:43.969> this<00:00:44.969> color<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and I'm out the door this color is a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.510 
and I'm out the door this color is a
little<00:00:45.600> bright<00:00:48.170> but<00:00:49.170> I've<00:00:49.320> had<00:00:49.590> bright<00:00:50.070> colors

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
little bright but I've had bright colors

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.459 
little bright but I've had bright colors
in<00:00:50.640> my<00:00:50.760> hair<00:00:50.969> before<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.539> been<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> long

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
in my hair before it's just been a long

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.470 
in my hair before it's just been a long
time<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:53.910> pretty

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
time but I think this is a really pretty

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.160 
time but I think this is a really pretty
style<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.230> color<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.460> summer<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.170> again

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
style and color for the summer and again

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.430 
style and color for the summer and again
it<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> human<00:00:58.890> hair<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.670> if<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.840> curls<00:01:01.170> fall<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it is human hair so if the curls fall a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
it is human hair so if the curls fall a
little<00:01:01.739> bit<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> feel<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> strand<00:01:03.510> or

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
little bit or you feel that I strand or

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.450 
little bit or you feel that I strand or
two<00:01:03.809> needs<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.350> curl<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.159> probably

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
two needs to be curl you can probably

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.140 
two needs to be curl you can probably
use<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.770> really<00:01:07.770> small<00:01:08.040> curling<00:01:08.490> irons<00:01:08.850> about

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
use the really small curling irons about

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.700 
use the really small curling irons about
pinky<00:01:09.900> size<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:11.070> recur<00:01:11.790> some<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> strands

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
pinky size to recur some of the strands

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.760 
pinky size to recur some of the strands
and<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.890> also<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.369> easy<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:15.770> separate

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and it's also really easy to separate

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.429 
and it's also really easy to separate
some<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> strands<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.060> feel<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.439> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
some of the strands if you feel like the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.740 
some of the strands if you feel like the
curls<00:01:19.799> are<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> little

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
curls are a little

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.030 
curls are a little
bigger<00:01:21.470> than<00:01:21.590> what<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.070> like<00:01:23.620> yeah<00:01:24.620> I<00:01:24.830> think
