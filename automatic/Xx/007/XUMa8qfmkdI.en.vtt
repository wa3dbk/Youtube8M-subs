drive<00:02:05.160> here<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.819> anyways<00:02:06.209> so<00:02:06.920> Forester<00:02:07.920> this

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
drive here but anyways so Forester this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.710 
drive here but anyways so Forester this
one<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:09.000> as<00:02:09.470> 78,000<00:02:10.470> kilometers<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.720> guess

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
one here as 78,000 kilometers I guess

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.990 
one here as 78,000 kilometers I guess
that<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.650> T<00:02:15.170> /tp<00:02:16.170> model<00:02:16.680> which<00:02:17.580> has

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that is it is the T /tp model which has

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.740 
that is it is the T /tp model which has
auto<00:02:18.420> leveling<00:02:18.930> rear<00:02:18.990> suspension

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
auto leveling rear suspension

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.800 
auto leveling rear suspension
and<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:21.560> more<00:02:21.770> real<00:02:22.280> biased<00:02:22.850> on<00:02:23.330> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
and it's more real biased on the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
and it's more real biased on the
four-wheel-drive<00:02:24.140> system<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.170> car<00:02:27.410> does

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
four-wheel-drive system so the car does

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.420 
four-wheel-drive system so the car does
have<00:02:28.070> four-wheel<00:02:28.670> drive<00:02:28.940> all<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.420> time<00:02:29.890> flies

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
in situations where is slipping it tends

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.030

the<00:05:04.729> biggest<00:05:04.970> fan<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.360> fake<00:05:05.539> wooden<00:05:05.810> trim

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
the biggest fan of the fake wooden trim

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.879 
the biggest fan of the fake wooden trim
but<00:05:06.620> whatever<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.280> can<00:05:07.940> deal<00:05:08.090> with<00:05:08.120> that

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.080 

honestly<00:05:12.889> I'm<00:05:13.070> not<00:05:13.220> sure<00:05:13.280> that's<00:05:13.669> pretty<00:05:13.970> much

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
honestly I'm not sure that's pretty much

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.629 
honestly I'm not sure that's pretty much
to<00:05:14.150> like<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.330> don't<00:05:14.389> like<00:05:14.630> I<00:05:14.840> really

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
to like I don't like I really

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.740 
to like I don't like I really
this<00:05:16.639> car<00:05:16.880> is<00:05:16.970> growing<00:05:17.240> on<00:05:17.330> me<00:05:17.419> I'm<00:05:17.600> actually

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.360 
this car is growing on me I'm actually
going<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.110> get<00:05:18.320> myself<00:05:18.470> a<00:05:18.680> five-speed<00:05:19.160> and

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
going to get myself a five-speed and

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.310 
going to get myself a five-speed and
when<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.610> get<00:05:19.820> that<00:05:19.940> I<00:05:20.240> will<00:05:20.450> definitely<00:05:20.840> post<00:05:21.229> a

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
when I get that I will definitely post a

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.719 
when I get that I will definitely post a
review<00:05:21.440> about<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.860> supply<00:05:22.220> speed<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.669> the

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
review about the supply speed and the

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.310 
review about the supply speed and the
difference<00:05:23.000> between<00:05:23.180> 5-speed<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:25.120> automatic

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
difference between 5-speed and automatic

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.420 
difference between 5-speed and automatic
but<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.440> automatic<00:05:27.590> is<00:05:27.950> definitely<00:05:28.310> pretty

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
but the automatic is definitely pretty

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.209 
but the automatic is definitely pretty
good
