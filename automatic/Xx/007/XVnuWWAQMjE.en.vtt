00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.370

 today for a new video he 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.710
 this is a top 5 and not just any 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.970
 top 5 because it is safer labit 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.830
 who does not make the monk see you 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.600
 because it's a top 5 on 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.189
 blankets of the blow it does not speak 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.330
 especially books even though I can 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.519
 still give you my opinion on 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.949
 the books I told you about but that 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.470
 is talking about the cover that 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.329
 dress up his books and his stories so 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.370
 I can not wait to introduce my five 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.770
 favorite blankets present in my 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.809
 library in fifth position ago 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.670
 the cover of the book the kiss of 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.160
 the angel of elisabeth chandler this is 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.000
 Volume 3 May Volume 1 and 2 is a 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.100
 little the same style 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.329
 so why this cover in 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.489
 particular simply because 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.410
 I love feathers and that saga I 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.559
 them very long ago 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.840
 it must be 3 4 years old and in fact when 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.399
 I want them first and foremost for 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.899
 cover I was in Corsican had my 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.120
 mom in the picture was a book and there 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.460
 I saw this book I said it's him that 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.840
 I want suddenly she offered me both 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.220
 first volumes and I was able to discover 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.780
 this saga in the end thanks to the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.700
 cover otherwise I would never have 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.530
 interested in these books because I do not 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.880
 had not heard and suddenly 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.800
 it's true that you see how the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.110
 cover can really attract us and 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.270
 that she still has a pretty low effect 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.950
 attractive for us just a book 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.450
 can be read just for its cover 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.460
 because we liked it and because 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.070
 she was beautiful so it's true 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.090
 view you there I love most so that 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.140
 as soon as you put a feather for the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.120
 coverage are chances for that 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.190
 I like and here I found it so much 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.780
 simple is good you see the little 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.390
 reflection 2 of my camera 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.130
 you see me in duplicate it's true that 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.570
 I love this little simple side but the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.400
 small purple feathers in addition to a 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.240
 color I love the pink purple the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.890
 shame is too pretty 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.140
 so here I love this cover 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.030
 it's true I'm a fan of feathers and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.910
 this is the book in fifth position 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.800
 from my top 5 in fourth position I 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.500
 presents you the flake blanket 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.570
 love of john greenway maureen johnson 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.480
 and miracle lorraine who edited at 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.010
 plate that is a novel that talks about 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.540
 christmas and in fact I find that the 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.819
 cover is perfect to illustrate 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.170
 the season he found romantic actually 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.459
 she has a little trick that makes that 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.440
 that I do not see her I fall in love with 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.290
 this cover with the little choir 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.120
 during this year 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.569
 there in the small puffs the rose with 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.069
 the tree full of small flakes and 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.659
 little snowflakes and snow 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.659
 everywhere in fact that's what I love 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.280
 so really that's this cover 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.980
 it was my Christmas crush in 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.810
 did if I had a favorite Christmas book 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.620
 cover level that would be she it's 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.000
 sure and certain 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.640
 because I really find this 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.379
 sublime cover and in addition she 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.450
 contains sublime stories so 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.849
 this is really the 2 in 1 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.010
 sublime cover story sublime everything 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.530
 is perfect then in third position 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.000
 there were nightmares of kent 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.019
 herblay publishes at hachette 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.970
 black moon collection 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.609
 it's a blanket that is very dark 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.689
 very black that scares and that's what 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.340
 I love it is that I find it 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.500
 perfectly illustrates the story when 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.150
 we read the book we see the cover in 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.650
 does it appear before our eyes and we 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.269
 see the scene we come to a good 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.909
 imagine it and that's what I find 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.189
 great I find it super well done them 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.439
 colors are sublime with the red that 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.419
 is really a deep red I 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.829
 find it super pretty and suddenly it's 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.870
 so that this cover knew me 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.250
 to charm as soon as I saw them in fact I 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.599
 I did not even ask myself 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.650
 what is the book about wow 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.540
 it is beautiful I need it in the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.489
 library and then I read the summary that 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.319
 I liked it and when I read the book I 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.090
 am saying wow the blanket is also 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.979
 perfect that the book so suddenly 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.870
 it was really great i loved it 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:35.659
 the story I loved the cover so 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.799
 it was again 2 years ago did in 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.329
 make every book that I present to you 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.190
 I did not like them it's a good 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.900
 new and it's true that this 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.609
 cover I find it really sublime 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.209
 there is a very good job they 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.849
 realize and say legs full of 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.139
 blood are really small details 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.620
 that make the cover perfect 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.019
 in my eyes 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.060
 and here I love it finds that everything has 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.040
 been done well that's also the title 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.760
 and the name of the author everything was put to 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.419
 good place 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.790
 so for me this is a blanket 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.620
 totally beautiful and in addition I you 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.729
 advise the book you see it's 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.439
 really well you can have a 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.419
 beautiful is in your library 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.909
 no longer a book that you will love 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.709
 then in second position I you 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.349
 present love letters to the dead 2 have 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.090
 had lra published by michel lafon editions 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.380
 for those who follow me since very 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.120
 long this blanket has very 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.800
 long been my favorite blanket 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.889
 she moved to second position 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.719
 to be dethroned by who 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.669
 ah ah you will find out very quickly 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:33.189
 it's true that this is in my eyes 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.719
 they all already had the colors 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.310
 that I like a lot because there is 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.499
 really a nuance for me it's 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.909
 exactly the color of the sky that is 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.560
 get up in the morning and then if there is a 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.909
 color I love it's this one it's 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.139
 to see the sun rise in the morning with 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.759
 the clouds that become all pink 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.009
 orange is beautiful 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.289
 and after that turns to rape and satan 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.779
 delay and the blue of the night up 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.550
 go almost to the black and it's not 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.999
 this cover as soon as I saw that 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.289
 been the intergalactic love at first sight 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:01.779
 those who have been following me for a long time 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.669
 know that's been the favorite 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:05.529
 for me and I do not know if you too 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.289
 you find it nice but really for 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.050
 me it's a beautiful blanket she 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.310
 is not that amazing it's not 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.870
 not an extraordinary cover 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.879
 she and there are certainly some 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.490
 pretty similar covers but me 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.560
 I love them and the person who has succeeded 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.449
 to dethrone love letters to the dead who 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.080
 is in first position of my 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.629
 ranking 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.069
 these are the little queens of 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.509
 clementine beauvais I put you the 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.930
 cover here because we're from them 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.699
 to lend 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.020
 so I'm not and yes you 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.250
 see when a book is too good 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.189
 find himself lending it to a lot of people 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.330
 and we never have it at home but 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.710
 really it's a blanket that 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.449
 I love it's the cover of 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.639
 little queens because she is sublime 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.490
 the colors but I love with the gray 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.439
 rose gold metal there and especially she is 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.550
 brilliant and all the matter of the 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.050
 coverage the elders then she is 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.870
 sweet to places at the elysée in 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.419
 relief and all and it shines and for 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.279
 me this is an asset that is fair 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.360
 great she shines less suddenly from 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.469
 that I will pass in a radius I see 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.110
 a color all that shines this scourge 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:04.300
 what is it really about 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.750
 little queens for me this is the 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.520
 wonder 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.050
 so in more one more time I had a 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.210
 favorite for the cover and blow 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.500

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.830
 cover attracts you do not hesitate to 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.960
 the story will certainly disappoint you 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.139
 not in any case it's really a 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.349
 big crush cover and sq for
