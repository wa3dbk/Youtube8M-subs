moisture and soil during a hot summer

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.369 
moisture and soil during a hot summer
day<00:00:04.410> in<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.250> farmland<00:00:05.759> have<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.750> ever<00:00:06.870> noticed

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
day in a farmland have you ever noticed

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.860 
day in a farmland have you ever noticed
that<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:08.189> air<00:00:08.400> above<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.059> land<00:00:09.300> is

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
that the air above the land is

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.770 
that the air above the land is
shimmering<00:00:10.700> this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.880> due<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> presence

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
shimmering this is due to the presence

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.400 
shimmering this is due to the presence
of<00:00:12.960> moisture<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.099> soil<00:00:14.870> due<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> heat

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
of moisture in the soil due to the heat

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.189 
of moisture in the soil due to the heat
the<00:00:16.680> moisture<00:00:17.220> from<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> soil<00:00:18.199> evaporates

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the moisture from the soil evaporates

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.439 
the moisture from the soil evaporates
and<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> air<00:00:19.740> above<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.310> seems<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.210> shimmer

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and the air above it seems to shimmer

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.800 
and the air above it seems to shimmer
because<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> condensed<00:00:23.070> water<00:00:23.250> vapor<00:00:23.810> let
