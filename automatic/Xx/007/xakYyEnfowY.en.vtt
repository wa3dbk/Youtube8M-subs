now<00:01:07.840> let's<00:01:08.049> start<00:01:08.259> sewing<00:01:08.470> it

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.990 

and<00:01:17.570> we're<00:01:18.109> not<00:01:18.200> going<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.469> so<00:01:18.680> old<00:01:19.369> aside<00:01:19.820> so

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
and we're not going to so old aside so

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.490 
and we're not going to so old aside so
we're<00:01:20.090> going<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.450> almost<00:01:20.840> all<00:01:21.079> of<00:01:21.109> them<00:01:21.380> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
we're going to so almost all of them and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.950 
we're going to so almost all of them and
then<00:01:21.770> leave<00:01:22.009> an<00:01:22.340> inch<00:01:22.939> where<00:01:23.570> we<00:01:23.659> can<00:01:23.840> then

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
then leave an inch where we can then

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:44.700 
then leave an inch where we can then
turn<00:01:24.170> an<00:01:24.320> inside<00:01:24.710> out

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.280 

make<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> few<00:01:45.640> nuts<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.810> thread<00:01:47.080> doesn't

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
make a few nuts so the thread doesn't

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:56.750 
make a few nuts so the thread doesn't
start<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:47.770> unravel

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.820 

and<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:57.810> material<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.410> kind<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
and because this material is kind of

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.900 
and because this material is kind of
polyester<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.670> tends<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.660> tear<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:01.980> stitches

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
polyester it tends to tear and stitches

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.060 
polyester it tends to tear and stitches
to<00:02:03.060> unravel<00:02:03.480> and<00:02:03.600> especially<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.110> my

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
to unravel and especially because my

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.160 
to unravel and especially because my
thread<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:05.790> cheap<00:02:06.150> Chinese<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.810> can't<00:02:06.990> get

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
thread is a cheap Chinese we can't get

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.500 
thread is a cheap Chinese we can't get
any<00:02:07.350> other<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:07.950> island<00:02:08.400> here<00:02:08.730> so<00:02:09.270> it's

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
any other in this island here so it's

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.930 
any other in this island here so it's
really<00:02:09.660> cheap<00:02:09.930> and<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.230> keeps<00:02:10.410> tearing<00:02:10.940> so

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
really cheap and it keeps tearing so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.000 
really cheap and it keeps tearing so
therefore<00:02:12.240> I<00:02:12.270> make<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> lot<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.780> nuts<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.320> I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
therefore I make a lot of nuts and I

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.150 
therefore I make a lot of nuts and I
also<00:02:14.310> usually<00:02:14.760> double<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> thread<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.160> let's

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
also usually double the thread so let's

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.850 
also usually double the thread so let's
start<00:02:17.400> sewing<00:02:17.610> here<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.540> corner<00:02:18.900> they

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
start sewing here in the corner they

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.680 
start sewing here in the corner they
cannot<00:02:20.190> go<00:02:20.700> through<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> knot<00:02:21.150> again<00:02:21.420> make<00:02:21.660> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
cannot go through the knot again make a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:35.010 
cannot go through the knot again make a
second<00:02:22.110> knot<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:23.760> start<00:02:24.090> sewing

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.710 

an<00:02:35.080> easy<00:02:35.860> way<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.100> stitch<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.120> stick<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
an easy way to stitch is to stick the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.040 
an easy way to stitch is to stick the
needle<00:02:38.020> through<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.580> simply<00:02:39.600> put<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.780> thread

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
needle through and simply put the thread

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.380 
needle through and simply put the thread
across<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.400> needle<00:02:42.670> like<00:02:42.760> around<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.150> needle

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
across the needle like around the needle

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.570 
across the needle like around the needle
so<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.050> funs<00:02:44.380> not<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.830> then<00:02:44.980> pull<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> needle

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
so it's funs not to then pull the needle

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.050 
so it's funs not to then pull the needle
through<00:02:50.280> there<00:02:51.280> are<00:02:51.370> many<00:02:51.490> different<00:02:51.910> ways<00:02:51.940> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
through there are many different ways to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.970 
through there are many different ways to
soap<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:52.960> is<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> fastest<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:53.920> easiest

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
soap but this is a fastest and easiest
