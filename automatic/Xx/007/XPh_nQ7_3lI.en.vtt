mojang<00:00:43.950> had<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> hard<00:00:44.520> time<00:00:44.640> doing<00:00:45.350> but<00:00:46.350> with

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
mojang had a hard time doing but with

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.880 
mojang had a hard time doing but with
TNT<00:00:47.850> fishing<00:00:48.360> now<00:00:49.020> keep<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.469> mind<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
TNT fishing now keep in mind this is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220 
TNT fishing now keep in mind this is
just<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.309> concept<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.059> did<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.449> find<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.110> any

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
just a concept I did not find two in any

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.729 
just a concept I did not find two in any
of<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:53.430> doesn't<00:00:54.420> look<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.020> well

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
of this it doesn't look all that well

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.279 
of this it doesn't look all that well
but<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.690> performs<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.870> way<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.230> I

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
but it kind of performs a way that I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.260 
but it kind of performs a way that I
want<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.300> but<00:01:00.300> anyway<00:01:00.680> TNT<00:01:01.680> fishing<00:01:02.270> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
want it to but anyway TNT fishing you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
want it to but anyway TNT fishing you
toss<00:01:03.570> some<00:01:03.809> TNT<00:01:04.080> into<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> ocean<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.280> into

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
toss some TNT into the ocean or into

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300 
toss some TNT into the ocean or into
river<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.390> whatever<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.960> boom<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.189> get

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
river or whatever and boom you get

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.070 
river or whatever and boom you get
yourself<00:01:08.400> some<00:01:08.909> fish<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.450> fly<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
yourself some fish that fly out of the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.590 
yourself some fish that fly out of the
water<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.619> we've<00:01:11.580> seen<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> lot<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.360> from

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
water and we've seen a lot of that from

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.350 
water and we've seen a lot of that from
like<00:01:12.840> TV<00:01:13.770> shows<00:01:14.070> cartoons<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.030> stuff<00:01:15.119> like

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
like TV shows cartoons and stuff like

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.850 
like TV shows cartoons and stuff like
that<00:01:15.420> maybe<00:01:15.750> you've<00:01:15.960> done<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.439> real<00:01:16.500> life

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that maybe you've done it in real life

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.640 
that maybe you've done it in real life
just<00:01:17.729> toss<00:01:18.360> those<00:01:18.570> stick<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.960> dynamite<00:01:19.110> into

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
just toss those stick of dynamite into

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.060 
just toss those stick of dynamite into
the<00:01:19.770> water<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> boom<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.119> some<00:01:21.360> fish

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
the water and boom you get some fish

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.380 
the water and boom you get some fish
this<00:01:23.070> would<00:01:23.820> make<00:01:24.119> fishing<00:01:24.799> fun<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
this would make fishing fun and that is

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.740 
this would make fishing fun and that is
what<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.810> matters<00:01:31.939> nobody<00:01:32.939> really<00:01:33.329> wants

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
what really matters nobody really wants

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.950 
what really matters nobody really wants
to<00:01:33.869> fish<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.680> fun<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.729> my<00:01:36.090> idea<00:01:36.600> here

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
to fish if it's not fun now my idea here

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100 
to fish if it's not fun now my idea here
is<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.560> make<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.340> possible<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.450> automated

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
is to make this possible to be automated

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710 
is to make this possible to be automated
so<00:01:40.530> you'd<00:01:40.860> only<00:01:40.920> only<00:01:41.430> need<00:01:41.820> TNT<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.570> also

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
so you'd only only need TNT you can also

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.740 
so you'd only only need TNT you can also
use<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.829> creepers<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.759> filter<00:01:45.600> out

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
use just creepers if you can filter out

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.649 
use just creepers if you can filter out
creepers<00:01:46.320> inside<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:47.189> world<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.970> have

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
creepers inside your world and and have

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.899 
creepers inside your world and and have
them<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.229> up<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.619> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
them go up to you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.599 
them go up to you
um<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:52.289> can<00:01:52.439> make<00:01:52.560> them<00:01:52.740> explode<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.369> water

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
um you can make them explode in water

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.520 
um you can make them explode in water
and<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.090> boom<00:01:54.359> you<00:01:54.630> got<00:01:54.749> yourself<00:01:55.140> some<00:01:55.319> fish

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
and then boom you got yourself some fish

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.480 
and then boom you got yourself some fish
and<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.859> can<00:01:56.039> automate<00:01:56.249> it<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.759> way<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.439> think

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
and you can automate it that way I think

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.559 
and you can automate it that way I think
this<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.000> best<00:02:00.390> way<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:01.259> fishing

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
this is the best way to make fishing

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.469 
this is the best way to make fishing
more<00:02:03.569> entertaining<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:05.069> for<00:02:05.939> anyone<00:02:06.359> in

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
more entertaining for for anyone in

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.509 
more entertaining for for anyone in
Minecraft<00:02:06.959> because<00:02:07.350> who<00:02:07.920> doesn't<00:02:07.950> love

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
Minecraft because who doesn't love

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.610 
Minecraft because who doesn't love
explosions<00:02:09.269> I<00:02:09.660> love<00:02:10.259> explosions<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:11.129> think<00:02:11.640> I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
explosions I love explosions I think I

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.920 
explosions I love explosions I think I
honestly<00:02:13.620> think<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.720> solution

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
honestly think that this is the solution

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.960 
honestly think that this is the solution
for<00:02:16.560> fishing<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.099> if<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.459> can<00:02:17.819> be

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
for fishing and if this can be

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.259 
for fishing and if this can be
implemented<00:02:18.390> into<00:02:18.750> 1.9<00:02:19.680> dinner<00:02:20.430> bone<00:02:20.640> sorry

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
implemented into 1.9 dinner bone sorry

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.250 
implemented into 1.9 dinner bone sorry
you<00:02:22.019> guys<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.849> this<00:02:23.849> can<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.150> implemented<00:02:24.959> in

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
you guys if this can be implemented in

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.460 
you guys if this can be implemented in
1.9<00:02:25.890> how<00:02:26.310> awesome<00:02:27.030> would<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.239> be<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.230> able

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
1.9 how awesome would that be to be able

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.800 
1.9 how awesome would that be to be able
to<00:02:28.709> go<00:02:28.860> fishing<00:02:29.430> like<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.599> able<00:02:30.660> to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
to go fishing like this to be able to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.259 
to go fishing like this to be able to
automate<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.500> TNT<00:02:32.069> explosions<00:02:32.819> and

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
automate it with TNT explosions and

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.319 
automate it with TNT explosions and
stuff<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.799> don't<00:02:35.519> know<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.760> think<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.239> a

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
stuff like I don't know I think it's a

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.539 
stuff like I don't know I think it's a
really<00:02:36.360> cool<00:02:36.780> idea<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.290> did<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:38.010> fine<00:02:38.280> tune

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
really cool idea I did not fine tune

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.849 
really cool idea I did not fine tune
this<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.060> will<00:02:39.360> put<00:02:39.629> this<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:40.049> um<00:02:40.319> as<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.859> a

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
this but I will put this up um as a as a

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.780 
this but I will put this up um as a as a

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
not a filter a schematic so you guys can

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.800 
not a filter a schematic so you guys can
come<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.549> here<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.760> play<00:02:50.910> with<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.269> add<00:02:51.450> some

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
come in here and play with it add some

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.440 
come in here and play with it add some
more<00:02:51.930> fish<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.590> maybe<00:02:52.769> change<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.819> motion<00:02:54.329> of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
more fish you maybe change the motion of

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.559 
more fish you maybe change the motion of
the<00:02:54.720> armor<00:02:55.380> stands<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.389> basic

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the armor stands this is just a basic

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.599 
the armor stands this is just a basic
little<00:02:58.260> thing<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.709> together<00:02:58.980> as<00:02:59.370> quick

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
little thing that I do together as quick

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.720 
little thing that I do together as quick
as<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.849> can<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.269> show<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.480> guys<00:03:00.690> my<00:03:00.750> idea<00:03:01.730> so

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
as I can to show you guys my idea so

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.270 
as I can to show you guys my idea so
yeah<00:03:03.269> it's<00:03:03.450> not<00:03:03.630> very<00:03:03.780> fine<00:03:04.319> tuned<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.920> fact

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
yeah it's not very fine tuned in fact

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.400 
yeah it's not very fine tuned in fact
you<00:03:05.819> can<00:03:05.970> also<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:07.769> when<00:03:08.639> I<00:03:09.169> caused<00:03:10.169> the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
you can also see that when I caused the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.970 
you can also see that when I caused the
explosion<00:03:11.010> here<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.910> idea<00:03:12.269> was<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.630> have<00:03:12.980> all

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
explosion here the idea was to have all

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.979 
explosion here the idea was to have all
of<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.519> fish<00:03:14.760> kind<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.090> floating<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.630> top<00:03:15.660> of

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
of the fish kind of floating on top of

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.680 
of the fish kind of floating on top of
the<00:03:16.049> water<00:03:16.310> but<00:03:17.310> as<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.060> see<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.450> that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the water but as you can see like that

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.080 
the water but as you can see like that
one's<00:03:18.930> almost<00:03:19.109> there<00:03:19.500> these<00:03:20.130> ones<00:03:20.370> are<00:03:20.730> not

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
one's almost there these ones are not

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.280 
one's almost there these ones are not
quite<00:03:21.359> there<00:03:21.660> not<00:03:22.319> too<00:03:22.500> sure<00:03:22.769> why<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.459> if<00:03:24.290> this

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
quite there not too sure why but if this

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.229 
quite there not too sure why but if this
was<00:03:25.530> implemented<00:03:26.190> into<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.579> game<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.970> think

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
was implemented into the game I think

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.879 
was implemented into the game I think
it'll<00:03:27.389> be<00:03:27.480> really<00:03:27.599> cool<00:03:28.019> if<00:03:28.079> they<00:03:28.319> can<00:03:28.470> like<00:03:28.590> if

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
it'll be really cool if they can like if

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.610 
it'll be really cool if they can like if
items<00:03:29.220> would<00:03:29.400> float<00:03:29.730> on<00:03:29.849> water<00:03:29.959> if<00:03:30.959> they<00:03:31.500> would

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
items would float on water if they would

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.680 
items would float on water if they would
shoot<00:03:32.040> out<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.430> ocean<00:03:32.700> or<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.150> water<00:03:33.450> so

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
shoot out of the ocean or the water so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.930 
shoot out of the ocean or the water so
that<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.530> actually<00:03:34.650> see<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:35.340> explosion

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
that you can actually see the explosion

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.240 
that you can actually see the explosion
have<00:03:36.180> an<00:03:36.299> effect<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.959> don't<00:03:37.739> know<00:03:37.799> I<00:03:37.859> think<00:03:37.980> it's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
have an effect I don't know I think it's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.390 
have an effect I don't know I think it's
just<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.489> really<00:03:38.790> really<00:03:39.120> cool<00:03:39.239> idea<00:03:39.930> and

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
just a really really cool idea and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.150 
just a really really cool idea and
hopefully<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.609> guys<00:03:42.120> like<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.389> too<00:03:43.160> anyway

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.140 
want to show you guys my latest version
of<00:04:06.150> lasers<00:04:06.900> I've<00:04:07.740> made<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.220> video<00:04:08.460> once<00:04:08.700> before

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
of lasers I've made a video once before

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.030 
of lasers I've made a video once before
on<00:04:09.330> lasers<00:04:10.020> but<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.290> didn't<00:04:10.620> feel<00:04:10.770> that<00:04:10.920> they

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
on lasers but I didn't feel that they

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.160 
on lasers but I didn't feel that they
were<00:04:11.100> fine-tuned<00:04:11.790> enough<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.780> i<00:04:12.810> went<00:04:13.080> ahead

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
were fine-tuned enough so i went ahead

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.729 
were fine-tuned enough so i went ahead
and<00:04:13.350> remade<00:04:14.100> them<00:04:14.990> everyone<00:04:15.990> record<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.440> here

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
and remade them everyone record it here

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.470 
and remade them everyone record it here
so<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.100> want<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.370> smoke<00:04:17.580> connector<00:04:18.060> on<00:04:18.180> mirage

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
so you want a smoke connector on mirage

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.970 
so you want a smoke connector on mirage
you're<00:04:18.720> going<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:18.930> come<00:04:19.140> back<00:04:19.320> when<00:04:19.500> be<00:04:19.739> halls

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
you're going to come back when be halls

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.370 
you're going to come back when be halls
stand<00:04:20.940> into<00:04:21.300> the<00:04:21.390> corner<00:04:21.720> right<00:04:21.930> here<00:04:21.960> where

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
stand into the corner right here where

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.280 
stand into the corner right here where
you<00:04:22.530> cannot<00:04:22.980> move<00:04:23.480> you're<00:04:24.480> going<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.870> crouch

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
you cannot move you're going to crouch

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.140 
you cannot move you're going to crouch
and<00:04:25.680> you're<00:04:26.430> going<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.610> aim<00:04:26.850> at<00:04:27.030> the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
and you're going to aim at the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.660 
and you're going to aim at the
connection
