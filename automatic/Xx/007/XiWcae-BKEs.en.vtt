left-side<00:00:13.950> Magneto<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.530> you're<00:00:16.530> gonna<00:00:16.620> see

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
left-side Magneto and you're gonna see

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.790 
left-side Magneto and you're gonna see
this<00:00:17.100> thing<00:00:17.370> actually<00:00:17.610> work<00:00:18.210> on<00:00:18.510> YouTube<00:00:19.110> for

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
this thing actually work on YouTube for

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.860 
this thing actually work on YouTube for
the<00:00:19.890> first<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.490> you're<00:00:21.150> gonna<00:00:21.240> see<00:00:21.360> it<00:00:21.690> and

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:21.870 
the first time you're gonna see it and

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.650 
the first time you're gonna see it and
it<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.260> awesome<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.430> connections<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.180> solid

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it is awesome the connections are solid

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.040 
it is awesome the connections are solid
it's<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:25.950> tricky<00:00:26.340> for<00:00:26.370> tension<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.780> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
it's a little tricky for tension on the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230 
it's a little tricky for tension on the
main<00:00:28.500> retaining<00:00:28.980> bolts<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.430> have<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.850> have<00:00:30.030> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
main retaining bolts you have to have it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.829 
main retaining bolts you have to have it
so<00:00:30.270> this<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.810> loose<00:00:31.590> enough<00:00:32.329> where<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.449> spring

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839 
so this is loose enough where the spring

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:36.020 
so this is loose enough where the spring
will<00:00:34.170> auto-advance<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.609> can<00:00:35.760> see<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
will auto-advance it you can see it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.209 
will auto-advance it you can see it
moving<00:00:36.210> very<00:00:36.539> easily<00:00:36.809> push<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.769> pinky

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
moving very easily push it with a pinky

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.439 
moving very easily push it with a pinky
that's<00:00:38.820> correctly<00:00:39.600> mounted<00:00:41.120> remember<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> use

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
that's correctly mounted remember to use

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.649
