00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
nice thing and this is not like a real

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.309 
nice thing and this is not like a real
good<00:02:28.550> unboxing<00:02:29.060> because<00:02:29.239> this<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.660> my<00:02:30.080> dad's

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
good unboxing because this is my dad's

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.860 
good unboxing because this is my dad's
and<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.800> haven't<00:02:31.610> been<00:02:31.760> able<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.090> make<00:02:32.269> it<00:02:32.480> the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
and I haven't been able to make it the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.479 
and I haven't been able to make it the
video<00:02:33.500> yet<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.890> don't<00:02:33.980> know<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:34.310> this

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
video yet so I don't know if this

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.309 
video yet so I don't know if this
doesn't<00:02:34.819> has<00:02:35.030> all<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.450> original<00:02:35.540> packaging

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
doesn't has all the original packaging

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.860 
doesn't has all the original packaging
and<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:37.400> believe<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:37.849> already<00:02:38.360> has<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
and I believe that already has the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.479 
and I believe that already has the
wheels<00:02:39.110> in<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.500> like<00:02:39.650> some<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.069> larger

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
wheels in it like some of the larger

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.699 
wheels in it like some of the larger
models<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.000> put<00:02:41.180> wheels<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:42.650> one

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
models and put wheels on it but this one

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.880 
models and put wheels on it but this one
I<00:02:42.920> think<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.400> already<00:02:43.580> has<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.090> wheels<00:02:44.890> so

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
I think it already has the wheels so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.580 
I think it already has the wheels so
here's<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.700> model<00:02:46.910> be<00:02:47.690> real<00:02:47.900> careful<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:48.440> it
