00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.039 
very frustrating for me I never felt
like<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> lead<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
like I was in the lead but we kind of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.749 
like I was in the lead but we kind of
just<00:01:19.259> claw<00:01:19.619> our<00:01:19.799> way<00:01:19.830> back<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.340> by<00:01:20.490> getting

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
just claw our way back here by getting

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.190 
just claw our way back here by getting
the<00:01:20.820> ball<00:01:20.970> over<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.270> arroyo<00:01:21.540> he<00:01:21.840> makes<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the ball over to arroyo he makes a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.740 
the ball over to arroyo he makes a
really<00:01:23.070> quick<00:01:23.250> decision<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> press<00:01:24.180> B<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
really quick decision to press B and I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.690 
really quick decision to press B and I
kind<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> capitalize<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> by<00:01:26.220> putting<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
kind of capitalize on that by putting it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.880 
kind of capitalize on that by putting it
into<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.150> near<00:01:27.540> post<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.710> free
