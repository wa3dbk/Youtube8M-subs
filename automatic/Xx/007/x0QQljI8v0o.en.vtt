00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.840 
- doesn't appear that way mine's appears
like<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.410> think<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.490> because<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
like this I think it's because it's a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.670 
like this I think it's because it's a
newer<00:02:18.090> version<00:02:18.360> then<00:02:18.690> when<00:02:18.900> he<00:02:19.050> uploaded<00:02:19.380> he

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
newer version then when he uploaded he

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.840 
newer version then when he uploaded he
uploaded<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.370> at<00:02:20.640> 2011<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:23.280> isn't<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
uploaded this at 2011 this isn't the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.180 
uploaded this at 2011 this isn't the
newest<00:02:24.240> because<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> newest<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.710> actually

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
newest because the newest is actually

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.800 
newest because the newest is actually
the<00:02:26.490> 7<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.200> actually<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> 6a<00:02:29.420> 6<00:02:30.420> software

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the 7 this is actually the 6a 6 software

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.080 
the 7 this is actually the 6a 6 software
and<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.830> mines<00:02:32.190> appears<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and so mines appears like this when you

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.570 
and so mines appears like this when you
go<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.270> application<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.050> what<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> did<00:02:34.380> was<00:02:34.770> when

now the reason why I got this error

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.240 
now the reason why I got this error
message<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.660> because<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> was<00:03:34.650> updating<00:03:34.860> it

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
message is because I was updating it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.140 
message is because I was updating it
with<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.519> computer<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:37.400> my<00:03:38.400> computer<00:03:38.910> turned

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
with the computer and my computer turned

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.170 
with the computer and my computer turned
off<00:03:39.300> halfway<00:03:39.660> through<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.860> update<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:42.030> it

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
off halfway through the update so it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.780 
off halfway through the update so it
wouldn't<00:03:42.540> after<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.860> wouldn't<00:03:43.980> work<00:03:44.250> so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
wouldn't after that and wouldn't work so

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.780 
wouldn't after that and wouldn't work so
this<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:44.970> what<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.360> see<00:03:45.830> once<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:47.280> happens

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
this is what you see once this happens

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.449 
this is what you see once this happens
you<00:03:47.910> automatically<00:03:48.750> click<00:03:49.140> get<00:03:49.769> update<00:03:50.600> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
so it will start to render but yeah like

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.030

again<00:04:14.190> you're<00:04:14.549> going<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.730> wait<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.940> while<00:04:15.180> and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
again you're going to wait a while and

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.199 
again you're going to wait a while and
it's<00:04:15.959> gonna<00:04:16.080> keep<00:04:16.290> on<00:04:16.500> saying<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.209> it's

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
not really going to work and so you

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.130 
not really going to work and so you
don't<00:04:22.770> really<00:04:22.950> need<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.610> like<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.270> if<00:04:24.900> you

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
you have on your blackberry for example

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.659 
you have on your blackberry for example
my<00:04:51.810> memory<00:04:52.530> card<00:04:52.680> still<00:04:52.919> there<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.370> once<00:04:53.550> I

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
my memory card still there and once I

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.089 
my memory card still there and once I
did<00:04:53.729> this<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.330> still<00:04:54.569> work<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.530> don't<00:04:56.009> need

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
did this it still work so you don't need

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.200 
did this it still work so you don't need
to<00:04:56.190> worry<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.460> you're<00:04:56.699> going<00:04:56.819> to<00:04:56.880> lose<00:04:57.180> your

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.610 
contacts or lose your information
because<00:04:59.820> to<00:05:00.240> my<00:05:00.479> knowledge<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:01.229> didn't<00:05:01.470> do

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
because to my knowledge it didn't do

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.110 
because to my knowledge it didn't do
that<00:05:01.650> so<00:05:02.280> you're<00:05:02.400> going<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.580> wait<00:05:02.820> and

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
that so you're going to wait and

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.180 
that so you're going to wait and
basically<00:05:03.870> I'm<00:05:04.320> not<00:05:04.380> going<00:05:04.560> to<00:05:04.770> let<00:05:04.860> this<00:05:05.009> to

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
basically I'm not going to let this to

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.409 
basically I'm not going to let this to
load<00:05:05.340> completely<00:05:05.789> since<00:05:06.000> my<00:05:06.120> phone<00:05:06.300> is

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
load completely since my phone is

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.960 
load completely since my phone is
already<00:05:06.630> fixed<00:05:06.990> I<00:05:07.550> don't<00:05:08.550> know

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
already fixed I don't know

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.390 
already fixed I don't know
but<00:05:09.720> basically<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:10.320> let<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.620> install<00:05:10.889> all<00:05:11.250> the

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
before it's going to have that black

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.920 
before it's going to have that black
screen<00:05:49.139> with<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:50.030> battery<00:05:51.030> not<00:05:51.180> there<00:05:51.449> and<00:05:51.599> I

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
screen with the battery not there and I

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.959 
screen with the battery not there and I
said<00:05:52.110> before<00:05:52.590> cuz<00:05:52.979> I've<00:05:53.099> done<00:05:53.490> this<00:05:53.669> video

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
said before cuz I've done this video

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.490 
said before cuz I've done this video
twice<00:05:55.340> but<00:05:56.340> this<00:05:56.940> is<00:05:57.120> just<00:05:57.449> it<00:05:57.659> rendering

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
twice but this is just it rendering

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.649 
twice but this is just it rendering
without<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.900> so<00:06:02.090> basically<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.300> let<00:06:03.509> it

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
without that so basically you let it

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.140 
without that so basically you let it
render<00:06:04.139> put<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.680> battery<00:06:04.979> and<00:06:05.099> after<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.969> see

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
that it says that there's no battery in

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
that it says that there's no battery in
there<00:06:07.860> and<00:06:09.169> after<00:06:10.169> that<00:06:10.530> you<00:06:10.770> should<00:06:10.800> have<00:06:11.190> a
