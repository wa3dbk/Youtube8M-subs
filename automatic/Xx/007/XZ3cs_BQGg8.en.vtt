00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
been around the world but I think that

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.280 
been around the world but I think that
Sheree<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.770> I<00:04:18.010> have<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:19.660> more<00:04:19.959> unique

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
Sheree and I have a more unique

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.560 
Sheree and I have a more unique
combination<00:04:20.980> and<00:04:21.610> it<00:04:22.180> just<00:04:22.360> doesn't

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
combination and it just doesn't

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.320 
combination and it just doesn't
encompass<00:04:23.020> one<00:04:24.010> style<00:04:24.400> Pro<00:04:24.670> Wrestling<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.210> as

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
encompass one style Pro Wrestling and as

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.960 
encompass one style Pro Wrestling and as
many<00:04:25.570> styles<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.580> think<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.670> should<00:04:27.790> be<00:04:27.820> an

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
many styles and I think it should be an

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.970 
many styles and I think it should be an
