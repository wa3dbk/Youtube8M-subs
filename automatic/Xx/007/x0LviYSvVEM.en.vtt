00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:30.000
 To prescribe a soul has to be with you. 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:32.370

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:43.070

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:53.250
 and it is something else that has done 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.110
 another thing that has done goes to the recall 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.870
