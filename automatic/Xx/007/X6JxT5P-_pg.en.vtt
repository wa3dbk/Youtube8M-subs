few patches the game will be perfectly
enjoyable<00:04:12.540> which<00:04:12.989> is<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.260> be<00:04:13.290> expected<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.980> a

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
enjoyable which is to be expected of a

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.430 
enjoyable which is to be expected of a
new<00:04:14.190> release<00:04:14.520> nothing<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:15.630> released<00:04:15.930> spotless

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
new release nothing is released spotless

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.259 
new release nothing is released spotless
and<00:04:16.680> while<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.310> game<00:04:17.549> definitely<00:04:17.760> needs

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
and while this game definitely needs

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.060 
and while this game definitely needs
some<00:04:18.359> polish<00:04:18.900> if<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:19.260> enjoyed<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.680> Warhammer

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
some polish if you enjoyed the Warhammer

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.880 
some polish if you enjoyed the Warhammer
series<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.820> or<00:04:21.060> strategy<00:04:21.660> games<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.230> see<00:04:22.680> no

reason<00:04:23.070> why<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.400> shouldn't<00:04:23.730> get<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.210> also

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
reason why you shouldn't get this also

reason why you shouldn't get this also
I'm<00:04:25.320> not<00:04:25.530> sure<00:04:25.710> if<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:25.950> should<00:04:25.980> listed<00:04:26.430> as<00:04:26.550> a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
I'm not sure if I should listed as a

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.580 
I'm not sure if I should listed as a
positive<00:04:26.880> or<00:04:27.300> negative<00:04:27.480> but<00:04:27.960> after<00:04:28.200> my<00:04:28.320> first

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
positive or negative but after my first

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.620 
positive or negative but after my first
kill<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.860> locked<00:04:29.310> seven<00:04:29.730> random<00:04:29.940> achievements

in<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.810> game<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.350> just<00:04:32.280> thought<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.520> was<00:04:32.580> funny

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
in the game I just thought it was funny

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:48.970 
in the game I just thought it was funny
to<00:04:33.030> be<00:04:33.150> honest

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.680 

although<00:04:49.980> not<00:04:50.160> particularly<00:04:50.790> terrifying<00:04:51.270> or

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
although not particularly terrifying or

although not particularly terrifying or
even<00:04:51.930> fast-paced<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.830> probably<00:04:53.310> should<00:04:53.580> have

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
even fast-paced I probably should have

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.860 
even fast-paced I probably should have
taken<00:04:53.790> notes<00:04:54.150> while<00:04:54.330> going<00:04:54.510> through<00:04:54.630> the
