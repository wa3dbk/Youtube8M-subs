00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
reaction that he is way off now I do

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.560 
reaction that he is way off now I do
have<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> theory<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.290> dippers<00:01:31.979> true<00:01:32.400> name<00:01:32.700> but

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
have a theory on dippers true name but

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.920 
have a theory on dippers true name but
it<00:01:34.380> requires<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.579> accept<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.420> stand

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it requires that you accept the stand

it requires that you accept the stand
secret<00:01:37.740> twin<00:01:38.159> theory<00:01:38.700> I've<00:01:39.479> spoken<00:01:39.990> about

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
secret twin theory I've spoken about

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.920 
secret twin theory I've spoken about
this<00:01:40.320> theory<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.189> previous<00:01:41.640> meeting<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.210> if

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this theory in a previous meeting and if

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.780 
this theory in a previous meeting and if
you'd<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.290> learn<00:01:43.500> more<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.280> just

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.010 
redundant enough to have two brothers so
similarly<00:02:16.800> named<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.670> wouldn't<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.540> surprised

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
similarly named I wouldn't be surprised

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.680 
similarly named I wouldn't be surprised
if<00:02:19.320> they<00:02:19.500> also<00:02:19.800> passed<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.730> name<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.360> in

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
if they also passed that name down in

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.380 
if they also passed that name down in
the<00:02:21.810> lineage<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.560> well<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.180> case

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the lineage as well if that's the case

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.320 
the lineage as well if that's the case
that<00:02:25.200> could<00:02:25.590> mean<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.190> dipper<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.700> Mabel's

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
that could mean that dipper and Mabel's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.100 
that could mean that dipper and Mabel's
father<00:02:27.690> could<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.710> named<00:02:29.210> Stanley<00:02:30.210> jr.<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
father could be named Stanley jr. and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.410 
father could be named Stanley jr. and
this<00:02:31.890> could<00:02:32.130> very<00:02:32.370> possibly<00:02:32.460> mean<00:02:33.210> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this could very possibly mean the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.920 
this could very possibly mean the
dippers<00:02:33.930> true<00:02:34.380> name<00:02:34.680> could<00:02:35.460> be<00:02:35.510> Stanley<00:02:36.510> Pines

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
dippers true name could be Stanley Pines

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.120 
dippers true name could be Stanley Pines
the<00:02:37.350> third<00:02:38.070> granted<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.660> pretty<00:02:40.470> huge

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
the third granted this is a pretty huge

the third granted this is a pretty huge

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
leap in logic but even if you don't

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.820 
leap in logic but even if you don't
believe<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.970> dipper<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.900> named<00:02:46.200> after<00:02:46.530> his
