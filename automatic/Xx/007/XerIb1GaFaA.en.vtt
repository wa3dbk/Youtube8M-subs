foolish burial being there that's going

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.319 
foolish burial being there that's going
to<00:00:37.290> change<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.770> few<00:00:37.980> things<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.520> don't<00:00:38.640> recognize

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to change a few things I don't recognize

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.380 
to change a few things I don't recognize
that<00:00:39.600> card<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.610> we'll<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that card so we'll have to see what it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.900 
that card so we'll have to see what it
is<00:00:42.890> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.250> card<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.670> don't

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
is kind of like that card I don't

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.810 
is kind of like that card I don't
recognize<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.559> recognize<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.670> an

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
recognize but I do recognize that as an

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.069 
recognize but I do recognize that as an
Ebola<00:00:48.270> sore<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.239> recognize<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
Ebola sore and I do recognize a

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.439 
Ebola sore and I do recognize a
metamorphosis<00:00:55.100> which<00:00:56.100> probably<00:00:56.610> means<00:00:57.120> why

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
metamorphosis which probably means why

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.189 
metamorphosis which probably means why
the<00:00:57.510> yvala<00:00:58.050> sores<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.930> metamorphosis<00:01:00.930> are

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the yvala sores and metamorphosis are

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.950 
the yvala sores and metamorphosis are
going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.590> limited<00:01:02.180> going<00:01:03.180> down<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> semi

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
going to be limited going down to semi

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.700 
going to be limited going down to semi
limited<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.869> future<00:01:06.869> fusions

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
limited we see that a future fusions

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.899 
limited we see that a future fusions
going<00:01:08.159> there<00:01:08.780> that's<00:01:09.780> unusual<00:01:10.110> uh<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:13.170> uh

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.380 

what's<00:01:16.179> a<00:01:16.299> call<00:01:16.509> about<00:01:16.630> ultimate<00:01:17.590> offering

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
what's a call about ultimate offering

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.749 
what's a call about ultimate offering
going<00:01:19.390> there<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.049> something<00:01:20.740> else<00:01:21.039> I<00:01:23.759> think

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
going there and something else I think

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.219 
going there and something else I think
it's<00:01:24.939> Mizuki<00:01:25.600> but<00:01:26.469> I'm<00:01:26.560> not<00:01:26.770> sure<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.659> on<00:01:28.929> the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
it's Mizuki but I'm not sure then on the

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.309 
it's Mizuki but I'm not sure then on the
non<00:01:29.920> limited<00:01:30.549> which<00:01:30.999> would<00:01:31.569> mean<00:01:31.749> these<00:01:32.049> are

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
non limited which would mean these are

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.559 
non limited which would mean these are
getting<00:01:32.619> ready<00:01:32.829> to<00:01:32.920> remove<00:01:33.850> from<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.270> lists

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
getting ready to remove from the lists

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.550 
getting ready to remove from the lists
all<00:01:34.689> together<00:01:35.039> um<00:01:36.149> it<00:01:37.149> looks<00:01:37.719> like<00:01:38.170> primal

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
all together um it looks like primal

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.480 
all together um it looks like primal
seeds<00:01:39.069> going<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.750> be<00:01:40.899> unlimited<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
seeds going going to be unlimited it

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
seeds going going to be unlimited it
also<00:01:42.700> looks<00:01:42.969> like<00:01:43.149> summoner<00:01:43.810> monk<00:01:44.170> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.219 

bottomless<00:01:47.740> trap<00:01:48.310> hole<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:49.360> Ruiz<00:01:49.659> I<00:01:49.869> say

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
bottomless trap hole is going to three

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:57.569 
bottomless trap hole is going to three
because<00:01:53.140> it's<00:01:53.349> already<00:01:53.619> at<00:01:53.890> two<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.509> I<00:01:56.579> don't
