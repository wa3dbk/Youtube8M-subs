these are the four things that you can
do<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.550> remain<00:00:32.850> stable<00:00:33.240> and<00:00:33.600> upright<00:00:34.080> while

do to remain stable and upright while

paddling hitting waves head-on at a
right<00:00:37.140> angle<00:00:37.170> allows<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.310> punch<00:00:38.550> through

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
right angle allows you to punch through

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.660 
right angle allows you to punch through
them<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.750> reactionary<00:00:40.410> waves<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.280> means

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
them for reactionary waves this means

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.980 
them for reactionary waves this means
that<00:00:41.820> you'll<00:00:41.970> want<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> angle<00:00:42.630> your<00:00:42.690> boat

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
that you'll want to angle your boat

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.260 
that you'll want to angle your boat
towards<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:43.710> wave<00:00:43.890> instead<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.820> keeping<00:00:45.150> your

towards the wave instead of keeping your

towards the wave instead of keeping your
kayak<00:00:45.660> pointed<00:00:46.110> down<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.470> tongue

if<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:47.910> angle<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.420> boat<00:00:48.600> toward<00:00:48.990> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
if you don't angle your boat toward the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.020 
if you don't angle your boat toward the
wave<00:00:49.290> then<00:00:49.860> it'll<00:00:50.100> hit<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.790> side

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.560 
wave then it'll hit you from the side
and<00:00:51.330> push<00:00:51.630> you<00:00:51.810> off<00:00:51.960> line<00:00:52.290> or<00:00:52.560> flip<00:00:52.950> you<00:00:53.130> over

so when we lean back we place all of our

so when we lean back we place all of our
weight<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.039> back<00:01:35.219> of<00:01:35.460> our<00:01:35.549> kayak<00:01:35.969> which

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
weight on the back of our kayak which

sinks it into the water and makes it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
sinks it into the water and makes it
more<00:01:38.640> vulnerable<00:01:39.179> to<00:01:39.240> being<00:01:39.420> overtaken<00:01:40.109> by

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
more vulnerable to being overtaken by

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.169 
more vulnerable to being overtaken by
the<00:01:40.619> river

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
the river

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.849 
the river
not<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.359> mention<00:01:42.569> that<00:01:42.869> leaning<00:01:43.229> back<00:01:43.409> throws

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
not to mention that leaning back throws

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.459 
not to mention that leaning back throws
a<00:01:43.890> soft<00:01:44.249> balance<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.569> it's<00:01:45.719> important<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.289> be

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
a soft balance so it's important to be

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.319 
a soft balance so it's important to be
