so this has a 60-inch LED screen and its

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.929 
so this has a 60-inch LED screen and its
edge<00:00:19.230> lit<00:00:19.560> Agilent<00:00:20.010> means<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> LED<00:00:20.699> lights

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this model also has local dimming so

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.779 
this model also has local dimming so
this<00:00:28.289> means<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> has<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.830> ability<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.400> adjust

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
this means it has the ability to adjust

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.150 
this means it has the ability to adjust
different<00:00:30.240> zones<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.230> order<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.590> improve<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
TV so great is a 4k resolution this is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.689 
TV so great is a 4k resolution this is
four<00:01:00.090> times<00:01:00.570> greater<00:01:00.809> than<00:01:01.140> 1080p<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.520> yeah

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
four times greater than 1080p so yeah

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.060 
four times greater than 1080p so yeah
extremely<00:01:03.359> sharp<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.870> extremely<00:01:04.500> clear

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
extremely sharp and extremely clear

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030 
extremely sharp and extremely clear
image<00:01:05.549> quality<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.330> also<00:01:06.510> has<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> 4k<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.650> skilar

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
image quality it also has a 4k of skilar

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.039 
image quality it also has a 4k of skilar
so<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.670> automatically<00:01:09.330> upscale<00:01:10.020> your

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
so it will automatically upscale your

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.950 
so it will automatically upscale your
non<00:01:10.470> 4k<00:01:11.130> content<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.939> get<00:01:12.060> pretty<00:01:12.360> close<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
non 4k content and get pretty close to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.840 
non 4k content and get pretty close to
the<00:01:13.110> 4k<00:01:13.650> quality<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:14.310> looking<00:01:14.640> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the 4k quality you're looking for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.850 
the 4k quality you're looking for
obviously<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> won't<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:15.960> clear<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.380> native

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
obviously it won't be as clear as native

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.249 
obviously it won't be as clear as native
4k<00:01:17.369> content<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> gets<00:01:18.390> pretty<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.140> it's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
4k content but it gets pretty and it's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.380 
4k content but it gets pretty and it's
definitely<00:01:19.710> an<00:01:20.040> improvement<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> small

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
definitely an improvement so the small

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.289 
definitely an improvement so the small
also<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:21.840> true<00:01:22.259> motion<00:01:22.880> 240<00:01:23.880> hertz<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
also that's true motion 240 hertz and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
also that's true motion 240 hertz and
this<00:01:24.479> feature<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.020> turned<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:25.770> off

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
this feature can be turned on or off

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.219 
this feature can be turned on or off
it's<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.970> personal<00:01:27.210> preference<00:01:27.780> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it's kind of a personal preference I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's kind of a personal preference I
recommend<00:01:29.070> leaving<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.670> feature<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.119> if

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
recommend leaving this feature on if

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
recommend leaving this feature on if
you're<00:01:30.720> watching<00:01:31.140> sports<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.579> will

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you're watching sports because it will

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
you're watching sports because it will
make<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.090> sports<00:01:33.450> look<00:01:33.689> very<00:01:34.020> clear<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
make your sports look very clear and it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
make your sports look very clear and it
greatly<00:01:35.100> reduces<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.030> motion<00:01:36.420> blur<00:01:36.540> does

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
greatly reduces the motion blur does

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.410 
greatly reduces the motion blur does
this<00:01:37.200> by<00:01:37.409> adding<00:01:37.590> two<00:01:38.040> software<00:01:38.820> generated

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this by adding two software generated

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200 
this by adding two software generated
frames<00:01:39.840> between<00:01:40.140> each<00:01:40.740> frame<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.030> will

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
frames between each frame and this will
