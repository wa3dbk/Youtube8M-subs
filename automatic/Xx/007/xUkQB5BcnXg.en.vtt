 people you have to do for now 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.949
 is to seek the help of a veterinarian 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.660
 I'm not looking for help on the internet. 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 It will not solve much of you. 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.429
 have to take there was only one veterinarian and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.279

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.600
 society does not have a veterinary 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.550
 alagoas, take a normal veterinarian who 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.440
 best person to help you 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 good leaves the beach effect like you 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 saw him very agitated just to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.030
 vary 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 so there is no solution 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.489
 magic this is because I'm sick and I 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 passed because because it can be a 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.270
 disease does not exist for example 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.010
 I'll buy the antibiotic. 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.989
 microcity teaching agent one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.239
 antibiotic and solved this was 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.129
 caused by bacteria if it were a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 ice cream or anything else 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.479
 antibiotic will not resolve yet can 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.770
 worsening the health of your area and left it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.869
 more weakened 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.119
 so that's why it matters to you 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.119
 takes the veterinarian to do the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.240
 Correct diagnostic soft tesch only has 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.460
 This is based on what she has and will 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.000
 give the specific remedy for that is the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.680
 same thing you have with a tape recorder 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 to take medicine for headache not 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.900
 It will solve nothing or you are with 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.299
 diarrhea bellyache and take medicine 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.369
 for nun on foot does not solve people 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.750
 You have to take the right medicine to 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.880
 Who do you want to deal with? 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.970
 so it's the same, it's no use, you 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.070
 there is a remedy produced there is no 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.200
 that exists in you see any disease 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.479
 to make less if and how you will see 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.399
 Anyone walking for me is not 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.500
 searching the internet is not good 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.509
 while his neighbor and leading the rabbi 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.520
 and end up like I said at the beginning of 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.619
 video does not matter if the company does not have 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.270
 a light water given no will 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.100
 finish normal that he will be the person 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.259
 who will have more notion to help 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.030
 even if you do not want, I only understand cat 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.039
 dog he will have notion that that 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.660
 is a disease caused by bacteria that is 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.500
 a disease caused by holes and is not 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.810
 none of this 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.590
 he will have more of this notion than the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.390
 people 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.670
 so I wanted to talk you do not come 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.709
 looking for help on the internet that 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.530
 most imagine that you will find and 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.030
 liver so I think you can 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.350
 find something is that you can 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.140
 find someone who really will 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.000
 help that I do not know 90 percent of 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.250
 help will be useless who you are 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.709
 looking for help on internet people a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.800
 disease and the executive already of the 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.260
 all disease nothing evolves very fast 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.300
 so it 's only in two days for a delight 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.840
 silly turn something that will kill her and 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.610
 taking advantage of what we are 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.190
 talking about diseases of medicine I wanted 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.380
 say that I said another video that 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.810
 is the following beginning to present a 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.569
 different behavior of autocad corner 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.220
 the bottinelli side only began to 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.340
 behave differently is 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.130
 very quiet dominates a shed 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.440
 shiver and a chorus she's sick 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.410
 there you think she is discouraged step 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.640
 At the end she is sick and needs help 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.980
 the veterinarian so the first 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.709

 Yellow is worked out by the pieces 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.220
 whether they are yellow or not 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.780
 The change you put knows the first 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.850
 first, if you do not get leads to a 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.950
 given expected the worst because it
