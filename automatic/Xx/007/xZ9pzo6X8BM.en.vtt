want to loosen them up

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.590 
want to loosen them up
just<00:01:20.520> push<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> button<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.509> the

just push the button which is in the
bottom<00:01:21.840> there<00:01:22.430> which<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:23.850> therefore

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
bottom there which is actually therefore

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.520 
bottom there which is actually therefore
I<00:01:24.210> push<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.170> there's<00:01:25.380> one

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
I push it there and then there's one

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.429 
I push it there and then there's one
there<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.310> press<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
there just press that and then that

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.080 
there just press that and then that
releases<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.470> elastic<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.189> begun<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
releases the elastic so they begun and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.730 
releases the elastic so they begun and
as<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.420> said<00:01:30.600> that's<00:01:30.720> all<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.200> built<00:01:31.439> within<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
as I said that's all in built within the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.990 
as I said that's all in built within the
pocket<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.159> obviously<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> bit<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
pocket so obviously if it's a bit of a

some autumn or winter walking or just

some autumn or winter walking or just
you<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.750> spring<00:02:19.290> early<00:02:19.620> springtime<00:02:19.920> gets<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you know spring early springtime gets a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.950 
you know spring early springtime gets a
bit<00:02:20.460> chilly<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.970> morning<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.780> again

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
bit chilly in the morning and again

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.900 
bit chilly in the morning and again
they're<00:02:22.140> all<00:02:22.290> designed<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.920> fit<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> scarf<00:02:23.610> or<00:02:23.880> a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
they're all designed to fit a scarf or a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.270 
they're all designed to fit a scarf or a
shoot<00:02:24.240> or<00:02:24.420> even<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.780> buff<00:02:24.990> underneath<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.770> so

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
shoot or even a buff underneath that so

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.980 
shoot or even a buff underneath that so
obviously<00:02:26.850> we<00:02:26.940> won't<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.150> too<00:02:27.300> restricting

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
obviously we won't be too restricting

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.470 
obviously we won't be too restricting
and<00:02:28.410> then<00:02:28.500> obviously<00:02:28.910> takes<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.090> wind<00:02:30.270> chill

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
and then obviously takes the wind chill

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.320 
and then obviously takes the wind chill
off<00:02:30.600> but<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.930> also<00:02:31.050> helps<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:32.700> your<00:02:33.060> core

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
off but it also helps you know your core

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.760 
off but it also helps you know your core
temperature<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.110> actual<00:02:34.350> wind<00:02:34.500> itself

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
temperature so the actual wind itself

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.890 
temperature so the actual wind itself
won't<00:02:34.950> reduce<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.520> by<00:02:35.760> too<00:02:35.820> much<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.840> that's

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
won't reduce it by too much so that's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.600 
won't reduce it by too much so that's
nice<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.440> high<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.830> again<00:02:38.190> these<00:02:38.370> work

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
nice and high and again these work

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.250 
nice and high and again these work
really<00:02:38.640> well<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.300> hood<00:02:39.570> system<00:02:39.990> which<00:02:40.110> I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
really well with the hood system which I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.110 
really well with the hood system which I
will<00:02:40.410> talk<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.830> about<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.820> found<00:02:42.030> right

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
will talk to you about to be found right

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.520 
will talk to you about to be found right
now<00:02:42.360> because<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.690> we're<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.020> going<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.290> flip

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
now because and we're now going to flip

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.490 
now because and we're now going to flip
the<00:02:43.650> jacket<00:02:43.950> over<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.780> then<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the jacket over so then you can see the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.930 
the jacket over so then you can see the
back<00:02:46.650> part<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> jacket<00:02:47.610> now<00:02:47.790> obviously

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
back part of the jacket now obviously

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.420 
back part of the jacket now obviously
the<00:02:48.870> jacket<00:02:49.230> itself<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.830> ergonomically

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the jacket itself is ergonomically

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.070 
the jacket itself is ergonomically
fitting<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.180> rather<00:02:51.570> than<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:51.900> being

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
fitting so I'm rather than it just being

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.290 
fitting so I'm rather than it just being
a<00:02:52.290> straight<00:02:52.590> down<00:02:52.890> jacket<00:02:53.370> well<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.000> it's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
a straight down jacket well it is it's

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.090 
a straight down jacket well it is it's
got<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.570> as<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.380> pretty<00:02:55.680> much<00:02:55.890> from

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
got this as you can see pretty much from

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.400 
got this as you can see pretty much from
the<00:02:56.240> zip<00:02:57.240> sits<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.900> same<00:02:58.110> should<00:02:58.290> I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the zip sits so for the same should I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.680 
the zip sits so for the same should I
say<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:59.160> all<00:02:59.430> kind<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.000> shaped<00:03:00.420> now

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
say it's all kind of shaped now

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.090 
say it's all kind of shaped now
basically<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.230> works<00:03:01.410> really<00:03:01.650> well<00:03:01.860> when<00:03:01.980> it

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
basically this works really well when it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.800 
basically this works really well when it
comes<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> layering<00:03:02.820> system<00:03:02.970> so

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
comes to the layering system so

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.420 
comes to the layering system so
obviously<00:03:04.080> if<00:03:04.200> you've<00:03:04.350> got<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> size<00:03:04.710> 12<00:03:05.190> North

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
obviously if you've got a size 12 North

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.640 
obviously if you've got a size 12 North
Face<00:03:05.670> jacket<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.960> will<00:03:07.290> work<00:03:07.410> really

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
Face jacket and that will work really

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.500 
Face jacket and that will work really
well<00:03:07.770> with<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> size<00:03:08.280> 12<00:03:08.700> North<00:03:08.970> Face<00:03:09.210> house

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
well with a size 12 North Face house

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.300 
well with a size 12 North Face house
right<00:03:09.750> over<00:03:09.780> 200<00:03:10.350> weight<00:03:10.440> fleece<00:03:10.710> on<00:03:10.920> top<00:03:11.100> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
right over 200 weight fleece on top and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.680 
right over 200 weight fleece on top and
then<00:03:11.400> obviously<00:03:11.730> either<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.180> t-shirt<00:03:12.540> or<00:03:12.630> a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
then obviously either a t-shirt or a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.210 
then obviously either a t-shirt or a
base<00:03:12.930> they<00:03:13.170> are<00:03:13.200> underneath<00:03:13.770> obviously

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
base they are underneath obviously

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.140 
base they are underneath obviously
depending<00:03:14.520> on<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.640> time<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.880> year<00:03:15.090> that

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
depending on the time of year that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.080 
depending on the time of year that
you're<00:03:15.360> walking<00:03:15.570> these<00:03:16.290> all<00:03:16.770> together<00:03:17.090> give

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
you're walking these all together give

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.790 
you're walking these all together give
you<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.240> better<00:03:18.390> fit<00:03:18.690> which<00:03:19.110> also<00:03:19.320> means<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
you a better fit which also means the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.080 
you a better fit which also means the
layering<00:03:20.010> systems<00:03:20.520> going<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.760> work<00:03:20.880> better

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
layering systems going to work better

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.400 
layering systems going to work better
for<00:03:21.300> you<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:21.510> it's<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> keep<00:03:21.960> you<00:03:22.080> warmer

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
for you so it's going to keep you warmer

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.290 
for you so it's going to keep you warmer
in<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> winter<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.130> obviously<00:03:23.760> cooler<00:03:24.060> in

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
in the winter and obviously cooler in

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.540 
in the winter and obviously cooler in
the<00:03:24.480> spring<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.960> this<00:03:25.200> summer<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.190> again<00:03:26.280> as

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
the spring and this summer and again as

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.040 
the spring and this summer and again as
I<00:03:26.670> said<00:03:26.700> before<00:03:26.970> you've<00:03:27.300> got<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.720> toggle

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
I said before you've got the toggle

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.290 
I said before you've got the toggle
system<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.710> you've<00:03:29.610> got<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.790> toggle<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.210> the

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
system so you've got a toggle on the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.700 
system so you've got a toggle on the
back<00:03:30.450> now<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.900> then<00:03:31.050> as<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.260> say<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.680> a

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
back now and then as I say to you a

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.320 
back now and then as I say to you a
couple<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.040> seconds<00:03:32.340> ago<00:03:32.400> you've<00:03:32.970> got<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.180> two

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
couple of seconds ago you've got the two

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.850 
couple of seconds ago you've got the two
toggles<00:03:33.540> systems<00:03:34.050> on<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.230> front<00:03:34.470> now

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
toggles systems on the front now

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.100 
toggles systems on the front now
basically<00:03:35.070> what<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:35.970> do<00:03:36.090> once<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.570> once<00:03:36.990> you

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
basically what you do once you once you

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.810 
basically what you do once you once you
obviously<00:03:37.410> got<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.620> hood<00:03:37.770> up<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.520> adjust

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
obviously got you hood up you can adjust

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.250 
obviously got you hood up you can adjust
the<00:03:39.000> hood<00:03:39.120> accordingly<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:39.750> by<00:03:39.870> pulling<00:03:40.080> on

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
the hood accordingly so by pulling on

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.780 
the hood accordingly so by pulling on
these<00:03:40.440> toggle<00:03:40.650> systems<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.280> front<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.700> on

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
these toggle systems on the front and on

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.730 
these toggle systems on the front and on
the<00:03:41.820> back<00:03:42.060> there<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.480> basically<00:03:42.990> enables<00:03:43.650> the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
the back there and basically enables the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.290 
the back there and basically enables the
actual<00:03:43.980> hood<00:03:44.190> itself<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.790> fit<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.150> your<00:03:45.240> head

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
actual hood itself to fit on your head

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.610 
actual hood itself to fit on your head
so<00:03:45.540> rather<00:03:45.720> than<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.990> hood<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.230> say

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
so rather than the hood you say

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.620 
so rather than the hood you say
dooms<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.580> basically<00:03:48.000> staying<00:03:48.210> on<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.450> so

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
dooms just basically staying on that so

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.510 
dooms just basically staying on that so
when<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.900> want<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.080> look<00:03:49.200> left<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.500> white<00:03:49.740> it

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
when you want to look left and white it

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.610 
when you want to look left and white it
stays<00:03:50.820> there<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.240> actual<00:03:51.510> hood<00:03:51.780> itself<00:03:52.080> will

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
stays there the actual hood itself will

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.370 
stays there the actual hood itself will
move<00:03:53.040> with<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:53.850> also<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.930> works<00:03:55.170> really

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
move with you also this works really

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.290 
move with you also this works really
well<00:03:55.620> with<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.980> peak<00:03:56.190> as<00:03:56.430> well<00:03:56.700> that's<00:03:56.910> in<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
well with the peak as well that's in the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.390 
well with the peak as well that's in the
hood<00:03:57.450> giving<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.200> clear<00:03:58.590> sights<00:03:58.980> all<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
hood giving you clear sights all the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.340 
hood giving you clear sights all the
time<00:03:59.610> and<00:04:00.210> once<00:04:00.330> it's<00:04:00.450> all<00:04:00.540> pulled<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:00.990> that

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
time and once it's all pulled in that

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.410 
time and once it's all pulled in that
peak<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.250> going<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.460> stay<00:04:02.670> up<00:04:02.940> all<00:04:03.210> the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
peak is just going to stay up all the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.240 
peak is just going to stay up all the
time<00:04:03.600> so<00:04:03.840> even<00:04:04.320> if<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:04.560> absolutely<00:04:04.950> chucking

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
time so even if it's absolutely chucking

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.350 
time so even if it's absolutely chucking
it<00:04:05.310> down<00:04:05.340> with<00:04:05.670> rain<00:04:05.910> or<00:04:06.090> if<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:06.300> really

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
it down with rain or if it's really

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.660 
it down with rain or if it's really
really<00:04:06.750> that's<00:04:06.930> always<00:04:07.230> going<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.740> stay<00:04:08.010> up<00:04:08.250> so

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
really that's always going to stay up so

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.160 
really that's always going to stay up so
then<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.880> can<00:04:09.030> see<00:04:09.180> where<00:04:09.360> you've<00:04:09.480> been<00:04:09.660> where

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
then you can see where you've been where

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.770 
then you can see where you've been where
you're<00:04:10.260> going<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.800> where<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.130> need<00:04:11.460> to<00:04:11.910> go<00:04:12.210> so

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
you're going and where you need to go so

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.850 
you're going and where you need to go so
that's<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.050> other<00:04:13.170> side<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.620> jacket

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
that's the other side of the jacket

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.500 
that's the other side of the jacket
let's<00:04:14.130> just<00:04:14.370> take<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.610> look<00:04:14.790> at<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.150> inside

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
let's just take a look at the inside

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.390 
let's just take a look at the inside
shower

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
shower

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.229 
shower
obviously<00:04:17.400> they<00:04:17.489> try<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.760> keep<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.120> as

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
obviously they try to keep it as

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.070 
obviously they try to keep it as
lightweight<00:04:18.480> as<00:04:18.840> possible<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:21.239> there's<00:04:21.930> nine

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
lightweight as possible so there's nine

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.830 
lightweight as possible so there's nine
there's<00:04:22.890> basically<00:04:23.310> no<00:04:23.790> nothing<00:04:24.479> major<00:04:24.660> on

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
there's basically no nothing major on

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.450 
there's basically no nothing major on
the<00:04:24.930> actual<00:04:25.140> internal<00:04:25.560> part<00:04:25.950> itself<00:04:26.220> there's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
the actual internal part itself there's

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.010 
the actual internal part itself there's
no<00:04:26.580> pocket

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
no pocket

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.300 
no pocket
so<00:04:27.110> we<00:04:27.169> run<00:04:27.289> a<00:04:27.319> thing<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:27.650> that<00:04:27.710> that's<00:04:28.099> just

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
so we run a thing like that that's just

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.740 
so we run a thing like that that's just
purely<00:04:28.580> just<00:04:28.849> to<00:04:29.030> keep<00:04:29.180> obviously<00:04:29.569> one

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
purely just to keep obviously one

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.089 
purely just to keep obviously one
because<00:04:29.990> you've<00:04:30.110> got<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.289> ventilation<00:04:30.949> and

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
because you've got the ventilation and

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.129 
because you've got the ventilation and
to<00:04:31.849> just<00:04:32.090> kind<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.419> keep<00:04:32.539> the<00:04:32.690> weight<00:04:32.900> down<00:04:32.930> but

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
to just kind of keep the weight down but

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.020 
to just kind of keep the weight down but
what<00:04:33.319> you<00:04:33.410> do<00:04:33.560> helplessly<00:04:33.919> have<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.430> this<00:04:34.729> nice

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
what you do helplessly have is this nice

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.879 
what you do helplessly have is this nice
mesh<00:04:35.419> lined<00:04:35.750> as<00:04:35.960> well<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:36.259> if<00:04:36.319> you<00:04:36.409> don't<00:04:36.590> doing

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
mesh lined as well so if you don't doing

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.379 
mesh lined as well so if you don't doing
a<00:04:36.949> lot<00:04:37.129> of<00:04:37.250> movement<00:04:37.460> like<00:04:37.729> you're<00:04:37.849> fast-paced

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
a lot of movement like you're fast-paced

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.240
