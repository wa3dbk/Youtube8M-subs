00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hey people and welcome to mikes edit 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.500
 Today I show you as you with one 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:16.440
 click the sound in sync with the picture 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 You can get it in an earlier tutorial 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.010
 I already showed how to do it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.619
 can synchronize sound and image using 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.750
 from a film flap so with help 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.350
 a clapper or a clap in 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.779
 the hands 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 today it's about another little one 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.219
 trick and the whole thing works with 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.620
 Adobe Premiere needed the whole thing 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.270
 About two seconds it really only 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.340
 One click I do not know how to do it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.920
 other cut program is something like 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.469
 magix or something no idea if so, too 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.329
 such a function is final cut pro ex 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.670
 also has its function I know that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.770
 but today shows you adobe premiere 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.579
 I'm taking the whole sound right now 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.039
 you hear with the road smartlab here 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 down on my iphone with the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.719
 escalator i know at android 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.520
 smartphones there is this app not there 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.650
 you just have to take another app around 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.240
 to record the whole but plays here 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.619
 at the moment no role 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.630
 I have the recording here now 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.970
 started on the camera synonymous runs the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.430
 Recording is important that the sound 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.930
 also recorded on the camera 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.060
 so it will not be the microphone somehow 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.400
 mute the camera or the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.439
 tone down level or something but 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.080
 really best just the camera 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.610
 on automatic sound on automatic 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.290
 turn torpedo and then 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.729
 it works pretty well we are 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.490
 here also under difficult conditions 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 here on the side is a highway here 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.939
 on the side is a station the train s 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.700
 So it should also show again 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.890
 that despite ambient noise 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.579
 Ambient noise that relatively well 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.770
 is working 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.619
 I have now as I said recording 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.490
 started packing the smartphone in mine 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.259
 pocket 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.560
 the recording is running and you can 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.420
 now for help, for example, a 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.100
 You do not need to do gossip now 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.619
 necessarily because the whole thing works like this 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.719
 that the sound from the camera and the sound 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.210
 the external one recorded here is on 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.469
 compared with each other the smartphone 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.840
 and how the whole thing works 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.670
 I show you in premiere now 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.129
 we are about like now 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.080
 premiere pro tc I do not know which 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.500
 version the whole thing works on everyone 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.230
 case 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.180
 c6 it was already in front of it I am 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.070
 not sure now i have mine here 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.420
 sound recording the normal in the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.850
 iphone was saved 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.220
 and my picture so that from the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.840
 camera with the original camera sound and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.850
 the only thing we have to do now 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.230
 I'll show you again here is not an end 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.570
 point or something like that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.910
 here in the picture is not in point or 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.530
 something set and the only thing we did 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.140
 do both now 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.390
 so with pressed ctrl button both 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.110
 Click on the right mouse button 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.190
 merge one of the two clips 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.020
 and then a window opens here 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.209
 For example, it will be a new name 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.610
 can enter or we can do things 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.500
 select what to synchronize to 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.450
 for example in points or on points 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.850
 I could now look into the points 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.580
 Put sound and picture recordings and then 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.250
 dhabi would synchronize that afterwards 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.230
 or time code 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.510
 if both now so both the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.520
 sound recording as well as the picture recording in 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.230
 the recording itself is the same 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.750
 time code then i could do this here 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.060
 select but we now take audio 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.540
 because after the audio is supposed to be synchronized 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.690
 become 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.060
 and I advise you here also audio from mv 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.610
 select clip to remove 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.269
 that means that the original sound of the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.040
 now out of the camera stems 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.010
 is removed and then only the sound 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.530
 which is newly created to hear is so 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.670
 the other one is replaced and therewith and 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.459
 Now we just need to go ok 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.140
 Press and wait a bit which can 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.000
 Now take a few seconds to complete 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.880
 One minute I would say come 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.220
 always on how long clip is and 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.530
 how fast your computer is and ever 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.090
 if longer or shorter it can 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.110
 take longer or shorter 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.760
 that takes a lot of time now 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.239
 Zack it is done and here we have 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.070
 directly the clip with the clip name and 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.530
 then I would have put together now 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.090
 typed in another name would be 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.320
 here of course another name and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.880
 I'll show you the one now 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.299
 difference as always in the original 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.880
 clip time already saved 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.859
 where I jump now and that is 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.030
 now the beginning of the video you 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.229
 now have seen it now 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.229
 once with original sound 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.990
 and now again with synchronous sound 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.210
 hey people and welcome to mikes like 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.730
 Today I show you as you with one 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.260
 click the sound in sync with the picture 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.410
 can get a huge difference 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.940
 anyway to the camera microphone 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.000
 Of course I like to take part 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.890
 the red live on but I have you 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.880
 thus also shown that the whole 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.840
 works though enormous 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.000
 background noise was so you hear 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.130
 The highway there is also motorcycle 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.250
 and so on but the whole thing has 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:13.660
 works because of this audio 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.150
 he analyzes there as such 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.190
 whole and then he puts that together and 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.660
 this works in most cases 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.060
 So I have never had a case where 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.890
 that did not work so easy 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.080
 can it go people how does you do that 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.370
 he synchronizes with the picture and sound 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.620
 also uses a great premiere 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.480
 maybe another plugin or one 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.430
 other program completely like it in 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.080
 other cut program like to post 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.770
 Down in the comments would be real 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.930
 interest 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.430
 otherwise you know the game I am 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.140
 Hope you liked the video and 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.270
 also helped if that is clear 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.130
 go upstairs channel for free 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.080
 subscribe to it so no cool video 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.220
 missed the video also gives more 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.750
 happy with your friends if it's you 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.790
 has fallen and many thanks to

 christoph blog photography for the 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.690
 Great work a camera
