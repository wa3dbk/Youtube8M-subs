00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.049
 ae with a yamaha key 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.870
 ah ah ah, because everyone thinks that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.539
 there have always been stars in the world 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.149
 flasher but it's wrong 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.570
 before the Indians looked at the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.750
 Dark and very dark sky was this sky 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 black 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.080
 I'll tell the simple story of the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.770
 birth of the stars was once in the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.460
 many Indians and assets 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.640
 They hunted fished at war but in 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.479
 boards did nothing 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.390
 They lay down on their hammocks and slept snoring 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 food only women took care of the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.350
 preparation of her to have in all 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.920
 eat once they noticed that it was missing 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.869
 corn in the grinder basket that made the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.700
 brave women 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.630
 the following fearlessly reported whether in the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 woods 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.649
 I'm a sexy yellow solo. 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:53.549
 the trees gleamed green underneath 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.939
 there was shade and fresh water when 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.359
 I left where under the canopies I found 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.310
 and drank in the kingdom of the waters of 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:08.250
 throbbing streams but always looking 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.519
 because hunger was one of those that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.100
 they ate leaves of trees but only 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.549
 found the pirates in distress 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.329
 grace 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:24.209
 Let's go back and bring some chrome 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:27.980
 so the Indians called the children 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.079
 curumin of luck and even gave 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.440
 the boys to guess things 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:37.760
 were retained in front and in a clearing 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.720
 from the forest they a lush cornfield 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.410
 growing tall 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.060
 the Indians marveled they said touches 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.139
 covered spike 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.819
 but the little boys also reap many 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.210
 fled mothers 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:58.740
 Coming back to Taba and asking Grandma 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.200
 a corn cake grandma so did god 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.640
 chrome were filled with cake that soon 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.030
 ended 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.080
 only then were they afraid of mothers who 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.210
 complain that they eat so much 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.740
 hide in a cave grandmother and the 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.720
 parrot because the two told everything 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.780
 assists the mothers 10 or lack of the voice of the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.360
 Tagalog parrot 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.050
 then they called the hummingbirds so that the 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.540
 moorage at the top of the sky when 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.750
 Indians came back scared seeing 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.810
 children up the air solve these 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.500
 Nervous mothers climb boys' boy and 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.450
 cut underneath them happened 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.370
 something that happens only when people 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.700
 believes 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.990
 the mothers fell to the ground, becoming 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.830
 in jaguars and in crimes like no longer 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.800
 could go back to earth stayed in the sky 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:03.050
 to date have become effective 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.970
 bright stars but for me 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.320
 I have to tell you that the stars are 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.960
 more than promising stars are the 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.700
 eyes of God watching for you to run 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:23.780
 okay for ever 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.780
 And as we all know, it never ends.
