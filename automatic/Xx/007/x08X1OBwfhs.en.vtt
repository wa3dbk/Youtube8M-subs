00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.309
 lighting is a very controversial issue 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.320
 they have a lot of discussion about this 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.800
 in our forum you can read but so 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.830
 I'll tell you so much attention 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 We do not pay for the lighting as with experience 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.859
 We understood that in principle it is for the bow 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.140
 not so important not so significant 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.820
 parameter yes again I repeat it 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 controversial question because say otherwise 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.920
 as for any green right 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.160
 lighting but we made sure that for the bow 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 it is not so main and main 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.200
 the only question is that he basically has 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.370
 we have enough 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.980
 daylight and after planting onions 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 In general, lighting as such is not necessary 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.620
 but we pay attention to our greenhouses in 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.800
 our work we pay attention only 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.309
 on those plots in the greenhouse on this on those 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.350
 plots you racks which up to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.700
 ill light hits you 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.630
 see here we have lighting 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.030
 enough on the bottom rack here we have 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.860
 there is one piece where the lighting is not 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.210
 daylight is not so lacking 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.729
 therefore to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.700
 if we see some kind of stunted growth 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 or the color of the pen is not very good 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.189
 especially in winter bitch then we 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.799
 lighting up the usual daytime lamps 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:39.360
 the light can of course also argue 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.299
 what special lamps are needed special 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.479
 lighting that is to pass 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.119
 certain light streams from experience 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.640
 because of the many attacks we deal with 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.140
 lining and green onions 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.649
 we concluded that it is not 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.649
 significantly
