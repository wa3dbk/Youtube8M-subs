gameplay<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.170> probably<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.650> arms<00:01:22.950> race<00:01:23.159> was

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
gameplay was probably when arms race was

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
gameplay was probably when arms race was
released<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.570> wanted<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:24.990> some

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
released and I just wanted to get some

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.350 
released and I just wanted to get some
core<00:01:25.380> gameplays<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.909> before<00:01:27.180> then

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
core gameplays on that but before then

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.030 
core gameplays on that but before then
it<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:28.049> probably<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.409> January<00:01:28.710> or

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it was probably like January or

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.800 
it was probably like January or
something<00:01:29.369> since<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.970> last<00:01:30.150> use<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.570> kill

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
something since I last use these kill

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.719 
something since I last use these kill
streaks<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> gameplay<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> reason<00:01:32.549> is

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
streaks and a gameplay and the reason is

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.280 
streaks and a gameplay and the reason is
the<00:01:33.180> reason<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.420> don't<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.840> use<00:01:34.020> them<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the reason I don't really use them is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.630 
the reason I don't really use them is
because<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.590> don't<00:01:34.799> enjoy<00:01:34.950> using<00:01:35.310> them<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> just

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
because I don't enjoy using them it just

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.090 
because I don't enjoy using them it just
makes<00:01:35.790> people<00:01:36.090> back<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.810> usually<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
makes people back out and usually it's a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
makes people back out and usually it's a
lot<00:01:38.220> more<00:01:38.340> fun<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> try<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.390> nuclear

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
lot more fun to try and go for nuclear

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
lot more fun to try and go for nuclear
streaks<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.979> did<00:01:41.159> manage<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
streaks but I did manage to go on a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.580 
streaks but I did manage to go on a
nuclear<00:01:42.240> streak<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.869> use<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:43.350> kill

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
nuclear streak and use these kill

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.929 
nuclear streak and use these kill
streaks<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> same<00:01:44.189> gameplay<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.850> went

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
streaks in the same gameplay so it went

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.670 
streaks in the same gameplay so it went
pretty<00:01:45.210> well<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.720> hopefully<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.079> guys<00:01:46.200> enjoy

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

obviously<00:02:08.300> they<00:02:08.420> give<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.720> 15<00:02:09.140> points<00:02:09.530> per

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
obviously they give you 15 points per

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.190 
obviously they give you 15 points per
kill<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.550> then<00:02:11.120> if<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.420> teammate<00:02:11.600> runs<00:02:11.900> out<00:02:12.050> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
kill and then if a teammate runs out the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.900 
kill and then if a teammate runs out the
tag<00:02:12.410> that's<00:02:12.620> an<00:02:12.740> extra<00:02:13.010> 50<00:02:13.280> points<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.640> believe

tag that's an extra 50 points I believe

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.140 
tag that's an extra 50 points I believe
so<00:02:14.180> that's<00:02:14.660> 65<00:02:15.260> points<00:02:15.590> for<00:02:16.340> one<00:02:16.490> kill<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.940> your

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
so that's 65 points for one kill of your

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.240 
so that's 65 points for one kill of your
swamp<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.690> your<00:02:18.320> swarm<00:02:18.590> can<00:02:18.710> get<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> load

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.980 
swamp and your swarm can get you a load
of<00:02:19.280> kills<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.000> that's<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.270> load<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.630> points<00:02:20.900> you

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
host migrations there that I skipped out

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.670 
host migrations there that I skipped out
so<00:02:49.820> my<00:02:49.970> swarm<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.420> my<00:02:50.570> dogs<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.260> called<00:02:51.500> in

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
so my swarm and my dogs I just called in

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.380 
so my swarm and my dogs I just called in
didn't<00:02:52.190> really<00:02:52.340> get<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.610> do<00:02:52.730> too<00:02:52.970> much<00:02:53.120> work

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
didn't really get to do too much work

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.120 
didn't really get to do too much work
because<00:02:53.660> they<00:02:53.990> were<00:02:54.050> cut<00:02:54.350> short<00:02:54.590> by<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.740> Year

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
because they were cut short by the Year

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.830 
because they were cut short by the Year
by<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.700> host<00:02:55.880> migration<00:02:56.390> but<00:02:56.450> it's<00:02:56.600> okay

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
by the host migration but it's okay

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.600 
by the host migration but it's okay
because<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.110> just<00:02:57.380> managed<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.800> get<00:02:57.980> my<00:02:58.370> next

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
because I just managed to get my next

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.180 
because I just managed to get my next
visa<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.390> was<00:02:59.750> able<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.110> rotate<00:03:00.380> my

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
visa so I was able to rotate my

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.310 
visa so I was able to rotate my
killstreaks<00:03:01.430> again<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.300> I'm<00:03:02.900> thinking<00:03:03.230> of

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
killstreaks again so I'm thinking of

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.690 
killstreaks again so I'm thinking of
doing<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:03.680> more<00:03:03.860> often<00:03:04.010> where<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.310> just<00:03:04.520> run

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
doing this more often where I just run

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.550 
doing this more often where I just run
into<00:03:04.820> ground<00:03:05.060> war<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.540> use<00:03:06.170> these<00:03:06.350> high

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
into ground war and use these high

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.350 
into ground war and use these high
streaks<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.070> get<00:03:07.160> some<00:03:07.280> hiking<00:03:07.490> gameplays

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
streaks and get some hiking gameplays

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.970 
streaks and get some hiking gameplays
because<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:09.140> know<00:03:09.230> I've<00:03:09.350> got<00:03:09.470> some<00:03:09.620> right<00:03:09.800> in

is<00:04:08.510> coming<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.840> end<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.080> gameplay

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
is coming to the end of the gameplay

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.750 
is coming to the end of the gameplay
this<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.620> where<00:04:09.799> I<00:04:09.830> decided<00:04:10.190> just<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.489> hold

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
this is where I decided just to hold

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.160 
this is where I decided just to hold
back<00:04:10.970> on<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.150> few<00:04:11.360> tags<00:04:11.570> I've<00:04:11.750> realized<00:04:12.049> that

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
back on a few tags I've realized that

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.229 
back on a few tags I've realized that
this<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.410> probably<00:04:12.620> going<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:12.980> be<00:04:13.100> my<00:04:13.760> left<00:04:14.030> my

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
this is probably going to be my left my

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.770 
this is probably going to be my left my
last<00:04:14.480> set<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.720> Strix<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.200> was<00:04:15.320> able<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.590> call<00:04:15.799> in

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
last set of Strix I was able to call in

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.390 
last set of Strix I was able to call in
do<00:04:16.989> some<00:04:17.170> work<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.560> thought<00:04:17.739> I'd<00:04:17.950> save<00:04:18.190> some

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
do some work so I thought I'd save some

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.550 
do some work so I thought I'd save some
time<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.820> I'll<00:04:19.570> buy<00:04:19.750> myself<00:04:19.959> some<00:04:20.260> more<00:04:20.380> time

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
time and I'll buy myself some more time

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.870 
time and I'll buy myself some more time
and<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:20.859> leave<00:04:21.010> some<00:04:21.220> tags<00:04:21.430> on<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.640> floor

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
and just leave some tags on the floor

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.270 
and just leave some tags on the floor
and<00:04:22.090> hopefully<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:22.750> was<00:04:23.200> able<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.620> get<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.860> 100

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
and hopefully I was able to get that 100

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.980 
and hopefully I was able to get that 100
kills<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.760> that's<00:04:25.000> exactly<00:04:25.210> what<00:04:25.480> happens<00:04:25.780> so

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
kills and that's exactly what happens so

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.720 
kills and that's exactly what happens so
