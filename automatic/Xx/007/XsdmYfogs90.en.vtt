00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.650 
laser for non one we've got picked up
over<00:00:09.780> there<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.800> second<00:00:11.070> one<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.660> LSO

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
over there the second one is the LSO

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.650 
over there the second one is the LSO
hover<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.639> this<00:00:14.639> one<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.849> used<00:00:14.969> by<00:00:15.089> mike<00:00:15.299> i<00:00:15.509> use

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
hover and this one is used by mike i use

the<00:00:15.750> laser<00:00:15.900> forward<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.619> board<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.460> then

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the laser forward on board and then

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.460 
the laser forward on board and then
we're<00:00:18.390> gonna<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.570> reviewing<00:00:18.810> them<00:00:19.050> just

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
we're gonna be reviewing them just

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.349 
we're gonna be reviewing them just
discussing<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> really<00:00:20.760> good<00:00:20.880> aspects<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
discussing the really good aspects of

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.710 
discussing the really good aspects of
both<00:00:21.510> tails<00:00:22.789> okay<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> laser

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
both tails okay so this is the laser

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320 
both tails okay so this is the laser
photon<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.260> by<00:00:25.410> terra<00:00:25.710> nova<00:00:26.150> where's<00:00:27.150> about

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
photon one by terra nova where's about

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.370

to<00:00:46.829> pin<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.010> down<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.340> floor<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> layers<00:00:48.989> are

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
to pin it down the floor the layers are

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.250 
to pin it down the floor the layers are
poured<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.829> now<00:00:50.219> 2<00:00:50.280> pitch<00:00:50.550> 1st<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
poured on one is now 2 pitch 1st and

i<00:01:39.360> groaned<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.560> use<00:01:40.710> them<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.009> wet<00:01:41.880> soil<00:01:42.210> or

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
i groaned if you use them in wet soil or

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.080 
i groaned if you use them in wet soil or
softer<00:01:43.170> ground<00:01:43.290> they<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.460> come<00:01:44.700> loose<00:01:44.880> so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
softer ground they can come loose so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
softer ground they can come loose so
it's<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.420> windy<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.740> something

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
