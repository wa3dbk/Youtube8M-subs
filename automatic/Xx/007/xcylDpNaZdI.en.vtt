today<00:00:00.599> we<00:00:00.810> look<00:00:01.050> at<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.410> science<00:00:01.829> behind<00:00:02.010> a

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
today we look at the science behind a

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.849 
today we look at the science behind a
tennis<00:00:02.639> balls<00:00:02.939> felt<00:00:03.720> covering<00:00:06.560> tennis<00:00:07.560> balls

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
tennis balls felt covering tennis balls

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.310 
tennis balls felt covering tennis balls
the<00:00:08.580> holy<00:00:08.820> balls<00:00:09.090> used<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.570> sport<00:00:09.929> which<00:00:10.170> are

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the holy balls used in sport which are

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.669 
the holy balls used in sport which are
covered<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.800> filled<00:00:11.690> today<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:13.019> find<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:13.440> why

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
covered and filled today we find out why

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:23.029 
covered and filled today we find out why
they<00:00:13.950> are<00:00:13.980> designed<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.849> way<00:00:21.650> we<00:00:22.650> asked<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
they are designed this way we asked a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.710 
they are designed this way we asked a
professional<00:00:23.609> player<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.090> hit<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.240> series<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
professional player to hit a series of

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.200 
professional player to hit a series of
balls<00:00:25.050> towards<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.769> small<00:00:26.039> target<00:00:26.310> marked<00:00:27.090> in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
balls towards a small target marked in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.990 
balls towards a small target marked in
the<00:00:27.300> corner<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> court<00:00:31.790> when<00:00:32.790> using

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the corner of the court when using

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
the corner of the court when using
standard<00:00:33.360> balls<00:00:34.050> he<00:00:34.440> manages<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.070> land<00:00:35.250> three

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
standard balls he manages to land three

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.720 
standard balls he manages to land three
out<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> five<00:00:36.300> shots<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.230> small<00:00:37.530> area<00:00:43.730> with

out of five shots in the small area with

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.510 
out of five shots in the small area with
balls<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.360> covered<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.960> felt<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:47.039> asked

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
balls not covered in felt we then asked

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:57.840 
balls not covered in felt we then asked
him<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.940> repeat<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> task

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.719 

the<00:00:58.360> player<00:00:58.660> misses<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.350> target<00:00:59.590> completely

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.820 

so<00:01:06.729> why<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.060> there<00:01:07.420> such<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.660> big<00:01:07.810> difference<00:01:08.050> in

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
so why is there such a big difference in

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.150 
so why is there such a big difference in
accuracy<00:01:09.370> and<00:01:09.790> why<00:01:10.690> is<00:01:10.750> felt<00:01:11.350> covering<00:01:11.860> so

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
accuracy and why is felt covering so

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.520 
accuracy and why is felt covering so

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.890 
when we show the two balls side-by-side
the<00:03:31.890> difference<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.459> airflow<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.239> direction

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
the difference in airflow and direction

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.500 
the difference in airflow and direction
is<00:03:34.049> obvious<00:03:34.650> we<00:03:35.459> can<00:03:35.670> clearly<00:03:35.909> see<00:03:36.239> how<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
is obvious we can clearly see how the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.000 
is obvious we can clearly see how the
felt<00:03:36.900> improves<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.680> player's<00:03:37.980> control

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.550 

the<00:03:42.550> tennis<00:03:42.879> balls<00:03:43.180> design<00:03:43.659> is<00:03:43.900> critical<00:03:44.110> to

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
the tennis balls design is critical to

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.430 
the tennis balls design is critical to
the<00:03:44.680> game<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.190> helps<00:03:45.909> pros<00:03:46.299> land<00:03:46.900> their<00:03:47.110> shots

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
the game and helps pros land their shots

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.600 
the game and helps pros land their shots
exactly<00:03:48.400> where<00:03:48.730> they<00:03:48.970> walk

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.190 

so<00:03:54.610> we<00:03:54.700> can<00:03:54.880> see<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.330> felt<00:03:55.630> is<00:03:55.840> very

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
so we can see that the felt is very

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.740 
so we can see that the felt is very
important<00:03:56.980> scheisse<00:03:57.550> very<00:03:57.940> there<00:03:58.120> Harry

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
important scheisse very there Harry

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.170 
important scheisse very there Harry

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
it is this bull has more hairs than

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.430 
it is this bull has more hairs than
