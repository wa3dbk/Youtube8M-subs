00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:02.210
I had an idea to
demonstrate speed

00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:03.903
control on 3
different routers

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:05.838
but I only have 2 router tables.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.207
So that, of course, means I need
to build another router table.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.511
And I had the idea of using my
slot mortiser as a router table.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.647
A horizontal one by fastening
a piece of wood on here

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.482
and just routing
right through that.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.193
I figure I want
to hold the other

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:19.852
table at about
this height here.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.655
I need a fence that goes up
against the other fence.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:25.931
So I think I want a profile
roughly like this.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.380
It kind of sucks that this piece
of wood has some cracks in it.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.003
But I don't want to
start over again

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:50.449
so I'm just gonna
reinforce that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.371
with some screws.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:34.746
I thought of
building a

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:36.095
horizontal router
table like this

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.431
on here a long time ago,
but I've always worried

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.107
what's gonna happen
with the shavings.

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:41.868
because they're just
gonna clog up here.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.437
But the key is to have
dust collection and

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:47.940
this will guide the
air this way and then

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.110
this part fits on here.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.679
And then this will
hold the hose.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.582
And then the hose
plugs in right here.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.325
And hopefully that
way, I'll clear

00:01:58.346 --> 00:01:59.819
the chips as I'm
making them.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.388
So I just did a whole bunch
of drilling and screwing so

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.194
this is screwed
on here and these

00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:05.892
parts are all
screwed together.

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:08.394
And the dust hose fits on here.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:11.197
And Iâ€™ve got this
little hook thingy.

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:16.702
So this will slide
along the table.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:20.139
And I can fasten that
down with a wing nut.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.575
And this part here supports
the front of the table

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:26.846
and it just goes on there
with a pair of C-clamps.

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:30.051
And then the table
screws on top of here.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.735
So, let's see how
this is gonna work.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:11.783
Well, as best as I can tell

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.866
there is no chips
lying in there so I

00:03:15.887 --> 00:03:18.168
think it clears the
dust just fine.

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.500
Well I think that
was successful.

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.768
You could, of course,
also build a

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.035
table like this for
a Pantorouter.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.868
But for this
application, the slot

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.146
mortiser is the
better machine.
