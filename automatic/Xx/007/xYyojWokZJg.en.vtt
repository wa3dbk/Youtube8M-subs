I achieve this look then surgeon ok so
the<00:00:11.550> head<00:00:11.670> unlocking<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> moment<00:00:12.719> is

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the head unlocking at the moment is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.670 
the head unlocking at the moment is
Milky<00:00:13.410> Way<00:00:13.559> q<00:00:14.009> hair<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.540> thats<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
Milky Way q hair and and thats like the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.830 
Milky Way q hair and and thats like the
yakky<00:00:16.980> texture<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.090> means<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.420> blends<00:00:18.660> in

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
yakky texture so it means it blends in

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.640 
yakky texture so it means it blends in
with<00:00:19.140> african<00:00:19.710> caribbean<00:00:19.890> relaxed<00:00:20.730> hair<00:00:21.650> it's

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
with african caribbean relaxed hair it's

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.250 
with african caribbean relaxed hair it's
more<00:00:22.859> thick<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.730> whereas<00:00:24.420> european<00:00:25.050> we've

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
more thick so whereas european we've

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.080 
more thick so whereas european we've
blend<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.160> caucasian<00:00:26.910> textures<00:00:27.630> and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
blend in with caucasian textures and

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.849 
blend in with caucasian textures and
asian<00:00:30.090> textures<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.810> yeah<00:00:31.260> key<00:00:31.439> terms<00:00:31.679> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
asian textures and yeah key terms to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.910 
asian textures and yeah key terms to
blending<00:00:32.250> back<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.850> caribbean<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.290> i<00:00:34.620> would

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
blending back and caribbean so i would

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.080 
blending back and caribbean so i would
that<00:00:35.540> one<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> look<00:00:37.489> realistic<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that one of it to look realistic you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.069 
that one of it to look realistic you
know<00:00:39.120> wanted<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> person<00:00:39.899> actually
