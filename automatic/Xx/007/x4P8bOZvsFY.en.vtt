 finalist to the girl and colombia contest 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:13.480
 2002 continuing with the details of 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.570
 beauty today I have you how to prepare your 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.119
 face for a good makeup then 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.640
 we analyze our mirror in the creams 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.430
 necessary and in this case we are going to 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.880
 start by cleaning our face either 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.160
 with a damp cloth or with a 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.960
 cleansing cream this can be done 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.989
 depending 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.899
 to girls who use a lot of makeup 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.590
 I recommend washing your face first 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.920
 with soap and water 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.310
 go through the wet panic is also 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.100
 good option to clean the neck too 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.930
 it is very important to prepare the neck 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.930
 also because - according to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.440
 many many professional people in 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.620
 the theme 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.219
 I know that the age of the woman is reflected in 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.219
 hands 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.130
 cleaned your face 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.920
 we already said it with so many cream 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:22.229
 we started putting the base 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.670
 the base of moisturizer in this case 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.799
 you can choose the cream that 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.430
 better to fall to your skin that was accommodated 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.430
 to the pocket 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.350
 and that they are very judicious applying themselves 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.890
 this in the morning and the night before 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.000
 of makeup and after makeup 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.150
 I'm applying a contour serum 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.150
 eyes 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.150
 it's very important because this part of the 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.220
 tenderloin is delicate 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:04.270
 and as I was saying it is important to apply 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.429
 cream on your outside to also moisturize 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.410
 taking this into account for 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.410
 people who use sunscreen 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.980
 It is advisable to apply it before 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.980
 put on cream 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.720
 and it is also very important that they fix 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.060
 his eyebrows if they have are perfect for 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.660
 that when you apply makeup 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.610
 obviously the color in results 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.190
 make the effect that corresponds to them 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.720

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.260

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.950
