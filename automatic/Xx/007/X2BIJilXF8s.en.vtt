00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.920
 who does not keep his commitments 2 it's ok 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.229
 to be the best way to leave the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.270
 place to this scourge of the century which is the 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.100
 procrastination 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.320
 I do not know if you if you have this 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.439
 used to postpone what 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.850
 you have to do it right now 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.250
 this is really what human touch 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 right now it's always postponed to 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.700
 next day 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.979
 and serving a billion guys that I 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.439
 I'm tired I do not have the Algerian word the 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.450
 same but was more makeup I did not 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.009
 am not in mode etc etc 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.500
 and by the way, what does that mean? 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.210
 in everyone's life but the signal 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.350
 hill is overtaking you why because 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.909
 it's people who go to 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.539
 the action that make the difference 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.399
 personally I take a putsch at 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.289
 the less I pity people who cry 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.520
 because they gave up if you 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.320
 give crying 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.500
 and for one reason because it 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.090
 is continuing to put 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.100
 the action of a product because if you 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.049
 do not do people action 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.539
 staff will make your way it's very 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.579
 simple if we do not move back even 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.840
 better today we die 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:14.739
 so here I have no makeup 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.110
 I 'm tired but I fought this 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.700
 procrastination how did I do his ba 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.830

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.510
 people today millions thanks to 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.519
 the TV on the Pope's radio for 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.950
 finally being submissive and nothing 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.260
 to do so what to do 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.209
 that you are taken by sebo companion 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.160

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.870
 already tell you a story it's this 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.280

 commitment his outfit must hold his 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.930
 promise 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 it promises a video at a rate of one per 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.319
 day 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.120
 move your buttocks out of bed and 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.650
 you will honor these people because if you 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.500
 do not keep your promise no one 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.810
 will have confidence and even you will be yourself 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.700
 you will feel completely 1000 m to 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.579
 you raise this is the first of 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.850
 things change the story that you are 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.889

 second Caribbean is sometimes we have 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.250
 badly to change the story loudly and stop 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.859
 the recipients because it is the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.609
 dialogue does she or who bluesy good 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.170
 dynamic 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.940
 because you 're here in the process of 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.970
 justified by the fact of doing nothing 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.740
 tired of bursting not the best way 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.380
 to stop the internal dialogue it's very 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.420
 simple when you are in contact 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.150
 without expressing your tongue and sticking 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.790
 to your palate and that's what makes that 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.440
 your mechanics dance a turner has 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.140
