00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
situation versus a six on six who can

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.260 
situation versus a six on six who can
tell<00:00:17.670> me<00:00:17.699> max<00:00:18.590> six<00:00:19.590> or<00:00:19.770> seven<00:00:20.160> percent<00:00:20.310> excuse

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
tell me max six or seven percent excuse

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.070 
tell me max six or seven percent excuse
me<00:00:21.449> 60<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.350> 70%<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.820> six<00:00:24.180> or<00:00:24.330> seven<00:00:24.660> out<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.810> ten

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
me 60 or 70% so six or seven out of ten

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
me 60 or 70% so six or seven out of ten

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.350 
from UNC but I'm still gonna rip it
right<00:02:22.140> off<00:02:22.200> Larry's<00:02:22.830> hip<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.790> I'm<00:02:24.000> gonna<00:02:24.120> use

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
right off Larry's hip and I'm gonna use

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.199 
right off Larry's hip and I'm gonna use
him<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> screen<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:26.280> Larry's<00:02:26.640> too<00:02:26.880> smart

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
him as a screen but Larry's too smart

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.720 
him as a screen but Larry's too smart
he's<00:02:27.420> gonna<00:02:27.569> play<00:02:27.810> where<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.140> CONUS<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
he's gonna play where that CONUS so the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.699 
he's gonna play where that CONUS so the
first<00:02:30.000> thing<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.330> thinking<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.750> space<00:02:36.709> the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
first thing I'm thinking is space the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.340 
first thing I'm thinking is space the
defender<00:02:38.370> once<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.300> draw<00:02:39.600> him<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.280> dump<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.550> ball

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
defender once I draw him I dump the ball

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.820 
defender once I draw him I dump the ball
okay<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.970> then<00:02:44.970> finally<00:02:45.300> he<00:02:46.230> does<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.620> same

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
okay and then finally he does the same

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.479 
okay and then finally he does the same
thing<00:02:47.360> he's<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> threat<00:02:48.780> these<00:02:49.320> drawers<00:02:49.650> dump

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
thing he's a threat these drawers dump

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.800 
thing he's a threat these drawers dump
and<00:02:50.820> then<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.269> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> backside
