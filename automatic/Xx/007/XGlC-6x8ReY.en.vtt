Dinis earthlight the whole enchilada and

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.910 
Dinis earthlight the whole enchilada and
really<00:00:12.179> neat<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.719> made<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> big<00:00:14.000> battery<00:00:15.920> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
really neat I made a big battery and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.000 
really neat I made a big battery and
this<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.730> big<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.590> he<00:00:19.590> has<00:00:19.710> shown

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
this is the big one that he has shown

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.290 
this is the big one that he has shown
and<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> laser<00:00:21.060> sabers<00:00:21.720> idea<00:00:22.279> but

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
and this is laser sabers idea but

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.939 
and this is laser sabers idea but
somebody<00:00:24.300> else<00:00:24.510> i<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.199> pirate<00:00:25.740> or

right<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:12.320> look<00:01:13.320> at<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> milliamps<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
right that look at the milliamps that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
right that look at the milliamps that
that<00:01:14.909> thing's<00:01:15.119> pumping<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.380> pumping

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that thing's pumping out it's pumping

out<00:01:16.860> 21<00:01:17.310> milliamps<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.390> doesn't<00:01:18.689> sound<00:01:18.869> like

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
out 21 milliamps that doesn't sound like

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
out 21 milliamps that doesn't sound like
a<00:01:19.080> lot<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.409> folks<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.759> you're<00:01:20.909> working

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
a lot of folks but when you're working

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850 
a lot of folks but when you're working
with<00:01:21.420> these<00:01:21.600> kinds<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> things<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.500> run<00:01:22.830> on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
with these kinds of things that run on

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.960 
with these kinds of things that run on
the<00:01:23.840> moisture<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.950> something<00:01:26.400> else<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the moisture that is something else and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840 
the moisture that is something else and
that<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.990> guy<00:01:28.140> over<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.579> only

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that little guy over there is only

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
that little guy over there is only
putting<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.360> about<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.659> milliamp<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.890> it's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
putting out about a milliamp and it's

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.770 
putting out about a milliamp and it's
running<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.820> pulse<00:01:33.090> motors<00:01:33.570> been<00:01:33.720> running

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
running that pulse motors been running

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.039 
running that pulse motors been running
that<00:01:34.110> pulse<00:01:34.409> motor<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> long<00:01:35.189> time<00:01:35.579> and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
that pulse motor for a long time and

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.830 
that pulse motor for a long time and
that<00:01:37.430> difference<00:01:38.430> between<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> size<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.659> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that difference between the size of that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.639 
that difference between the size of that
and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.740> size<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.899> huge<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.470> run

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and the size of that is huge I can run

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
and the size of that is huge I can run
most<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.130> my<00:01:44.310> projects<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.810> work<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
most of my projects that work on a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.100 
most of my projects that work on a
double<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.890> battery<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.479> battery<00:01:48.930> right

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
double a battery on that battery right

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
double a battery on that battery right
there<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.710> lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.399> stuff<00:01:50.670> works<00:01:50.970> down<00:01:51.240> there

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
there a lot of my stuff works down there

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.230 
there a lot of my stuff works down there
around<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.810> milliamp<00:01:52.170> now<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.610> can't<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
around a milliamp now if I can't get it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.679 
around a milliamp now if I can't get it
to<00:01:54.420> run<00:01:54.600> down<00:01:55.369> under<00:01:56.369> 100<00:01:56.729> milliamps<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.509> don't

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
to run down under 100 milliamps I don't

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.300 
to run down under 100 milliamps I don't
think<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:57.990> doing<00:01:58.140> very<00:01:58.439> good<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> double<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
think I'm doing very good on a double a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
think I'm doing very good on a double a
battery<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.909> could<00:02:00.270> probably<00:02:00.479> run<00:02:00.719> exciters

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
battery I could probably run exciters

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.219 
battery I could probably run exciters
off<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.280> jewel<00:02:02.549> ringer<00:02:03.049> some<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.140> my

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
it up and felt and then just start

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.050 
it up and felt and then just start
spiraling<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.770> magnesium<00:02:40.280> ribbon<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:41.030> it

spiraling this magnesium ribbon on it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.270 
spiraling this magnesium ribbon on it
and<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:43.090> wonderful<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.330> its<00:02:44.570> hollow<00:02:44.840> inside

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
and it's wonderful in its hollow inside

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.710 
and it's wonderful in its hollow inside
now<00:02:46.280> John<00:02:46.700> mentioned<00:02:47.180> make<00:02:47.360> them<00:02:47.540> one<00:02:47.690> of

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
now John mentioned make them one of

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.690 
now John mentioned make them one of
these<00:02:47.930> things<00:02:48.170> with<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.440> magnesium<00:02:48.920> rod<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:49.550> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
these things with a magnesium rod on the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.970 
these things with a magnesium rod on the
inside<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.960> I'm<00:02:51.110> sure<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.380> would<00:02:51.740> work<00:02:51.770> just

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
inside and I'm sure that would work just

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.000 
inside and I'm sure that would work just
as<00:02:52.370> well<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:54.110> haven't<00:02:54.620> done<00:02:54.830> any

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
as well and I haven't done any

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.650 
as well and I haven't done any
temperature<00:02:55.520> readings<00:02:56.030> on<00:02:56.240> this<00:02:56.420> I'm<00:02:56.570> going

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
temperature readings on this I'm going

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.390 
temperature readings on this I'm going
to<00:02:56.780> let<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.020> run<00:02:57.320> for<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.620> day<00:02:57.770> or<00:02:57.890> two<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.190> see

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
to let this run for a day or two and see

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.060 
to let this run for a day or two and see
what<00:02:58.550> happens<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.120> all<00:02:59.870> I<00:02:59.930> did<00:03:00.320> once<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.770> built

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
what happens but all I did once I built

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.860 
what happens but all I did once I built
it<00:03:01.420> was<00:03:02.420> put<00:03:02.660> distilled<00:03:03.140> water<00:03:03.470> on<00:03:03.710> it<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.870> the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
it was put distilled water on it and the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.410 
it was put distilled water on it and the
felt<00:03:06.170> soaked<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.710> up<00:03:06.800> right<00:03:07.070> away<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:08.330> know

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
felt soaked it up right away you know

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.030 
felt soaked it up right away you know
that's<00:03:08.750> all<00:03:08.930> I'm<00:03:09.050> going<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.290> use<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:09.860> is

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
that's all I'm going to use on this is

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.030 
that's all I'm going to use on this is
distilled<00:03:10.460> water<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:11.330> puts<00:03:11.720> out<00:03:12.880> 1.75<00:03:13.880> volts

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
distilled water it puts out 1.75 volts

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.530 
distilled water it puts out 1.75 volts
at<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.940> milliamp<00:03:17.720> load<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:20.030> me<00:03:20.210> that's

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
at that milliamp load and to me that's

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.350 
at that milliamp load and to me that's
that's<00:03:21.200> fantastic<00:03:22.190> compared<00:03:22.970> up<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.270> the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
that's fantastic compared up to the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.900 
that's fantastic compared up to the
stuff<00:03:23.630> that<00:03:23.810> I've<00:03:23.930> built<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:24.440> far<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:25.070> like<00:03:25.730> I

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
stuff that I've built so far and like I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.490 
stuff that I've built so far and like I
say<00:03:26.120> that's<00:03:26.390> running<00:03:26.720> this<00:03:26.990> thing<00:03:27.230> right

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
say that's running this thing right

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.780 
say that's running this thing right
there<00:03:27.910> just<00:03:28.910> phenomenally<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:30.370> very<00:03:31.370> happy

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
there just phenomenally and very happy
