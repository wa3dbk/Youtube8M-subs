 hi dear friends swami marakasi 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.009
 for 5000 gold, that is, there were two prizes 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.110
 2 500 gold and in fact I already 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.460
 recorded a video well, at least I thought 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.320
 what i'm writing but there are buggy fraps and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.239
 just what I said there chose 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 the winner is he mean by chance 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.120
 I selected using random.org all 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.770
 I did not sign up I was just very shocked 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 strongly fraps let me down but none the less 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.010
 I wrote to the winners and even to one 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.129
 gave the prize here's the first winner 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 Alexander 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.140
 believe n cypher he already got a prize and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.600
 here even the screenshot sent me where it 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.299
 got a prize and even have me 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.259
 notice that here is a prism 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.500
 You came here 2,500 golds here it is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.310
 per person you can write to him and 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.290
 make sure that when the family was awarded a 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.560
 also the second winner here he is Fedor 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.049
 Latukhina 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 so let's see, too, I wrote to him 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.630
 year but he has not yet answered him apparently 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.290
 no, so far, what's online here is 859 he came in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 probably have to work will be pleased and 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.240
 so friends I decided another third 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.549
 the winner give gold well all the same yes it 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 my mistake although there were three conditions 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.630
 thousands of participants then 3 urge but 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.719
 since this is such a garbage I happened 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.659
 I also decided to win the third prize for 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.960
 2,500 gold and let's it now 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:12.750
 hopefully make a fraction write it down or 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:19.260
 I will delete finally and so and 2076 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:24.180
 participants all right right run 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:29.569
 barrel organ and win 3 prizes 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:34.680
 at number two hundred now we will find him 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:38.400
 damn how to be uncomfortable I already understood 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.030
 Well, in general, holding competitions is 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.800
 I liked the good idea and I rather 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.890
 I will still hold contests with 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.519

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.050

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:02.370
 interesting and so where is our winner 200 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:06.260
