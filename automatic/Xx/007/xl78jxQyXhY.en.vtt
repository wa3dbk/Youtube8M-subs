worried about getting a flat finish this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.889 
worried about getting a flat finish this
is<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.649> semi-gloss<00:01:31.219> so<00:01:31.520> it'll<00:01:32.329> be<00:01:32.420> really<00:01:32.570> good

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
is a semi-gloss so it'll be really good

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:51.120 
is a semi-gloss so it'll be really good
once<00:01:33.289> I<00:01:34.960> glaze<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.200> you'll<00:01:36.409> say<00:01:36.619> or<00:01:36.859> whether<00:01:37.070> it

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.950 

here's<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.900> finished<00:01:53.900> door<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.780> now<00:01:56.780> what

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
here's the finished door and now what

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.400 
here's the finished door and now what
I'm<00:01:57.050> going<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.200> do<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:58.490> stress<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.230> it's<00:02:00.230> not

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
I'm going to do is to stress it it's not

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.470 
I'm going to do is to stress it it's not
even<00:02:00.650> dry<00:02:00.890> yet<00:02:00.920> but<00:02:01.430> when<00:02:01.850> you're<00:02:01.970> distressing

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
even dry yet but when you're distressing

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.850 
even dry yet but when you're distressing
it<00:02:02.570> doesn't<00:02:02.780> really<00:02:02.870> matter<00:02:03.110> because<00:02:03.590> I'm

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
it doesn't really matter because I'm

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.410 
it doesn't really matter because I'm
going<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.220> be<00:02:04.310> taking<00:02:04.580> some<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.940> off<00:02:05.030> anyway

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
going to be taking some of it off anyway

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.170 
going to be taking some of it off anyway
so<00:02:05.480> if<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.440> don't<00:02:06.560> let<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.740> paint<00:02:07.100> dry<00:02:07.190> it's

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
so if I don't let that paint dry it's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.030 
so if I don't let that paint dry it's
actually<00:02:08.510> easier<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.899> take<00:02:09.080> off<00:02:09.290> I'm<00:02:09.740> going<00:02:09.950> to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
actually easier to take off I'm going to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.550 
actually easier to take off I'm going to
show<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.220> how<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.399> distress<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.600> door<00:02:12.290> and

show you how to distress the door and

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.100 
show you how to distress the door and
then<00:02:12.920> we're<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.400> finish<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.210> with<00:02:14.240> a

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
then we're going to finish it with a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.060 
then we're going to finish it with a
stain<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.820> give<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.150> an<00:02:17.420> older<00:02:17.720> look<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.260> once

we do that stain that distressing will
come<00:02:21.470> through<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.950> it'll<00:02:22.130> look<00:02:22.280> nice<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.910> not

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.650 
antiqued we'll say so to de-stress a
little<00:02:26.750> bit<00:02:26.870> here<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.800> give<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.100> an<00:02:28.220> idea

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
little bit here can I give you an idea

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.600 
little bit here can I give you an idea
so<00:02:29.660> pretty<00:02:30.080> much<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:30.350> you're<00:02:30.470> going<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.650> do<00:02:30.800> I

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
so pretty much what you're going to do I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:40.090 
so pretty much what you're going to do I
just<00:02:32.390> go<00:02:32.480> around<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.780> edges<00:02:34.270> go<00:02:35.270> down<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.980> I'm

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
just go around the edges go down and I'm

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.220 
just go around the edges go down and I'm
going<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.310> scrape<00:02:40.520> down<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.720> actual<00:02:41.930> wood

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
going to scrape down to the actual wood

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.170 
going to scrape down to the actual wood
because<00:02:42.709> when<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:42.890> put<00:02:43.100> this<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.520> glaze<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:43.970> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
because when I put this the glaze on it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.390 
because when I put this the glaze on it
you'll<00:02:45.140> define<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.820> distressing<00:02:46.820> mark

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:04.989 

you

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:04.999 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:13.610 

with<00:03:05.999> this<00:03:06.840> method<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:08.689> find<00:03:09.689> it<00:03:09.810> easier<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.900> get

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
with this method I find it easier to get

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.920 
with this method I find it easier to get
the<00:03:13.859> actual<00:03:14.219> pain<00:03:14.790> off<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> door<00:03:15.359> and<00:03:15.629> if<00:03:15.780> I'm

the actual pain off the door and if I'm
just<00:03:16.139> scraping<00:03:16.290> thin<00:03:16.680> layers<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.189> can<00:03:17.219> kinda

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
just scraping thin layers you can kinda

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.039 
just scraping thin layers you can kinda
just<00:03:18.389> dress<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.719> accordingly<00:03:20.689> things<00:03:21.689> too<00:03:21.930> you
