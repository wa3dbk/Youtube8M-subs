 like a stack of coins by many 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.030
 metal detectors are indefinable they 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.500
 attributed such a goal to ferrous metals 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.420
 the object is made of iron but for 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.600
 metal detectors a series of those quarrels in that 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 including metal detectors tesoro cibola 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.610
 such a goal is absolutely not 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:50.739
 no difficulty definitions we are now

 metal detectors but not for metal 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.420
 say fly quarrels in particular 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.000

 what depth 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.919
 35 centimeters us delicate bracelet with

 Since the time of Vasily Shuisky, we will look at 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.680
 what depth will discover it 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.680
 metal detector tesoro cibola 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:13.190
 22 centimeters on miniature silver 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.830

 but no matter the air test 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.610
 metal detector tesoro cibola passes

 he shows a remarkable result by 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.650
 depth of detection of various targets
