though how do you look at this one now
that<00:00:12.599> was<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> really<00:00:12.929> good<00:00:13.110> challenge<00:00:13.320> for

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
that was a really good challenge for

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.169 
that was a really good challenge for
Wichita<00:00:13.860> State<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.370> final<00:00:14.670> score<00:00:14.759> probably

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
Wichita State the final score probably

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.849 
Wichita State the final score probably
not<00:00:15.299> indicative<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:16.080> much<00:00:16.230> control<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
not indicative of how much control the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.529 
not indicative of how much control the
chakras<00:00:17.250> were<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.850> think<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.330> got<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
chakras were in but I think it's got to

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.060 
chakras were in but I think it's got to
be<00:00:18.630> good<00:00:18.750> for<00:00:18.930> them<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> play<00:00:19.260> teams<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.859> this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
be good for them to play teams like this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.470 
be good for them to play teams like this
they<00:00:20.220> were<00:00:20.279> athletic<00:00:20.580> they<00:00:20.880> were<00:00:20.939> aggressive

Illinois State I think they had 20 some
and<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.390> killed<00:00:36.690> him<00:00:36.809> tonight<00:00:37.079> but

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
