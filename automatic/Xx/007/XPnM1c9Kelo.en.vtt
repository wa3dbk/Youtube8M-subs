00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 and so they tell how to use 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.880
 dolce gusto capsule coffee machine 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.950
 This is how it looks and the coffee machine 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.710
 capsular therefore it will be necessary for her 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.949
 buy these capsules in boxes 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.380
 16 or eight pieces and worth it 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.990
 a box around 300 rubles 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.660
 accordingly, it turns out about 20 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.710
 rubles for a cup of freshly brewed coffee 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.720
 it's ten times cheaper than starbucks 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 I will immediately say that after buying this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.610
 cars I stopped using the kettle 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 here stands because the coffee machine 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.309
 boils water in just 40 seconds and after 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.649
 There were a lot of past videos 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.510
 questions where you need to pour water 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.210
 and whether it is necessary to let the water here 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.750
 poured here for 10 tank in it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.699
 some water 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.390
 he comes off like this and this 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.840
 little 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 the documentation says that here is 0 8 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.600
 liter but in my opinion in fact here is much 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.200
 less because I only have enough for 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.299
 two cups of 200 milliliters like this 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.490
 poured from the filter from the crane from 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:19.490
 pleasing the water above and so here we are 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 sisters 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.479
 in the coffee machine stand changing the level 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.820
 first we have water here 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.520
 which is shed by and even where the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.070
 it can be set to the lower level 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.079
 on the middle or the topmost one is in 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.020
 whichever cup we will 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.659
 it is very convenient to use because 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.250
 for each drink its own cup but in general 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.210
 who are not picky can drink from 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.079
 absolutely ordinary capsules here there 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.439
 such a mechanism 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.750
 opens the lock and here we have this tray 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.149
 for capsules last time a very 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.810
 many questions and will be what it is 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.299
 capsules and what's inside them here 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.470
 specially capsule used 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.410
 open it and there inside us for 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.530
 filter are ground and soluble 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.260
 Arabica coffee exactly in those proportions 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.660
 which are needed for 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.239
 latte macchiato that is there is some 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.569

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.450
 on the boxes immediately show up to level 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.319
 caffeine so to speak coffee in coffee water 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.780
 lunga 66 grain this know how in 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.430
 cigarette numbers show strength 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.519
 there is also a coffee fortress here too 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.760
 there will be caffeine here and here actually when 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:47.850
 such here now open capsules 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:51.069
 box them there 16 pieces take one 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.560
 first you need to turn on the machine before 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.709
 how to enable here we have 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.069
 lever up here he switches the water 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.569
 in cold or hot mode ie this 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.730
 the machine can use the principle as 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.380
 cooler like this to turn here or 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.739
 cold water turned right here 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.319
 there is boiling water now we turn on top 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.420
 the light comes on it flashes red 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.260
 light bulb as soon as it turns green 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.639
 the coffee machine can start right away 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.650
 use and it only needs 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.159
 40 seconds 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.720
 so we still set the cup here it is 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:33.129
 little black capsule and cooks 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.090

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.220
 time we have a car continues 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.769
 warm up here's a green light bulb 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:49.220

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:53.270

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:57.440
