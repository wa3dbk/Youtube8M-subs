video<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.750> exhibition<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.840> don't<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.170> how

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
video in exhibition I don't know how

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.770 
video in exhibition I don't know how
long<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.369> been<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.880> thing<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
long this is you know been a thing but I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.990 
long this is you know been a thing but I
like<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:25.700> practice<00:01:26.700> mode<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
like it a lot because practice mode is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
like it a lot because practice mode is
sometimes<00:01:27.720> different<00:01:28.200> than<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.560> actual<00:01:28.799> game

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
sometimes different than an actual game

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.609 
sometimes different than an actual game
environment<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:30.930> why<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:31.380> it's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
environment so that's why I think it's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.469 
environment so that's why I think it's
best<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.490> exhibition<00:01:33.180> notes<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
best to do it in exhibition notes of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
to make a my first read because usually

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
to make a my first read because usually
no<00:01:49.890> matter<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.460> will<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.030> open<00:01:51.299> because

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
no matter what a will get open because

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.710 
no matter what a will get open because
you<00:01:51.750> can't<00:01:52.020> press<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.799> receiver<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.000> most

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you can't press the a receiver and most

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.940 
you can't press the a receiver and most
of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.869> time<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.320> linebacker<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> so

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
of the time it's a linebacker on a so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
of the time it's a linebacker on a so
and<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.159> know<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.579> CJ<00:01:59.939> Moseley<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and you know that's CJ Moseley so it's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.959 
and you know that's CJ Moseley so it's
not<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> sound<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.140> scrub<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:02.009> look<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
not the sound of scrub like look it's

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.209 
not the sound of scrub like look it's
what<00:02:03.119> happens<00:02:03.390> every<00:02:03.479> time<00:02:03.920> usually<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
what happens every time usually get to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.160 
what happens every time usually get to
insane<00:02:05.520> separation<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.329> that's<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.899> first

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
insane separation so that's my first

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.210 
insane separation so that's my first
read<00:02:07.439> every<00:02:07.979> time<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.280> man

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
read every time you man

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.100 
read every time you man
the<00:02:09.790> second<00:02:10.150> read<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.480> like<00:02:10.600> I<00:02:10.810> guess<00:02:10.960> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
the second read and like I guess the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.450 
the second read and like I guess the
last<00:02:11.320> read<00:02:11.560> unless<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:11.950> do<00:02:12.070> something<00:02:12.340> crazy

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
last read unless you do something crazy

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.880 
last read unless you do something crazy
with<00:02:12.730> X<00:02:13.090> or<00:02:13.270> Y<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:15.090> RB<00:02:16.090> RB<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:17.110> my<00:02:17.230> next<00:02:17.470> read

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
with X or Y is RB RB is my next read

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.700 
with X or Y is RB RB is my next read
because<00:02:18.840> when<00:02:19.840> he<00:02:19.930> cuts<00:02:20.170> upfield

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
because when he cuts upfield

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.020 
because when he cuts upfield
that's<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.190> weird<00:02:21.340> play<00:02:21.550> right<00:02:21.730> there<00:02:21.880> because

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
that's a weird play right there because

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.550 
that's a weird play right there because
the<00:02:22.390> safety<00:02:22.570> usually<00:02:22.930> never<00:02:23.080> plays<00:02:23.350> like<00:02:23.530> that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the safety usually never plays like that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.050 
the safety usually never plays like that
but<00:02:25.050> when<00:02:26.050> he<00:02:26.170> cuts<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.560> field<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.820> causes

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
but when he cuts up field that causes

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.860 
but when he cuts up field that causes
the<00:02:28.720> man<00:02:28.960> covering<00:02:29.410> RB<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.860> do<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.690> he<00:02:31.690> gets

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
the man covering RB to do like a he gets

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.670 
the man covering RB to do like a he gets
kind<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.170> stuck

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
kind of stuck

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.490 
kind of stuck
I<00:02:32.710> guess<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:33.490> due<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:33.940> computer<00:02:34.500> but

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
I guess it's due to the computer but

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.810 
I guess it's due to the computer but
almost<00:02:35.770> every<00:02:36.070> time<00:02:36.220> he<00:02:36.310> gets<00:02:36.370> man

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
almost every time he gets man

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.780 
almost every time he gets man
I<00:02:36.850> think<00:02:37.530> 99%<00:02:38.530> in<00:02:38.620> time<00:02:38.740> units<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.980> man<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.700> gets

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
I think 99% in time units a man it gets

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.030 
I think 99% in time units a man it gets
wide<00:02:40.090> open<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.660> like<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.960> switch<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.800> user

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
wide open and I like to switch on a user

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.400 
wide open and I like to switch on a user
catch<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.550> with<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.910> Kelly<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.660> guess<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.350> this

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
catch on with a Kelly I guess in this

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.810 
catch on with a Kelly I guess in this
case<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:47.950> makes<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.670> much<00:02:48.730> more

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
case and it just makes it so much more

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.700 
case and it just makes it so much more
effective<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.810> that's<00:02:50.020> basically<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> two

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
effective and that's basically the two

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.330 
effective and that's basically the two
reads<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.100> like<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.430> do<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:53.440> reason<00:02:53.680> we<00:02:53.770> put<00:02:54.070> X

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
reads I like to do the reason we put X

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.030 
reads I like to do the reason we put X
on<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.610> drag<00:02:55.180> instead<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.140> us<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> slant<00:02:56.890> I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
on a drag instead of us like a slant I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.290 
on a drag instead of us like a slant I
mean<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.250> could<00:02:57.400> put<00:02:57.520> them<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> slant<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.240> I

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
mean you could put them on a slant but I

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.360 
mean you could put them on a slant but I
like<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.600> put<00:02:58.780> them<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.990> drag<00:02:59.350> just<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
like to put them on a drag just so it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.870 
like to put them on a drag just so it
doesn't<00:03:00.580> get<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.180> way<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:02.670> there's<00:03:03.670> not

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
doesn't get in the way of a there's not

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.490 
doesn't get in the way of a there's not
much<00:03:04.120> else<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.720> do<00:03:04.840> with<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.080> play<00:03:05.260> I

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
much else you can do with this play I

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.920 
much else you can do with this play I
like<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.010> sometimes<00:03:06.220> put<00:03:06.490> Y<00:03:06.910> on<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.270> streak<00:03:07.720> or<00:03:07.900> a

I should have up I got sacked of course
again<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.169> ridiculous

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
again this is ridiculous

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.090 
again this is ridiculous
but<00:04:44.260> RB<00:04:44.410> gets<00:04:44.800> wide<00:04:45.280> open<00:04:46.710> against<00:04:47.710> zone<00:04:47.919> I

but RB gets wide open against zone I

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.400 
but RB gets wide open against zone I
think<00:04:48.340> I'm<00:04:48.430> gonna<00:04:48.580> write<00:04:48.760> down<00:04:48.910> this<00:04:49.000> play<00:04:49.410> I'm

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
think I'm gonna write down this play I'm

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.980 
think I'm gonna write down this play I'm
not<00:04:50.500> gonna<00:04:50.740> cut<00:04:51.070> this<00:04:51.430> video<00:04:51.700> because<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.540> gets

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
not gonna cut this video because I gets

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.960 
not gonna cut this video because I gets
a<00:04:53.169> couple<00:04:53.470> times<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:54.370> play<00:04:54.520> still<00:04:54.760> works

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
a couple times the play still works

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.950 
a couple times the play still works
regardless<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:57.040> fix<00:04:57.880> for<00:04:58.000> science<00:04:58.330> are<00:04:58.720> be

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
regardless so a fix for science are be

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.370 
regardless so a fix for science are be
rather<00:04:59.110> and<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.800> like<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.250> always<00:05:00.540> switch<00:05:01.540> on<00:05:01.840> to

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
rather and I like to always switch on to

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.220 
rather and I like to always switch on to
a<00:05:02.410> an<00:05:03.040> eye<00:05:03.190> on<00:05:03.550> 2<00:05:03.820> RB<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.450> user<00:05:04.810> catch<00:05:05.020> that

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
a an eye on 2 RB and user catch that

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.750 
a an eye on 2 RB and user catch that
because<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.010> makes<00:05:06.160> it<00:05:06.220> much<00:05:06.370> more<00:05:06.550> effective

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
because it makes it much more effective

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.070 
because it makes it much more effective
and<00:05:07.120> it's<00:05:07.240> usually<00:05:07.360> much<00:05:08.110> more<00:05:08.290> safer<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:10.080> think

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
and it's usually much more safer I think

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.070 
and it's usually much more safer I think
I'll<00:05:11.140> run<00:05:11.290> one<00:05:11.470> more<00:05:11.620> time

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
I'll run one more time

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.890 
I'll run one more time
just<00:05:13.889> make<00:05:14.099> the<00:05:14.220> same<00:05:14.370> rate<00:05:14.580> X<00:05:14.909> if<00:05:15.240> X<00:05:15.389> not<00:05:15.629> open

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
just make the same rate X if X not open

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.960 
just make the same rate X if X not open
then<00:05:16.080> hit<00:05:16.199> B<00:05:16.409> if<00:05:16.620> B<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.949> open<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.340> usually<00:05:17.639> RB

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
then hit B if B the open and usually RB

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.089 
then hit B if B the open and usually RB
will<00:05:18.120> be<00:05:18.270> Y<00:05:18.509> that's<00:05:18.810> okay<00:05:19.080> and<00:05:19.620> this<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.919> cover

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
will be Y that's okay and this is cover

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.520 
will be Y that's okay and this is cover
2<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:20.580> see<00:05:20.699> how<00:05:20.819> wide<00:05:21.060> open<00:05:21.090> D<00:05:21.569> was<00:05:21.780> like

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
2 and you see how wide open D was like

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.800 
2 and you see how wide open D was like
cover<00:05:22.830> -<00:05:23.069> for<00:05:23.250> some<00:05:23.370> reason<00:05:23.400> B<00:05:23.909> gets<00:05:24.120> naked<00:05:24.539> I

think when it's not in the red zone the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.959 
think when it's not in the red zone the
