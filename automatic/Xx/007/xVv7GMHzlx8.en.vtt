we've<00:00:03.090> been<00:00:03.270> posting<00:00:03.689> these<00:00:03.840> videos<00:00:04.500> up<00:00:04.650> on

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
we've been posting these videos up on

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.740 
we've been posting these videos up on
YouTube<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:05.339> week<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.910> have<00:00:06.089> noticed<00:00:06.509> that

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
YouTube this week and have noticed that

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.900 
YouTube this week and have noticed that
they're<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> bit<00:00:07.589> shaky<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.280> we<00:00:08.580> move<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
they're a bit shaky and we move the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.280 
they're a bit shaky and we move the
camera<00:00:09.030> around<00:00:09.269> far<00:00:09.599> too<00:00:09.780> quickly<00:00:10.019> so

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
camera around far too quickly so

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.690 
camera around far too quickly so
hopefully<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.040> been<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> bit<00:00:11.370> bit<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
hopefully have been a bit bit of a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.480 
hopefully have been a bit bit of a
smoother<00:00:12.059> ride<00:00:12.210> from<00:00:12.750> here<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.110> out<00:00:13.290> okay<00:00:13.530> so

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
smoother ride from here on out okay so

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.330 
smoother ride from here on out okay so
here<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.299> clearly<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.529> two<00:00:16.800> walls

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
here you can clearly see the two walls

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.010 
here you can clearly see the two walls
the<00:00:17.670> inner<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.000> outer<00:00:18.119> wall<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> left

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the inner and outer wall to the left

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.330 
the inner and outer wall to the left
here<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:21.800> behave<00:00:22.800> completely

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
here that behave completely

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.679 
here that behave completely
independently<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> each<00:00:23.939> other<00:00:24.119> ones<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
independently of each other ones on the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.750 
independently of each other ones on the
floated<00:00:25.050> floor<00:00:25.289> one<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.830> connected<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
floated floor one is connected to the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.630 
floated floor one is connected to the
floor<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.990> building<00:00:28.470> itself<00:00:28.800> then

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
floor of the building itself then

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.009 
floor of the building itself then
there's<00:00:29.760> some<00:00:29.880> framework<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
there's some framework going in for the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.060 
there's some framework going in for the
ceilings<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:31.679> entirely<00:00:32.070> sure<00:00:33.890> how<00:00:34.890> its

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
ceilings I'm not entirely sure how its

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
ceilings I'm not entirely sure how its
clad<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> presume<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.450> more

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
clad but I presume it's going to be more

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.080 
clad but I presume it's going to be more
rock<00:00:36.809> wall<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.280> plaster<00:00:38.280> board<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.910> see

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
rock wall and plaster board you can see

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.020 
rock wall and plaster board you can see
all<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> electrics<00:00:39.840> beautifully<00:00:40.489> done<00:00:41.489> here

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
all the electrics beautifully done here

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
all the electrics beautifully done here
going<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.739> kind<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.370> in

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
going in and they kind of have to go in

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
going in and they kind of have to go in
before<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.899> ceiling<00:00:46.260> goes<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:48.649> there<00:00:49.649> we

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
before the the ceiling goes up there we

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.439 
before the the ceiling goes up there we
go

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
go

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
go
and<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.559> attached<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.070> kind<00:00:53.190> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and so that's attached to a kind of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.970 
and so that's attached to a kind of
bulkhead<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.989> then<00:00:54.989> joists<00:00:55.469> hold<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> in

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
bulkhead and then joists hold it in

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.040 
bulkhead and then joists hold it in
place<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.489> well<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> ceiling

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
place as well that got to the ceiling

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.990 
place as well that got to the ceiling
another<00:01:01.050> gripping<00:01:01.739> view<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:02.399> machine<00:01:02.789> room

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
another gripping view of my machine room

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
another gripping view of my machine room
but<00:01:03.809> again<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
but again you can really see the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.580 
but again you can really see the
cavities<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.760> distance<00:01:06.240> between<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.380> wall

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
cavities the distance between the wall

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
cavities the distance between the wall
of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> studio<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> wall<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
of the studio and the wall of the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.810 
of the studio and the wall of the
building<00:01:09.210> itself<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> protect<00:01:10.920> stuff

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
building itself that's to protect stuff

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.240 
building itself that's to protect stuff
coming<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.380> thought

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
coming in and going out I thought

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
coming in and going out I thought
another<00:01:14.520> thing<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.630> interesting<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.080> look

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
another thing to be interesting to look

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.990 
another thing to be interesting to look
at<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.560> stage<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> look<00:01:17.850> at

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
at at this stage is if we have a look at

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
at at this stage is if we have a look at
these<00:01:18.150> walls<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.259> whilst<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:19.650> look

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
these walls and whilst they look

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820 
these walls and whilst they look
parallel<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:21.540> angles<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.680> little

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
parallel the angles are just that little

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.950 
parallel the angles are just that little
bit<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:23.100> obtuse<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> they<00:01:24.810> don't

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
bit more obtuse so that they don't

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.870 
bit more obtuse so that they don't
actually<00:01:25.259> face<00:01:25.680> each<00:01:25.860> other<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.759> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
actually face each other see if that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.210 
actually face each other see if that
isn't<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.659> corner<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.200> isn't<00:01:28.530> quite<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
isn't this corner here isn't quite a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.280 
isn't this corner here isn't quite a
right<00:01:29.520> angle

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.890 

and<00:01:38.790> you'll<00:01:39.790> see<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.120> two<00:01:40.390> layers<00:01:40.690> of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
and you'll see this two layers of

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.150 
and you'll see this two layers of
plaster<00:01:41.200> board<00:01:41.350> up<00:01:41.440> now<00:01:41.620> I<00:01:41.920> think<00:01:41.980> that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
plaster board up now I think that

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.950 
plaster board up now I think that
there's<00:01:42.430> only<00:01:42.580> two<00:01:42.820> for<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.180> fat<00:01:43.390> rule<00:01:43.630> there

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
there's only two for that fat rule there

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.870 
there's only two for that fat rule there
and<00:01:45.330> preparations<00:01:46.330> for<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.600> framework<00:01:47.880> up

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
and preparations for the framework up

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.730 
and preparations for the framework up
there<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:51.040> again<00:01:52.170> we've<00:01:53.170> got<00:01:53.350> these<00:01:53.470> wall

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
there and again we've got these wall

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.410 
there and again we've got these wall
away<00:01:54.130> we've<00:01:55.030> got<00:01:55.180> these<00:01:56.490> walls<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:57.700> simply

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
away we've got these walls that simply

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.580 
away we've got these walls that simply
aren't<00:01:58.570> parallel<00:01:58.870> with<00:01:59.080> each<00:01:59.200> other

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
aren't parallel with each other

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.350 
aren't parallel with each other

who<00:02:09.220> isn't<00:02:09.460> a<00:02:09.520> geek<00:02:09.700> he's<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> very<00:02:10.770> brilliant

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.190 
who isn't a geek he's a very brilliant
acoustician<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> word

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
acoustician that is a word

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.560 
acoustician that is a word
we'll<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.130> see<00:02:15.370> here<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.150> three<00:02:16.360> layers

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
we'll just see here the three layers

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.710 
we'll just see here the three layers
across<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.110> board<00:02:17.320> on<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.740> side<00:02:18.370> there<00:02:18.720> okay

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
across the board on that side there okay

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.000 
across the board on that side there okay
so<00:02:19.780> let's<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.320> look<00:02:20.440> where<00:02:20.650> all<00:02:20.680> these

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
so let's have a look where all these

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.190 
so let's have a look where all these
cables<00:02:21.670> are<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.270> ending<00:02:22.930> up<00:02:23.020> where

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
cables are kind of ending up where

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.199 
cables are kind of ending up where
they're<00:02:23.350> terminating<00:02:24.330> we<00:02:25.330> go<00:02:25.480> back<00:02:25.660> outside

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
they're terminating we go back outside

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.810 
they're terminating we go back outside
it's<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.390> above<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.750> main<00:02:28.900> door<00:02:29.790> quite<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
it's just above the main door quite a

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.930 
it's just above the main door quite a
lot<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.090> spag<00:02:31.360> there<00:02:31.630> already<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.940> here's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
lot of spag there already and here's

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.030 
lot of spag there already and here's
where<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.660> electric<00:02:35.020> cupboard<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.590> going<00:02:35.890> to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
where the electric cupboard is going to

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.030 
where the electric cupboard is going to
be<00:02:36.190> situated
