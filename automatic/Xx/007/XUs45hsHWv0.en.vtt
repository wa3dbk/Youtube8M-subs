00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.530
 in the halloween time we can find 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.510
 a special area where with spells 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.530
 a villain will appear and precisely from 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.099
 collins I will not explain exactly 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.730
 how this is done this is the pot of the 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.200
 magic or natixis decoder and if it still exists 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.110
 internally and the interesting thing is that 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.960
 here you visitors enter go to 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.300
 see her here today and if you realize good 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.370
 it seems like it 's full of magic and if 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.100
 do you want I can teach you how 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.929
 conjure a disney villain right now 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.350
 this moment but nothing happens to me 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:44.600
 who knows I do not know that thing but 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.550
 risk is not good yes yes yes yes yes the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.570
 thing is that I have to teach you the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.789
 magic word so ready and look what 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.820
 What are you going to do first is take a 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.159
 wand like this is going to be the wand that 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.710
 more use perfect then now what 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.079
 let's say is if you want to follow is 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.089
 because they are the magic words that 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.690
 you want and who yes yes and in Spanish 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.310
 is two pilots small pics ogx 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.540
 pÃ©rez and after and after you go 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.220
 do 12 with your hands you are going to plan and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.479
 then you will move the wand over the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.340
 pot and there it depends good I do not know we're going to 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.250
 doing so I'm going to pass the microphone to you this 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.060
 and see if I learned the whole ritual 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.860
 If you have small eyes pickets 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.860
 exactly twice 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 Advance 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.560
 so I think that yes that is already 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 working 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.640
 the evil queen was quite lucky 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.640
 if he has an angry face 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.030
 and if wright a shot 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.030
 show every day 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.009
 i 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.630
 I'm not going to say it's the favorite I do not 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.330
 I will argue with her for nothing that 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.760
 thing and the most surprising thing is that never 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.680
 you know who's going out but well 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.019
 I'm glad he came out and although he's a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.000
 little bit angry but if you want us 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.000
 we can dismiss from before clear 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.230
 randy winn 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.349
 we have to come to the best and will have 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.349
 an apple for all of you be by 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.349
 yonhap 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.720
 the villains are in all the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.209
 park and if you're not careful they could 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.489
 catch you with a spell as you can see 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.690
 this journey has also made me 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.430
 in a pumpkin I am part of the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.470
 disney decorations at least this 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.019
 spell alone will last around 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.610
 about 15 minutes the villains tell me 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.239
 they are definitely doing the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.410
 yours here in disneyland so good 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.599
 we wait to see this end 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.489
 spell and if I do not have to be part of 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.450
 the decorations permanently or at 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.450
 less during halloween 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.290
 with the images of Antonio Uribe from 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.560
 ana in california for a california
