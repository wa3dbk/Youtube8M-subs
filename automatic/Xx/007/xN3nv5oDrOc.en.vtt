 to the page 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.459
 technology also deals with 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.269
 who practice extreme sports like this 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.269
 this cell came up 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.190
 how many times has it happened to you that in a 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.830

 puddle 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.840
 usually this means losing by 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.360
 complete our smartphone at least 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.150
 until now 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.650
 nec developed the 1010 phone a 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 smartphone that as a main 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.170
 Feature is totally proof of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.170
 Water 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.630
 Its design consists mainly of 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.880
 a hybrid frame of stainless steel and

 plastic packaging structure 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.530
 rubber was thought not to allow 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.260
 between a single drop of water at 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.600
 electrical components in such a way that 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.940
 at a depth of one meter under water 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.000
 can continue to receive calls or 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 running programs for up to half an hour 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 what makes it stand out mainly 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.830
 is your water resistance has a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.910
 Water resistance 30 minutes 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.040
 Can submerge one meter deep 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.479
 for 30 minutes this is a standard 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.729
 international than very few 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.310
 smartphones hold it in fact could 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.780
 tell them that it is of the three that what 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.020
 the endurance is not the fastest 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.570
 it also has a core processor 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.119
 to a giga hertz 512 megabytes of memory 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 ram and well he also has 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.830
 Dust resistance another of its

 Features are 4 screen 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.330

 possibility to be expanded up to 32 GB 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.200
