then<00:03:45.879> you're<00:03:46.030> going<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.209> tie<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:47.129> on<00:03:48.129> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
then you're going to tie it on the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:56.369 
then you're going to tie it on the
outside<00:03:48.639> of<00:03:48.939> your<00:03:48.970> egg<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.720> craft<00:03:53.019> egg<00:03:55.379> once

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
outside of your egg so craft egg once

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:57.899 
outside of your egg so craft egg once
our<00:03:56.530> eggs<00:03:56.709> have<00:03:56.919> been<00:03:57.069> wrapped<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.579> silk

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
our eggs have been wrapped in the silk

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.330 
our eggs have been wrapped in the silk
and<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.569> white<00:03:58.780> material<00:03:59.349> we're<00:03:59.980> gonna<00:04:00.069> put

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
and the white material we're gonna put

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.899 
and the white material we're gonna put
them<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.879> stove<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.889> boil<00:04:02.889> them<00:04:03.189> we're

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
them on the stove and boil them we're

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.069 
them on the stove and boil them we're
going<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.090> boil<00:04:04.269> them<00:04:04.419> in<00:04:04.599> a<00:04:04.659> pot<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:04.900> water

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
going to boil them in a pot of water

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.179 
going to boil them in a pot of water
with<00:04:05.560> one<00:04:06.129> quarter<00:04:06.489> cup<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.819> vinegar<00:04:07.209> added

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
with one quarter cup of vinegar added

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:18.740 
with one quarter cup of vinegar added
for<00:04:09.189> 20<00:04:09.489> minutes

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.440 

although<00:04:19.650> these<00:04:19.890> eggs<00:04:20.220> will<00:04:20.489> be<00:04:20.519> boiled<00:04:21.030> they

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
although these eggs will be boiled they

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:31.800 
although these eggs will be boiled they
should<00:04:21.690> not<00:04:21.900> be<00:04:22.049> eaten

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.860 

the<00:04:32.650> next<00:04:33.010> step<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.820> let<00:04:34.000> them<00:04:34.150> dry<00:04:34.510> and

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
the next step is to let them dry and

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.750 
the next step is to let them dry and
cool<00:04:35.440> in<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:36.639> strainer<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.889> when<00:04:39.340> they<00:04:39.460> are<00:04:39.550> all

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
cool in a strainer and when they are all

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.210 
cool in a strainer and when they are all
dry<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.450> cooled<00:04:40.810> off<00:04:40.990> then<00:04:41.590> we<00:04:41.740> can<00:04:41.889> unwrap

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
dry and cooled off then we can unwrap

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.930 
dry and cooled off then we can unwrap
them<00:04:42.960> our<00:04:43.960> eggs<00:04:44.380> are<00:04:44.650> not<00:04:44.830> completely<00:04:45.220> dry<00:04:45.580> but

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
them our eggs are not completely dry but

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.400 
them our eggs are not completely dry but
they<00:04:46.090> are<00:04:46.240> cool<00:04:46.540> so<00:04:46.810> we're<00:04:46.960> going<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.139> go<00:04:47.320> ahead

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
they are cool so we're going to go ahead

00:04:47.410 --> 00:05:10.549 
they are cool so we're going to go ahead
and<00:04:47.800> start<00:04:48.190> taking<00:04:48.370> them<00:04:48.669> apart

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:10.559 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:16.999 

hmm<00:05:13.849> this<00:05:14.849> one<00:05:15.179> didn't<00:05:15.719> work<00:05:15.959> so<00:05:16.019> well<00:05:16.649> a

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
hmm this one didn't work so well a

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:27.529 
hmm this one didn't work so well a
little<00:05:17.309> bit<00:05:17.549> of<00:05:17.609> design<00:05:25.849> play<00:05:26.849> this<00:05:27.089> one<00:05:27.329> is

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
little bit of design play this one is

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:36.660 
little bit of design play this one is
better

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.120 

I<00:05:36.760> definitely<00:05:37.570> see<00:05:38.140> some<00:05:38.410> photo<00:05:38.650> it's<00:05:38.950> real

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
I definitely see some photo it's real

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.280 
I definitely see some photo it's real
pretty<00:05:39.250> right<00:05:39.580> here

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
I'm definitely sent to see some of the

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.670 
I'm definitely sent to see some of the
flowers<00:05:45.570> all<00:05:46.570> right<00:05:46.780> let's<00:05:47.020> check<00:05:47.140> out<00:05:47.470> this

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
flowers all right let's check out this

00:05:47.680 --> 00:06:00.000 
flowers all right let's check out this
one<00:05:53.790> I<00:05:54.900> really<00:05:55.900> like<00:05:56.110> this<00:05:56.380> one<00:05:58.800> now<00:05:59.800> these

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
one I really like this one now these

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.850 
one I really like this one now these
little<00:06:00.250> pieces<00:06:00.550> of<00:06:00.790> material<00:06:01.450> can<00:06:02.140> be<00:06:02.200> reused

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
little pieces of material can be reused

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.280 
little pieces of material can be reused
but<00:06:03.190> each<00:06:03.400> time<00:06:03.730> you<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.330> use<00:06:04.600> them<00:06:04.810> again<00:06:05.110> to

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
but each time you you use them again to

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.760 
but each time you you use them again to
do<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.530> same<00:06:05.740> project<00:06:06.250> they<00:06:07.000> will<00:06:07.560> fade<00:06:08.560> in

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
do the same project they will fade in

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.400 
do the same project they will fade in
color<00:06:09.040> and<00:06:09.310> be<00:06:09.430> less<00:06:09.580> and<00:06:09.760> less<00:06:09.880> strong<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:10.570> as

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
color and be less and less strong and as

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.740 
color and be less and less strong and as
you<00:06:12.220> see<00:06:12.490> some<00:06:12.820> of<00:06:12.940> them<00:06:13.060> weren't<00:06:13.210> very<00:06:13.390> strong

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
you see some of them weren't very strong

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:30.940 
you see some of them weren't very strong
to<00:06:13.990> begin<00:06:14.140> with

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.150 

let's<00:06:31.640> see<00:06:31.940> what<00:06:32.120> the<00:06:32.270> mystery<00:06:32.960> egg<00:06:33.380> is<00:06:33.920> gonna

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
let's see what the mystery egg is gonna

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:51.640 
let's see what the mystery egg is gonna
be<00:06:49.000> part<00:06:50.000> of<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.150> flower<00:06:50.360> to<00:06:50.810> the<00:06:51.350> middle<00:06:51.590> of

and<00:07:05.750> these<00:07:06.590> are<00:07:07.099> the<00:07:07.280> completed<00:07:07.729> eggs<00:07:08.120> we<00:07:08.509> made

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009 
and these are the completed eggs we made

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.469 
and these are the completed eggs we made
I'm<00:07:10.009> gonna<00:07:10.190> try<00:07:10.400> this<00:07:10.460> again<00:07:10.849> another<00:07:11.090> time

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
I'm gonna try this again another time

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.629 
I'm gonna try this again another time
with<00:07:12.199> some<00:07:12.409> other<00:07:12.560> material<00:07:13.099> and<00:07:13.220> see<00:07:13.400> how<00:07:13.550> it

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 
with some other material and see how it

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:17.080 
with some other material and see how it
comes<00:07:13.849> out<00:07:14.259> my<00:07:15.259> first<00:07:16.159> impression<00:07:16.729> is<00:07:16.849> it

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
comes out my first impression is it

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.149 
comes out my first impression is it
really<00:07:17.360> was<00:07:17.539> not<00:07:17.720> that<00:07:17.780> difficult<00:07:18.199> and<00:07:19.039> they

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:19.159 
really was not that difficult and they

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:22.749 
really was not that difficult and they
are<00:07:19.280> kind<00:07:19.490> of<00:07:19.520> cute<00:07:21.069> the<00:07:22.069> link<00:07:22.340> to<00:07:22.610> the<00:07:22.729> website
