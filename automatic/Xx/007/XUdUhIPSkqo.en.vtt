 Hello and welcome to the FDD topic on Wednesday 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:16.379
 They can still remember the 80s as a video format dispute 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.159
 the one romped for power made it strong the others say in the 2000 video 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.329
 the system of the future 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.769
 today there are again two camps namely in the tug of war around the high also solve the 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.759
 Successor of the DVD on the one hand already in the PlayStation 3 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.160
 used system Blum Re from Sony on the other sliding and Microsoft 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.150
 with her system hd-dvd 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.110
 between themselves the companies could not despite numerous discussions 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.930
 some 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.800
 Devices that play both are not synonymous because of the high prices 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.920
 ideal solution 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 and consumers are insecure and with buying back 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.060
 who wants to experience the video 2000 disgrace from the 80s again 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.840
 I know what I'm talking about 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.690
 and also suppliers Mechanical engineers and disco hits rarely suffered 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.640
 the uncertain prospects 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240
 So a decision must come from 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.110
 and that seems to have fallen now per Blue Eye 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.660
 Warner Bros has already announced that its videos will also be available in the future. 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.940
 To market it please also one of the existing hd-dvd supporters 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.950
 Leave the film studio Paul Maar and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 According to ft-information, there is an exit clause in the contract 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.410
 attacks 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.240
 Menden Bonner supports blue-ray 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.910
 What has happened now is that with only 2 left him only to union 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.260
 about Soul behind Toshiba's system 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.540
 Analysts are already talking about the death blow, especially Lou Brien between 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.730
 Walt Disney creatively wants VOX scored metro-goldwyn-mayer 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.180
 is supported 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.150
 And that accounts for about 75 percent of hollywood productions 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.750
 and over one thing all parties involved will decide in the clear 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.470
 ultimately, who can deliver the most content 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 and that is now foreseeable BlueGen 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:15.459
 that's it for today with the theme we'll see each other again tomorrow and 12 until then 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.519
 have a nice day
