 very good you follow very good guys I am 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.660
 grandson and we are in great news of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.120
 co2 crops I already mentioned it in a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 last news I 'm really fed up 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.560
 in which the games constitute or not the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.900
 politicians did not buy it for me 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.119
 partridge for playstation3 me for risks 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.330
 of 60 because I do not have the annexation yet 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.800
 and for me it's the time I feel javier not what 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.210
 I have not bought it for the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.820
 versions of the consoles that I have 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.510
 because I got totally bored of calling 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.900
 of duty and this makes me still bored 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.729
 more and is that an image has been leaked 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.820
 for the return of the multiplayer map of 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:48.720
 call of duty cost in the next tlc of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.369
 game you already know that domm is one of the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.010
 most important modern warfare dads 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:55.110
 3 that could return to call of duty 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.909
 host due to a filtered image in the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 network that you can see it in the source of the 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.620
 apparently apparently news 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.350
 after the release of the first dlc 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.400
 onslaught the company infinity ward will 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.070
 is already working in the next 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.590
 content that would incorporate four new 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.220
 maps that according to these would be battery 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.290
 rumble retriever and dom that according to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.299
 reflects in an image shared by the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.950
 user in the network forum and in the forum 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.049
 redit then confirms these 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 beginnings infinity ward has not 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.149
 pronounced about it or communicated 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.640
 nothing officially this information is 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.390
 as always a rumor can be made 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 true with time surely yes but 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.840
 these are speculations nothing else are 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 filtrations that remember the water of you 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.200
 or as always here I am for 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 inform you but confirm it is 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.330
 one more piece of something that pisses me off 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.580
 enough that it does not happen twice that 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.789
 it is very easy to put maps that are already 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.490
 made in previous games and without 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.080
 tip back and that I'm sorry but 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.500
 I do not like it 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.930
 cool that once twice but it's already 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.210
 has become a habit in the saga 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.440
 call of duty and pay for audi you already had 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.270
 it should only come completely 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.110
 Free for all and not for people 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.030
 that to compete in infinitive nothing else is to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.990
 Your opinion commented like and favorites and 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.990
 see you in the next
