00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
Watchers has switched over to simply

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.240 
Watchers has switched over to simply
feeling<00:00:19.900> that<00:00:20.169> switch<00:00:20.500> but<00:00:20.800> it's<00:00:20.920> an<00:00:21.039> option

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
feeling that switch but it's an option

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.790 
feeling that switch but it's an option
what<00:00:22.000> simply<00:00:22.449> feeling<00:00:22.840> is<00:00:23.140> it's<00:00:23.710> just

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
what simply feeling is it's just

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.070 
what simply feeling is it's just
basically<00:00:24.010> instead<00:00:24.670> of<00:00:24.760> counting<00:00:25.119> point<00:00:25.480> they

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
basically instead of counting point they

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.140 
basically instead of counting point they
