00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
step in this tutorial is going to be to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.720 
step in this tutorial is going to be to
add<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.680> white<00:00:16.830> glue<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.250> water<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
add the white glue and water to the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.179 
add the white glue and water to the
metal<00:00:17.940> pan<00:00:18.560> you're<00:00:19.560> going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.859> want<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.130> use

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
metal pan you're going to want to use

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.279 
metal pan you're going to want to use
about<00:00:20.550> three<00:00:20.880> times<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.270> amount<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.600> glue<00:00:21.840> as

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
about three times the amount of glue as

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.290 
about three times the amount of glue as
you're<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.680> use<00:00:22.830> water<00:00:23.300> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you're going to use water the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.519 
you're going to use water the
temperature<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.840> water<00:00:24.869> doesn't<00:00:25.260> really

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
temperature of the water doesn't really

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.950 
temperature of the water doesn't really
matter<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.130> find<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.269> warm<00:00:27.720> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
matter but I find that if it's warm I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.710 
matter but I find that if it's warm I
have<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> much<00:00:28.500> easier<00:00:28.529> time<00:00:28.830> mixing<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.720> as

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
have a much easier time mixing and as

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.979 
have a much easier time mixing and as
you<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.050> see<00:00:31.080> i<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.439> crow<00:00:32.040> pouring<00:00:32.550> skills

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
you can see i have crow pouring skills

out any lumps or bubbles that the glue
may<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.649> made<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> water<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:48.090> smoother

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
may have made in the water the smoother

may have made in the water the smoother
your<00:00:48.660> solution<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> better<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.820> twine

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 

once<00:00:55.170> your<00:00:55.289> solution<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.800> mixed<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.429> really

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
once your solution is mixed you really

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
once your solution is mixed you really
want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> consistency<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
want to get it to the consistency of a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.610 
want to get it to the consistency of a
heavy<00:00:58.890> whipping<00:00:59.309> cream<00:01:00.019> you<00:01:01.019> want<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.589> a

you dip your paintbrush into it you're

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:08.960 
you dip your paintbrush into it you're
going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> want<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.580> stick<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
going to want it to stick to the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.890 
going to want it to stick to the
paintbrush<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> bit

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.900 

for<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> next<00:01:13.740> step<00:01:14.100> you're<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> take

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
for the next step you're going to take

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.180 
for the next step you're going to take
your<00:01:14.970> piece<00:01:15.300> of<00:01:15.450> twine<00:01:15.720> any<00:01:16.050> length<00:01:16.770> will<00:01:17.010> do

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
your piece of twine any length will do

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.650 
your piece of twine any length will do
and<00:01:17.400> you're<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> stick<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.480> the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
and you're going to stick it in the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.390 
and you're going to stick it in the
solution<00:01:19.200> you're<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.980> to<00:01:20.040> want<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.250> let

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
solution you're going to want to let

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.540 
solution you're going to want to let
this<00:01:20.580> soak<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.090> 15<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.600> 25<00:01:22.020> minutes<00:01:22.230> I<00:01:22.620> had<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
this soak for 15 to 25 minutes I had to

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.400 
this soak for 15 to 25 minutes I had to
let<00:01:23.670> mine<00:01:23.880> soak<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> bit<00:01:24.420> longer<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
let mine soak a bit longer because it

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.510 
let mine soak a bit longer because it
was<00:01:25.560> an<00:01:25.680> older<00:01:26.040> twine<00:01:27.590> while<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.950> soaking

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
was an older twine while this is soaking

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
was an older twine while this is soaking
set<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.940> off<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> side<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.260> can<00:01:31.380> blow

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
set it off to the side and we can blow

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560 
set it off to the side and we can blow
up<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.860> balloon<00:01:32.130> I'm<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.970> using<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.360> simple

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
up the balloon I'm just using a simple

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
up the balloon I'm just using a simple
latex<00:01:34.020> balloon<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> dollar<00:01:34.950> store<00:01:35.070> any

latex balloon from the dollar store any
size<00:01:36.480> of<00:01:36.690> shape<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.440> for<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.520> ball<00:01:38.730> I<00:01:38.760> want

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
size of shape will do for my ball I want

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.610 
size of shape will do for my ball I want
to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.240> small<00:01:39.600> ones<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.460> my<00:01:41.460> balloon<00:01:41.760> is<00:01:41.880> small

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.370 

once<00:01:46.340> your<00:01:46.490> twine<00:01:46.790> has<00:01:47.150> had<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.330> chance<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:48.110> soak

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
once your twine has had a chance to soak

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.530 
once your twine has had a chance to soak
you're<00:01:49.370> going<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.670> want<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.940> see<00:01:50.150> if<00:01:50.390> it's

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
you're going to want to see if it's

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.250 
you're going to want to see if it's
absorbed<00:01:50.930> enough<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.470> liquid<00:01:53.080> when<00:01:54.080> you

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
absorbed enough of the liquid when you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.740 
absorbed enough of the liquid when you
