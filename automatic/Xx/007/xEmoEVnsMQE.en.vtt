00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.790
 really, a couple of months ago 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.250
 we made a note with the vices 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.590
 conductivos the famous note of carlitos 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.480
 we had used this honda civic and in that 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.060
 opportunity I asked myself why not do 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.470
 a small test at least of this car 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.079
 that in the segment of sedans 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.079
 medium is one of the ones that I like the most 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.990
 what is the honda civic as I said is a 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.200
 sedan of the middle segment its great rival 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.970
 historic is the toyota corolla there was already 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.370
 started the rivalry in japan but there's 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.600
 many more models in the form of inventions 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.120
 renault fluence 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 about the cross and so on is a car that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.510
 was born in 1972 in Japan and knew for this 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.520
 which is the ninth generation but 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.980
 what we care about is that it is the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.530
 fourth manufactured in Brazil since the year 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.530
 99 so this car comes from Brazil 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.159
 What do we have with us? 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.470
 testing the full version xs which is the 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.049
 more equipped of the two versions that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.850
 they offer and this one has a box 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.259
 fasting manual also automatic but to 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.720
 I like the manual because it has a 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.869
 very good box well related to a 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.549
 very precise selector and six gears is 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.049
 one of the latest improvements that incorporates 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.049
 this honda civic 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.320
 and like all civic because there's no 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.960
 another available engine has a 1.8 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.940
 140 horsepower efficient engine 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.680
 with good response in good low 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.590
 High performance and operation 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 very soft coexists perfectly with this 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.630
 box of 6 marches and achieve good 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.330
 accelerations and also consumptions chords 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.479
 a car that mechanically does everything very 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.479
 all right 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.739
 is what I like least about this civil 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.200
 the capacity of the trunk is the smallest 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.720
 this segment that is maybe a little weird 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.360
 get used to the board divided between 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.000
 the superior digital instrument and the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.620
 analog behind the wheel at the level of 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.690
 design out there I could say that this 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.090
 last generation did not propose a change 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.280
 too obvious from the previous 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.080
 and why not also in terms of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.480
 security that did not incorporate headlights 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.940
 xenon but the most serious thing is that no 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 civilian has stability control 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.209
 this does not have down on what is the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.209
 dynamic security 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.880
 in the items that I liked the most 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.280
 contradictory of this with the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.870
 passive safety security as soon as 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.790
 to the body of the car not only in the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.240
 deformation but also because it has 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.220
 six airbags and isofix hooks in addition to 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.890
 headrests and inertial belts 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.870
 for the five occupants I like 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.370
 also the inner comfort and the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.470
 interior design has a 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.750
 full comfort equipment and in 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.450
 general is a comfortable car is a 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.240
 auto silent and with very good walking 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.200
 because he has a very good walk 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.520
 mainly because it is one of the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.640
 few of this segment that have 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.530
 arms independent rear suspension 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.959
 independents that transmit less 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.660
 vibrations inside and this does it 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.580
 also more efficient in the high 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.230
 speed on the route than other models 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.540
 similar as for example it occurs to me 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.850
 the toyota corolla and finally highlighted 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.160
 the overall quality of the car 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.410
 very reliable and good 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.220
 aftermarket service of the brand honda 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.220
 for all 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.900
 this car just falling below 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.400
 the new barrier or the new floor of the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.380
 automotive tax remained around the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.900
 275 thousand pesos is still a value 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.060
 high but rather lower 150 thousand 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.280
 lower weights than what it cost to make 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.230
 a couple of months for tax purposes 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.850
 It's a car that I always liked and it's 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.430
 last version I like more than 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.140
 previous I would buy it maybe it 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.140
 will incorporate stability control
