hey<00:00:09.750> everybody<00:00:09.900> stand<00:00:10.260> back<00:00:10.349> once<00:00:10.590> again<00:00:10.769> and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
hey everybody stand back once again and

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.890 
hey everybody stand back once again and
yes<00:00:11.490> it's<00:00:11.700> now<00:00:11.820> time<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.450> benchmark

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
yes it's now time to do the benchmark

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.020 
yes it's now time to do the benchmark
tests<00:00:13.290> now<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.860> keep<00:00:14.219> getting<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.610> questions

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
tests now I keep getting that questions

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
tests now I keep getting that questions
task<00:00:15.360> if<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.599> could<00:00:15.719> eat<00:00:15.809> all<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.260> all<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
task if I could eat all of it all the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.070 
task if I could eat all of it all the
phones<00:00:16.859> again<00:00:17.010> those<00:00:17.460> benchmarks<00:00:17.930> so<00:00:18.930> I'm

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
phones again those benchmarks so I'm

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.300 
phones again those benchmarks so I'm
going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.350> all<00:00:19.470> these<00:00:19.560> individually<00:00:20.100> fire

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
going to do all these individually fire

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.920 
going to do all these individually fire
the<00:00:21.000> first<00:00:21.210> we're<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> run<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> this

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the first we're going to run to this

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.380 
the first we're going to run to this
video<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.619> quadrant<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.490> again

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
video is going to be quadrant and again

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.630 
video is going to be quadrant and again
regards<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> benchmarking<00:00:25.980> I'll<00:00:26.130> say<00:00:26.430> I've

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
regards the benchmarking I'll say I've

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.400 
regards the benchmarking I'll say I've
said<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.939> many<00:00:27.029> many<00:00:27.150> times<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:28.230> an

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
said it many many times it's an

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.660 
said it many many times it's an

indication of where device could

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.790 
indication of where device could
potentially<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:31.050> other<00:00:31.230> things<00:00:31.500> going

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
potentially be what other things going

is<00:00:34.170> an<00:00:34.350> everyday<00:00:34.559> usage<00:00:35.130> benchmark<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> good

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
is an everyday usage benchmark to a good

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.119 
is an everyday usage benchmark to a good
idea<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> doll<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.770> given<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
idea but the doll was given to

road<00:00:40.620> we're<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> run<00:00:41.219> first<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.760> all

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
road we're going to run first of all

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.200 
road we're going to run first of all
it's<00:00:42.059> quadrant<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.250> run

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it's quadrant so as you can see here run

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:55.000 
it's quadrant so as you can see here run
the<00:00:45.300> benchmark<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.120> off<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.300> goes

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.080 

right<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.489> here's<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:56.760> fan<00:00:56.970> of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
right so here we are here's the fan of
