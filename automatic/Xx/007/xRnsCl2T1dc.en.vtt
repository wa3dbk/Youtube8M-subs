00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.730
 Attention 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.920
 Hello everyone, Dmitry, and today 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.699
 tell you about the legendary sniper 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.609
 rifle 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.460
 which is also neatly feathered from 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:06.040
 the second part and it is called garden 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.100
 instrument playing the second part of the guide 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.770
 by this gun I didn't do like that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.050
 large levels I did not bring her 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.340
 old morph or warrior 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.800
 but how many times have I already stopped it 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.110
 there is a beautiful crushed points and gun 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.840
 get this here won't make any 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.660
 problems a special effect on the garden 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.540
 tool says pops and thanks 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.660
 this effect rifle shoots five 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.900
 bullets in the horizontal direction when 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.060
 This spending only two patrons also in 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.320
 aiming mode you will shoot 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.500
 the queue 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.290
 and each shot will consist of five 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 bullets 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.150
 this sniper rifle can fall out with 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.480
 any elemental effect 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.780
 as well as without him and in fact 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.990
 besides all of the above and not 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.450
 considering the unique texture of this gun 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.050
 nothing special ordinary weapons 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.780
 the firm was given but if you are the same st 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.540
 tractor you can just look at something 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.090
 how beautifully the bullets fly out of this 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.220
 rifles will effectively use 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.090
 this gun against big opponents 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.700
 size 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.709
 as well as if any weapon 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.770
 burst firing 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.780
 this gun you got the squeak effect then 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.620
 opponents will freeze very 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.400
 quickly and by the way I don't know how it is 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.130
 checked but on wikipedia it is written that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.510
 critical chance increases 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.580
 if the enemy goes sideways and what can 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.500
 move the rifle scope up and down 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.470
 when firing 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.100
 although I do not think this gun hurts 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.850
 special but she is very practical her 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.950
 can be used on a permanent basis 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.980
 we exclude the fact that I personally quickly 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.430
 spent ammunition but gun 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.959
 does good damage on it all if 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.870
