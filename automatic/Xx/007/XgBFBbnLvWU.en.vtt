 standby mode actually to access it 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.250

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.300

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.350

 I leave supported and here we are 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.780
 so alas we have different choices 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.369
 so restart the ps vita system 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.439

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.820
 loot or update their 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.020
 system software so will restart

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.100
 including rebuilding the database 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.200
 it can be useful when you have 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.719
 corrupted data backups or 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.219
