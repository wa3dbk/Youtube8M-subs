00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
what makes a brain healthy and what

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
what makes a brain healthy and what
makes<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.840> brain<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.140> risk<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.469> Alzheimer's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
disease and other disorders as so often

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
disease and other disorders as so often
what<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.649> find<00:00:52.890> correlations<00:00:53.219> with

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
what we do is we find correlations with

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000 
what we do is we find correlations with
genes<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.300> might<00:00:54.539> cause<00:00:54.840> disease<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.829> very

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
genes that might cause disease and very

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.619 
genes that might cause disease and very
often<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.399> other<00:00:56.699> databases<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.300> find<00:00:57.329> out

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
often we use other databases to find out

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.860 
often we use other databases to find out
what<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> genes<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> tree<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.010> causes

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
what the genes do so if a tree in causes

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.000 
what the genes do so if a tree in causes
migration<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> axons<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.739> begin<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
migration of axons you can begin to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.560 
migration of axons you can begin to
build<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.309> story<00:01:02.579> about<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.300> gene

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
build a story about what that gene

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
build a story about what that gene
actually<00:01:03.899> does<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> brain<00:01:04.700> in

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
actually does in the brain in

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
actually does in the brain in
translational<00:01:06.689> experiments<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.409> knockout

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
translational experiments like knockout

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
translational experiments like knockout
mice<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> look<00:01:08.970> at<00:01:09.150> removing<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.229> gene

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
mice you can look at removing the gene

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
mice you can look at removing the gene
and<00:01:10.470> seeing<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> functions<00:01:11.369> lost<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and seeing the functions lost and so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.149 
and seeing the functions lost and so
often<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> imaging<00:01:13.500> establishes<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
often the imaging establishes the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
often the imaging establishes the
correlation<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.939> displays<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> pattern<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
correlation it displays a pattern of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
correlation it displays a pattern of
connections<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> more

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
connections but then you go to more

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.690 
connections but then you go to more
translational<00:01:18.450> experiments<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.490> wet<00:01:20.490> lab

works<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:21.390> delete<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> gene<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.439> see

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
works are really delete the gene and see

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
works are really delete the gene and see
if<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.890> made<00:01:23.189> any<00:01:23.220> difference<00:01:23.490> there<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
if that made any difference there is a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090 
if that made any difference there is a
gene<00:01:24.659> MOS<00:01:24.930> discovered<00:01:25.350> recently<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.710> one

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
gene MOS discovered recently that one

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
gene MOS discovered recently that one
percent<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.640> us<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.840> called<00:01:28.080> trend

percent of us have and it's called trend

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710 
percent of us have and it's called trend
to<00:01:28.590> variant<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.280> gene<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.299> doubles

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
to variant in this gene and it doubles

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.359 
to variant in this gene and it doubles
your<00:01:30.810> risk<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.259> Alzheimer's<00:01:31.740> disease<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
your risk of Alzheimer's disease and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
your risk of Alzheimer's disease and
this<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.759> only<00:01:32.909> discovered<00:01:33.360> very<00:01:33.630> recently

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
this was only discovered very recently

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
this was only discovered very recently
it's<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.290> important<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it's very important so if you think in

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.670 
it's very important so if you think in
the<00:01:36.000> US<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.479> three<00:01:36.840> million<00:01:37.170> people<00:01:37.350> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the US that's three million people that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920 
the US that's three million people that
carry<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.280> dangerous<00:01:38.670> gene<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
carry this very dangerous gene so one of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.850 
carry this very dangerous gene so one of
the<00:01:40.079> things<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.380> were<00:01:40.439> able<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.740> with

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the things we were able to do with

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.499 
the things we were able to do with
images<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.400> figure<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.240> gene

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
images is figure out how this gene

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.090 
images is figure out how this gene
affects<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> brain<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:43.979> actually

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
affects the brain and what actually

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.859 
affects the brain and what actually
happens<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.939> speeds<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> rate<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
happens is it speeds up the rate of

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.139 
happens is it speeds up the rate of
tissue<00:01:46.200> loss<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> brain<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.820> may<00:01:48.000> not

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
tissue loss in the brain so we may not

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.580 
tissue loss in the brain so we may not
notice<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.020> fact<00:01:49.200> while<00:01:49.439> we're

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
notice this and in fact while we're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
notice this and in fact while we're
healthy<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> time<00:01:50.970> now

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
healthy this is going all the time now

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.600 
healthy this is going all the time now
there<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> positive<00:01:52.590> message<00:01:52.770> norther<00:01:53.310> so

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
there is a positive message norther so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.550 
there is a positive message norther so
if<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.299> could<00:01:54.450> find<00:01:54.780> these<00:01:54.990> people<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.380> have

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
if you could find these people that have

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.499 
if you could find these people that have
that<00:01:55.710> gene<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.340> very<00:01:56.549> easily<00:01:56.729> genotype<00:01:57.329> them

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that gene you very easily genotype them

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.240 
that gene you very easily genotype them
and<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:57.840> find<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:59.070> could

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and then find them you could

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.710 
and then find them you could
preferentially<00:02:00.060> enroll<00:02:00.329> them<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
preferentially enroll them in

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.240 
preferentially enroll them in
trail<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.500> could<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.800> all<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.160> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
trail and they could have all of the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.820 
trail and they could have all of the
Alzheimer's<00:02:02.490> medications<00:02:03.300> available<00:02:03.420> today

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
Alzheimer's medications available today

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.530 
Alzheimer's medications available today
and<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.160> much<00:02:05.430> more<00:02:05.700> power<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.210> fighting

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and you have much more power in fighting

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.150 
and you have much more power in fighting
and<00:02:06.570> effects<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> drug<00:02:07.260> in<00:02:07.500> these<00:02:07.740> people

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and effects of the drug in these people

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.310 
and effects of the drug in these people
and<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.850> did<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.060> study<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.390> regular<00:02:09.960> normal

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
and if you did a study of regular normal

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.010 
and if you did a study of regular normal
people<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.340> reason<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.850> most<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.510> all<00:02:12.690> people

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
people the reason is most of all people

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.200 
people the reason is most of all people
aren't<00:02:13.260> losing<00:02:13.410> brain<00:02:13.740> tissue<00:02:14.010> very<00:02:14.340> fast<00:02:14.580> so

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
aren't losing brain tissue very fast so

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.000 
aren't losing brain tissue very fast so
it's<00:02:15.720> really<00:02:15.990> hard<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.620> whether<00:02:16.770> drugs

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it's really hard to see whether drugs

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's really hard to see whether drugs
working<00:02:17.340> because<00:02:17.610> there's<00:02:17.850> no<00:02:17.940> lot<00:02:18.150> happening

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
working because there's no lot happening

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.240 
working because there's no lot happening
in<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.570> brain<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.860> positive

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
in the brain so one of the positive

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.430 
in the brain so one of the positive
messages<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:20.940> genomics<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.080> can<00:02:22.170> find

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
messages with genomics is you can find

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.870 
messages with genomics is you can find
people<00:02:22.740> at<00:02:22.830> risk<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.430> something<00:02:23.760> pretty

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
people at risk and do something pretty

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.730 
people at risk and do something pretty
much<00:02:24.120> straight<00:02:24.360> away<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.440> gives<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.650> a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
much straight away and so it gives you a

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.920 
much straight away and so it gives you a
really<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.340> leg<00:02:26.610> up<00:02:26.790> into<00:02:27.000> drug<00:02:27.300> trials<00:02:27.720> where

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
really a leg up into drug trials where

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.630 
really a leg up into drug trials where
you're<00:02:28.530> normally<00:02:28.920> they'd<00:02:29.070> be<00:02:29.160> very<00:02:29.340> expensive

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you're normally they'd be very expensive

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.610 
you're normally they'd be very expensive
and<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.510> could<00:02:30.690> really<00:02:30.840> scan<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.320> people

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and you could really scan the people

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.320 
and you could really scan the people
that<00:02:31.770> are<00:02:31.800> declining<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.370> fastest<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
that are declining the fastest the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.270 
that are declining the fastest the
Europeans<00:02:34.320> are<00:02:34.380> involved<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.890> very<00:02:35.100> large

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
Europeans are involved in very large

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.940 
Europeans are involved in very large
scale<00:02:35.520> genomics<00:02:36.180> projects<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.500> Australians

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
scale genomics projects the Australians

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.040 
scale genomics projects the Australians
we<00:02:38.070> work<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.490> very<00:02:39.060> busy<00:02:39.240> collecting<00:02:39.630> data

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
we work with a very busy collecting data

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.810 
we work with a very busy collecting data
from<00:02:40.260> twins<00:02:40.590> spree<00:02:41.160> informative<00:02:41.610> from<00:02:41.760> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
from twins spree informative from a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.640 
from twins spree informative from a
genetic<00:02:42.150> point<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.420> view<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.230> think<00:02:43.350> it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
genetic point of view so I think it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.890 
genetic point of view so I think it
keeps<00:02:43.830> giving<00:02:44.160> us<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.490> lot<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.180> new<00:02:45.360> insights<00:02:45.750> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
keeps giving us a lot of new insights a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.120 
keeps giving us a lot of new insights a
lot<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.110> new<00:02:46.230> information<00:02:46.260> about<00:02:46.920> what's

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
lot of new information about what's

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.920 
lot of new information about what's
happening<00:02:47.490> that's<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.300> brain<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.630> research

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
happening that's the brain and research

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.470 
happening that's the brain and research
worldwide<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.740> think<00:02:50.490> one<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.060> benefits

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
worldwide I think one of the benefits

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.660 
worldwide I think one of the benefits
with<00:02:51.660> imaging<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:53.160> many<00:02:53.250> people<00:02:53.400> have

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
with imaging is that so many people have

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.640 
with imaging is that so many people have
collected<00:02:54.120> data<00:02:54.240> already<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> grad

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
collected data already that a grad

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.080 
collected data already that a grad
student<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:56.190> come<00:02:56.340> into<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.610> lab<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.790> just

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
student can come into the lab and just

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.460 
student can come into the lab and just
to<00:02:57.180> explore<00:02:57.570> images<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.230> look<00:02:58.320> at<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
to explore images and look at the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.170 
to explore images and look at the
diseases<00:02:58.830> they<00:02:58.860> care<00:02:59.130> about<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.790> they<00:03:00.060> don't

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
diseases they care about and they don't

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.270 
diseases they care about and they don't
have<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.690> scan<00:03:01.470> thousands<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.070> people

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
have to scan thousands of people

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.980 
have to scan thousands of people
themselves<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.510> little<00:03:03.630> bit<00:03:03.720> like

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
themselves so it's a little bit like

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.150 
themselves so it's a little bit like
we're<00:03:04.140> standing<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.590> shoulders<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.980> other

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
we're standing on the shoulders of other

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.560 
we're standing on the shoulders of other
people's<00:03:05.489> work<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.180> much<00:03:06.390> more

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
people's work and it's is much more

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.989 
people's work and it's is much more
efficient
