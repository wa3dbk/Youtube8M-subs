00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.150
 he talked about how they are in the dance of 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.910
 today I want to share a technique that 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.730
 I learned very recently and the truth is 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.090
 love how it looks like a marble 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.010
 with water but in this case we're going to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.649
 obviously do without water as we were 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.530
 I put in the title surely the first 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.140
 what are we going to do in all the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.910
 manicures the first thing I do is 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.650
 put me a base this is a 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.290
 chain treatment which is for 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.300
 Brittle nails and that will help 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.160
 protect the nail both from color and 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.290
 to reinforce a little bit because my 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.370
 honestly my dreams are very very 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.130
 after a weak base of 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.739
 color that you choose in this case 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.290
 I opted for the pink lilac flames 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.649
 fuchsias but the colors are going to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.230
 choose you and I gave previously a 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:16.300
 hand in this color like fuchsia 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.300
 I'm going to give a second hand 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.650
 having the wet base still I would 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.140
 gave a very finite hand of color and 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.140
 let the second hand dry let's 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.150
 use on wet 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.300
 we are going to apply the colors that 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.940
 we are going to mix in this 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.990
 case it's going to be a lilac and we're going to 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.920
 try to place abundant product in 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.920
 A line 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.650
 then we will try to choose a 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.140
 color that the contrast tries to have 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.610
 the open glazes like this is easier and 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.869
 faster because this we have to 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.869
 work on a less 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.590
 and now 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.170
 let's make the sea bolado with a 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.130
 toothpick what we're going to do 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.130
 is to drag 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.629
 the colors 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.050
 see how I put the toothpick not 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.050
 tip 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.120
 well there would be the mole sea that 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.459
 is very similar to what we do with 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.860
 What we are going to do is let it dry 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.769
 very very well and then we are going to apply 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.769
 a coat of shine or protector 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.210
 good girls this would be the day of the day 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.880
 today I hope you like the technique to me 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.280
 I liked it a lot, that's why I wanted it 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.310
 share with you I have a little picture 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.110
 where I did the same job in another 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.600
 color that I will share them for 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.000
 to see how nice are different 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.510
 tones in the other I did it in colors 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.450
 green and good hope I do this 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.270
 technique they see that it's not that complicated and 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.010
 it is very original very beautiful to 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.590
 continuation as always I will leave 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.050
 photos of this little job I thank you 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.370
 they have accompanied me to the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.170
 end of the video but this idea serves them 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.910
 and I send a huge kiss to all bye 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.720
