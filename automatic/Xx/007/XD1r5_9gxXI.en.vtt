guessing<00:00:05.420> a<00:00:05.480> lot<00:00:05.630> of<00:00:05.810> simple<00:00:06.110> 5<00:00:06.320> complex

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
guessing a lot of simple 5 complex

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.660 
guessing a lot of simple 5 complex
numbers<00:00:07.630> so<00:00:08.630> in<00:00:08.960> your<00:00:09.230> graphing<00:00:09.590> calculator

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
numbers so in your graphing calculator

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.980 
numbers so in your graphing calculator
the<00:00:10.670> first<00:00:10.940> thing<00:00:11.150> you<00:00:11.270> want<00:00:11.480> to<00:00:11.540> do<00:00:11.690> is<00:00:11.809> make

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
the first thing you want to do is make

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.810 
the first thing you want to do is make
sure<00:00:12.020> in<00:00:12.290> more<00:00:12.500> real-time<00:00:12.769> locating<00:00:13.580> your

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
sure in more real-time locating your

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.249 
sure in more real-time locating your
imaginary<00:00:14.599> that<00:00:15.139> so<00:00:16.099> here's<00:00:16.610> the<00:00:16.880> eye<00:00:17.259> and

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259 
imaginary that so here's the eye and

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.560 
imaginary that so here's the eye and
since<00:00:18.619> is<00:00:18.740> in<00:00:18.890> bloom<00:00:19.130> you<00:00:19.640> have<00:00:19.759> to<00:00:19.880> press<00:00:20.060> 2nd

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
since is in bloom you have to press 2nd

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.069 
since is in bloom you have to press 2nd
and<00:00:20.890> decimal<00:00:21.890> what<00:00:22.329> but<00:00:23.329> the<00:00:23.540> first<00:00:23.779> thing<00:00:23.989> we

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
and decimal what but the first thing we

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.240 
and decimal what but the first thing we
want<00:00:24.200> to<00:00:24.320> do<00:00:24.470> is<00:00:24.590> to<00:00:24.680> make<00:00:24.800> sure<00:00:24.860> that<00:00:25.220> our

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
want to do is to make sure that our

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.700 
want to do is to make sure that our
calculators<00:00:25.820> in<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.000> correct<00:00:26.410> so<00:00:27.410> because

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
calculators in the correct so because

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.870 
calculators in the correct so because
one<00:00:28.099> mode<00:00:28.310> one<00:00:29.980> here<00:00:30.980> you<00:00:31.279> have<00:00:31.460> different

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
one mode one here you have different

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.030 
one mode one here you have different
studies<00:00:32.329> for<00:00:32.570> your<00:00:32.689> back<00:00:32.870> later<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:33.860> is

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
studies for your back later and this is

longer living reload or you can change

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.119 
longer living reload or you can change
your<00:00:38.300> calculator<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:39.050> be<00:00:39.199> a<00:00:39.230> complex<00:00:39.829> more

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
your calculator to be a complex more

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.090 
your calculator to be a complex more
than<00:00:40.429> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.770

names impressed quit so you're you spit
on<00:00:56.280> me<00:00:56.640> understand<00:00:56.969> boo<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.110> second<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
on me understand boo for a second in the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.509 
on me understand boo for a second in the
moment<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> now<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> enter

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
moment so now we want to do is to enter

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.870 
moment so now we want to do is to enter
in<00:01:02.699> our<00:01:03.030> purse<00:01:03.449> example<00:01:04.040> yeah<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> cds

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
in our purse example yeah or the cds

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.999 
in our purse example yeah or the cds
keep<00:01:06.840> those<00:01:07.020> three<00:01:07.289> and<00:01:07.409> once<00:01:07.680> i<00:01:07.770> mean<00:01:07.890> in

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
keep those three and once i mean in

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.550 
keep those three and once i mean in
order<00:01:08.190> access<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> odd<00:01:09.020> that's<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> second

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
order access the odd that's the second

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
order access the odd that's the second
foot<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.630> our<00:01:12.630> decimal<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> once<00:01:21.810> we've

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
foot and then our decimal so once we've

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.649 
foot and then our decimal so once we've
innovated<00:01:22.289> our<00:01:22.560> expression<00:01:23.130> requesting<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
innovated our expression requesting it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.440 
innovated our expression requesting it
calculates<00:01:25.170> 6-2<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.069> of<00:01:26.159> words<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.940> we<00:01:27.179> just

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
calculates 6-2 out of words so we just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600 
calculates 6-2 out of words so we just
combine<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.990> real<00:01:28.170> parts<00:01:28.560> will<00:01:29.039> custom<00:01:29.460> game

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
combine the real parts will custom game

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.580 
combine the real parts will custom game
assist<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.690> combine<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> measurements

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
assist and combine the measurements

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.880 
assist and combine the measurements

last<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.680> 3i<00:02:41.220> santa<00:02:42.090> fe<00:02:42.269> fi<00:02:42.540> fi<00:02:42.840> which<00:02:43.109> gives<00:02:43.350> us

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
last is 3i santa fe fi fi which gives us

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.979 
last is 3i santa fe fi fi which gives us
a<00:02:43.500> plate<00:02:43.769> 15<00:02:44.310> times<00:02:44.340> weird<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:45.870> to

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
a plate 15 times weird you have to

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.539 
a plate 15 times weird you have to
remember<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.290> i<00:02:46.560> squared<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.130> equal<00:02:47.160> to

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
remember that i squared is equal to

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.110 
remember that i squared is equal to
negative<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.859> have<00:02:50.069> negative<00:02:50.489> 15<00:02:50.970> i

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
negative one so we have negative 15 i

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.020 
negative one so we have negative 15 i
squared<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.780> squared<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:53.130> negative<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:53.700> so

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
squared a squared is negative one so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.890 
squared a squared is negative one so
negative<00:02:54.420> 1<00:02:54.450> times<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.949> negative<00:02:56.340> 15<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.720> is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
negative 1 times the negative 15 this is

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.080 
negative 1 times the negative 15 this is
a<00:02:57.930> quadruped

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
a quadruped

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.510 
a quadruped
so<00:03:00.090> positive<00:03:00.480> 15<00:03:00.740> plus<00:03:01.740> your<00:03:01.920> first<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.310> eight

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
so positive 15 plus your first of eight

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.230 
so positive 15 plus your first of eight
this<00:03:03.240> how<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.570> w<00:03:04.560> word<00:03:05.240> now<00:03:06.240> we<00:03:06.300> want<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.080> by

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
this how you w word now we want to do by

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.630 
this how you w word now we want to do by
as<00:03:09.240> I<00:03:09.420> think<00:03:09.720> if<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.050> second<00:03:10.440> inner<00:03:10.710> me<00:03:13.640> change

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
as I think if I second inner me change

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.260 
as I think if I second inner me change
that<00:03:14.700> supervision<00:03:16.190> now<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.250> end<00:03:17.640> up<00:03:17.790> very

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
that supervision now you end up very

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.690 
that supervision now you end up very
long<00:03:18.690> message<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.950> what<00:03:20.220> we're<00:03:20.370> going<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.580> do

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
long message so what we're going to do

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.440 
long message so what we're going to do
is<00:03:21.060> go<00:03:21.210> to<00:03:21.270> math<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:23.100> tragic<00:03:23.820> as<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.120> will

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
is go to math and tragic as this will

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.630 
is go to math and tragic as this will
change<00:03:24.630> any<00:03:24.930> decimal<00:03:25.500> values<00:03:26.070> actually

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
change any decimal values actually

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.380 
change any decimal values actually
rather<00:03:27.150> than<00:03:28.130> first<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.760> negative

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
rather than first you know the negative

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.780 
rather than first you know the negative
70<00:03:30.690> point<00:03:31.020> 1<00:03:31.230> plus<00:03:31.740> 2<00:03:31.980> 18<00:03:32.370> holes<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.390> want<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
70 point 1 plus 2 18 holes we want I and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:46.540 
70 point 1 plus 2 18 holes we want I and
the<00:03:36.209> last<00:03:36.390> part<00:03:44.630> negative<00:03:45.630> 5<00:03:45.750> plus<00:03:46.020> worldwide

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
the last part negative 5 plus worldwide

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.430 
the last part negative 5 plus worldwide
so<00:03:47.550> this<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.030> how<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.180> simplify<00:03:49.050> complex

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
so this is how you simplify complex

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.280 
so this is how you simplify complex
expressions
