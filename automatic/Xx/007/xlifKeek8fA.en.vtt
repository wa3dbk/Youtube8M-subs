00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.750
 Let me remind you of the contests on the number 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.220
 one and that's how he was he was gently 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.620
 saying well, not exactly not very successful 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.210
 but I expected more from you. I understand that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.810
 not everyone can draw not everyone was 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.750
 born artists I asked you 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.610
 only about one in creative and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.240
 certainly there was a very good job 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.270
 from young people and girls 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.300
 I already distributed all the prizes that all of you 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.560
 got what they deserve so let's say but in 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.580
 autonomy work that you give me 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.350
 sent by e-mail 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.930
 you know it was like choosing either 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.540
 I took some screenshots of my photo 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.690
 type as background on desktop and from 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.310
 game subjects and just stuck there 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.960
 my photos say here is alexa rivers 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.610
 and operational come on detachment spring so 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.350
 I don't paint 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.140
 I also understand photoshop a bit 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.440
 even I would have done it but being somewhere and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.600
 retired resentment for three no more is 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.820
 guys are not creative this modeling modeling is not for us 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.370
 need i wanted to somehow but she doesn't have 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.650
 give at least something a little work 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.060
 not too lazy too specifically 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.159
 right up they took my picture on 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 lepilina on some kind of background and that's it 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.020
 there is nothing like this on you 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.180
 Okay, I did not understand what I already 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.070
 realized that not in the topic as if this 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.200
 drawing means competition number two will 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.229
 be the next i hope that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.680
 many of you if not artists then 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.479
 at least knows how to use 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.549
 no video editors no I'm not asking you 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.100
 now do not some super screensaver 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.500
 I'm not asking to do some kind of cartoon 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.840
 nothing like it is too complicated I 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 from you and from this even no I ask 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.489
 I ask you to cut the most 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.330
 memorable 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.340
 funny creative cool and funny 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.060
 moments solely from my 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.959
 videos I tell you 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.550
 We are talking about raw necessarily to those but 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.590
 these moments were funny 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.330
 not necessarily they can be 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.550
 funny they can be creative they 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.349
 can be funny creative and cool 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.660
 there by some personal phrases by some 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.250
 maybe but i don't know maybe i 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.680
 I got there ridiculous situations although I 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.470
 constantly they get in general somewhere 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.390
 in short cast snippets from 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.370
 only my videos 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.380
 five minutes no more but those who 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.180
 wants to do more believe it 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.790
 will be only a plus but mostly 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.709
 of course for five minutes you do here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.760
 this installation but not for nothing 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.799
 take my video 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.280
 cut out the video and just glue 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.750
 their stupid together I want it to be 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.459
 transitions I do not know there in creative 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.680
 with any kind of bet it can even be 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.170
 your comments with your sound 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.450
 effects can be with some further 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.099
 text absurd, I do not know in general that 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.650
 think it up think it up your already 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.870
 I deal in it as if it's ridiculous for that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.360
 enough of your head that's what you 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.459
 creativity then of course everything will go well 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.769
 plus it will be you have a bonus 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.200
 because so here you do it with the installation 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.690
 with transitions for special effects you can 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.250
 somehow with text with your voice acting 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.170
 with some kind of sound sound effects 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.970
 do it and get prizes 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.500
 but since whether this we have stood out 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.359
 Sorry scant on hits 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.640
 no games at all come out in the summer but 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.940
 it is clear whether it is actually in 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.350
 hibernation time for them igrodelov so we 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.390
 don't notice anything about it while there 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.000
 do not eat the magicians did not think and to what 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.579
 clever as for the first place you get 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.600

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.690
 licensed version 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.720

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.459

 that this is enough for you so 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.320
 I remind you again the last time in what 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.990
 is the essence of it 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.470
 of the competition you do cutting montage and 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.160
 their most spectacularly impressive 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.960
 exciting funny creative 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.229
 actually the video you make on 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.150
 nazadochku from hydrate in their video and 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.770
 put together and all this together that is 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.199
 the most creative moments in my 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.479
 videos you compose together then 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.289

 what is said in your head you will not fly 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.460
 in short, how much of your creativity is enough 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:36.310
 all the prizes are enough for that and I voiced 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.780

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.490
