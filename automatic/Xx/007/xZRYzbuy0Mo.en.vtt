and I remember I'm always blowing back
in<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.509> list<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.049> case

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.420 

there's<00:01:58.220> still<00:01:58.430> some<00:01:58.610> question

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
there's still some question

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:12.910 
there's still some question
how<00:02:00.940> to<00:02:01.800> work<00:02:02.800> out<00:02:03.010> with<00:02:03.160> new<00:02:03.250> fears

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.740 

I<00:02:13.010> mean<00:02:13.580> there's<00:02:13.790> still<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.090> few<00:02:14.300> piece<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.660> a

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
I mean there's still a few piece of a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.980 
I mean there's still a few piece of a
legend<00:02:15.580> but<00:02:16.580> not<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:17.000> there

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.560 

so<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:22.800> not<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.220> hundred<00:02:23.730> percent<00:02:23.850> out<00:02:24.330> I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
so it's not a hundred percent out I

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.840 
so it's not a hundred percent out I
think<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.110> hard<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.590> it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
think it's really hard to get it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.220 
think it's really hard to get it
one-hundred<00:02:26.850> percent<00:02:29.720> because<00:02:30.720> then<00:02:31.020> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
one-hundred percent because then you

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.470 
one-hundred percent because then you
have<00:02:31.260> things<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.950> act<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:33.000> similar<00:02:33.330> to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
have things that act is so similar to

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.290 
have things that act is so similar to
the<00:02:33.630> gold

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300
