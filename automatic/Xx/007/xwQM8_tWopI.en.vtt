they're not very specific on here so I'm
going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> assume<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> was<00:01:45.390> either<00:01:45.829> by<00:01:46.829> dollar

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
going to assume it was either by dollar

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.830 
going to assume it was either by dollar
49<00:01:48.979> or<00:01:49.979> $2.99<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:51.060> 249<00:01:52.490> basically<00:01:53.490> nothing<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
49 or $2.99 or 249 basically nothing the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.730 
49 or $2.99 or 249 basically nothing the
most<00:01:55.020> expensive<00:01:55.530> item<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.070> 399<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
most expensive item here is 399 so this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.149
