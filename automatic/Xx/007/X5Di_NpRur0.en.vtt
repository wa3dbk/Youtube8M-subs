EPISODE 7
STATION 6: THE FLAGELLATION

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.106
Pilate's conversation with Jesus

00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:33.531
was not only about what had been said

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:37.156
nor about stating who Jesus was,

00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:41.481
but ended up with something
 absolutely tragic and cruel.

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:46.706
Lord Jesus was led to the court
where He was tied to a post

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:51.331
and where, as Holy Biblie say,
He was brutally flagellated and tortured.

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:56.085
Presumably, this flagellation 
was horribly brutal and violent,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.210
so to speak, 
an extremely vicious and bestial act.

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:04.135
Obviously, any suffering 
should be treated seriously

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.860
but as all mistics claim,

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:10.585
and those who try to explore 
a subject of the Passion,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.510
it was probably this flagellation

00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:18.535
where the whole hatred 
and the evil of the world was accumulated.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.960
It was as if the evil had it in for Him

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:24.685
to torture Him so heavily.

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:28.689
What we ususally 
notice in the flagellation

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:32.314
is very painful humiliation of suffering 
body but there is something more,

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:35.139
something of much greater importance

00:01:35.164 --> 00:01:38.564
so that Jesus took it on Himself 
for some other reason.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:00.421
The flagellation was carried out 
by Roman soldiers.

00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:04.446
It seems that those who 
tormented Lord Jesus in that way

00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:07.371
were mainly the Romans.

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:13.051
However, historans say, 
the Roman troops that time in Jerusalem,

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:16.076
though there was plenty of them,

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.201
were not consisting merely of the Romans.

00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:22.226
Probably lots of Syrophoenicians 
and Samaritans joined the ranks

00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:24.251
of this Roman troop.

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:26.076
There is one reason.

00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:31.101
They hated the Jews enough to join 
the enemy's army to fight them.

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:33.826
There was no single Jew in this cohort,

00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:36.951
instead, there were those 
who hated the Jews.

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:40.276
This flagellation 
on the order of the Romans

00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:44.901
- it was a Roman who 
was the leader of this cruel event -

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:48.926
was probably carried out by somebody else,

00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:53.551
e.g. Syrophoenicians or Samaritans 
but not the Romans.

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:58.676
And it makes all the difference when 
we look at the scene of the flagellation.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:17.565
If the Christ's flagellation 
was carried out not only by the Romans

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.290
but also by Syrophoenicians or Samaritans

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:26.515
it might have been simply a racism.

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:31.202
Once they figured it out 
they have a full control over a Jew

00:03:31.227 --> 00:03:33.427
they decided to take 
their anger out on Him.

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:36.852
The reason why He was crowned 
with thorny branches,

00:03:36.877 --> 00:03:40.177
why He was dressed with a scarlet robe

00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:43.802
and why they jeered at Him

00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:48.927
was that they realized they have 
a perfect opportunity to mock a Jew

00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:52.352
- a Galilean who calls Himself a King.

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:56.622
This flagellation is not only a torture

00:03:56.647 --> 00:03:59.347
but probably a symptom of racism

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:03.072
where one takes his anger out on another

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:07.997
because of different nation, 
skin colour or denomination.

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:11.747
It's very probable it looked like this.

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:15.272
Lord Jesus wanted 
to take on such an affront.

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:19.097
He accepted the flagellation  
in order to take on all hatred

00:04:19.122 --> 00:04:23.222
and insults people throw 
at each other just because they differ.

00:04:23.247 --> 00:04:28.847
Being totally different from everybody, 
He took all these insults on Himself.

00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:50.726
If the flagellation was all about that

00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:54.351
today we need to 
make ourselves aware

00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:58.176
of all acts of hatred, 
disagreement and opposition

00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:00.801
in our relationships

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:05.626
which come from 
different nationalities,

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:10.251
religions, orientations
and whatever else.

00:05:11.023 --> 00:05:15.097
When you look at somebody 
of different nationality, and skin colour,

00:05:15.122 --> 00:05:18.222
when you see he thinks differently,

00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:22.172
when you see he has 
different convictions and beliefs,

00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:27.297
or has different political 
or sexual orientation

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:32.322
and for this reason you put 
some hateful pressure on him,

00:05:33.372 --> 00:05:36.772
and you flagellate him, 
not necessarily physically,

00:05:36.797 --> 00:05:39.997
but with words, 
thoughts, and hatred

00:05:40.022 --> 00:05:42.322
you always do it to Christ.

00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:45.247
Christ has taken it all on Himself,

00:05:45.572 --> 00:05:48.572
and it means we should eventually

00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:52.697
stop whipping each other with hatred.

00:05:52.847 --> 00:05:56.247
Look through your life today
to search for relationships

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.772
in which you treat somebody badly,

00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:02.797
where you disagree with somebody
whipping them continually

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:05.622
just because you're at odds with them.

00:06:05.647 --> 00:06:10.647
Today we need to eventually finish with it.
