00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.469
 greet here I hope you are well 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.230
 today I like to do a hairstyle 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.370
 which is a bit of a variant of where you 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.740
 vas torso said that you did 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.420
 previously 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.180
 so that gives you an earlier hairstyle 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.539
 a rather nice and rather romantic 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.100
 which is very very very fast to do 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.340
 really that is perfect for the morning 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.420
 but not too much time not you 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.769
 to style but you still want to 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.870
 to style her something pretty 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:39.519
 Baal is really perfect so you 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:44.260
 will need a few brush 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.850
 elastic and then if you want 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.500
 accessories is like me bah of a 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:54.159
 pliers or pliers will be grabbed so we 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.449
 not start to brush the hair and we 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.820
 bring them all back to one side so then 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.680
 we will make a half-tail finally a 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.930
 tail starting taking the hair to 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.850
 roughly from above the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.840
 ears bringing it back to the side of 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.840
 side where there is all the hair 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.830
 we tie with a rubber band 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.820
 and then it's going to be the same 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.650
 technique that for the braid beat 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.409
 is it the twisted ponytail pardon 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.860
 we are going to make a hollow is spent there 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.860
 that in 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.650
 we tighten up a little bit then we will come 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.780
 take more hair so a section 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.780
 of hair below them is that 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.240
 that's it and we have it so we bring it back with 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.240
 the tail and attach 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.659
 we will do exactly the same thing 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.129
 will go down and we will go there 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.629
 in so if you have hair 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.440
 shorter than me because it's true 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.019
 that mine are still enough 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.400
 heavy ben i'm gonna I'm going to do that 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.840
 three times if ever they are more 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:43.739
 short than me bah you do twice 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:45.599
 tightens and so for the third I 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:54.319
 will take the paths that remain I 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:54.319
 add to the tail and tie 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.820
 we do the same thing a hollow on 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.880
 queue in and tighten a 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.880
 little 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.300
 so if you want you can add 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.880
 a little clip I'm going to put it 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.880
 at the end like that and you're done 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.070

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.620
