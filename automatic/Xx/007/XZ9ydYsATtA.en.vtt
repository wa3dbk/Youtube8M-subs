00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
frenzy for it seems to confuse opponents

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.679 
frenzy for it seems to confuse opponents
just<00:01:19.380> ever<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.039> slightly<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.850> opening

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
just ever so slightly in the opening

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.670 
just ever so slightly in the opening
this<00:01:22.049> move<00:01:22.350> order<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.609> b6<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
this move order so b6 and it's like you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.429 
this move order so b6 and it's like you
know<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.859> opponent's<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.430> making<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
know the opponent's like making it up I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.279 
know the opponent's like making it up I
thought<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> time<00:01:29.719> especially<00:01:30.719> now

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
thought at the time especially now

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.560 
thought at the time especially now
because<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.670> there's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> king's<00:01:33.180> engine

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
because you know there's a king's engine

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
because you know there's a king's engine
feature<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:35.009> finish<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.460> bishop<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
feature here in the finish at bishop and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
feature here in the finish at bishop and
it<00:01:36.179> is<00:01:36.390> combining<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.899> with<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:37.049> Queen's<00:01:37.380> Finch

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it is combining it with a Queen's Finch

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.639 
it is combining it with a Queen's Finch
at<00:01:38.460> 0<00:01:39.259> which<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.560> sure<00:01:40.859> is<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.789> great

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
at 0 which I'm not sure is that great

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.770 
at 0 which I'm not sure is that great
especially<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.070> continuation<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:45.090> now

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
especially in this continuation I now

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.529 
especially in this continuation I now
play<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.320> four<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.219> I've<00:01:47.310> got<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> kind<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.850> Kings

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
play a four so I've got a kind of Kings

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.419 
play a four so I've got a kind of Kings
engine<00:01:48.929> you<00:01:49.079> know<00:01:49.200> big<00:01:49.439> center<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.950> pawns<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
engine you know big center of pawns and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.010 
engine you know big center of pawns and
he<00:01:53.429> further<00:01:53.700> weakens<00:01:54.090> his<00:01:54.240> dark<00:01:54.509> squares<00:01:54.840> he

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
he further weakens his dark squares he

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.609 
he further weakens his dark squares he
plays<00:01:55.259> e6<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:57.600> really<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:57.899> thought<00:01:58.499> this

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
plays e6 and I really just thought this

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.910 
plays e6 and I really just thought this
was<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.859> bit<00:01:59.070> odd<00:01:59.249> I<00:01:59.869> mean<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.170> black<00:02:01.649> might

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
was a bit odd I mean I know black might

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.880 
was a bit odd I mean I know black might
be<00:02:02.130> preparing<00:02:02.460> d5<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.539> if<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.619> keep<00:02:04.859> this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
be preparing d5 but if I keep this

always what would be the point of
extending<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:30.990> scope<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> rook<00:03:32.240> you<00:03:33.240> know

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
Castle in this game but you know look at

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.189 
Castle in this game but you know look at

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
all his pieces all just on the back row

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.800 
all his pieces all just on the back row
here<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.860> play<00:05:14.860> night<00:05:15.159> after<00:05:16.090> night<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.389> six<00:05:16.659> I

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
here so I play night after night a six I

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.050 
here so I play night after night a six I
playing<00:05:17.050> night<00:05:17.259> to<00:05:17.620> d6<00:05:18.129> and<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:20.639> did<00:05:21.639> see<00:05:21.849> some

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
playing night to d6 and I did see some

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.679 
playing night to d6 and I did see some
fascinating<00:05:22.800> variations<00:05:23.909> here<00:05:24.909> actually

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:25.689 
fascinating variations here actually

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.119 
fascinating variations here actually
worked<00:05:26.020> when<00:05:26.139> I<00:05:26.169> did<00:05:26.409> check<00:05:26.439> with<00:05:26.680> with<00:05:27.520> vodka

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
worked when I did check with with vodka

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.110 
worked when I did check with with vodka
basically<00:05:30.150> involving<00:05:31.150> like<00:05:31.330> a<00:05:31.509> cheese<00:05:31.960> and

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
basically involving like a cheese and

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.059 
basically involving like a cheese and
hgs<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.240> night<00:05:34.389> g5s<00:05:35.020> is<00:05:35.229> very<00:05:35.500> dangerous<00:05:35.680> for

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
hgs and night g5s is very dangerous for

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.839 
hgs and night g5s is very dangerous for
black<00:05:36.490> in<00:05:36.789> many<00:05:36.969> variations<00:05:38.580> so<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.699> way<00:05:39.819> I

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
black in many variations so the way I

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.309 
black in many variations so the way I
played<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.300> may<00:05:40.659> not<00:05:40.810> have<00:05:40.930> been<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.110> most

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
played it may not have been the most

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.800 
played it may not have been the most
accurate<00:05:41.620> but<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.339> seems<00:05:42.969> to<00:05:43.060> me<00:05:43.210> you<00:05:43.719> know

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
accurate but it seems to me you know

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:51.240 
accurate but it seems to me you know
quite<00:05:44.080> good<00:05:44.319> anyway<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:46.979> tonight<00:05:47.979> d<00:05:48.430> 6<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:50.919> he

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
quite good anyway so tonight d 6 and he

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.189 
quite good anyway so tonight d 6 and he
plays<00:05:51.490> Knight<00:05:51.759> c5<00:05:52.270> so<00:05:52.810> maybe<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.379> idea<00:05:53.620> of<00:05:53.740> 94

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
plays Knight c5 so maybe the idea of 94

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.019 
plays Knight c5 so maybe the idea of 94
I<00:05:56.199> play<00:05:56.560> Queen<00:05:56.800> takes<00:05:57.039> d4<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.580> his<00:05:57.729> Bishop

he'll<00:06:06.039> match<00:06:06.189> didn't<00:06:06.580> do<00:06:06.729> anything<00:06:06.909> it<00:06:07.180> was

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
he'll match didn't do anything it was

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.329 
he'll match didn't do anything it was
later<00:06:07.479> on<00:06:07.689> the<00:06:07.839> minds<00:06:08.110> and<00:06:08.500> it's<00:06:09.009> the<00:06:09.129> same

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:09.339 
later on the minds and it's the same

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.790 
later on the minds and it's the same
thing<00:06:09.370> gonna<00:06:09.699> happen<00:06:09.789> here<00:06:10.180> with<00:06:10.360> f6<00:06:10.839> so<00:06:11.740> I

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
thing gonna happen here with f6 so I

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.070 
thing gonna happen here with f6 so I
wasn't<00:06:12.370> actually<00:06:12.969> at<00:06:13.180> this<00:06:13.419> point<00:06:13.539> in<00:06:13.990> the

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
wasn't actually at this point in the

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.450 
wasn't actually at this point in the
game<00:06:14.110> during<00:06:14.589> the<00:06:14.770> game<00:06:14.919> I<00:06:14.949> wasn't<00:06:15.339> actually

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
game during the game I wasn't actually

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.230 
game during the game I wasn't actually
convinced<00:06:16.710> that<00:06:17.710> I<00:06:17.919> had<00:06:18.339> you<00:06:19.120> know<00:06:19.150> a

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
convinced that I had you know a

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.029 
convinced that I had you know a
reasonably<00:06:19.870> good<00:06:20.050> position<00:06:20.620> I<00:06:20.680> thought<00:06:20.919> I'd

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
reasonably good position I thought I'd

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.570 
reasonably good position I thought I'd
lost<00:06:21.099> the<00:06:21.430> advantage<00:06:21.490> actually<00:06:23.339> but<00:06:24.339> then<00:06:24.490> I

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
lost the advantage actually but then I

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.149 
lost the advantage actually but then I
thought<00:06:24.610> hold<00:06:25.029> on<00:06:25.210> hold<00:06:25.539> on<00:06:25.719> the<00:06:25.990> swing<00:06:26.919> about

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
thought hold on hold on the swing about

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.279 
thought hold on hold on the swing about
this<00:06:27.460> position<00:06:28.240> which<00:06:28.479> it<00:06:28.629> actually<00:06:29.110> is

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
this position which it actually is

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.969 
this position which it actually is
positive<00:06:30.419> you<00:06:31.419> know<00:06:31.539> I<00:06:31.569> think<00:06:31.839> this<00:06:32.199> h-hold<00:06:32.800> is

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
positive you know I think this h-hold is

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.920 
positive you know I think this h-hold is
dangerous<00:06:33.520> because<00:06:33.699> there's<00:06:34.300> a<00:06:34.360> positional

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
dangerous because there's a positional

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.959 
dangerous because there's a positional
aspect<00:06:35.409> that<00:06:35.949> if<00:06:36.069> I<00:06:36.159> really<00:06:36.460> want<00:06:36.610> to<00:06:36.699> stop

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:36.969 
aspect that if I really want to stop

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.139 
aspect that if I really want to stop
Black<00:06:37.210> playing<00:06:37.569> f6<00:06:38.199> then<00:06:38.919> hg<00:06:39.550> is<00:06:39.669> useful

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:40.149 
Black playing f6 then hg is useful

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:43.050 
Black playing f6 then hg is useful
because<00:06:40.959> if<00:06:41.169> he<00:06:41.229> plays<00:06:41.409> FG<00:06:41.860> obvious<00:06:42.159> is<00:06:42.279> how<00:06:42.490> f6

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
because if he plays FG obvious is how f6

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.710 
because if he plays FG obvious is how f6
well

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
well

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.300 
well
I'm<00:06:43.750> giving<00:06:44.080> him<00:06:44.170> like<00:06:44.380> pressure<00:06:44.680> on<00:06:44.860> on<00:06:45.040> the<00:06:45.220> F

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
I'm giving him like pressure on on the F

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.580 
I'm giving him like pressure on on the F
file<00:06:45.610> without<00:06:46.330> F<00:06:46.600> sex<00:06:46.840> happening<00:06:47.170> undermine

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
file without F sex happening undermine

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.370 
file without F sex happening undermine
you<00:06:47.950> know<00:06:48.100> II<00:06:48.280> five<00:06:48.700> and<00:06:48.910> d6<00:06:49.360> so<00:06:50.080> what<00:06:50.230> I<00:06:50.290> did

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
you know II five and d6 so what I did

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.230 
you know II five and d6 so what I did
first<00:06:50.860> was<00:06:51.510> just<00:06:52.510> take<00:06:52.810> on<00:06:53.670> g6<00:06:54.670> so<00:06:54.940> it's<00:06:55.090> sort

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
first was just take on g6 so it's sort

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.240 
first was just take on g6 so it's sort
of<00:06:55.360> positional<00:06:55.840> actually<00:06:56.110> not<00:06:56.200> just<00:06:56.440> you<00:06:57.130> have

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
of positional actually not just you have

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.200 
of positional actually not just you have
h<00:06:57.490> file<00:06:57.880> attack<00:06:58.630> and<00:06:58.900> now<00:06:59.710> he<00:07:00.310> took<00:07:00.520> the<00:07:00.670> f<00:07:00.850> porn

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
h file attack and now he took the f porn

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.380 
h file attack and now he took the f porn
so<00:07:01.570> there's<00:07:01.720> no<00:07:01.810> concern<00:07:02.200> about<00:07:02.230> f<00:07:02.650> sex<00:07:03.390> so

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
so there's no concern about f sex so

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.860 
so there's no concern about f sex so
this<00:07:04.570> is<00:07:04.600> more<00:07:04.930> secure<00:07:05.290> the<00:07:05.500> night<00:07:05.650> on<00:07:05.770> b6<00:07:06.870> but

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
this is more secure the night on b6 but

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.180 
this is more secure the night on b6 but
I<00:07:07.930> really<00:07:08.200> wondered<00:07:08.500> you<00:07:08.590> know<00:07:08.620> how<00:07:08.890> is<00:07:09.070> it

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
I really wondered you know how is it

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.780 
I really wondered you know how is it
actually<00:07:09.610> you<00:07:09.880> know<00:07:09.970> useful<00:07:10.450> hair<00:07:10.690> um<00:07:11.550> well<00:07:12.550> I

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:12.790

found<00:07:13.060> that<00:07:13.720> there's<00:07:14.710> another<00:07:15.010> neat<00:07:15.280> move

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
found that there's another neat move

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.930 
found that there's another neat move
here<00:07:15.970> that<00:07:16.300> perhaps<00:07:16.920> you<00:07:17.920> know<00:07:18.040> justifies<00:07:18.670> now

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
here that perhaps you know justifies now

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.200 
here that perhaps you know justifies now
light<00:07:19.630> and<00:07:20.230> the<00:07:20.350> porn<00:07:20.620> so<00:07:21.430> I<00:07:21.460> wanted<00:07:21.790> to<00:07:21.850> attack

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
light and the porn so I wanted to attack

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.180 
light and the porn so I wanted to attack
on<00:07:22.390> the<00:07:22.480> dark<00:07:22.720> squares<00:07:23.110> and<00:07:23.380> although<00:07:23.950> it's

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
on the dark squares and although it's

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.890

subtle<00:07:27.880> point<00:07:28.270> in<00:07:28.360> here<00:07:28.480> that<00:07:28.630> the<00:07:28.840> squares<00:07:29.230> d

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860
