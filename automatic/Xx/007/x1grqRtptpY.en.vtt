alright yeah up here you know I think

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
alright yeah up here you know I think
this<00:01:55.860> next<00:01:56.130> platform<00:01:56.399> would<00:01:56.759> collapse<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this next platform would collapse so you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.959 
this next platform would collapse so you
might<00:01:57.960> want<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.380> careful<00:01:58.590> oh<00:01:59.070> man<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> almost

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
might want to be careful oh man I almost

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.399 
might want to be careful oh man I almost
died<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.079> would<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.290> been

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
died just there that would have been

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.620 
died just there that would have been
literally<00:02:01.799> terrible<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:03.420> yeah<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.600> think

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
literally terrible but yeah I think

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.999 
literally terrible but yeah I think
these<00:02:03.899> ones<00:02:04.110> collapsed<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.799> you're<00:02:04.920> gonna

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
these ones collapsed so you're gonna

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.260 
these ones collapsed so you're gonna
want<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> be<00:02:05.310> quick<00:02:05.579> when<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> this

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
want to be quick when you go to this

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.950 
want to be quick when you go to this
next<00:02:06.509> area<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> shouldn't<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.380> too

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
next area but it shouldn't be too

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.859 
next area but it shouldn't be too
and<00:02:08.170> we<00:02:08.800> got<00:02:08.950> ourselves<00:02:09.130> at<00:02:09.550> checkpoints<00:02:10.330> so

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
and we got ourselves at checkpoints so

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.830 
and we got ourselves at checkpoints so

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
in this barrel and blast off to our very

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.330 
in this barrel and blast off to our very
first<00:02:21.040> bonus<00:02:21.640> room<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:23.590> was<00:02:23.830> just<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.190> know

the plot point one bounce back and forth
pretty<00:02:26.950> standard<00:02:27.520> pretty<00:02:28.000> easy<00:02:28.300> actually<00:02:28.660> I

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
pretty standard pretty easy actually I

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.940 
pretty standard pretty easy actually I
found<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.930> good<00:02:29.050> way<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> do<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:29.590> one<00:02:29.800> or<00:02:29.890> if

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
found a good way to do this one or if

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.340 
found a good way to do this one or if
you<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.250> alternate<00:02:30.760> sort<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.230> from<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
you just like alternate sort of from the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.140 
you just like alternate sort of from the
outer<00:02:32.500> platforms<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.400> inner<00:02:33.550> ones<00:02:33.820> like

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
outer platforms to the inner ones like

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.330 
outer platforms to the inner ones like
you<00:02:35.080> get<00:02:35.230> them<00:02:35.290> sort<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:35.980> this

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
you get them sort of in like this this

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.949 
you get them sort of in like this this
grouping<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.090> works<00:02:37.300> out<00:02:37.510> really<00:02:37.720> well<00:02:37.930> and

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
grouping that works out really well and

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.830 
grouping that works out really well and
you<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.170> pretty<00:02:39.130> much<00:02:39.510> collect<00:02:40.510> everything

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
you can pretty much collect everything

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.410 
you can pretty much collect everything
in<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.709> or<00:02:41.830> two<00:02:42.040> jumps<00:02:42.520> for<00:02:42.670> either<00:02:42.730> side<00:02:43.090> as

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
in one or two jumps for either side as

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.020 
in one or two jumps for either side as
long<00:02:43.900> as<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.080> don't<00:02:44.200> mess<00:02:44.410> up<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:44.980> that's<00:02:45.820> how

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
long as you don't mess up so that's how

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.250 
long as you don't mess up so that's how
I<00:02:46.060> prefer<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:46.840> these<00:02:46.989> types<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.500> rooms<00:02:47.770> now

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
I prefer to do these types of rooms now

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.240 
I prefer to do these types of rooms now
anyways<00:02:50.260> down<00:02:50.470> we<00:02:50.590> got<00:02:50.709> this<00:02:50.770> puzzle<00:02:51.130> piece

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
levels so we're gonna grab this DK

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.560 
levels so we're gonna grab this DK
barrel<00:02:55.090> now<00:02:55.510> you're<00:02:56.410> gonna<00:02:56.500> want<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.739> be<00:02:56.860> very

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
that'll actually break the DK barrel so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.930 
that'll actually break the DK barrel so
yeah<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.470> can't<00:03:08.800> lose<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.190> if<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.400> do<00:03:09.489> lose<00:03:09.730> it

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.400 
um there's two no other barrels in this
level<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:13.239> basically<00:03:13.720> have<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.230> kill

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
level so you basically have to kill

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.289 
level so you basically have to kill
yourself<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:14.890> order<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.160> get<00:03:16.030> all<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
yourself in order to get all the

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.960 
yourself in order to get all the
collectables<00:03:16.450> if<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.170> barrel<00:03:17.620> breaks

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
collectables if this barrel breaks

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.180 
collectables if this barrel breaks
hopefully<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.810> won't<00:03:19.930> happen<00:03:20.080> but<00:03:20.799> I'm

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
hopefully that it won't happen but I'm

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.190 
hopefully that it won't happen but I'm
not<00:03:21.610> making<00:03:21.790> any<00:03:22.030> promises<00:03:22.299> who<00:03:22.989> actually

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200

worried<00:03:30.130> about<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.640> it's<00:03:31.540> not<00:03:31.750> exactly<00:03:32.320> right

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
worried about so it's not exactly right

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.920 
worried about so it's not exactly right
here<00:03:32.799> it's<00:03:33.180> upcoming<00:03:34.180> after<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:34.570> segment

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
there's like a chain of these fireballs

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.240

that<00:03:37.360> go<00:03:37.570> up<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.959> it's<00:03:38.049> like<00:03:38.170> run<00:03:38.530> through

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
that go up and it's like run through

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.509 
that go up and it's like run through

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
I didn't take too long and you probably

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.070 
I didn't take too long and you probably
saw<00:05:05.940> that<00:05:06.150> end<00:05:06.330> letter<00:05:06.540> which<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:06.930> like

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
saw that end letter which is like

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.560 
saw that end letter which is like
underneath<00:05:07.410> this<00:05:07.740> platform<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.940> basically<00:05:09.419> to

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
underneath this platform so basically to

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.320 
underneath this platform so basically to
get<00:05:09.720> that<00:05:10.010> you<00:05:11.010> can<00:05:11.160> see<00:05:11.370> those<00:05:11.550> little<00:05:11.850> like

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
get that you can see those little like

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.760 
get that you can see those little like
pillars<00:05:12.750> jetting<00:05:13.140> out<00:05:13.200> on<00:05:13.380> laughs<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.680> have

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
pillars jetting out on laughs you have

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.070 
pillars jetting out on laughs you have
to<00:05:13.800> like<00:05:13.979> short<00:05:14.760> jump<00:05:15.060> across<00:05:15.360> all<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.840> those

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
to like short jump across all of those

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.790 
to like short jump across all of those
all<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.190> way<00:05:17.280> over<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:17.820> end<00:05:18.210> letter<00:05:18.419> so

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
all the way over to that end letter so

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.290 
all the way over to that end letter so
it's<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.860> lot<00:05:20.010> easier<00:05:20.400> with<00:05:20.550> Diddy<00:05:20.790> so<00:05:21.270> I

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
it's a lot easier with Diddy so I

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.969 
it's a lot easier with Diddy so I
recommend<00:05:21.750> having<00:05:21.870> him<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:22.530> should<00:05:22.800> if

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
recommend having him and you should if

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.980 
recommend having him and you should if
you've<00:05:23.100> got<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.580> bonus<00:05:24.120> room<00:05:24.419> puzzle<00:05:24.810> piece

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
you've got that bonus room puzzle piece

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.300 
you've got that bonus room puzzle piece
unless<00:05:25.260> it<00:05:25.410> took<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.590> ton<00:05:25.770> of<00:05:25.800> damage<00:05:26.040> on<00:05:26.250> the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
unless it took a ton of damage on the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.310 
unless it took a ton of damage on the
way<00:05:26.370> back<00:05:26.580> for<00:05:26.820> whatever<00:05:26.970> reason<00:05:27.450> but<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.870> is

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
way back for whatever reason but it is

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.380 
way back for whatever reason but it is
still<00:05:28.620> entirely<00:05:28.950> possible<00:05:29.580> with<00:05:29.729> just<00:05:29.940> DK

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
still entirely possible with just DK

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.880 
still entirely possible with just DK
alone<00:05:30.630> although<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.140> a<00:05:31.169> lot<00:05:31.350> harder<00:05:31.530> as<00:05:31.770> you

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
alone although it is a lot harder as you

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.070 
alone although it is a lot harder as you
could<00:05:32.040> probably<00:05:32.190> imagine<00:05:32.600> all<00:05:33.600> right<00:05:33.840> there

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
could probably imagine all right there

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.420 
could probably imagine all right there
we<00:05:34.229> go<00:05:34.320> we<00:05:34.470> got<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:34.710> EDD<00:05:34.830> letter<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:35.250> we're

going to go for it I really don't care
about<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.930> damage<00:05:37.200> because<00:05:37.470> we<00:05:37.620> are<00:05:37.710> almost

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
about the damage because we are almost
