Rivaldo<00:01:19.479> players<00:01:20.320> like<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.560> but<00:01:21.009> Cristiano

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
Rivaldo players like that but Cristiano

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.419

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
and up and up and I think their battle

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.319 
and up and up and I think their battle
against<00:01:27.039> each<00:01:27.159> other<00:01:27.369> has<00:01:27.700> allowed<00:01:28.060> them<00:01:28.270> to

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
against each other has allowed them to

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.649 
against each other has allowed them to
do<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:28.719> as<00:01:28.840> well<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.429> believe<00:01:30.789> Suarez<00:01:31.509> is

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
do that as well and I believe Suarez is

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.599 
do that as well and I believe Suarez is
not<00:01:31.840> far<00:01:32.020> behind<00:01:32.049> them<00:01:32.530> as<00:01:32.649> well<00:01:32.859> and<00:01:33.100> Neymar
