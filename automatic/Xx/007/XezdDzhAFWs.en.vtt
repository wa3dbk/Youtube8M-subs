00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.570

 start from the bottom if you go the way 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.930

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.110
 yellow dolls who are my last 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.210

 I still left to buy myself 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.229
 compensated and black for this summer but 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.320
 Here I changed my mind agree here 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.700
 ok if you a little too tall 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.229

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.450
 go out occasionally then here I have a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.090
 little chinos pants that I bought 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.799
 in the swamp I think the mark this 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.049
 and reiko but I'm not sure 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.840
 it's an Italian thing they have plenty of 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.079
 colors and that's how I like it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.450
 well this form I have a moldy belt 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.009
 have run away from the Chinese who is 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.450
 leaving in lollipop but 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.789

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.310
 so here I reveal it to you for the 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.039
 camera 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.810

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.569
 angry it's a 10,10 hawai tee shirt 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.149
 that's how we say it's actually 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:02.229
 a monoprix t-shirt on which I 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:05.140
 added hand-stitched bag I have 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.179
 cut beforehand that I recovered at 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.200
 the 10th anniversary of the ed banger label 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.420
 at the villette 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.920
 a month ago and some views that the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.989
 dudes of the organ was under they go 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.299
 spin 500 with I could have the joy 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.790
 to take the opportunity to remaster this 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.500
 tee shirt and drained much sooner 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.230
 bet in fact yeah that's it I like 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.870
 ok i like it when i can and then that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.060
 does something original that others my 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.180
 bag and that jean t-shirt class and that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.340
 it's a zahra blood jacket that serves 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.859
 every year every summer every 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.569
 seasons that is perfect opportunity and 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.329
 yeah he's really worn out those of 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.470
 vintage like what we do well 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.079
 here are the basics I have a bag I think 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.790
 to that weird weird weird nickname 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.540
 like it is fake leather it comes from 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.769
 rotterdam actually 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.470
 finally except these hennebert hens so 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.150
 findable in Paris I imagine but he 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.040
 comes from rotterdam i bought during 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.510
 a little getaway here and then 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.720
 what else do I have I have 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.299
 shows that I love who is ours nixon 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.560
 any basic fake fake fake 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:14.049
 turtle with this stuff that leather that 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.069
 I remember above me I speak to you 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.319
 where am I going to buy 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.500
 and that's bracelets that I have 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.669
 bought these of these from the yak bone that 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.019
 I bought in Bhutan actually since 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.400
 the announced nacre but that's a 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.680
 stuff I bought in Bhutan is at a 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.900
 year and a half their place and the journey of my 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.400
 life I do not tell everyone when 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.079
 I meet people in the street but 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.870
 here I keep it for myself and that's 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.310
 a charm that comes from the train station 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.720
 ballast 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.439
 like the Chinese one I think but you 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.480
 why do you like a value ring 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.890
 no it's because I love love has 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.480
 full of jokes I like it when that 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.530
 take both phalanges the problem 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.390
 is that I can not work with because 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.670
 that it's a little dirty to make 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.930
 ultrasounds with jewels so so 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.700
 it's the same as soon as I go out I put 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.700
 shoes with heels and jewels 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.480
 I live bad blues and my pajamas my fangs 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.410
 ugly boxing yes I have legs 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.010
 no no no it's handy but 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.769
 it's not very sexy 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.319
 outside the heap but there too he was 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:18.609

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.160
 offered my mother and her date before my 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.979
 birth is coral its part to pass 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.370
 the different generations find 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.800
 hyper Thursday it looks like small 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.260

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.040
 al that time in Paris allows us 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.340
 by thinning it's enough out for
