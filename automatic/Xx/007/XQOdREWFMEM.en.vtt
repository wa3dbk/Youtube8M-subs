00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
really kicked up so it's obvious that

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.180 
really kicked up so it's obvious that
you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.739> modify<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:42.050> included<00:00:43.190> character

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you can modify the included character

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.950 
you can modify the included character
models<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> assets<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> mod

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
models and assets for the mod

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.470 
models and assets for the mod
development<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> want<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> know<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
development but what I want to know is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
development but what I want to know is
how<00:00:48.840> easy<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.370> add<00:00:50.610> new

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
how easy is it going to be to add new

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.170 
how easy is it going to be to add new
character<00:00:51.960> models<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.800> assets<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.820> coat

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
character models and assets and coat

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420 
character models and assets and coat
those<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> depend<00:00:56.190> on

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
those I think it's going to depend on

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
those I think it's going to depend on
how<00:00:56.489> good<00:00:56.670> an<00:00:56.789> artist<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.960> you're

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

engineers<00:03:17.579> have<00:03:17.670> been<00:03:17.700> very<00:03:17.940> supportive<00:03:18.150> of

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
engineers have been very supportive of

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.090 
engineers have been very supportive of
this<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.900> trying<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.440> get<00:03:19.530> these<00:03:19.709> kinds<00:03:20.040> of

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
this of trying to get these kinds of

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.340 
this of trying to get these kinds of
systems<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.609> systems<00:03:20.910> into<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.480> game<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:22.290> you

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
systems and systems into the game so you

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.490 
systems and systems into the game so you
guys<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.739> really<00:03:22.950> make<00:03:23.100> use<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.280> them<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:25.260> what

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
guys can really make use of them in what

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.250 
guys can really make use of them in what
ways<00:03:25.859> will<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.700> hero<00:03:26.970> system<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.660> galaxies

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
ways will the hero system and galaxies

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.020 
ways will the hero system and galaxies
be<00:03:28.410> more<00:03:28.650> flexible<00:03:28.889> than<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.430> was<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.850> will

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
be more flexible than it was and will

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.229 
be more flexible than it was and will
work<00:03:30.359> out<00:03:30.510> free<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.699> question<00:03:32.790> what<00:03:33.090> ways

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
work out free so the question what ways

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.180 
work out free so the question what ways
with<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.449> hero<00:03:33.660> system<00:03:33.989> be<00:03:34.079> more<00:03:34.229> flexible<00:03:34.410> yeah

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
with a hero system be more flexible yeah

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.070 
with a hero system be more flexible yeah
so<00:03:35.730> you'll<00:03:35.940> be<00:03:36.000> able<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.150> recreate<00:03:36.570> anything

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
so you'll be able to recreate anything

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.530 
so you'll be able to recreate anything
you<00:03:37.320> wanted<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.620> do<00:03:37.830> with<00:03:38.250> warcraft<00:03:38.880> 3<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.390> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
you wanted to do with warcraft 3 in the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.180 
you wanted to do with warcraft 3 in the
hero<00:03:39.780> system<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.650> think<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:40.920> can<00:03:41.040> also

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
hero system but I think you can also

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.680 
hero system but I think you can also
create<00:03:41.520> any<00:03:41.760> number<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.090> other<00:03:42.180> heroes<00:03:42.570> our

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
create any number of other heroes our

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.650 
create any number of other heroes our
data<00:03:42.870> editor<00:03:43.020> is<00:03:43.430> extremely<00:03:44.430> powerful

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
data editor is extremely powerful

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.000 
data editor is extremely powerful
everything<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.750> saw<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.110> obelisk<00:03:46.530> was

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
everything you saw in the obelisk was

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.160 
everything you saw in the obelisk was
all<00:03:47.220> created<00:03:47.490> in<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.880> data<00:03:48.060> out<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.210> here<00:03:48.450> our

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
all created in the data out of here our

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.960 
all created in the data out of here our
entire<00:03:49.470> game<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:50.070> screen<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.460> editor

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
entire game the screen of the editor

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.520 
entire game the screen of the editor
everything<00:03:51.360> is<00:03:51.480> coated<00:03:51.660> with<00:03:51.960> the<00:03:52.410> data

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
everything is coated with the data

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.380 
everything is coated with the data
editor<00:03:52.740> so<00:03:53.370> there's<00:03:53.550> nothing<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:54.060> our<00:03:54.180> game

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
editor so there's nothing in our game

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.720 
editor so there's nothing in our game
that<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.110> could<00:03:55.320> not<00:03:55.500> recreate<00:03:55.950> if<00:03:56.520> you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
that you could not recreate if you

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.790 
that you could not recreate if you
wanted<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.090> recreate<00:03:57.420> oh<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:58.020> don't<00:03:58.080> know<00:03:58.350> maybe

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
wanted to recreate oh I don't know maybe

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.280 
wanted to recreate oh I don't know maybe
a<00:03:59.430> little<00:03:59.640> game<00:03:59.850> called<00:03:59.880> brood<00:04:00.330> war<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:01.050> our

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
a little game called brood war in our

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.900 
a little game called brood war in our
game<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:02.070> could<00:04:02.250> absolutely<00:04:02.640> do<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:04.910> was

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
game you could absolutely do that I was

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
game you could absolutely do that I was
a<00:04:05.940> very<00:04:06.720> big<00:04:06.930> fan<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.290> doing<00:04:07.920> missions<00:04:08.490> and

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
a very big fan of doing missions and

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.660 
a very big fan of doing missions and
I've<00:04:09.930> never<00:04:10.170> really<00:04:10.500> had<00:04:10.710> any<00:04:10.890> incentive<00:04:11.520> to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
I've never really had any incentive to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.760 
I've never really had any incentive to
use<00:04:11.820> secondary<00:04:12.450> missions<00:04:12.960> so<00:04:13.560> what<00:04:13.650> are<00:04:13.710> you

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
use secondary missions so what are you

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.920 
use secondary missions so what are you
going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.010> add<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.430> make<00:04:14.610> those<00:04:14.880> more<00:04:15.270> useful

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
going to add to make those more useful

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.820 
going to add to make those more useful
I'm<00:04:18.930> sorry<00:04:19.170> I<00:04:19.200> think<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.410> understand<00:04:19.739> the

I'm sorry I think I understand the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.020 
I'm sorry I think I understand the
question<00:04:19.950> could<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.280> elaborate<00:04:20.700> for<00:04:20.910> us<00:04:20.970> a

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
question could you elaborate for us a

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.510 
question could you elaborate for us a
little<00:04:21.150> bit<00:04:21.269> well<00:04:21.750> warcraft<00:04:22.560> 3<00:04:22.890> ride<00:04:23.190> your

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
little bit well warcraft 3 ride your

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.190 
little bit well warcraft 3 ride your
primary<00:04:24.090> objectives<00:04:24.660> then<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.020> had

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
primary objectives then you had

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.370 
primary objectives then you had
secondary<00:04:25.950> things<00:04:26.250> right<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:27.360> in<00:04:27.660> starcraft

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
secondary things right but in starcraft

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.620 
secondary things right but in starcraft
you<00:04:28.650> didn't<00:04:28.980> really<00:04:29.430> need<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.120> secondary

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
you didn't really need the secondary

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.750 
you didn't really need the secondary
things<00:04:31.020> because<00:04:31.290> your<00:04:31.470> eros<00:04:31.770> couldn't<00:04:32.490> do

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
things because your eros couldn't do

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.000 
things because your eros couldn't do
anything<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.420> we're<00:04:33.930> going<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.200> do<00:04:34.410> make<00:04:34.740> those

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
anything so we're going to do make those

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.670 
anything so we're going to do make those
secondary<00:04:35.670> things<00:04:36.000> more<00:04:36.360> important<00:04:36.870> right<00:04:37.440> so

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
secondary things more important right so

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.650 
secondary things more important right so
in<00:04:37.830> starcraft<00:04:38.370> 2<00:04:38.580> right<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.030> we've<00:04:39.210> got<00:04:39.390> sort

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
in starcraft 2 right like we've got sort

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.330 
in starcraft 2 right like we've got sort
of<00:04:39.750> main<00:04:39.990> objectives<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.590> bonus<00:04:40.860> objectives
