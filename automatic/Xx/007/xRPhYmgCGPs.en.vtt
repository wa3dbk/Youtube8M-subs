00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
but today we're going to be doing a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.799 
but today we're going to be doing a
repotting<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.399> well<00:00:32.610> know

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
repotting because as you well know

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.299 
repotting because as you well know
orchids<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:33.989> grow<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.559> although<00:00:35.070> that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
orchids do grow and although that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.650 
orchids do grow and although that
sometimes<00:00:35.670> they<00:00:35.910> grow<00:00:36.059> slow<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.600> do

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
sometimes they grow slow they do

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.139 
sometimes they grow slow they do
eventually<00:00:36.989> need<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> repotting<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.760> has

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
eventually need a repotting and I has

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.420 
eventually need a repotting and I has
come<00:00:39.420> time<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> repot<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.770> orchid<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.250> so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
come time to repot this orchid here so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760 
come time to repot this orchid here so
we'll<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.610> doing<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> now<00:00:42.690> there<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> few

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
we'll be doing that now there are a few

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.860 
we'll be doing that now there are a few
things<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.219> make<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> growing<00:00:45.480> medium<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
things that make the growing medium a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.180 
things that make the growing medium a
little<00:00:46.050> bit<00:00:46.170> different<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.860> Mastiff

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
little bit different about the Mastiff

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.260 
little bit different about the Mastiff
alias<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.579> we're<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:47.940> through<00:00:48.120> that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
alias so we're going to go through that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
alias so we're going to go through that
and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.129> next

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and then you're going to need the next

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
and then you're going to need the next
up<00:00:50.460> size<00:00:50.640> pot<00:00:51.000> you're<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.780> need<00:00:51.899> just

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
up size pot you're going to need just

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.830 
up size pot you're going to need just
some<00:00:52.289> trays<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:53.010> find<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.340> pretty<00:00:53.399> easy<00:00:53.840> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
some trays I find it's pretty easy to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.670 
some trays I find it's pretty easy to
repot<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.379> orchid<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.840> basically<00:00:57.840> leave<00:00:58.379> some

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
repot an orchid to basically leave some

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
repot an orchid to basically leave some
of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> old<00:00:59.070> growing<00:00:59.370> medium<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.690> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
of the old growing medium in a in a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.479 
of the old growing medium in a in a
separate<00:01:01.199> container<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.010> way<00:01:02.100> doesn't<00:01:02.370> get

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
separate container that way doesn't get

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.740 
separate container that way doesn't get
mixed<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> new<00:01:03.239> growing<00:01:03.449> medium

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
mixed up with the new growing medium

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.039 
mixed up with the new growing medium
because<00:01:04.379> you'll<00:01:05.159> find<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.640> especially<00:01:06.450> with

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
because you'll find that especially with

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
because you'll find that especially with
swamp<00:01:07.350> orchids<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> master<00:01:08.340> Bailey<00:01:08.580> being<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
swamp orchids the master Bailey being a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
swamp orchids the master Bailey being a
swamp<00:01:09.119> orchid<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.170> also<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.830> your<00:01:10.950> Peppa

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
swamp orchid and also some of your Peppa

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.609 
swamp orchid and also some of your Peppa
Pig<00:01:11.400> Liam's<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.630> stuff<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.140> you're

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
Pig Liam's and stuff like that you're

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
Pig Liam's and stuff like that you're
going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> find<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.330> growing<00:01:15.540> medium

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
going to find that the growing medium

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.420 
going to find that the growing medium
really<00:01:16.290> rots<00:01:16.560> down<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
really rots down because they like to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.590 
really rots down because they like to
stay<00:01:17.580> wetter<00:01:18.229> wetter<00:01:19.229> than<00:01:19.530> most<00:01:19.770> orchids<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
stay wetter wetter than most orchids and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.859 
stay wetter wetter than most orchids and
basically<00:01:22.340> that's<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.820> lead<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.420> lot

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
basically that's going to lead to a lot

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
basically that's going to lead to a lot
more<00:01:24.900> rotting<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> growing<00:01:26.490> medium<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
more rotting of the growing medium and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.270 
more rotting of the growing medium and
you<00:01:27.000> want<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.750> rid<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you want to get rid of that because the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.620 
you want to get rid of that because the
last<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.759> want<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.450> turn

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
last thing you want is for it to turn

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
last thing you want is for it to turn
completely<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.409> soil<00:01:31.890> because<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.549> begin

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
completely to soil because it will begin

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.450 
completely to soil because it will begin
to<00:01:32.909> decompose<00:01:33.450> over<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.259> years<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.280> what

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to decompose over the years and so what

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.999 
to decompose over the years and so what
you<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:37.079> rid<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.409> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you want to do is to get rid of that so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.100 
you want to do is to get rid of that so
that's<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.490> first<00:01:38.729> step<00:01:38.970> once<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that's the first step once we get this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.420 
that's the first step once we get this
all<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:40.740> why<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> find<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.280> nice

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
all out so that's why I find it's nice

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
all out so that's why I find it's nice
to<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.670> two<00:01:41.880> trays<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.600> keep<00:01:42.899> them

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to have two trays so you can keep them

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
to have two trays so you can keep them
separate<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.430> another<00:01:44.640> thing<00:01:44.729> you're<00:01:45.000> going

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
separate now another thing you're going

bit of Spagna moss and a little bit of
our<00:01:51.720> regular<00:01:52.619> orchid<00:01:53.549> mix<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.149> has

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
our regular orchid mix here that has

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.819 
our regular orchid mix here that has
just<00:01:54.509> some<00:01:54.659> vermiculite<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.170> perlite<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
just some vermiculite and perlite in it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
just some vermiculite and perlite in it
for<00:01:56.100> drainage<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> also<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
for drainage but then you also want the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.990 
for drainage but then you also want the
water<00:01:57.990> holding<00:01:58.380> capabilities<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.610> Spagna

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
water holding capabilities of the Spagna

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.240 
water holding capabilities of the Spagna
moss<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.570> again<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.409> swamp

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
moss because again they are swamp

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.100 
moss because again they are swamp
orchids<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.479> damp<00:02:03.750> they

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
orchids so you do like it damp they

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.510 
orchids so you do like it damp they
don't<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> soaking<00:02:04.979> wet<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.159> dripping

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
don't like it soaking wet and dripping

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.180 
don't like it soaking wet and dripping
that's<00:02:06.270> why<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.659> add<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> 50/50<00:02:07.590> mix<00:02:07.829> because

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that's why we add a 50/50 mix because

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.520 
that's why we add a 50/50 mix because
it's<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.849> hold<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:10.080> water<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it's going to hold on some water and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.800 
it's going to hold on some water and
allow<00:02:10.920> some<00:02:11.190> water<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.610> drain<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.629> what

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
allow some water to drain so that's what

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
allow some water to drain so that's what
we<00:02:12.900> find<00:02:13.020> works<00:02:13.290> really<00:02:13.500> well

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
we find works really well

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.860 
we find works really well
so<00:02:14.280> come<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.610> close<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.090> check<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.510> out

so come on in close and check this out
all<00:02:15.930> right<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.310> secrets<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
all right so one of the secrets to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.670 
all right so one of the secrets to
repotting<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:20.300> number<00:02:21.300> one<00:02:21.450> always<00:02:22.110> make<00:02:22.470> sure

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
repotting is number one always make sure

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.800 
repotting is number one always make sure
you<00:02:22.830> keep<00:02:23.040> your<00:02:23.220> tag<00:02:23.490> separate<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.690> don't

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
you keep your tag separate you don't

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.790 
you keep your tag separate you don't
want<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.990> lose<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.770> lose

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
want to lose that because then you lose

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.050 
want to lose that because then you lose
the<00:02:25.950> name<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> orchid<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.790> you'll<00:02:26.970> never

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the name of the orchid and you'll never

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.010 
the name of the orchid and you'll never
know<00:02:27.240> what<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.570> again

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
know what it is again

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.770 
know what it is again
now<00:02:28.560> another<00:02:28.950> secret<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.760> repotting<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.450> like

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
now another secret to repotting is like

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.640 
now another secret to repotting is like
we<00:02:30.870> always<00:02:31.080> talk<00:02:31.230> about

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
we always talk about

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.350 
we always talk about
don't<00:02:32.040> take<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.370> pot<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.760> try<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.970> yank<00:02:33.210> it

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
don't take the pot and try to yank it

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.570 
don't take the pot and try to yank it
off<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:34.410> will<00:02:34.620> end<00:02:34.830> up<00:02:34.950> ruining<00:02:35.220> roots

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
off just will end up ruining roots

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.000 
off just will end up ruining roots
you'll<00:02:36.240> have<00:02:36.390> roots<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.110> get<00:02:37.320> torn<00:02:37.710> and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
you'll have roots that get torn and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.210 
you'll have roots that get torn and
you'll<00:02:38.310> also<00:02:38.520> have<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:40.350> some<00:02:40.590> stress<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
you'll also have just some stress on the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.010 
you'll also have just some stress on the
plant<00:02:41.340> that's<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:41.910> not<00:02:42.030> needed<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.870> what

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
plant that's really not needed so what

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.230 
plant that's really not needed so what
we<00:02:43.110> find<00:02:43.320> we<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.460> take<00:02:44.670> some<00:02:44.940> of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
we find we like to do is take some of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.350 
we find we like to do is take some of
these<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:46.140> heavy-duty<00:02:46.970> pruners<00:02:47.970> here<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
these just heavy-duty pruners here and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.120 
these just heavy-duty pruners here and
just<00:02:48.960> prune<00:02:49.350> down<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:52.200> edge<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.650> pot<00:02:52.890> on

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
just prune down the edge of the pot on

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.600 
just prune down the edge of the pot on
both<00:02:53.310> sides<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:54.390> way<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.070> sacrifice

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
both sides that way you can sacrifice

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.090 
both sides that way you can sacrifice
the<00:02:56.850> pot<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.330> not<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.600> roots<00:02:57.840> also<00:02:58.710> another

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
the pot and not the roots also another

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.620 
the pot and not the roots also another
thing<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.400> we<00:02:59.490> find<00:02:59.610> really<00:02:59.850> handy<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:00.420> these

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
thing that we find really handy is these

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.900 
thing that we find really handy is these
pruners<00:03:01.080> here<00:03:01.290> specifically<00:03:01.770> they<00:03:02.400> actually

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
pruners here specifically they actually

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.030 
pruners here specifically they actually
are<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.210> double<00:03:03.720> bladed<00:03:03.990> oftentimes<00:03:04.830> you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
are not double bladed oftentimes you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.900 
are not double bladed oftentimes you
find<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:07.140> pruners<00:03:07.770> have<00:03:08.130> two<00:03:08.520> blades

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
find that the pruners have two blades

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.160 
find that the pruners have two blades
and<00:03:09.210> they<00:03:09.330> basically<00:03:09.510> come<00:03:09.780> together<00:03:09.900> like

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
and they basically come together like

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.440 
and they basically come together like
scissors<00:03:10.620> these<00:03:11.250> actually<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.940> one<00:03:12.180> blade

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
scissors these actually have one blade

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.650 
scissors these actually have one blade
and<00:03:12.680> kind<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:13.920> guide<00:03:14.670> here<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.210> rounded

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
and kind of a guide here this rounded

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.990 
and kind of a guide here this rounded
guide<00:03:15.870> make<00:03:16.440> sure<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.740> find<00:03:16.980> these<00:03:17.340> pruners

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
guide make sure to find these pruners

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.090 
guide make sure to find these pruners
because<00:03:18.930> these<00:03:19.110> pruners<00:03:19.590> here<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.950> can

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
because these pruners here you can

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.440 
because these pruners here you can
actually<00:03:20.250> stick<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.880> guide<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.470> pot<00:03:22.709> and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
actually stick the guide in the pot and

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.960 
actually stick the guide in the pot and
and<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:25.920> way<00:03:26.070> you're<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:26.340> cutting<00:03:26.790> any

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
and that way you're not cutting any

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.640 
and that way you're not cutting any
roots<00:03:27.950> when<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.040> go<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.250> cut<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.580> pot<00:03:30.650> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
roots when you go to cut the pot and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.960 
roots when you go to cut the pot and
we're<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:31.800> gonna<00:03:31.950> cut<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.280> down<00:03:32.520> here<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
we're just gonna cut this down here and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.400 
we're just gonna cut this down here and
then<00:03:33.510> all<00:03:33.660> we're<00:03:33.810> going<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.989> do<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.260> just

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
then all we're going to do is just

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.920 
then all we're going to do is just
butterfly<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:34.980> open<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.940> should<00:03:36.209> pop<00:03:36.720> down

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
butterfly it open this should pop down

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.620 
butterfly it open this should pop down
like<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.650> now<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.400> have<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.209> plant

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
like that and now you have the plant

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.330 
like that and now you have the plant
exposed<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.440> can<00:03:40.560> actually<00:03:40.709> just<00:03:41.100> peel

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
exposed and you can actually just peel

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.130 
exposed and you can actually just peel
the<00:03:41.459> pot<00:03:41.640> away<00:03:41.880> without<00:03:42.510> doing<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.930> whole<00:03:43.110> lot

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
the pot away without doing a whole lot

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.470 
the pot away without doing a whole lot
of<00:03:43.320> damage<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> roots<00:03:44.550> as<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.970> can<00:03:45.060> see<00:03:45.209> no

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
of damage to the roots as you can see no

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.870 
of damage to the roots as you can see no
damage<00:03:45.660> at<00:03:45.900> all<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:47.370> what<00:03:47.459> we're<00:03:47.550> going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.730> do

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
damage at all so what we're going to do

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.510 
damage at all so what we're going to do
is<00:03:48.060> we're<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.570> going<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:48.989> kind<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.920> work<00:03:50.340> this

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
is we're just going to kind of work this

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.650 
is we're just going to kind of work this
growing<00:03:50.850> medium<00:03:51.150> out<00:03:51.239> because<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.630> has

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
growing medium out because it has

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.470 
growing medium out because it has
definitely<00:03:52.200> begun<00:03:52.560> broken<00:03:52.950> breaking<00:03:53.730> down

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:14.729 

we're<00:03:57.480> gonna<00:03:57.630> work<00:03:57.750> some<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.110> away

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.650 

and<00:04:14.950> it's<00:04:15.370> not<00:04:15.519> really<00:04:15.879> critical<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.329> get<00:04:16.419> all

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
and it's not really critical to get all

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.199 
and it's not really critical to get all
of<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.900> because<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.639> growing<00:04:18.880> medium

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
of it because the the growing medium

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.689 
of it because the the growing medium
that<00:04:19.750> we<00:04:19.900> have<00:04:19.930> these<00:04:20.320> in<00:04:20.560> has<00:04:21.310> broken<00:04:21.549> down

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
that we have these in has broken down

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.420 
that we have these in has broken down
significantly<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:23.440> they<00:04:23.560> are<00:04:23.740> swamp<00:04:24.070> orchids

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
significantly but they are swamp orchids

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.360 
significantly but they are swamp orchids
so<00:04:24.789> they're<00:04:25.300> not<00:04:25.449> used<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.930> being<00:04:26.229> put<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:26.830> you

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
so they're not used to being put in you

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.969 
so they're not used to being put in you
know<00:04:27.400> perfectly<00:04:28.030> perfectly<00:04:28.990> fresh<00:04:29.440> new

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
know perfectly perfectly fresh new

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.040 
know perfectly perfectly fresh new
growing<00:04:30.310> medium<00:04:30.669> you<00:04:31.509> know<00:04:31.539> as<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:31.840> can<00:04:31.870> see

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
growing medium you know as you can see

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.890 
growing medium you know as you can see
this<00:04:32.169> is<00:04:32.320> pretty<00:04:32.710> well<00:04:32.889> broken<00:04:33.250> down<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.900> so

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
this is pretty well broken down and so

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.020 
this is pretty well broken down and so
if<00:04:34.990> we<00:04:35.199> take<00:04:35.650> out<00:04:35.830> some<00:04:36.130> of<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.340> it's<00:04:36.759> still

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
if we take out some of it it's still

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.219 
if we take out some of it it's still
going<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.330> hold<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.690> lot<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:37.960> that<00:04:38.050> moisture

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
going to hold a lot of that moisture

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.080 
going to hold a lot of that moisture
which<00:04:38.710> it's<00:04:38.919> used<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:39.550> it's<00:04:39.669> not<00:04:39.729> going<00:04:40.000> to

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
which it's used to so it's not going to

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.180 
which it's used to so it's not going to
be<00:04:40.180> nearly<00:04:40.660> as<00:04:40.810> crucial<00:04:41.139> as<00:04:41.440> they'd<00:04:41.949> like<00:04:41.979> a

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
be nearly as crucial as they'd like a

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.150 
be nearly as crucial as they'd like a
cataleya<00:04:42.910> or<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.449> Phalaenopsis<00:04:44.289> that<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:44.949> want

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
cataleya or a Phalaenopsis that you want

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.850 
cataleya or a Phalaenopsis that you want
to<00:04:45.250> make<00:04:45.520> sure<00:04:45.639> you<00:04:45.759> get<00:04:45.910> all<00:04:46.120> of<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:47.169> growing

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
to make sure you get all of the growing

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.770 
to make sure you get all of the growing
medium<00:04:48.160> out<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:48.520> we've<00:04:48.940> gotten<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.300> decent

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
medium out so we've gotten a decent

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.140 
medium out so we've gotten a decent
portion<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.380> it<00:04:50.470> out<00:04:51.009> and<00:04:51.280> then<00:04:51.789> next<00:04:51.940> we're

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
portion of it out and then next we're

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.529 
portion of it out and then next we're
going<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.330> do<00:04:52.479> is<00:04:52.630> take<00:04:52.900> our<00:04:53.110> our<00:04:53.590> pot<00:04:53.919> and

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
going to do is take our our pot and

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.490 
going to do is take our our pot and
about<00:04:55.539> a<00:04:55.570> like<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:55.930> said<00:04:56.080> about<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.259> 50/50<00:04:56.800> mix<00:04:57.039> of

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
about a like I said about a 50/50 mix of

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.310 
about a like I said about a 50/50 mix of
of<00:04:59.500> our<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.880> our<00:05:01.210> Spagna<00:05:01.840> moss<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.199> our

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
of our of our Spagna moss and our

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.270 
of our of our Spagna moss and our
regular<00:05:02.620> grain<00:05:02.860> mix<00:05:03.460> here<00:05:04.320> then<00:05:05.320> what<00:05:06.160> we're

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
regular grain mix here then what we're

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.029 
regular grain mix here then what we're
going<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.490> do<00:05:06.639> is<00:05:06.910> just<00:05:07.479> make<00:05:08.229> sure<00:05:08.259> to<00:05:08.620> stick

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
going to do is just make sure to stick

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.520 
going to do is just make sure to stick
this<00:05:09.280> end<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:10.090> don't<00:05:10.210> want<00:05:10.599> another<00:05:11.020> tip<00:05:11.289> here

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
this end you don't want another tip here

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.379 
this end you don't want another tip here
is<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:11.919> don't<00:05:12.070> want<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.250> go<00:05:12.340> up<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.759> pot<00:05:12.970> too

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
is you don't want to go up a pot too

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.300 
is you don't want to go up a pot too
large

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
large

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.990 
large
here's<00:05:15.310> another<00:05:15.460> pot<00:05:15.849> here<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.870> I<00:05:16.960> can<00:05:17.139> grab

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
here's another pot here that I can grab

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.779 
here's another pot here that I can grab
this<00:05:19.000> would<00:05:19.479> not<00:05:19.599> be<00:05:19.659> a<00:05:20.110> good<00:05:20.380> choice<00:05:20.710> this<00:05:21.460> pot

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
this would not be a good choice this pot

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.149 
this would not be a good choice this pot
is<00:05:21.970> too<00:05:22.000> large<00:05:22.870> too<00:05:23.320> much<00:05:23.530> whoopsie

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
is too large too much whoopsie

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:29.100 
is too large too much whoopsie
too<00:05:24.520> much<00:05:24.789> space<00:05:26.699> too<00:05:27.699> much<00:05:27.849> free<00:05:28.060> space<00:05:28.210> far

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
too much space too much free space far

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.899 
too much space too much free space far
too<00:05:29.260> much<00:05:29.380> as<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:30.039> can<00:05:30.130> see<00:05:30.250> it's<00:05:30.460> like<00:05:30.610> double

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
too much as you can see it's like double

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.219 
too much as you can see it's like double
the<00:05:30.940> size<00:05:32.070> it's<00:05:33.070> about<00:05:33.430> 20%<00:05:33.880> higher<00:05:34.229> 25%

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
the size it's about 20% higher 25%

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.430 
the size it's about 20% higher 25%
higher<00:05:35.380> so<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:36.370> have<00:05:36.880> a<00:05:37.120> lot<00:05:37.690> more<00:05:37.900> volume<00:05:38.139> in

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
higher so you have a lot more volume in

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.129 
higher so you have a lot more volume in
this<00:05:38.560> just<00:05:38.919> too<00:05:39.250> much<00:05:39.460> too<00:05:40.240> much<00:05:40.419> and<00:05:40.690> it's<00:05:41.080> a

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
this just too much too much and it's a

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.379 
this just too much too much and it's a
little<00:05:41.289> overkill<00:05:41.800> for<00:05:41.860> now<00:05:42.099> orchids<00:05:42.970> you<00:05:43.210> want

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
little overkill for now orchids you want

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.300 
little overkill for now orchids you want
to<00:05:43.479> be<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:44.110> little<00:05:44.530> more<00:05:44.710> on<00:05:44.919> the<00:05:45.190> safe<00:05:45.550> side<00:05:46.259> and

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
to be a little more on the safe side and

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.050 
to be a little more on the safe side and
and<00:05:49.530> risk<00:05:50.530> being<00:05:50.770> pot<00:05:51.070> bound<00:05:51.250> because<00:05:51.970> the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
and risk being pot bound because the

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.180 
and risk being pot bound because the
orchids<00:05:52.360> do<00:05:52.570> like<00:05:52.780> being<00:05:53.050> pot<00:05:53.320> bound<00:05:53.500> more

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
orchids do like being pot bound more

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.550 
orchids do like being pot bound more
than<00:05:54.400> they<00:05:54.490> like<00:05:54.810> having<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.870> ton<00:05:56.050> of<00:05:56.080> open

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
than they like having a ton of open

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.649 
than they like having a ton of open
space<00:05:56.860> so<00:05:57.099> now<00:05:57.310> all<00:05:57.580> we're<00:05:57.759> going<00:05:57.880> to<00:05:57.940> do<00:05:58.090> is

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
space so now all we're going to do is

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.839 
space so now all we're going to do is
just<00:05:58.870> take<00:05:59.080> this<00:05:59.320> extra<00:06:00.509> Spang<00:06:01.509> the<00:06:01.659> moss<00:06:01.930> and

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
just take this extra Spang the moss and

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.969 
just take this extra Spang the moss and
stuff<00:06:03.849> this<00:06:04.659> mix<00:06:04.960> here<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.320> we're<00:06:05.680> just<00:06:05.710> going

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
stuff this mix here and we're just going

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.909 
stuff this mix here and we're just going
to<00:06:06.009> cram<00:06:06.340> it<00:06:06.490> down<00:06:06.639> in<00:06:06.940> the<00:06:07.599> free<00:06:08.320> spaces

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
to cram it down in the free spaces

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.159 
to cram it down in the free spaces
around<00:06:09.370> the<00:06:09.699> edge<00:06:09.849> of<00:06:10.000> the<00:06:10.060> pot<00:06:10.270> again<00:06:10.750> just

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
around the edge of the pot again just

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.399 
around the edge of the pot again just
make<00:06:11.320> making<00:06:12.009> sure<00:06:12.250> that<00:06:12.729> you<00:06:13.169> cram<00:06:14.169> it<00:06:14.289> in

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
make making sure that you cram it in

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.830 
make making sure that you cram it in
there<00:06:14.440> because<00:06:14.710> orchids<00:06:15.340> again<00:06:16.240> don't<00:06:16.659> like

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
there because orchids again don't like

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.020 
there because orchids again don't like
all<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.169> loose<00:06:17.349> air<00:06:17.650> gaps<00:06:17.979> air<00:06:18.310> gaps<00:06:18.610> are<00:06:18.820> not

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
all the loose air gaps air gaps are not

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.870 
all the loose air gaps air gaps are not
good<00:06:19.300> especially<00:06:19.659> for<00:06:19.960> orchids<00:06:20.409> that<00:06:20.590> like<00:06:21.220> to

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
good especially for orchids that like to

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.860 
good especially for orchids that like to
have<00:06:22.090> their<00:06:22.449> their<00:06:22.779> roots<00:06:23.080> damp
