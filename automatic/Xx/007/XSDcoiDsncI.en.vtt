00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
it which is going to help follow the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.310 
it which is going to help follow the
hands<00:01:15.549> natural<00:01:16.060> movement<00:01:16.450> but<00:01:16.990> by<00:01:17.110> putting

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
the plastic inserts in the center it

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.609 
the plastic inserts in the center it
made<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.600> little<00:01:19.960> bit<00:01:20.140> more<00:01:20.259> comfortable

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
made it a little bit more comfortable

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.529 
made it a little bit more comfortable
easy<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.100> move<00:01:21.219> but<00:01:21.670> then<00:01:21.789> it<00:01:21.880> also<00:01:22.060> made<00:01:22.509> the

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
easy to move but then it also made the

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.240 
easy to move but then it also made the
durability<00:01:23.110> last<00:01:23.439> bit<00:01:23.710> longer<00:01:23.860> because<00:01:24.009> that

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
durability last bit longer because that

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.340 
durability last bit longer because that
plastic<00:01:24.820> wasn't<00:01:25.090> on<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.270> X<00:01:25.420> outside<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
plastic wasn't on the X outside the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.170 
plastic wasn't on the X outside the
materials<00:01:26.799> wearing<00:01:27.100> on<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.250> nylon<00:01:27.640> it's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
materials wearing on the nylon it's

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
materials wearing on the nylon it's
that's<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.360> nice<00:01:28.509> little<00:01:28.750> feature<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:29.170> they

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
that's a nice little feature that they

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.139 
that's a nice little feature that they
added<00:01:29.289> on<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.799> glove<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.280> then<00:01:30.610> also<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
added on the glove and then also the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.639 
added on the glove and then also the
palm<00:01:31.360> on<00:01:31.570> it<00:01:31.689> they<00:01:31.990> went<00:01:32.170> ahead<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:32.409> kept<00:01:32.560> the

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
palm on it they went ahead and kept the

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.740 
palm on it they went ahead and kept the
very<00:01:32.890> traditional<00:01:33.430> glove<00:01:33.729> or<00:01:34.000> palm<00:01:34.240> on<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.600> so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
very traditional glove or palm on it so

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.599 
very traditional glove or palm on it so
it's<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:34.990> nice<00:01:35.109> higher<00:01:35.380> grade<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.920> leather

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
it's a nice higher grade of leather

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.670 
it's a nice higher grade of leather
which<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.479> pros<00:01:37.689> we're<00:01:37.840> asking<00:01:38.170> for<00:01:38.350> but<00:01:38.530> also

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
which the pros we're asking for but also

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.109 
which the pros we're asking for but also
since<00:01:39.039> it's<00:01:39.219> a<00:01:39.280> nice<00:01:39.460> high-grade<00:01:40.090> leather

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
since it's a nice high-grade leather

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.389 
since it's a nice high-grade leather
they<00:01:40.899> were<00:01:40.960> able<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.380> actually<00:01:41.500> use<00:01:42.039> thinner

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
they were able to actually use thinner

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.940 
they were able to actually use thinner
materials<00:01:43.000> so<00:01:43.119> it's<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.420> very<00:01:43.770> thinner<00:01:44.770> design

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
materials so it's a very thinner design

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.649 
materials so it's a very thinner design
to<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.399> but<00:01:45.549> they're<00:01:45.850> able<00:01:45.969> to<00:01:46.179> keep<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.479> same

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
to it but they're able to keep the same

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.050 
to it but they're able to keep the same
great<00:01:46.899> level<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.469> durability<00:01:47.950> out<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.429> it<00:01:48.520> so

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
great level of durability out of it so

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.279 
great level of durability out of it so
with<00:01:49.149> that<00:01:49.240> thinner<00:01:49.539> design<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.140> get<00:01:50.259> a

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
with that thinner design you get a

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.870 
with that thinner design you get a
little<00:01:50.530> bit<00:01:50.619> better<00:01:50.799> of<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:51.070> stick<00:01:51.399> feel<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.850> it

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
little bit better of a stick feel to it

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.789 
little bit better of a stick feel to it
a<00:01:52.149> little<00:01:52.479> more<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> responsive<00:01:53.439> grip<00:01:53.649> on

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
a little more of a responsive grip on

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.830 
a little more of a responsive grip on
the<00:01:53.920> stick<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:54.219> well<00:01:54.429> and<00:01:55.149> then<00:01:55.270> going<00:01:55.420> on<00:01:55.630> from

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the stick as well and then going on from

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.510 
the stick as well and then going on from
there<00:01:56.049> I'm<00:01:56.200> taking<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.799> look<00:01:56.950> at<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.130> liner<00:01:57.369> on
