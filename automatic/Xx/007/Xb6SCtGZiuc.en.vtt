like<00:01:20.240> seven<00:01:20.660> years<00:01:20.690> old<00:01:21.020> maybe<00:01:21.500> younger<00:01:21.830> this

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
like seven years old maybe younger this

bed<00:01:22.880> used<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.990> be<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> bunk<00:01:24.590> bed<00:01:24.710> but<00:01:25.220> then<00:01:25.430> I

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
bed used to be a bunk bed but then I

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.790 
bed used to be a bunk bed but then I
became<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.180> little<00:01:26.360> too<00:01:26.630> old<00:01:26.810> for<00:01:26.960> them<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:27.710> he

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
became a little too old for them so he

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.620 
became a little too old for them so he
just<00:01:27.950> took<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.460> top<00:01:28.670> thing<00:01:28.940> off<00:01:29.090> which<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.479> why

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
just took the top thing off which is why

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.350 
just took the top thing off which is why
it<00:01:30.050> stops<00:01:30.649> right<00:01:31.100> here<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.970> headboard

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
it stops right here the headboard

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.540 
it stops right here the headboard
doesn't<00:01:32.720> go<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.170> ends<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.590> bed<00:01:33.800> which

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
doesn't go to the ends of the bed which

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.880 
doesn't go to the ends of the bed which
is<00:01:34.580> really<00:01:35.060> weird<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.690> awkward<00:01:35.990> I<00:01:36.500> don't

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890
