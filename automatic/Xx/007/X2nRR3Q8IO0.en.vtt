00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone welcome the cds 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.270
 welcome to a new video welcome 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.670
 to a new quick guide of champions in 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.260
 which we are going to try the basic build 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.660
 from yasuo you already know that in the video 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.150
 Yesterday I asked what champion you wanted 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.100
 we started from scratch in mid line to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.859
 learn to play it and such in maine from 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.720
 the beta and it was chosen already its so 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.910
 we are going to give cane in enough of 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.130
 episodes to yasuo until I do not 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.189
 get to use well and well you can 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.660
 learn from it so in this 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.420
 episode we're going to talk about the build 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.760
 basic of this champion let's try to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
 the initial objects to start the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.510
 initial objects life potion and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.149
 long sword is the start pretty 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 recommended then the guardian totem 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.170
 obviously but we can also choose 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.899
 for other items such as the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.239
 they gild the doran sword or the shield of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.280
 Oran there are also other beginnings 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.800
 like boots with boots too 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.360
 could go well for that extra of 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.670
 mobility or with the fabric armor yes 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.680
 we touch one of pretty strong online 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.049
 that usually happens also when we play 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 there is at its top but we are going to 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.490
 focus on playing it in mid 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.070
 in the game we have to have the dagger of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.440
 static and a vampiric scepter the items 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.510
 main jazzuv or scepter 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.480
 vampiric because it will give us that theft of 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.850
 life that added to the critic of yasuo us 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.260
 It gives enough sustain online and good 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.840
 for the static dagger that we know 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.220
 we can start with the fervor or the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.890
 avaricious sword and he's going to give us that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.740
 extra of critic plus the bourges that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.390
 characterizes this object as soon as 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.820
 boots we can catch the boots 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 speed at the start these and then the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.150
 we can overcome alan boots 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.009
 mercurio pod up video ninja or grebas 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.900
 to see that you have that I recommend more 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.660
 are the mercury boots because about 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.270
 all in mid tend to touch many magicians 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.700
 his characters that use the damage 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.220
 magical and the mercury boots will go very 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.800
 well in addition it reduces the duration of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.050
 the most disabling effects 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.450
 basically gives you tenacity not you 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.220
 they study so much xavi of ninja they are also 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.530
 a good option if we face 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.380
 against a full team if we play 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.270
 top against a pretty strong top 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.180
 it would come to be river would become a 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.579
 set for example in mid too 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.680
 would come to be these two boots the most 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.209
 optimal creams to be seen that are not 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.000
 the most appropriate so do not 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.409
 I recommend that you do and take care 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.540
 because I'm inactive 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.060
 to see if they are going to throw me out of the game and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.159
 we can not continue with the build objects 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.920
 of stealing life and your need theft 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.019
 of life to stay online for 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.030
 stay in duels and leave 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.760
 victorious that we can choose the sheet 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.769
 of the king will give us that slow with the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.920
 water saber is more that speed of 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.650
 attack more damage against tanks that 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.239
 weapon in life so it's fine but 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.639
 there are also people who are more supportive 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.900
 of the bloodthirsty because it gives us that theft 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:57.299
 of extra life gives us 20% of the theft of 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.060
 life gives us a lot more damage 80 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.760
 compared to 25 and he gives us a shield 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.650
 which is a passive that heals you and good 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.180
 we all know how the shield of the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.519
 bloodthirsty does not need to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.079
 Let's talk about offensive objects right now 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.730
 we already know his is a character that 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.650
 he has to be vile on the offensive side 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.359
 for it infinite file 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.919
 primary object who makes us cold 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.880
 infinity with ya subo is that it is a park 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.280
 the no 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.150
 has more infinite edge equal to yasuo 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.110
 critical and harm to mansalva then we have 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.930
 the last words for s 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.000
 you read james when the tanks have 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.370
 that penetrate the armor as the damage 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.500
 physical of the last words plus the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.170
 passive of the last words we 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.170
 will come from the jaws of death more 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.360
 dead is a more offensive offensive item 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.510
 defensive but that suits us the same or 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.820
 better than the rest and is a very good 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.680
 option against full ap compositions 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.930
 against compositions in which the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.490
 enemy is federated that pe o with 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.770
 positions with a lot of bulls like 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.770
 example an an and I could spell you 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.020
 in nothing or a leblanc the jaws of 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.030
 Marble guys will help a lot the 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.650
 dancers for when that reaches that late 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.810
 since it gives us many better 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.360
 statistics that the dagger of static us 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.660
 gives 50% attack speed and 35% 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.669
 critical when the static gives us only 40 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.799
 of speed and 20 of critical this in the 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.500
 late you can change the static by the 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.780
 dancer and so panchos is what 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.000
 I recommend myself as objects 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.490
 defensive we can 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.870
 by the omen of rand wing if they have 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.580
 a lot of physical damage they have there 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.800
 fedeled keylin then we opted for the run 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.420
 wing gives us life gives us armor and we 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.180
 It gives a lot of sustenance and also gives us a 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.280
 slow extra the truth to death 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.400
 for the same thing but if there is a champion 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.430
 federated ap to avoid the stunt of 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.050
 annie for example to avoid the fear of 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.240
 fidel sticks to help a lot of 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.770
 things and gives us magic resistance 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.430
 and life for which it is a very good item 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.760
 the layer the layer of fire is paka paka 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.590
 for the same as random but good we 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.540
 gives different things also gives us a 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.310
 little bit more offensive but I 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.330
 always chose the ranking when I have 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.490
 to play there when I've seen 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.160
 professionals play it always opt for 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.669
 this omen of Randin because it gives you 500 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.210
 of life and 70 armor and this 450 and 45 of 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.550
 armor for 250 more gold so it's worth 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.230
 quite worthwhile to be big 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.560
 spiritual time is also very good 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.180
 He gives us that extra healing 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.890
 I'm going to move it a little bit gives us that 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.230
 extra healing gives us reduction 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.450
 cool down which one is very good 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.580
 but you usually see more the veil of the of 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.950
 death and both are good I'm not going to 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.020
 say no but the one that the item 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.300
 defensive in excellence that I believe 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.810
 which is better is the guardian angel because 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.910
 it revives you is that you rbs make you the 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.100
 focus sales you heal there are a lot 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.960
 et cetera etcetera we already know the angel of 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.580
 the guard is a very very good item and it is 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.990
 which I recommend here we have the 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.880
 example of the final wii boots 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.160
 mercury dagger of static if infinity 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.980
 King's sheet last words and angel of 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.380
 keep it as I always say a build is 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.870
 an example you do not have to always do 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.880
 is build the bits are varying according to 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.790
 the game and wilder is going to give us 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.500
 lots of games for example if 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.540
 there would be a pc given on this computer 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.560
 would change guardian angel for the best 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.810
 a bad martius or I would change something here 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.180
 or more offensive for one more bit 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.340
 but good is what you have to learn 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.910
 playing and playing you learn you do not have 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.680
 more I hope that the series you like to 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.230
 you because soon we're going to see the 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.639
 first episode you should make up with 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.280
 yasuo because the first game with 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:43.139
 yasuo you will see that it will be a failure 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.980
 I've played it but I'm already including it 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:49.710
 you can already see the multiple face 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.780
 that I will do so we will see soon with 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.850
 this champion let's hope to learn it to 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.750
 play and see you until next time 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.490
 power 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.760
