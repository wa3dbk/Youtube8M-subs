you'll see that my team is pushing up to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.260 
you'll see that my team is pushing up to
where<00:01:34.979> their<00:01:35.130> spawn<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
where their spawn is so now all of a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.550 
where their spawn is so now all of a
sudden<00:01:36.509> they're<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> flip<00:01:37.020> behind<00:01:37.350> us

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
sudden they're going to flip behind us

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.870 
sudden they're going to flip behind us
and<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:38.340> something<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.759> very

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and that's something that's very

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.550 
and that's something that's very
important<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:39.600> Kill<00:01:40.020> Confirmed<00:01:40.049> has

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
important because Kill Confirmed has

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.870 
important because Kill Confirmed has
very<00:01:40.829> predefined<00:01:43.100> spawns<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.310> guess<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.729> could

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
very predefined spawns I guess you could

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.260 
very predefined spawns I guess you could
say<00:01:45.350> versus<00:01:46.350> domination<00:01:46.920> where<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.149> be

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
say versus domination where they can be

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.639 
say versus domination where they can be
a<00:01:48.299> little<00:01:48.360> bit<00:01:48.659> more<00:01:48.869> sporadic<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.350> know<00:01:49.470> Kill

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
mountain warfare 3 in general doesn't

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.940 
mountain warfare 3 in general doesn't
have<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> best<00:01:54.000> bonds<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.920> Kill<00:01:55.920> Confirmed

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
have the best bonds but Kill Confirmed

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.870 
have the best bonds but Kill Confirmed
has<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:56.909> predefined<00:01:57.750> spawns<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.880> on

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
has more predefined spawns and on

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.380 
has more predefined spawns and on
mission<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.990> are<00:02:01.200> very<00:02:01.740> very<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.640> easy<00:02:03.090> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
mission they are very very very easy to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
mission they are very very very easy to
dictate<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.960> probably<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
dictate this is probably one of the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.580 
dictate this is probably one of the
easiest<00:02:05.070> maps<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.119> get<00:02:06.420> map<00:02:06.689> control<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
easiest maps to get map control on and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.219 
easiest maps to get map control on and
the<00:02:08.459> reason<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.660> when<00:02:10.140> you

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the reason for that is because when you

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.800 
the reason for that is because when you
get<00:02:10.349> into<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> public<00:02:11.069> match<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.690> lot<00:02:12.690> of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
get into a public match a lot of

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.880 
get into a public match a lot of
teammates

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
teammates

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.210 
teammates
won't<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.970> push<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.690> hard<00:02:15.930> and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
won't really push up as hard and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.470 
won't really push up as hard and
actually<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> beginning<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> game<00:02:18.330> my

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
actually in the beginning of the game my

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.880 
actually in the beginning of the game my
teammates<00:02:18.840> were<00:02:19.020> pushing<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.650> hard<00:02:19.740> and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
teammates were pushing up is hard and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.430 
teammates were pushing up is hard and
that's<00:02:19.950> why<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.220> spawns<00:02:20.640> keep<00:02:20.910> flopping<00:02:21.440> but

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that's why the spawns keep flopping but

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.930 
that's why the spawns keep flopping but
now<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.950> see<00:02:23.130> if<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.280> look<00:02:23.400> up<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.760> mini

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
now you can see if you look up on a mini

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.610 
now you can see if you look up on a mini
map<00:02:24.090> you'll<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.330> teammates<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> back<00:02:25.380> of

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
map you'll see teammates in the back of

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.370 
map you'll see teammates in the back of
our<00:02:25.770> spawn<00:02:26.100> at<00:02:26.280> all<00:02:26.430> times<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.150> I'm<00:02:27.900> pushing

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
our spawn at all times and I'm pushing

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.720 
our spawn at all times and I'm pushing
up<00:02:28.500> into<00:02:28.620> their<00:02:28.860> spa<00:02:29.069> but<00:02:29.220> I'm<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.459> pushing

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
up into their spa but I'm not pushing

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.960 
up into their spa but I'm not pushing
all<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> way<00:02:30.510> back<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.550> going<00:02:32.550> directly

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
all the way back and and going directly

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.900 
all the way back and and going directly
to<00:02:33.090> them<00:02:33.480> constantly<00:02:34.050> I'm<00:02:34.350> kind<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.950> switching

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
to them constantly I'm kind of switching

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.250 
to them constantly I'm kind of switching
back<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.090> forth<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.660> now<00:02:36.720> you'll<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:36.959> that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
back and forth and now you'll see that

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.699 
back and forth and now you'll see that
the<00:02:37.530> whole<00:02:37.830> team<00:02:38.160> flopped<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.270> side<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.750> where

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
the whole team flopped the side of where

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.620 
the whole team flopped the side of where
I<00:02:40.739> just<00:02:40.860> was<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.550> now<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.880> spawns<00:02:42.360> are<00:02:42.510> going

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
I just was and now the spawns are going

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.270 
I just was and now the spawns are going
to<00:02:42.690> flip<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:42.959> it's<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.620> clockwork

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
to flip in it's like it's like clockwork

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.880 
to flip in it's like it's like clockwork
it<00:02:44.819> happens<00:02:45.600> every<00:02:46.080> single<00:02:46.260> time<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.650> it's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
it happens every single time and it's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.490 
it happens every single time and it's
really<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.550> easy<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.970> dictate<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.570> if

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
really really easy to dictate and if

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.530 
really really easy to dictate and if
you're<00:02:50.220> someone<00:02:50.820> who<00:02:50.940> doesn't<00:02:51.390> really

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
you're someone who doesn't really

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.960 
you're someone who doesn't really
understand<00:02:52.080> map<00:02:52.320> control<00:02:52.800> playing<00:02:53.790> on

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
understand map control playing on

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.930 
understand map control playing on
mission<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.560> really<00:02:56.190> make<00:02:56.790> you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
mission is going to really make you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.850 
mission is going to really make you
understand<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.660> if<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.560> know<00:02:58.680> you're

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
understand it if you know you're

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.080 
understand it if you know you're
something<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.430> know<00:02:59.459> you're<00:02:59.730> new<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
something you know you're new to the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.790 
something you know you're new to the
game<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.450> don't<00:03:00.540> really<00:03:00.720> understand<00:03:01.320> how<00:03:01.530> map

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
game you don't really understand how map

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.360 
game you don't really understand how map
control<00:03:02.220> works<00:03:03.680> watching<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.860> game<00:03:05.100> play

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
control works watching this game play

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.070 
control works watching this game play
and<00:03:05.400> also<00:03:05.760> playing<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.150> mission<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.570> lot<00:03:06.810> is

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
and also playing on mission a lot is

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.880 
and also playing on mission a lot is
going<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.760> help<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.380> figure<00:03:10.380> out<00:03:10.530> how

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
going to really help you figure out how

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.949 
going to really help you figure out how
to<00:03:10.950> get<00:03:11.100> map<00:03:11.340> control<00:03:11.790> you'll<00:03:12.420> see<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.840> now

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
to get map control you'll see that now

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.290 
to get map control you'll see that now
my<00:03:13.140> team<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.560> back<00:03:14.280> behind<00:03:14.489> me<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.120> they're

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
my team is back behind me so they're

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.699 
my team is back behind me so they're
gonna<00:03:15.420> start<00:03:15.690> spying<00:03:16.050> right<00:03:16.290> in<00:03:16.380> front<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.620> me

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
gonna start spying right in front of me

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.729 
gonna start spying right in front of me
very<00:03:17.160> very<00:03:17.310> easy<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.470> something<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.530> like<00:03:19.709> to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
very very easy and something I like to

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.620 
very very easy and something I like to
do<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.250> either<00:03:20.459> stay<00:03:20.820> up<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.600> a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
do is either stay up there I have a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.930 
do is either stay up there I have a
shotgun<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.470> game<00:03:22.680> play<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.519> it's<00:03:23.670> very

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
shotgun in this game play so it's very

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.250 
shotgun in this game play so it's very
hard<00:03:24.209> for<00:03:24.269> them<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.510> come<00:03:24.780> through<00:03:25.110> this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
hard for them to come through this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.890 
hard for them to come through this
little<00:03:25.500> doorway<00:03:25.769> here<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> white<00:03:26.519> truck

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
little doorway here to the white truck

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.090 
little doorway here to the white truck
but<00:03:27.900> also<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.260> need<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.650> switch<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:29.010> up

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
but also you need to switch it up

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.039 
but also you need to switch it up
because<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:30.090> can't<00:03:30.360> just<00:03:30.540> stay<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.870> one<00:03:31.019> spot

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
because you can't just stay in one spot

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.900 
because you can't just stay in one spot
killing<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:32.010> can't<00:03:32.220> just<00:03:32.340> let<00:03:32.459> them<00:03:32.579> funnel

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
killing you can't just let them funnel

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.610 
killing you can't just let them funnel
into<00:03:33.090> one<00:03:33.239> area<00:03:33.390> because<00:03:33.810> they<00:03:33.930> will<00:03:34.079> continue

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
into one area because they will continue

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.440 
into one area because they will continue
to<00:03:35.070> start<00:03:35.310> throwing<00:03:35.610> your<00:03:35.730> daed's<00:03:35.910> at<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.239> and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
to start throwing your daed's at you and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.660 
to start throwing your daed's at you and
even<00:03:37.019> if<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.170> have<00:03:37.260> blast<00:03:37.560> shield<00:03:37.829> specialist

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
even if you have blast shield specialist

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.850 
even if you have blast shield specialist
package<00:03:38.970> whatever<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:39.480> have<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:39.739> you're<00:03:40.739> not

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
package whatever you have on you're not

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.830 
package whatever you have on you're not
going<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.070> live<00:03:41.190> long<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:42.480> it's<00:03:42.720> very

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
going to live long so it's very

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.229 
going to live long so it's very
important<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.410> switch<00:03:43.709> up<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.890> routes<00:03:44.239> you'll

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
important to switch up the routes you'll

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.449 
important to switch up the routes you'll
see<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.660> now<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:46.049> they<00:03:46.230> switch<00:03:47.160> spawns

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
see that now that they switch spawns

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.890 
see that now that they switch spawns
there's<00:03:47.700> two<00:03:47.880> areas<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.570> go<00:03:48.690> through

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
there's two areas that I can go through

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.870 
there's two areas that I can go through
here<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.380> really<00:03:49.920> don't<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.310> jump<00:03:50.519> off<00:03:50.700> the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
here I really don't like to jump off the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.310 
here I really don't like to jump off the
church<00:03:51.090> because<00:03:51.299> that's<00:03:51.540> where<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.230> know

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
church because that's where you know

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.840 
church because that's where you know
people<00:03:52.350> start<00:03:52.860> sniping<00:03:53.070> people<00:03:53.519> start

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
people start sniping people start

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.789 
people start sniping people start
camping<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.510> get<00:03:54.690> do<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.260> get<00:03:55.380> destroyed

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
camping and you get do you get destroyed

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.190 
camping and you get do you get destroyed
and<00:03:56.190> then<00:03:56.310> going<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.850> other<00:03:56.880> way<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.450> do<00:03:57.959> like

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
and then going the other way I do like

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.620 
and then going the other way I do like
to<00:03:58.350> jump<00:03:58.560> off<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.950> go<00:03:59.130> up<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.370> little<00:03:59.549> ramp<00:03:59.820> to

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
to jump off and go up the little ramp to

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.449 
to jump off and go up the little ramp to
flank<00:04:00.900> them<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.410> all<00:04:01.620> about<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> get

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
flank them it's all about that and I get

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.140 
flank them it's all about that and I get
killed<00:04:02.700> on<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.260> twenty-third<00:04:04.260> kill<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:05.150> very

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150

very short break down on what mission

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.550 
very short break down on what mission
looks<00:04:09.000> like<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.420> can<00:04:09.660> go<00:04:09.810> more<00:04:10.019> in-depth<00:04:10.320> if<00:04:10.470> you

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
looks like I can go more in-depth if you

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.650 
looks like I can go more in-depth if you
guys<00:04:10.739> would<00:04:11.190> like<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.670> or<00:04:11.880> on<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.269> different

break down of mission probably the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.009

easiest map to get map control

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.330 
easiest map to get map control
especially<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.680> Kill<00:04:19.829> Confirmed<00:04:19.859> in
