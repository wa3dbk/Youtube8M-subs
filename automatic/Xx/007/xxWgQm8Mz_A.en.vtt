don't<00:00:06.240> do<00:00:06.390> now<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.870> we're<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.140> apply<00:00:07.230> a

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
don't do now is we're going to apply a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.100 
don't do now is we're going to apply a
bead<00:00:08.520> of<00:00:08.760> flux<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.630> then<00:00:09.690> I'm<00:00:09.870> going<00:00:10.050> to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
bead of flux and then I'm going to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.310 
bead of flux and then I'm going to
squeegee<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.770> across<00:00:11.430> the<00:00:11.730> parent<00:00:12.270> evenly<00:00:12.750> so

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
squeegee it across the parent evenly so

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.640 
squeegee it across the parent evenly so
just<00:00:13.530> put<00:00:16.820> then<00:00:18.050> squeegee<00:00:19.050> blade<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.380> can

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
just put then squeegee blade so you can

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.470 
just put then squeegee blade so you can
see<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.980> yeah<00:00:27.800> there<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.179> slowing

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
see that yeah there and we're slowing

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.410 
see that yeah there and we're slowing
the<00:00:30.689> device<00:00:30.839> down

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 

see<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> bubbles<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.460> we

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
see the bubbles there and what we

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.440 
see the bubbles there and what we
basically<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.450> line<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:41.149> balls<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
basically do is we line the balls of the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.689 
basically do is we line the balls of the
component<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.290> pads<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> soap<00:00:44.340> at

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
component and the pads on the soap at

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.330 
component and the pads on the soap at
the<00:00:44.850> top<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.300> top<00:00:45.510> row<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.100> know<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> hear

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the top on the top row I know I hear

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.250 
the top on the top row I know I hear
Venus<00:00:47.699> then<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.180> by<00:00:48.690> doing<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.199> can

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
Venus then you can by doing that you can

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
Venus then you can by doing that you can
de<00:00:49.500> cheap<00:00:49.790> you<00:00:50.790> can<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> component<00:00:51.570> of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
de cheap you can get the component of

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.009 
de cheap you can get the component of
square<00:00:52.430> once<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.760> square<00:00:54.089> in<00:00:54.720> litchi

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
square once you got it square in litchi

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.920 
square once you got it square in litchi
simply<00:00:55.530> put<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.920> its<00:00:56.040> position<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:57.720> it<00:00:57.839> will

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
simply put in its position and it will

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.770 
simply put in its position and it will
be<00:00:58.019> square<00:00:58.519> around<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.610> whole<00:00:59.760> component<00:01:00.059> now

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
be square around the whole component now

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.899 
be square around the whole component now
it<00:01:00.839> doesn't<00:01:01.110> matter<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.440> our<00:01:02.309> people<00:01:02.519> smaller

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
it doesn't matter how our people smaller

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.910 
it doesn't matter how our people smaller
devices<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.930> principle<00:01:04.320> will<00:01:04.440> work<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.830> any

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
devices that principle will work on any

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.280 
devices that principle will work on any
sized<00:01:05.220> component<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.720> we've<00:01:06.810> done<00:01:06.960> that

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.310 

component<00:01:09.740> down<00:01:10.120> on<00:01:11.120> to<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.330> lord<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.900> lord

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320

the<00:02:04.080> board<00:02:04.320> temperature<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.790> also<00:02:05.940> have<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the board temperature and we also have a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.770 
the board temperature and we also have a
non-contact<00:02:07.850> infrared<00:02:08.850> sensor<00:02:09.630> which

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
non-contact infrared sensor which

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.380 
non-contact infrared sensor which
measures<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.970> component<00:02:11.970> temperature

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
measures the component temperature

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.300 
measures the component temperature
throughout<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.050> whole<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.410> profile<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
throughout the whole of the profile and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.970 
throughout the whole of the profile and
this<00:02:14.880> software<00:02:15.120> basically<00:02:16.020> controls<00:02:16.739> all

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
this software basically controls all

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.390 
this software basically controls all
this<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.530> will<00:02:19.650> precisely<00:02:20.010> follow

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
this and so so you will precisely follow

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.360 
this and so so you will precisely follow
the<00:02:20.550> temperature<00:02:21.150> profile<00:02:21.630> automatically<00:02:22.560> go

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
the temperature profile automatically go

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.180 
the temperature profile automatically go
up<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.610> reflow<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.620> turning<00:02:25.620> off<00:02:25.739> at<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> end

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
up to reflow and turning off at the end

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.009 
up to reflow and turning off at the end
of<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.340> profile<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.299> moved<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.930> a

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
of the profile as you moved it in a

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.140 
of the profile as you moved it in a
reflow<00:02:28.320> oven<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.910> let's<00:02:30.060> start<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:31.880> as<00:02:32.880> you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
reflow oven so let's start that as you

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.110

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
like a reefer than you've got so

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.950 
like a reefer than you've got so
temperature<00:03:49.210> drop<00:03:50.210> there<00:03:50.390> as<00:03:50.480> well<00:03:50.720> when

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
temperature drop there as well when

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.060 
temperature drop there as well when
levels<00:03:51.350> of<00:03:51.970> as<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.060> said<00:03:53.090> before<00:03:53.330> but<00:03:53.720> heater<00:03:54.070> is

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
levels of as I said before but heater is

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.690 
levels of as I said before but heater is
doing<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.430> macro<00:03:55.760> heating<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:57.680> if<00:03:58.460> the<00:03:58.520> if

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
doing the macro heating so the if the if

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.040 
doing the macro heating so the if the if
there<00:03:59.000> is<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.120> temperature<00:03:59.330> difference<00:03:59.540> the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
there is a temperature difference the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.750 
there is a temperature difference the
actual<00:04:00.320> top<00:04:00.530> they<00:04:00.680> will<00:04:00.710> compensate<00:04:01.520> for<00:04:01.550> that

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
actual top they will compensate for that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.510 
actual top they will compensate for that
automatically<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:03.140> you<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:03.830> how<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.040> back<00:04:04.340> is

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
automatically so you see how the back is

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.280 
automatically so you see how the back is
and<00:04:05.150> everything<00:04:05.360> off<00:04:05.540> here<00:04:05.780> that's<00:04:06.140> at

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
and everything off here that's at

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.410 
and everything off here that's at
maximum<00:04:06.920> power<00:04:08.830> just<00:04:09.830> naturally<00:04:10.270> drop<00:04:11.270> back

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
maximum power just naturally drop back

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.720 
maximum power just naturally drop back
it's<00:04:11.750> about<00:04:11.930> fifty<00:04:12.260> percent<00:04:12.550> and<00:04:13.550> then

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
it's about fifty percent and then

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.520 
it's about fifty percent and then
basically<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.420> top<00:04:14.600> is<00:04:14.780> just<00:04:15.080> doing<00:04:15.230> all<00:04:15.440> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
basically the top is just doing all the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.380 
basically the top is just doing all the
control<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:17.180> precisely<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:18.049> try<00:04:18.260> again<00:04:19.390> bitch

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
control so precisely to try again bitch

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.850 
control so precisely to try again bitch
rifo<00:04:22.150> precise<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.300> just<00:04:23.480> stay<00:04:23.960> close<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
rifo precise to just stay close to the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.600 
rifo precise to just stay close to the
line<00:04:25.100> there

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
line there

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.440 
line there
swishing<00:04:26.240> yourself<00:04:26.570> on<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:26.900> off<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:29.060> now<00:04:29.270> it

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
swishing yourself on and off and now it

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:37.120 
swishing yourself on and off and now it
gets<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.780> end<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.110> can't<00:04:30.620> turn<00:04:30.800> itself<00:04:31.100> off

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.710 

so<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:37.640> actually<00:04:37.910> flowing<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.360> temperature

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
so is actually flowing the temperature

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.740 
so is actually flowing the temperature
profile<00:04:39.110> down<00:04:39.260> there

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:50.629 

so<00:04:42.750> cause<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.290> had<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.500> controlled<00:04:44.160> right

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.429 

that's<00:04:51.270> also<00:04:51.599> important<00:04:52.080> because<00:04:52.139> if<00:04:52.349> you

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
that's also important because if you

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:53.990 
that's also important because if you
don't<00:04:52.590> control<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:53.280> temperature<00:04:53.639> going<00:04:53.819> down

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
don't control the temperature going down

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.700 
don't control the temperature going down
you<00:04:54.150> can<00:04:54.270> actually<00:04:54.360> family<00:04:54.689> shock<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.349> device

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
you can actually family shock the device

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.350 
you can actually family shock the device
just<00:04:56.520> really<00:04:56.789> flowed<00:04:58.520> so<00:04:59.520> just<00:04:59.879> like<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.150> same

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
just really flowed so just like the same

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.820 
just really flowed so just like the same
way<00:05:00.389> as<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.379> have<00:05:01.409> an<00:05:01.590> approach<00:05:02.389> the<00:05:03.389> same<00:05:03.569> way

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
way as you have an approach the same way

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.110 
way as you have an approach the same way
you<00:05:04.830> control<00:05:05.069> the<00:05:05.310> temperature<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:05.759> as<00:05:06.030> you

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
you control the temperature so as you

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.240 
you control the temperature so as you
cool<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.900> down<00:05:06.930> in<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.349> refile<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.919> we<00:05:08.009> do<00:05:08.129> it

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
cool it down in a refile and we do it

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.939 
cool it down in a refile and we do it
also<00:05:08.629> with<00:05:09.629> the<00:05:11.000> with<00:05:12.000> our<00:05:12.120> system<00:05:12.509> or<00:05:12.659> so<00:05:12.949> well

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
also with the with our system or so well

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.909 
also with the with our system or so well
that's<00:05:14.099> the<00:05:14.370> end<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:14.879> profile<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.919> that

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
that's the end of the profile and that

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.100 
that's the end of the profile and that
device<00:05:17.189> have<00:05:17.370> been<00:05:17.550> perfectly<00:05:18.060> soldered<00:05:18.990> to

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
device have been perfectly soldered to

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.920 
device have been perfectly soldered to
the<00:05:19.139> board<00:05:19.469> this<00:05:20.270> generally<00:05:21.270> allow<00:05:21.629> the<00:05:21.689> board

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
the board this generally allow the board

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.990 
the board this generally allow the board
to<00:05:21.990> cool<00:05:22.259> down<00:05:22.439> to<00:05:22.469> about<00:05:22.680> 180<00:05:23.189> before<00:05:23.729> we

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
to cool down to about 180 before we

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.529 
to cool down to about 180 before we
actually<00:05:24.330> take<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.169> from<00:05:25.379> their<00:05:25.620> jaws<00:05:26.479> just<00:05:27.479> to

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
actually take it from their jaws just to

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.959 
actually take it from their jaws just to
make<00:05:27.659> sure<00:05:27.689> everything<00:05:28.169> is<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:29.550> solder<00:05:29.789> is

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
make sure everything is the solder is

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.100 
make sure everything is the solder is
basically<00:05:30.740> solid<00:05:31.939> and<00:05:32.939> now<00:05:33.689> the<00:05:33.750> board<00:05:33.990> will

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
basically solid and now the board will

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.350 
basically solid and now the board will
be<00:05:34.139> ready<00:05:34.379> to<00:05:34.560> either<00:05:34.740> go<00:05:35.039> to<00:05:35.069> be<00:05:35.610> tested<00:05:36.090> and

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
be ready to either go to be tested and

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:48.239 
be ready to either go to be tested and
then<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:37.020> go<00:05:37.139> to<00:05:37.379> the<00:05:37.740> customer<00:05:38.129> basically

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:48.249 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.309
