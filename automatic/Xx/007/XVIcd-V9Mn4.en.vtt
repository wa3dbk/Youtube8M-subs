00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.679
 my goal is to share with 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.260
 people 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.300
 techniques on the canine psychology 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.100
 which will provide more sexies to be the 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.660
 balance between humans 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.849
 that your dogs 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.849
 I'm the fall rehabilitator . 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.560
 the application of dogs with target cloud in 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.050
 last week we saw from where 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.899
 facing the challenge of addressing the aggressive 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.970
 Simon has already used snacks not like 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.370
 positive reinforcement because there is no 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.579
 desire to ask Simon to continue 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.860
 aggressive towards snacks only for 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.420
 through the nose of Simon to measure his degree 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.370
 of aggressiveness 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.320
 since one of the first signs of 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.890
 aggression is to realize that a dog 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.690
 uses a no lighthouse already realized that 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.879
 he no longer used his 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.429
 pointed nose 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.899
 Simon showed an imbalance 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.059
 behavioral because all the time denied 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.550
 his instincts and tried unique and 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.690
 only to attack even for no reason 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.450
 apparent 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.580
 today we will learn how to walk with a 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.729
 dog correctly 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.159
 I can not sleep, do not do this, do not 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:25.509
 you can do this, and he does not obey you. 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 aunt rigg mei starts rice to throw then 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.569
 so any correction you make 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.940
 do not kid you or do not you 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:39.369
 Call corners should walk the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.410
 exercises like running and to take 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.170
 loser to make the track is an exercise 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.119
 which drains this type of energy then 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.130
 this is not only the city also has 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.369
 a little stress to have a little bit of 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.060
 frustration but how will you play 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.530
 he in this unstable mental state he 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.369
 bite because that's how our door 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.369
 bye 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.629
 jean-claude rehab your dogs 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.790
 using canine psychology that is 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.230
 basically solve the problem of point 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.330
 view of dog 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.010
 using natural techniques and a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.900
 language that the dog understands 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.599
 he easily understands that the first 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.129
 step to bring balance the dog is a 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.780
 walk which serves as a good 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.510
 physical exercise 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.040
 he decides to leave first alone 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.230
 so that the dog does not suffer any 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.140
 influence of its owners so that it 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.860
 relax a bit from the walk to 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.860
 detoxify 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.239
 but he states that the commitment of the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.680
 family is critical to the success of 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.689
 balance in the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.909
 so he instructed the owners as if 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.549
 with the car on the street and that the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.750
 the main key beyond assertiveness is 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.510
 the relaxation 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.569
 remember that every time he 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.299
 is too dominant 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.040
 I never caress I do not look at him 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.480
 and I will not call by the name that only 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.489
 reinforces it even more 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.560
 he gets more and more aggressive then 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:15.530
 all is dominant breathe relax 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.260
 if you were here now think 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.379
 he would be tense but his father guides her and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.870
 He is relaxed and left loosely 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.450
 he begins to understand the following there is nothing 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.329
 of evil happens then the order is I do 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.879
 exercise with him being better still 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.859
 this one is one of the best moments that 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.659
 if you have evidence and make fall into the corner but 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.609
 we have to do is click exacerbated 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.970
 just a good touch you can look at the 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:44.840
 difference now from his asshole realizing 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.069
 the tall tail is of the territory 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.260
 I'm dominating crime here and there. 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.900
 When you have a tail like this it reflects the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.900
 mentality of his relaxation 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.129
 anxiety presentation 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.409
 We open the door to solve the problem. 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.000
 problem in this more practical way 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.669
 people feed his anxiety 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.599
 on the way out the same thing can open the door 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:14.720
 I do not want this there is too much anxiety 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.889
 little better without pulling him ever in 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.199
 My front 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.199
 It's right here, whoever leaves first 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.810
 ef 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.870
 long - awaited us who does all 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.210
 are there problem remembering that these 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.860
 days these weeks he enters the state 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.520
 rehabilitation 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.680
 so he does it right the way 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.849
 do ten times as many times as 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.349
 needed 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.349
 He has to understand that he leaves. 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.480
 Is the time can be lucky he me 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.030
 bit 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.970
 But do not worry, it's not when 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.410
 people go out with the dog, they have to be 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.990
 in the relaxed state 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.240
 I left here with him alone the first time. 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.810
 and he was in the state but it is the only key 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.930
 that now this apprehension harms me 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.510
 I understood because your memory and leads 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.490
 Exactly one love said I do not think 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.060
 that you say you think it goes 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.870
 die 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:28.790
 only I will not give up be calm 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:30.530
 Give it to me I will not give up because everything 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.060
 time it takes a bite and human 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.450
 Give it up, I'll do it. 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.830
 always relaxed relax of the same thing as 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.860
 I'm going out again 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:44.360
 relax the right breath 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.280
 now he knows that sandro is the most 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.950
 affected in this relationship 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.990
 therefore he calls on his faithful squire 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.540
 book and balanced center of 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.120

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.510

 jean claude canine behavior do not 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.840
 intimidates and knows that the bite and 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.830
 consequence and not the cause of 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.080
 aggressiveness 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.150
