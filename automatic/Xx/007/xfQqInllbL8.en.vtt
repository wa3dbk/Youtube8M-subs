00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.300
 m 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.530
 me it's snow in that dj composer 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.660
 and artistic director within the 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.880
 structure of the extracts 6 the structure to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.779
 soprano of which I am also co-founder 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.390
 with soprano matteo and jamal we have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.189
 started redemptions after soprano that has 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.390
 took a little volume of magnitude it has 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.250
 revived the record company learn to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.020
 develop our structure there is a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.900
 passage will take care of other artists 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.560
 that we produced their particular album 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.720
 redk urban revolution swija on 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.660
 also too much produces léa castel's album 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.370
 at the time in a given moment we try to 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.710
 touch a little discussed with us 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.090
 enjoy the soprano strength for 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.980
 to have credibility at the houses of 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.070
 records to be able to sign the artists 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.330
 and develop other artists but there 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.040
 we do it less and less because 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.729
 it's a lot of work 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.979
 it is and given the magnitude that career takes 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.960
 to soprano that's the domain too much too 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.000
 energy we can not manage 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.659
 so for me is no longer focused on 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.659
 career of teacher 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.119
 cosmo all these 18 people 1 18 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.880
 my adventure every night we fill 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.020
 rooms between four and six seven 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.820
 even 7000 people 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.979
 for us it's the best - because 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.960
 ie from the studio you know 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.050
 never know where will you go the title you see 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.240
 and when I arrive canned or ballast 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.940
 in title and everyone sings you see 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.490
 it's rewarding it's the moment the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.840
 more enjoyable for a party I think about 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.479
 programs in africa adds one of 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.330
 minimum stages it's something 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.010
 of emotionally enough it is strong and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.300
 especially with the speech that soprano 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.330
 what's more with 2 p2 on principles 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.610
 values ​​of life and there it is downright 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.840
 know it all live days so 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.050
 emotionally space a lot of 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.050
 jurists 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.630

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.040
 provided months with soprano it's perfect 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.480

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.220
 had to hip hop dj I thought 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.140
