there's one main jump and I guess that's
the<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:18.930> dump<00:01:19.530> also<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.340> does<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:21.360> it's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the only dump also but it does like it's

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
u-turns and everything like that notice

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.940 
u-turns and everything like that notice
how<00:03:26.670> smooth<00:03:27.269> all<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.989> entire<00:03:28.290> track<00:03:28.680> was

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
how smooth all the entire track was

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.789 
how smooth all the entire track was
there<00:03:29.459> wasn't<00:03:29.790> any<00:03:30.000> bumps<00:03:30.390> anywhere<00:03:30.840> nothing

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
there wasn't any bumps anywhere nothing

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.229 
there wasn't any bumps anywhere nothing
like<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.040> people<00:03:32.280> go<00:03:32.579> full<00:03:32.850> speed<00:03:33.000> around

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
like that people go full speed around

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.180 
like that people go full speed around
turns<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.870> stuff<00:03:33.989> that's<00:03:34.470> one<00:03:34.709> thing<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:35.010> got

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
turns and stuff that's one thing you got

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.740 
turns and stuff that's one thing you got
to<00:03:35.220> really<00:03:35.549> look<00:03:35.820> at<00:03:35.970> whenever<00:03:36.150> you're<00:03:36.420> making

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
to really look at whenever you're making

a<00:03:36.810> map<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.260> if<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.470> want<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.680> become<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:38.070> better

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
a map and if you want to become a better

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.240 
a map and if you want to become a better
forger<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.480> stuff<00:03:39.750> what<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.590> want<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.860> do<00:03:41.010> is

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
just try to make each like it take your

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.020 
just try to make each like it take your

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
make a map as smooth as you possibly can

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.030 
make a map as smooth as you possibly can
it's<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.019> know<00:03:55.109> i<00:03:55.140> remember<00:03:55.410> in<00:03:55.799> Halo

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
it's it you know i remember in Halo

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.849 
it's it you know i remember in Halo
Reach<00:03:56.180> there's<00:03:57.180> one<00:03:57.269> jump<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.380> worked<00:03:58.709> on

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
Reach there's one jump that I worked on

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.460 
Reach there's one jump that I worked on
and<00:03:59.100> even<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.430> Halo<00:03:59.609> 4<00:03:59.910> uh<00:03:59.940> there's<00:04:00.930> one<00:04:01.200> jump

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
and even in Halo 4 uh there's one jump

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.949 
and even in Halo 4 uh there's one jump
on<00:04:01.590> my<00:04:01.709> Star<00:04:02.040> Wars<00:04:02.280> map<00:04:02.459> in<00:04:02.640> Halo<00:04:02.850> 4<00:04:03.239> where<00:04:03.930> I

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
on my Star Wars map in Halo 4 where I

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.830 
on my Star Wars map in Halo 4 where I
probably<00:04:04.620> worked<00:04:05.190> on<00:04:05.489> hours<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.299> this<00:04:06.600> just

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
probably worked on hours on this just

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.390 
probably worked on hours on this just
one<00:04:07.140> jump<00:04:07.470> i<00:04:07.620> remember<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.100> Halo<00:04:08.310> Reach

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
one jump i remember in Halo Reach

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.380 
one jump i remember in Halo Reach
specifically<00:04:09.359> because<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.870> even

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
specifically because I even

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.960 
specifically because I even
like<00:04:11.780> kind<00:04:12.260> of<00:04:12.380> timed<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.069> a<00:04:13.160> way<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.730> me

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
like kind of timed it in a way of me

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.340 
like kind of timed it in a way of me
working<00:04:14.180> on<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.600> one<00:04:14.780> map<00:04:14.930> is<00:04:15.080> all<00:04:15.230> my

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
working on this one map is all my

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.319 
working on this one map is all my
wonders<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.920> world<00:04:15.980> part<00:04:16.400> 3<00:04:16.760> map<00:04:17.000> though

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
wonders of the world part 3 map though

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.789 
wonders of the world part 3 map though
the<00:04:17.570> huge<00:04:17.900> jump<00:04:18.200> it's<00:04:18.320> one<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.620> biggest

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
the huge jump it's one of the biggest

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.360 
the huge jump it's one of the biggest
jumps<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.510> Landa<00:04:21.049> belen<00:04:21.350> halo<00:04:21.920> reach<00:04:22.130> of

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
jumps that is Landa belen halo reach of

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.570 
jumps that is Landa belen halo reach of
course<00:04:22.580> it's<00:04:22.850> about<00:04:23.060> 90%<00:04:23.960> LAN<00:04:24.170> double<00:04:24.580> you

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
course it's about 90% LAN double you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.700 
course it's about 90% LAN double you
know<00:04:25.610> every<00:04:25.970> once<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.300> while<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:26.630> won't<00:04:27.290> you

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
know every once a while it won't you

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.990 
know every once a while it won't you
know<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:27.890> won't<00:04:28.130> land<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.490> even<00:04:28.760> if<00:04:28.880> you're

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
know you won't land it even if you're

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.990 
know you won't land it even if you're
going<00:04:29.120> full<00:04:29.390> speed<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.130> worked<00:04:31.669> on<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:31.970> for

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
going full speed but I worked on it for

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.730 
going full speed but I worked on it for
probably<00:04:32.330> somewhere<00:04:32.720> around<00:04:32.780> six<00:04:33.230> hours<00:04:33.590> on

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
probably somewhere around six hours on

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.440 
probably somewhere around six hours on
just<00:04:33.980> that<00:04:34.130> one<00:04:34.460> jump<00:04:34.820> trying<00:04:35.120> to<00:04:35.180> get<00:04:35.300> as

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
just that one jump trying to get as

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.110 
just that one jump trying to get as
perfect<00:04:35.960> as<00:04:36.110> possible<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:37.280> just<00:04:37.669> take<00:04:37.940> your

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
perfect as possible so just take your

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.570 
perfect as possible so just take your
time<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.780> make<00:04:38.870> sure<00:04:39.530> everything<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.220> know

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
time and make sure everything you know

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.970 
time and make sure everything you know
is<00:04:40.610> as<00:04:41.120> smooth<00:04:41.480> as<00:04:41.660> possible<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:42.650> know<00:04:42.740> don't

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
is as smooth as possible you know don't

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.820 
is as smooth as possible you know don't
you<00:04:43.280> know<00:04:43.370> put<00:04:43.730> pieces<00:04:44.540> really<00:04:45.050> you<00:04:45.680> know

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
you know put pieces really you know

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.250 
you know put pieces really you know
bumpy<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:47.060> guess<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:47.570> don't<00:04:47.870> know<00:04:47.960> how<00:04:48.080> say

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
bumpy and I guess I don't know how say

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.680 
bumpy and I guess I don't know how say
like<00:04:48.470> Jackie<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.130> stuff<00:04:49.400> like<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:49.580> but<00:04:50.360> like

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
like Jackie and stuff like that but like

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.270 
like Jackie and stuff like that but like
where<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.290> know<00:04:51.410> you're<00:04:51.590> really<00:04:51.770> gonna<00:04:51.980> like

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
where you know you're really gonna like

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.740 
where you know you're really gonna like
jump<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.970> then<00:04:53.090> you're<00:04:53.210> gonna<00:04:53.330> hit<00:04:53.600> the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
jump and then you're gonna hit the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.780 
jump and then you're gonna hit the
ground<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.410> stuff<00:04:54.620> real<00:04:54.950> hard<00:04:55.250> you're<00:04:55.730> gonna

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
ground and stuff real hard you're gonna

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.610 
ground and stuff real hard you're gonna
go<00:04:56.030> downhill<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.930> they're<00:04:57.140> all<00:04:57.230> sudden<00:04:57.530> it

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
go downhill and they're all sudden it

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.610 
go downhill and they're all sudden it
just<00:04:57.830> goes<00:04:58.250> real<00:04:58.520> flat<00:04:58.820> very<00:04:59.150> quickly<00:04:59.540> I<00:04:59.870> just

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
just goes real flat very quickly I just

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.200 
just goes real flat very quickly I just
all<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:00.860> have<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.070> do<00:05:01.250> is<00:05:01.400> on<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.760> part<00:05:02.030> where

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
all you have to do is on that part where

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.360 
all you have to do is on that part where
it<00:05:02.330> goes<00:05:02.450> downhill<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:03.080> it's<00:05:03.500> another<00:05:03.890> flat

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
it goes downhill and it's another flat

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.330 
it goes downhill and it's another flat
portion<00:05:04.910> just<00:05:05.510> put<00:05:05.720> like<00:05:05.840> two<00:05:06.230> pieces<00:05:06.680> in<00:05:07.100> at

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
portion just put like two pieces in at

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.400 
portion just put like two pieces in at
different<00:05:07.850> angles<00:05:08.030> on<00:05:08.510> that<00:05:08.960> it'll<00:05:09.140> make<00:05:09.260> a

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
different angles on that it'll make a

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.460 
different angles on that it'll make a
perfect<00:05:09.530> little<00:05:10.450> slope<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.810> you<00:05:12.050> can<00:05:12.230> easily

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
perfect little slope that you can easily

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.130 
perfect little slope that you can easily
write<00:05:12.980> off<00:05:13.190> onto<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.669> flat<00:05:13.880> surface<00:05:14.390> so<00:05:14.600> just

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
write off onto the flat surface so just

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.540 
write off onto the flat surface so just
remember<00:05:15.290> that<00:05:15.530> one<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.890> your<00:05:15.979> making<00:05:16.280> stuff
