00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.670
 many follow with a new and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.830
 Today I will give you a little trick 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.139
 hopefully show some of you 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 It will be very easy to help 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.440
 but perhaps knows now then 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.240
 not yet 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.250
 and that's why it's just that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.010
 Media libraries of, for example, iphoto 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.529
 or itunes to another place too 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.480
 It's really easy to lay that down 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.220
 I have my media libraries on one 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.930
 external hard drive moved so that me 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.539
 more space on my little ones 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.590
 laptop has something else, of course 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.660
 even more practical is if you 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 for example, if you have a lot of music or 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 Just take the pictures with you 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.690
 can insert a hard disk and at one 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.149
 other computer about this lethargy 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 can call by holding the other one 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.649
 mediathek the picture I'm supposed to you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.879
 show it for now and that is 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.890
 that's just you just stop 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.320
 the program and the bar and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 make a 1 click so keep old and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.899
 just click and it will open 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.280
 the window and asks which mediathek 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.570
 should use a photo 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.519
 there you can now for example so 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.920
 which has now created my daily 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.680
 You can choose another library 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.290
 The then here in the blog also in it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.210
 everyone finds you can then here 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.759
 For example, click Create New 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.820
 who then play this out of two here 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.950
 external hard drive and can here one 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.119
 create a new photo book 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.340
 in that I see it here 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.500
 may have copied the copy 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.270
 you can do that on the usb-stick 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 lay on an external hard disk or 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.560
 whatever I already live for you 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.259
 explained and then you secure the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.259
 just at the rx you can now 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.200
 Of course, so easily defend the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.780
 had already created also cancel 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.930
 and that too on itunes too 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.479
 show that works just as old and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.409
 knick already he asks if you have a new 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.500
 want to create or another because 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.969
 then we also create and do that 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.399
 same principle again the world 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.430
 just unplug the external hard drive and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.160
 could discuss the year 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.200
 once you've set that up and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.080
 here synonymous with if choose 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.730
 necessary at all most politically 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.349
 you have chosen then you can 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.370
 afterwards by a click normal 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.900
 open as if he had just so that 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.099
 even your local calculator only us 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.530
 need the external hard disk or 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.930
 usb-stick what always hang here 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.220
 wanted to have connected it first 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.819
 if i give you external hard drive now 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.379
 Mark out 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:44.310
 if I make briefly then wants 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.019
 I opened a photo 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.790
 he asks me which mediatex or one 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.040
 Use feed because he's the one I only 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.450
 times have chosen to not take but 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.920
 even there I could be a new Zurich 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.680
 create and then when I am that 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.590
 still copy photos files and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.090
 would then have two media library yes me 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.310
 Hope some of you got out 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.150
 helped 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.310
 If you have any question 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.500
 Write this in the comments 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.019
 That's basically a simple one 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.819
 principle what he has given us is but 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.849
 very handy if you can then 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.170
 manage his data better 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.290
 i hope i could hook up some 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.290
 to the
