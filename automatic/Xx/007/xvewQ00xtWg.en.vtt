00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
now and we can do that that just looks

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.570 
now and we can do that that just looks
weird

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
weird

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.090 
weird

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
so what we're gonna do instead is we're

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.050 
so what we're gonna do instead is we're
going<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.340> over<00:02:26.400> here<00:02:26.730> we're<00:02:26.910> going<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
going to go over here we're going to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.170 
going to go over here we're going to
just<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.810> spacing<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.350> little<00:02:28.560> bit<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.120> go<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
just a spacing a little bit and go to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.270 
just a spacing a little bit and go to
the<00:02:30.330> shape<00:02:30.630> dynamics<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.470> adjust<00:02:32.130> aside<00:02:32.459> so

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
the shape dynamics and adjust aside so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.150 
the shape dynamics and adjust aside so
just<00:02:35.280> change<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.540> range<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.049> size<00:02:37.260> then

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
just change the range of the size then

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.860 
just change the range of the size then
maybe<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.820> angle<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.299> hairs<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.630> bit

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
maybe just the angle of the hairs a bit

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.229 
maybe just the angle of the hairs a bit
and<00:02:40.110> go<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.620> scattering<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.090> where

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
and go to scattering this is where

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.320 
and go to scattering this is where
that's<00:02:42.750> where<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.989> gets<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.940> or<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.239> is

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
that's where it gets really or this is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.199 
that's where it gets really or this is
where<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.510> gets<00:02:45.630> really<00:02:45.780> detailed<00:02:47.000> okay<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
where it gets really detailed okay and

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.840 
where it gets really detailed okay and
then<00:02:48.890> finally<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.160> want<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> your<00:02:50.640> club

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
then finally you want to go to your club

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.259 
then finally you want to go to your club
dynamics<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:53.220> want<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.670> foreground

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
dynamics and you want the foreground

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.370 
dynamics and you want the foreground
background<00:02:54.510> jitter<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.620> all<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.860> way<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
background jitter to be all the way and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.940 
background jitter to be all the way and
you<00:02:58.380> want<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.590> go<00:02:58.680> ahead<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.660> just<00:03:00.660> get<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
you want to go ahead and just get a

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.840 
you want to go ahead and just get a
lighter<00:03:02.700> part<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.180> his<00:03:03.269> hair<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.720> then

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
lighter part of his hair and then

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.580 
lighter part of his hair and then
alternate<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.000> your<00:03:06.150> background<00:03:06.480> color<00:03:06.750> and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
alternate to your background color and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.920 
alternate to your background color and
get<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.769> darker<00:03:08.190> part<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.579> this<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:08.910> like<00:03:09.690> that

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
get a darker part of this here like that

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.890 
get a darker part of this here like that
and<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.769> it's<00:03:10.890> gonna<00:03:11.010> get<00:03:12.000> between<00:03:12.299> those<00:03:12.570> and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and so it's gonna get between those and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.259 
and so it's gonna get between those and
then<00:03:13.250> after<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.310> have<00:03:14.340> your<00:03:14.519> brush<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.000> just

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
then after you have your brush you just

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.500 
then after you have your brush you just
go<00:03:15.600> ahead<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.070> start<00:03:17.070> filling<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.299> hair

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
go ahead and start filling in the hair

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.050 
go ahead and start filling in the hair
and<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:19.019> can<00:03:19.140> see<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:20.850> does<00:03:21.720> charity<00:03:22.350> render

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
and you can see it does charity render

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.310 
and you can see it does charity render
and<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.780> go<00:03:24.900> ahead<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.140> bring<00:03:25.260> that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
and just go ahead and bring that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.610 
and just go ahead and bring that
hairline<00:03:25.920> down<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.280> about<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:27.440> normal<00:03:28.440> place

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
hairline down to about a normal place

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.150 
hairline down to about a normal place
where<00:03:28.890> he'll<00:03:29.489> ever<00:03:29.640> be

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
where he'll ever be

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.580 
where he'll ever be
human<00:03:30.580> being<00:03:30.820> it's<00:03:31.660> kind<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:31.900> blended<00:03:32.350> into

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
human being it's kind of blended into

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.860 
human being it's kind of blended into
his<00:03:32.710> original<00:03:33.550> hair<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.510> then<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:36.280> can<00:03:36.400> see

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
his original hair and then you can see

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.510 
his original hair and then you can see
you<00:03:37.870> can<00:03:37.960> see<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.320> detail<00:03:38.680> right<00:03:38.860> now<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.100> if

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
you can see the detail right now but if

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.150 
you can see the detail right now but if
we<00:03:39.580> go<00:03:39.790> ahead<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.830> zoom<00:03:41.830> out<00:03:42.040> then<00:03:42.460> I<00:03:42.760> mean<00:03:44.160> you

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
we go ahead and zoom out then I mean you

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.640 
we go ahead and zoom out then I mean you
fixed<00:03:45.550> it<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:45.940> like<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:49.500> then<00:03:50.500> what<00:03:50.620> I

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
fixed it just like that and then what I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.210 
fixed it just like that and then what I
like<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.830> do<00:03:51.100> is<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.640> like<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:52.330> go<00:03:53.290> ahead<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.620> I

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.710 

could<00:03:57.220> go<00:03:57.310> ahead<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.550> merge<00:03:58.120> all<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.540> my

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
could go ahead and merge all of my

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.480 
could go ahead and merge all of my
layers<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:02.080> then<00:04:02.290> nobody<00:04:02.740> can<00:04:02.980> tell<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.430> I

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
layers so then nobody can tell that I

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.840 
layers so then nobody can tell that I
edited<00:04:03.820> anything<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:04.960> it<00:04:05.680> really<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.820> really

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
edited anything and it really it really

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.220 
edited anything and it really it really
freaks<00:04:07.330> him<00:04:07.510> out<00:04:07.630> so<00:04:09.360> that's<00:04:10.360> how<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:10.660> fix

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
freaks him out so that's how you fix

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.910 
freaks him out so that's how you fix
hair<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.070> thanks
