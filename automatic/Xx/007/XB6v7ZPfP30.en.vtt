00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this game he's very much like the David

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.819 
this game he's very much like the David
Luiz<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> Serie<00:00:54.300> A<00:00:54.390> League<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.710> of

Luiz of the Serie A League and one of
the<00:00:55.920> weird<00:00:56.219> chemistry<00:00:56.640> glitches<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.329> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the weird chemistry glitches is you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.299 
the weird chemistry glitches is you
actually<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.930> back<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.379> sometimes<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
actually have to back out sometimes to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.650 
actually have to back out sometimes to
show<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> correct<00:00:59.879> chemistry<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
show the correct chemistry and as you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.090 
show the correct chemistry and as you
can<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:01.140> three<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.710> those<00:01:01.890> guys

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
can see all three of those guys

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
can see all three of those guys
obviously<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.940> nine<00:01:03.120> chemistry<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.019> know

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
obviously get nine chemistry you know

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.840 
obviously get nine chemistry you know
they're<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.409> Italian<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:05.430> play<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
they're all Italian and they all play in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.620 
they're all Italian and they all play in
this<00:01:05.970> area<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.280> awesome

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
this area so that is just an awesome

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.690 
this area so that is just an awesome
recipe<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.049> chemistry<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.520> team

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
recipe for good chemistry and this team

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.039 
recipe for good chemistry and this team
is<00:01:11.729> gonna<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> whole<00:01:12.420> bunch<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.750> different

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
is gonna have a whole bunch of different

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
is gonna have a whole bunch of different
elements<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.530> begin<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:13.920> we're<00:01:14.070> gonna<00:01:14.130> start

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
elements to begin with we're gonna start

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.030 
elements to begin with we're gonna start
with<00:01:14.580> sort<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.060> serie<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.020> theme<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
with sort of a serie a theme to it and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.590 
with sort of a serie a theme to it and
then<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.250> obviously<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.759> Chris<00:01:18.000> Ito<00:01:18.299> here<00:01:18.509> on

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then we obviously have Chris Ito here on

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390 
then we obviously have Chris Ito here on
the<00:01:18.689> left<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:19.080> who's<00:01:19.470> Italian<00:01:19.979> links<00:01:20.280> up

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the left back who's Italian links up

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.070 
the left back who's Italian links up
nicely<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:20.909> Chiellini<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> reason<00:01:21.840> why

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
nicely with Chiellini but the reason why

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080 
nicely with Chiellini but the reason why
i<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.290> Chris<00:01:22.530> c2<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.009> there<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:23.909> of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
i have Chris c2 and there is because of

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
honestly I'm when it comes to the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.460

midfield<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.760> 433<00:02:46.390> formation<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.080> really

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
midfield of a 433 formation it really

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.720 
midfield of a 433 formation it really
doesn't<00:02:47.770> make<00:02:47.830> too<00:02:48.010> much<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.400> difference

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
doesn't make too much of a difference

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.330 
doesn't make too much of a difference
and<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.110> finalize<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.350> midfield<00:02:50.709> we<00:02:50.890> do<00:02:51.100> have

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340

of his long Charles in this particular
clip<00:03:21.190> as<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.730> might<00:03:21.970> be<00:03:22.120> doing<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.450> review<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.750> him

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
clip as I might be doing a review on him

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.390 
clip as I might be doing a review on him
i'm<00:03:23.140> not<00:03:23.290> entirely<00:03:23.530> sure<00:03:23.709> because<00:03:24.040> i<00:03:24.070> really

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
i'm not entirely sure because i really

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.460 
i'm not entirely sure because i really
do<00:03:24.550> think<00:03:24.580> he<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.330> good<00:03:25.600> unfortunately

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
do think he is that good unfortunately

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.140 
do think he is that good unfortunately
he<00:03:26.560> does<00:03:26.769> only<00:03:26.950> have<00:03:27.160> two<00:03:27.430> star<00:03:27.700> skills<00:03:28.000> though

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
he does only have two star skills though

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.509 
he does only have two star skills though
so<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.540> could<00:03:28.750> be<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.900> bit<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.350> letdown<00:03:30.100> to

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
so that could be a bit of a letdown to

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.759 
so that could be a bit of a letdown to
anyone<00:03:30.910> who<00:03:31.060> relies<00:03:31.480> heavily<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:31.959> skills<00:03:32.560> in

anyone who relies heavily on skills in
this<00:03:32.890> game<00:03:33.100> then<00:03:33.880> as<00:03:34.030> strike<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.480> have

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
not 99 and that's because danny is

though it's okay for him to be on 7
chemistry<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:11.830> know<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.010> could<00:04:12.340> get<00:04:12.640> this<00:04:12.790> to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
chemistry you know you could get this to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.910 
chemistry you know you could get this to
a<00:04:12.970> 99<00:04:13.360> chemistry<00:04:13.750> team<00:04:13.900> if<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.440> were<00:04:14.590> really

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
a 99 chemistry team if you were really

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.250 
a 99 chemistry team if you were really
wanting<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:15.519> but<00:04:15.910> for<00:04:16.090> me<00:04:16.209> Danny<00:04:16.840> was<00:04:17.080> just

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
wanting that but for me Danny was just

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.719 
wanting that but for me Danny was just
such<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.440> key<00:04:17.680> player<00:04:17.950> that<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.160> really<00:04:18.459> wanted

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
such a key player that I really wanted

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.340 
such a key player that I really wanted
him<00:04:18.850> involved<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.479> plot<00:04:19.630> in<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.959> team<00:04:20.140> so

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
him involved in the plot in the team so

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.200 
him involved in the plot in the team so
you<00:04:20.709> could<00:04:20.859> still<00:04:21.220> very<00:04:21.430> much<00:04:21.609> have<00:04:21.849> this<00:04:22.030> team

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
you could still very much have this team

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.640 
you could still very much have this team
maybe<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.539> just<00:04:22.660> have<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.930> change<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.289> center

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
maybe you just have to change the center

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.620 
maybe you just have to change the center
midfielder<00:04:24.099> from<00:04:24.280> Danny<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.120> different<00:04:25.510> one

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
midfielder from Danny to a different one

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.040 
midfielder from Danny to a different one
and<00:04:25.660> possibly<00:04:26.260> have<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.770> change

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
and possibly have to change

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.629 
and possibly have to change
left-back<00:04:27.470> but<00:04:27.740> let<00:04:27.889> me<00:04:27.919> talk<00:04:28.129> a<00:04:28.159> little<00:04:28.400> bit

left-back but let me talk a little bit

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.760 
left-back but let me talk a little bit

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
about the team and more importantly the

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.230 
about the team and more importantly the
attacking<00:04:31.159> options<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:31.759> I<00:04:31.789> haven't<00:04:31.970> really

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
attacking options that I haven't really

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.980 
attacking options that I haven't really
gone<00:04:32.389> into<00:04:32.720> too<00:04:32.930> much<00:04:33.139> yet<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:33.800> um<00:04:34.750> right<00:04:35.750> wing

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
control is incredible that's probably

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.339 
control is incredible that's probably
the<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:41.150> big<00:04:41.360> thing<00:04:41.569> that<00:04:41.690> separates<00:04:42.139> him

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
the the big thing that separates him

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.899 
the the big thing that separates him
from<00:04:42.379> all<00:04:42.830> of<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.099> other<00:04:43.129> right<00:04:43.460> wings<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:43.849> I

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
from all of the other right wings that I

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.059 
from all of the other right wings that I
played<00:04:44.210> with<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:44.840> know<00:04:44.960> his<00:04:45.199> bowl<00:04:45.440> control<00:04:45.889> is

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
played with you know his bowl control is

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.820 
played with you know his bowl control is
really<00:04:46.550> sweet<00:04:47.030> his<00:04:47.960> left<00:04:48.259> foot<00:04:48.440> he's<00:04:48.620> got<00:04:48.800> a

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
really sweet his left foot he's got a

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.960 
really sweet his left foot he's got a
really<00:04:49.009> nice<00:04:49.220> left<00:04:49.520> foot<00:04:49.669> which<00:04:49.819> actually

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
really nice left foot which actually

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.820 
really nice left foot which actually
works<00:04:50.509> really<00:04:50.690> well<00:04:50.990> because<00:04:51.259> he<00:04:51.470> does<00:04:51.650> play

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
works really well because he does play

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.499 
works really well because he does play
on<00:04:51.949> the<00:04:52.039> right<00:04:52.190> wing<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.639> means<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.150> can<00:04:53.300> cut

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
on the right wing it means you can cut

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.659 
on the right wing it means you can cut
inside<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:54.440> can<00:04:54.590> fire<00:04:54.800> off<00:04:54.830> on<00:04:55.310> his<00:04:55.430> left

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
inside and you can fire off on his left

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.070 
inside and you can fire off on his left
foot<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:55.849> that<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.210> really<00:04:56.479> important<00:04:56.900> in<00:04:56.960> my

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
foot and that is really important in my

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.110 
foot and that is really important in my
opinion<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.560> then<00:04:57.889> we<00:04:57.979> have<00:04:58.129> varela<00:04:58.490> are<00:04:58.759> left

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
opinion and then we have varela are left

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.360 
opinion and then we have varela are left
winger<00:04:59.419> varela<00:04:59.780> is<00:05:00.020> an<00:05:00.169> underrated<00:05:00.680> player<00:05:01.129> a

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
winger varela is an underrated player a

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.939 
winger varela is an underrated player a
lot<00:05:01.849> of<00:05:01.879> people<00:05:02.000> who<00:05:02.690> don't<00:05:02.960> have<00:05:03.050> Ronaldo<00:05:03.800> or

lot of people who don't have Ronaldo or
just<00:05:04.250> instantly<00:05:04.699> jump<00:05:04.969> to<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.210> fact<00:05:05.419> that

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
just instantly jump to the fact that

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.939 
just instantly jump to the fact that
they<00:05:05.690> need<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:05.930> just<00:05:06.229> put<00:05:06.349> in<00:05:06.469> an<00:05:06.680> e<00:05:06.710> instead

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
they need to just put in an e instead

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.219 
they need to just put in an e instead
