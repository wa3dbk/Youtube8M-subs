00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
left hand you just play an octave like

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:38.000 
left hand you just play an octave like
um<00:00:26.160> F<00:00:26.970> sharp<00:00:28.609> like<00:00:29.609> these<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:33.710> an<00:00:34.710> A<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:36.800> B<00:00:37.800> flat

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
um F sharp like these to an A and B flat

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.470 
um F sharp like these to an A and B flat
you<00:00:38.399> want<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> keep<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.850> doing<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.120> while

step<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.619> flooded<00:01:20.509> do<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:22.050> time

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
step to be flooded do that for time

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.240 
step to be flooded do that for time
instead<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.440> time<00:01:25.649> instead<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.979> waiting

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
instead of that time instead of waiting

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
instead of that time instead of waiting
for<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> four<00:01:26.970> times<00:01:27.149> you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.660> go

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
for the four times you can just go

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:38.210 
for the four times you can just go
straight<00:01:27.840> into<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.320> octave<00:01:31.950> G<00:01:33.979> &amp;<00:01:34.979> G<00:01:35.490> sharp<00:01:37.220> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
straight into the octave G &amp; G sharp so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.760 
straight into the octave G &amp; G sharp so
it's<00:01:38.429> going<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:38.610> sound<00:01:38.789> like

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.080 

do<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.920> twice<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:48.520> then<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:48.759> just<00:01:48.909> play

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
do that twice and then you just play

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.389 
do that twice and then you just play
right<00:01:49.719> hand<00:01:49.960> just<00:01:50.860> play<00:01:51.130> b<00:01:51.729> &amp;<00:01:51.970> e<00:01:54.450> twice<00:01:56.399> then

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
right hand just play b &amp; e twice then

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:05.090 
right hand just play b &amp; e twice then
you<00:01:57.610> go<00:01:57.759> here<00:01:59.070> twice<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.829> once<00:02:03.280> again<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:04.179> go

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you go here twice then once again you go

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:20.250 
you go here twice then once again you go
back<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:08.910> F<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:16.090> after<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.599> you<00:02:17.170> go<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:19.260> F

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
back to F then after that you go to F

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:31.350 
back to F then after that you go to F
sharp<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.830> be<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.209> left<00:02:25.360> hand<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.630> go<00:02:30.360> so

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
strategy wait from Abby to g2 then you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.170 
strategy wait from Abby to g2 then you
go<00:02:59.990> 11<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.750> go<00:03:02.900> here<00:03:03.730> then<00:03:04.730> after<00:03:05.030> that
