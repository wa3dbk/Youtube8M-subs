00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
distance oh you still got that long

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.210 
distance oh you still got that long
float<00:04:28.190> time<00:04:28.570> but<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:29.600> get<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.410> jump<00:04:30.770> so

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
float time but just get that jump so

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.250 
float time but just get that jump so
stop<00:04:31.430> says<00:04:31.640> you<00:04:31.910> know<00:04:32.000> it's<00:04:32.570> quite<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.810> design

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
stop says you know it's quite a design

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.860 
stop says you know it's quite a design
flaw<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:33.620> my<00:04:33.740> opinion<00:04:34.540> it's<00:04:35.540> not<00:04:35.690> nice

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
flaw in my opinion it's not nice

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.200 
flaw in my opinion it's not nice
sometimes<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.710> just<00:04:36.830> sits<00:04:37.760> there<00:04:37.850> the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
sometimes it just sits there the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.980 
sometimes it just sits there the
relative<00:04:38.600> thing<00:04:39.010> while<00:04:40.010> clicking<00:04:40.220> both<00:04:40.490> ends

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
relative thing while clicking both ends

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.420 
relative thing while clicking both ends
so<00:04:43.930> that's<00:04:44.930> about<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.230> for<00:04:45.410> my<00:04:45.740> review<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.310> the

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
so that's about it for my review of the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.880 
so that's about it for my review of the
xstreet<00:04:46.790> it's<00:04:47.419> not<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.720> fan<00:04:48.140> mouse<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.680> quite<00:04:48.860> a
