00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.230
 then it is not official but almost 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:14.400
 made the juventus 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.719
 sportmediaset says took bala I wanted 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.920
 greet the interists with it 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.859
 expected 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.830
 hello Milanists hello foreigners that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:29.609
 they wanted to hello our mom 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:34.469
 my mom away from launching this guys here 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:38.940
 I tell you, I'll tell you if you can 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.520
 keep your head in place but like all 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.309
 champions around 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:50.219
 I say that it is easy for this to happen 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.629
 say what to say we took maybe 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.399
 Italy 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.149
 the strongest player around me 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.769
 I remember when there was iturbe I said 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:10.830
 these are fast, yes, but we have it here 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:14.880
 since there is very little 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.220
 indeed being pessimistic is given further 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.659
 pessimism just one thing is not 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.590
 apt one 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.090
 a bala for a player who a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.930
 my opinion have yet to show 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.030
 what able to do the levels says 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.290
 you know it reminds me well 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.049
 neymar I say this because if in the juve 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.350
 tevez has made the best vintage of the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.000
 career because it is so 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.000
 tevez is as old as he is 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.090
 you can imagine dancing with le 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.880
 ballistic skills that now a 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.579
 left tightrope walker made of rubber bends yes 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.259
 contorce part taken crazy and sees 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.979
 the door 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.979
 incredible assists 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.030
 I remind you that there was jovetic and it is not 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.590
 arrived there was all the players who did not 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.979
 will this be where the fuck came six 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.900
 arrived and practically a greeting 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:19.700
 all Juventus and juve b until now 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:24.440
 tevez looks like it remains po cuba is out 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:30.040
 from the market but we already have a cold 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.040
 throat or if he has tevez arrives cavani 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:41.060
 I dare not think I dare not think morata 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.640
 alive of those two counterattack there like 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.870
 goods that I do not know if I do not believe it 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.430
 that the networks even in the operation 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.459
 when you go bari the appears a 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:55.970
 the other one there that wakes up colors and 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.930
 that is, the numbers are fast too 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.860
 in short, juventus has the player 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.130
 strongest in the world 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.510
 no, however, one of this year the hand of the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.209
 stronger because there is a Cuban group 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.970
 absolutely cms then put us who 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.269
 you want another to cuba and elia 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.389
 in just behind because it's true that you put 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:25.639
 finalizes a little beard steal game 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:29.000
 ball goes to set goes to conclude in 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:31.180
 area end outside the tow area i 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.889
 balloons at a meter and a half high 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.099
 if we look right at the lines 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:42.829
 but it decides the grim little game the 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:45.430
 fuck builds there is a sos and laugh 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:50.150
 account that you are talking about means of balai 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.000
 I made a comparison that holds flock and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:58.220
 life of why in my opinion it is not 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.180
 yet exploded escape with the cagliari 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.250
 put behind them if he keeps 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.200
 and if he plays madrid I say I am 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.030
 I do so in the head 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.329
 we haven't done anything yet with 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.739
 father we don't talk because now 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:21.940
 start you and I have already passed 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:24.100
 which is good for fourth place then you do 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:30.759
 you make tv you make you do let us pass 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:34.830
 this part hello to all juventini e 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.830
