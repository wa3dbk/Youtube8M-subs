00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 what goes from happy near much 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.770
 fifa here and welcome to 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.720
 a little decision video 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.670
 then girlfriend, it is not really to 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.410
 but believe stefan and I have unfortunately 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 still no fifa 14 that's because 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.340
 that unfortunately there are problems as before 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.900
 we should get assigned to the game 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.010
 but unfortunately we can not do it here 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.660
 There have been some 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.430
 delivery problems is really annoying 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 yes and the early access is still 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.000
 Expired so now can not really 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.140
 FIFA 14 play but yes in the video 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.970
 It's about it I wanted you 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.859
 namely, as we chewed in with lex 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.240
 start the first league we are us 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.800
 first make a bronze team 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.450
 with pastels and then work us up 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.710
 on silver and then gold or but 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.510
 directly with a hot gold team 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 start so I have so many points but 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.030
 I could definitely get such a gold 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.410
 team with pascal on assemble 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.850
 but there are also many bronze 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.989
 players who can play very well so 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.040
 where I have you now the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.719
 leave a decision 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.690
 with it now in comments 2 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.940
 leave comments once with 2 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 Comments once with bronze and once 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.370
 with gold you can decide where with 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.840
 So I should start with myself 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.489
 me actually for bronze 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.079
 what makes more buck and so high 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.340
 especially with the teams 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.140
 then also because it is getting more difficult 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.170
 if you climb the league, there is yes 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.309
 this year are 10 and not just five 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.790

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.369
 I have to think twice 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.979
