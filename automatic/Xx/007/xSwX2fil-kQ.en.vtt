edited<00:00:19.080> Li<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.500> grow<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.369> part<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.449> you're

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
edited Li and grow the part up so you're

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.090 
edited Li and grow the part up so you're
printing<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.140> layer<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.529> top<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.769> another

four<00:00:26.099> tiers<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.400> 3d<00:00:26.699> printing<00:00:27.029> because<00:00:27.359> it

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
four tiers is 3d printing because it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.750 
four tiers is 3d printing because it
gives<00:00:28.380> us<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.560> lot<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.769> advantages<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.670> able

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
gives us a lot of advantages and be able

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.700 
gives us a lot of advantages and be able
to<00:00:30.000> create<00:00:30.240> something<00:00:30.599> right<00:00:30.900> away<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.590> do

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to create something right away we can do

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.580 
to create something right away we can do
many<00:00:31.980> iterations<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.969> at<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> same<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.590> we

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
many iterations all at the same time we

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
many iterations all at the same time we
can<00:00:34.710> come<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:34.890> engineer<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.790> say<00:00:36.000> I've<00:00:36.660> got

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
can come out engineer can say I've got

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
can come out engineer can say I've got
some<00:00:37.350> ideas<00:00:37.500> I've<00:00:37.950> got<00:00:38.100> five<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:38.489> six

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
some ideas I've got five or six

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.740 
some ideas I've got five or six
different<00:00:38.820> parts<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.300> really<00:00:39.480> don't<00:00:39.629> know

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
different parts I really don't know

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
different parts I really don't know
which<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.290> we'll<00:00:41.190> make<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.399> all

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
which one I want we'll make them all

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.400 
which one I want we'll make them all
once<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.329> we'll<00:00:42.420> make<00:00:42.540> them<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> very<00:00:43.050> short

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
once and we'll make them on a very short

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.319 
once and we'll make them on a very short
period<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.760> they'll<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.000> able<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> put

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
period of time so they'll be able to put

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
period of time so they'll be able to put
those<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.629> tests<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.110> say<00:00:46.230> okay<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.070> gives

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
those on tests and say okay this gives

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.560 
those on tests and say okay this gives
me<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> direction<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:48.120> gonna<00:00:48.210> go<00:00:48.390> I'm

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
me a direction and now I'm gonna go I'm

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.450 
me a direction and now I'm gonna go I'm
gonna<00:00:48.629> make<00:00:48.809> three<00:00:49.320> new<00:00:49.530> parts<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.309> are

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
gonna make three new parts that are

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
gonna make three new parts that are
completely<00:00:51.390> different<00:00:51.510> than<00:00:51.809> these<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
completely different than these but it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.319 
completely different than these but it
gave<00:00:52.739> me<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> information<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
gave me the information you can do that

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.639 
gave me the information you can do that
time<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:54.719> time<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> time<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> time<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> time

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
time at time to time the time to time

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
time at time to time the time to time
again<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.789> come<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> really

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
again and come up with a really

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.420 
again and come up with a really
optimized<00:00:58.350> part<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> end<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> day<00:00:59.219> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
optimized part at the end of the day and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.860 
optimized part at the end of the day and
that's<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.730> because<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> speed<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> we

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that's all because of the speed that we

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.689 
that's all because of the speed that we
can<00:01:01.140> produce<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.859> prototype<00:01:02.250> parts<00:01:02.520> with

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
can produce the prototype parts with

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
can produce the prototype parts with
without<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.809> we're<00:01:03.960> literally<00:01:04.170> taking

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
without so we're literally taking

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.940 
without so we're literally taking
something<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.949> took<00:01:05.309> 16<00:01:06.180> weeks<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.950> taking

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
something that took 16 weeks and taking

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
something that took 16 weeks and taking
it<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.610> couple<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.939> days<00:01:09.090> 3d

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it down to just a couple of days 3d

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.230 
it down to just a couple of days 3d
parts<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.310> prototype<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:12.090> on

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
parts that we make for prototype go on

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.359 
parts that we make for prototype go on
every<00:01:12.689> part<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> vehicle<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.130> think

these parts that are made using these
additive<00:01:24.939> technologies<00:01:25.749> are<00:01:26.439> very<00:01:27.009> similar

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
additive technologies are very similar

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.880 
additive technologies are very similar
to<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.759> real<00:01:27.939> part<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.869> 3d<00:01:29.170> printed<00:01:29.590> parts

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
to the real part the 3d printed parts

to the real part the 3d printed parts
out<00:01:30.219> of<00:01:30.280> sand<00:01:30.670> makes<00:01:31.329> you<00:01:31.420> make<00:01:31.569> a<00:01:31.659> casting<00:01:32.109> so

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
out of sand makes you make a casting so

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.289 
out of sand makes you make a casting so
that<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.770> basically<00:01:32.979> identical<00:01:33.609> to<00:01:33.939> a

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
that is basically identical to a

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.149 
that is basically identical to a
production<00:01:34.750> casting<00:01:34.959> you<00:01:35.770> know<00:01:35.829> we're<00:01:36.130> just

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
production casting you know we're just

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.679 
production casting you know we're just
using<00:01:36.429> a<00:01:36.579> different<00:01:36.670> technology<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.420> make<00:01:37.569> the

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
using a different technology to make the

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.080 
using a different technology to make the
mold<00:01:37.929> than<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.319> would<00:01:38.469> in<00:01:38.560> production<00:01:39.039> so<00:01:39.640> we

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
mold than you would in production so we
