side I'm sorry of this side of the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.910 
side I'm sorry of this side of the
exhaust<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> other<00:02:24.240> side<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
exhaust is on the other side this on the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.860 
exhaust is on the other side this on the

you<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.020> don't<00:02:28.140> hook<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.590> once<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.490> do

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
you just don't hook this once you do

you just don't hook this once you do
that<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.030> recommend<00:02:30.570> taking<00:02:30.720> off<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.200> little

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that I recommend taking off this little

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.000 
that I recommend taking off this little
piece<00:02:31.940> which<00:02:32.940> goes<00:02:33.660> inside<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> exhaust

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
piece which goes inside of the exhaust

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.460 
piece which goes inside of the exhaust
like<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.130> seal<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> pretty<00:02:38.459> much

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
like this just to seal it pretty much

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.500 
like this just to seal it pretty much
the<00:02:40.470> other<00:02:40.590> thing<00:02:40.800> Dan<00:02:41.130> moto<00:02:41.400> comes<00:02:41.730> with<00:02:42.000> this
