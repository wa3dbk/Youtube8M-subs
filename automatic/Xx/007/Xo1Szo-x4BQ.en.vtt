00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.739
 I do not have why we did it because the process is very easy what they are going to 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.269
 do 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.569
 but you do not have to be the first to know they're going to click on a window 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.959
 they will accept it 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.989

 and he's going to ask you to tell him not to use his presence, not out of fear 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.999
 to avoid time that I 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.659

 that you choose the sad what you want 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.409
 for example I want this 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.119
 they go here to 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.119
 they do not even give you a click 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.819
 on the image 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.629

 I do not do it anymore to avoid time but it's very easy 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.549
 once they dig the subject of the left the five branches of knowledge of the 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.419
 news the fact of bringing here 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.329

 from there we will select a folder that and second 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.909
 from there we're going to look for the folder that would do that 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.259
 recommended that you explain the letter r 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.409
 so that of flying towards and since then he is imprisoned 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.479

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:57.379

 p to activate the theme 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.470
