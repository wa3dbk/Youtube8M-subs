00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 if you like rpg you have to meet 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.640
 the legend online game completely 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.649
 translated you play straight from your 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.220
 browser and do not need a super pc 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:17.550
 fuck 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:19.289
 know and was supposed to be there. 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.449
 Just for you guys but I wanted to play. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.050
 commented and today's video is again 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.060
 about carla freire with xbox 360 a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.939
 possible first image of internet the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.730
 black ops 3 multiplayer exactly the same 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.559
 multiplayer game mode is a picture in the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.660
 truth from a monitor then the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.750
 People have a lot of good things, right? 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.850
 wasting much time this is the image is okay 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 there is not much that we can 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.840
 analyze but it is already useful 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.059
 so impressive the stretch in the move 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.329
 but the other stands out let us say so is 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.090
 that appears to be warned the type offer 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.940
 the gun until it's there reminds me a lot 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.070
 air sm1 site for example and the guy 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.440
 is in the air and all this impression of being a 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.189
 advent of ivory but finally this image 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.720
 so it 's black ops 3 sérgio and the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.270
 main point that gives us 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.710
 analyze this image is the mini map eu 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.909
 I think the mini map everyone goes 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.640
 to vote that is different is very 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.930
 similar to a mini map of the ghosts 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.180
 do you remember the mini map of the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.600
 I like it but it's in that style there it is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.509
 but this image is rectangular - square 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.060
 it's more open it 's wider let's say so 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.280
 and this is interesting should have new 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.009
 changes at least apa for this game 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.299
 because I've been mapping since changing since 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.700
 I do not like it 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.770
 o wcf has a profile that increases the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 Minimal vision I do not know if this is already 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.820
 embedded in the domain map of the black ops 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.439
 but I really like it because I like it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.979
 too him was the big winner faith is 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.079
 the peripheral or peripheral is the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.340
 people may notice that the mini bope map 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.799
 3 will be a little different will be 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.720
 more to the side of the goals, right? 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.149
 Otherwise, there's no way 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.270
 thing the image is all blurred 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.219
 purposefully obviously is is that the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.560
 people can see that he appears to be in the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.500
 high I do not know if he's floating up there 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.670
 he is under something is this wall 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.860
 left side gives me the impression 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.550
 of being a wall or organic in these 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.070
 can break the smooth wall 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.600
 there are two edges there that leave 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.280
 so let's say the parts 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.670
 lower and he has a 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.770
 other things on the wall in a few splinters 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.570
 of wood or something like that but the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.660
 center is flat, implying that 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.580
 it is the bauru apparatus, for example. 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.520
 Otherwise, we can see 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.780
 lower right corner of 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.540
 the sport flex 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.890
 we have three schools 33 lots for 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.010
 the safes but you can not have them 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.000
 inkling of what they are right and is 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.370
 that 's what we can do 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.890
 analyzing this image is evil as I said 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.020
 The main thing she brings us there is 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.180
 just this map a little 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.680
 slightly different from the standards 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.140
 that we have had in recent years. 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.270
 games here in right hark 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.670
 another interesting thing to notice 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.850
 this image is that the dealer who is 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.610
 playing that this piece from there the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.720
 gameplay is the guy took the picture and 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.370
 I'll talk about the sea myself. 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.580
 Only a little while he is playing 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.170
 playstation 4:09 xbox one is all 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.600
 This controversy this game goes to 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.739
 exclusivity because the duck goes to the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.660
 xbox hand 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.930
 We even have an xbox o years there but 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.030
 he is playing in a play 4 is and on the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.160
 marshawn lynch is that he's playing there 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.840
 is not there just for the invitation of the full 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.180
 I've had newspaper brand we will 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.580
 to be a character will be one of the villains 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.320
 of black ops 3 exactly but only 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.900
 for those who do not know is a nfl player 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.230
 American football, okay, one of the great 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.730
 football stars and he is 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.250
 very famous in the United States from where 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.750
 The sport is popular but here in Brazil 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.520
 maybe a lot of people did not know me 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.040
 I confess that I did not know 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.200
 I was researching soon after they were 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.090
 announced that he would be present at the 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.570
 because I'm not a big fan of 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.160
 Inersel but finally who is a fan for sure 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.310
 You must be very excited because yes 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.480
 he's going to be a character inside the box 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.790
 3 in it will be one of the villains of xbox 33 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.980
 ante notice that atinjam comes every year 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.660
 investing in someone in this industry . 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.760
 entertainment industry big 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.739
 entertainment and bringing to code 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.419
 It's the code of the eminem he did not 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.789
 was a gay character but he made a 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.360
 very big marketing by taste prugo 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.860
 because he released the clip of his song 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.259
 in that survival that included 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.090
 the song that has been playing in the trailer 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.099
 multiplayer and his clip in the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.020
 his music has had a lot of reference 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.270
 I like a single from Eden was 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.580
 completely towards the heat of the 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.439
 jury, last year the winner was the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.520
 We had Kevin Spacey is what's next 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:47.919
 dodo cinema was one of the main is 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.689
 character of the story and now this year 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.419
 coming from sport entertainment to 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.979
 People have marshawn lynch, and you're doing it. 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.539
 part of the game and will be one of the 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.759
 villains of the game have at last 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.949
 investing a lot of money and our 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.949
 personalities to try to increase more 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.319
 still martin in the code and that's it then 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.879
 is the news that predicts that today for you 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.379
 in this video comments that you think that 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.449
 Did you notice anything at all? 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.849
 more in this multiplayer mode image 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.620
 this first image I really do not 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.779
 I could not notice anything that made me 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.189
 draws more attention even was the mini map 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.810
 but do not worry because the company 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.250
 It's coming and in this e3 we'll have 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.229
 multiplayer and multiplayer gameplay 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.939
 sure a lot should come out in the 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.650
 internet, then stay 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.629
 linked to the greater coverage of botox you 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.770
 find on the channel if you liked 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.330
 2010 which has reached its limit and 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.860
 can your favorite and that's it 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.860
 so a hug, everybody gets god and until 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.860
 souls
