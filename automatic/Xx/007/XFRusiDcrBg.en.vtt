you've done that you can go ahead and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.340 
you've done that you can go ahead and
run<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.290> wire<00:01:16.670> from<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.360> existing

run a new piece of wire from that first

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.640 
run a new piece of wire from that first
can<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.270> location<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> second<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.500> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
can to the location of the second can so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
can to the location of the second can so
this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.070> you're<00:01:32.189> doing<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this is if you're doing it with to
