00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.580
 hi people i am kelly cripe too 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.210
 known as clement time and good you see 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.150
 here a kind of billiards is not like that 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.580
 missing the balls I think and well I have 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.050
 prepared here this that is simply 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.210
 some proof it's worth that I've been 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 doing to prove a little thing and we're going 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.890
 to put the balls so much here they are 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.950
 the balls as you see are sheep and good 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.060
 I have put here here what you see here 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.170
 who has his science then I'm going to 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.840
 explain a little bit of what all this is about 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.150
 and as you can see if you see right button there 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 it is a drawer what is basically worth 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.140
 this here is a plot but 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.250
 changed the entity and has something 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.740
 quite interesting that we're going to see 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.460
 Now we are going to give it a go here, here we go 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:02.660
 12 and let's see this to see what happens 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.239
 and good they all go for your corner 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.680
 goodbye my bad that is messing here to 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.600
 see if he marked some lamas la blanca 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.640
 is there has not entered and those from here are 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.409
 have been stuck or look into that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.030
 very good very good 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.590
 to see what happens here I will lose the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.820
 white will enter the white to enter and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 I have already lost 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.790
 there are aimed at deputies and this one here 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 will stay there all my life I will not go 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.060
 entered the black and I won finally going to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.590
 enter the white ole or how good is it here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.690
 you come to see and see what happens to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.280
 you and the white moves the white and it 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.320
 is here in a loop has a failure 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.550
 This is what I've been following 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.740
 a lot of time trying 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.710
 fix it and there seems to be no 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.930
 solution the issue of what the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.580
 corners are going to be straight I wanted to make 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.200
 something to be diverted in that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.229
 fact I have placed for you to think 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.210
 invisible do not know if you can appreciate 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.940
 see if I'm going a little bit in a hurry I do not know why 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.010
 where is it clear here 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.530
 there are times that I brake because there are 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.440
 invisible goods is worth there in that area 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.090
 Look, I brake, well, let's go 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.920
 end this suffering of the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.619
 poor sheep you have to shoot the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 because if it does not work well 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.340
 well this is quite simple let's 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.880
 expose here first a sheep here 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.520
 loose is worth and has its science guys 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.770
 you have sufficiency because you are 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.630
 on top of slim although it is not noticeable 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.730
 because good is a pretty thing 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.980
 curious in short that if I do for example 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.740
 well and I leave here below 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.960
 Well let's put this here so 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.550
 we leave it here covered good you see a 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.430
 cucumber let's gather this here as 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.950
 You see, you move, you see, it moves like this 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.390
 all the straight is worth then happens this is 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.860
 as a kind of book that what happens 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.500
 is what what you just saw down here 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.030
 but it happens up then it's worth 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.530
 it looks pretty cool, what happens is 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.240
 that there is a common block and below as 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.860
 You see here the command is good 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.110
 big 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.180
 good to color the sheep is with 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.280
 this command here so it's nothing 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.960
 difficult and it's a pretty command 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.090
 quite long but good enough 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.560
 cool and the truth because the map you have it 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.380
 the description if you want to look at it 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.780
 your account then you can 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.150
 download it and look at it if so although already 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.940
 I tell you not to dissolve the books 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.580
 so that they would cross the corners 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.340
 and were direct line is a problem 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.920
 pretty fat but good but still 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.470
 what counts is the idea because or 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.780
 deviated you see 6 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.690
 It works a lot even if you want it not but 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.430
 they serve quite the ends are here 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.050
 placed and deflect the ears then 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.360
 let's give it this that is what god 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.680
 want god there starts 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.270
 Well, I hope we liked it 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.090
 guys you have this map the description 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.790
 ok and you can watch it on your own 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.740
 that it's always going to be better, so it's 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.060
 not just go to the movies 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.970
 a greeting wants kripper and 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.450
 and peace 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.450
 and 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.880
 if you liked this video you can leave 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.650
 a like that does not cost or my god oh god 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.380
 mine in the forbidden zone of the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.550
 commands do not tie you damn 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.410
 they always kill me 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.170
 they always kill me just like script you're 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.170
 heavy fucking control 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.739
 Y
