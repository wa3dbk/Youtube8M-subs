00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.790
 Ok guys let's go let's start 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.140
 Now the couple's sertanejo class 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.090
 university 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.330
 Already a double class, so we'll do it. 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.940
 in double first I will pass the marking 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.100
 of each maneuver, that's right. 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.140
 We'll do it together later. 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 with Adam it 's not hard not to dance 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.220
 It is by itself very quiet and you will 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.869
 see that it will not be difficult, will not it? 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.840
 first I will make the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.680
 man then knights prepare man only 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.360
 or woman to do not to confuse you 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.719
 scoring so he will score his 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.219
 left leg in front of left 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:54.809
 So right front four 1234 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:56.760
 The one switching so as right 234 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.870
 if you had marched the first time alone 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.189
 the first is a little ahead then the 1 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:12.750
 234 alternating and then in trade with 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:18.390
 right and finished and marked on 2 312 312 34 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:28.520
 I repeat , it's good, let's go back to the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:36.720
 time now 78 and 1 2 3 4 123 again 12 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:40.170
 341 23 again 12 341 23 giving 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.000
 A quiet man, that's a beauty. 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.460
 basic marking does not actually dance 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.710
 separated in this together and loves doing 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.659
 Contrary to this time, then, I will. 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.689
 to pass the first marking of the lady now 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.990
 for we only make knights not 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:00.020
 needs to do damage unlike her 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:05.969
 mark right behind the mark so 1 2 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:08.250
 344 under the knee then starts here 11 23 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.390
 and she is under the knee, and there 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.400
 left 123 left knee raised 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.640
 km 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.590
 acting 123 this is actually a 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.579
 mirror is not making this space 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.150
 interleaved 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:31.989
 and look that guy works out okay then the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:35.870
 lady right back ago 781 23 under 12 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.720
 3123 rises 1 2 3 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.650
 Calm down then I scored both 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.900
 times of each and knights and ladies 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.420
 for the two to join us let's go 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.810
 make the law go with the arm to the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.950
 your front and back mark 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.200
 We're going to do with a couple each year 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.090
 he will do the drama part to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.170
 You understand the ladies understand for 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.540
 get easier then I checked here 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.450
 Let's go out with her hand long. 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.790
 knights who with the hand in his hand 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.159
 his right hand on the back of the arm 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.049
 slightly extended not fully 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:20.629
 not too close so medium here and the 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.799
 marking always happens to facilitate 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.139
 with the hand 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.849
 it is the hand that really gives the touch 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.769
 I'm going to do with the foot because it does not have 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.709
 How can I guess that I 'm leaving? 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.540
 run over, then stay here then 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.209
 If I touch it, it's a 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.709
 tight or a little shove 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.260
 She already realizes it 's time for him. 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.120
 back will leave with the right back 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.040
 of the man with the left front 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.780
 For now, not counting is for 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.500
 get easier instead of going out like this 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.659
 out of the blue 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.359
 Ok, let's go out with left 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:04:02.870
 front of a right behind 1878 to 1 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:04:08.090
 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 no 1 2 3 4 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.819
 1 2 3 and if in fact he went out to 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.229
 That I make a turn so that I can 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.750
 shift in the hall 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:17.359
 If I do not stay still, I'll do this. 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:22.159
 way it looks weird so 123 instead of 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.800
 123 so crack smoking 11 23 e 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:26.979
 I'm going to shoot then I'm going to shoot 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:38.060
 stay like this 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:45.020
 78 a 1 2 3 4 a 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:48.289
 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.620
 All right, this basic dance marking 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.189
 maybe you have some difficulty 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.509
 the class returns to class but then 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.430
 there are several styles to dance 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.169
 Any dance, we'll dance. 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.199
 here as basic as possible 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.240
 for you to pick up maybe now you will 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.099
 confront people dancing more 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.409
 clinging to this dance can be danced 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.250
 more clinging a little more than 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.590
 broken 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.389
 Yeah, but we're doing the basicÃ£o here. 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.189
 to get you cool and then do not 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.289
 increases persist looks one here looks 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.629
 There you get a little bit of each one. 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.270
 then this base marking will not go 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:25.339
 now make this mark with music 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.469
 dance circus music then prepare for 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:29.810
 train now and let's get together 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:31.430
 music I'm going to do the count 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.199
 Let's go out together because you'll know. 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.089
 if it is right or maybe 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.710
 Go dancing with the normal grass. 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:40.430
 who led the rider then if he has 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.050
 the wrong ho pas will leading you go 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.669
 drive the dance if you ever go in 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.620
 When you dance, take a look at the screen. 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.360
 If we have different then we have 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.159
 Something wrong, it's okay, come back to 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.020
 dance though beauty 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.020
 come go with music now ensures
