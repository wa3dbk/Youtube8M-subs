great<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.509> cut<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> priming<00:01:52.170> slide<00:01:52.409> so

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
great and I cut the priming slide so

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.440 
great and I cut the priming slide so
that<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.920> fits<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.850> long<00:01:54.060> shot<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that it fits because this long shot is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.719 
that it fits because this long shot is
still<00:01:54.689> clipped<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.590> priming<00:01:56.100> slide<00:01:56.340> had<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
still clipped so priming slide had to

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.389 
still clipped so priming slide had to
fit<00:01:57.320> whereas<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> stock<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:58.860> would<00:01:59.100> hit<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
fit whereas the stock one would hit the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.249 
fit whereas the stock one would hit the
clip<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.030> doesn't<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.110> even

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
clip this one doesn't and you can even

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.660 
clip this one doesn't and you can even
put<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.530> drum<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.280> still<00:02:02.490> fits

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
put a drum in here and it still fits

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.789 
put a drum in here and it still fits
that's<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:03.509> off<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> key<00:02:04.049> ring<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.469> here

that's right off a key ring back here

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
that's right off a key ring back here
and<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.340> not<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> key<00:02:06.119> ring<00:02:06.270> he

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and it's not actually a key ring he

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.119 
and it's not actually a key ring he
wanted<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.869> secondary<00:02:07.259> trigger<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.950> did

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
wanted a secondary trigger like I did

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:08.600 
wanted a secondary trigger like I did
with<00:02:08.250> my

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
with my

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.350 
with my
um<00:02:09.350> what<00:02:10.350> was<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> my<00:02:10.740> giveaway<00:02:11.070> blaster<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:12.150> I

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
um what was it my giveaway blaster but I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.270 
um what was it my giveaway blaster but I
didn't<00:02:12.630> have<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> materials<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.710> so

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
didn't have the materials to do that so

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.110 
didn't have the materials to do that so
or<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.210> time<00:02:15.420> really<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.470> um<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:17.010> did<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> next

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
or the time really but um I did the next

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.300 
or the time really but um I did the next
best<00:02:18.270> thing<00:02:18.690> which<00:02:18.750> was<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> heavy<00:02:19.680> steel<00:02:20.010> gauge

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
best thing which was a heavy steel gauge

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.250 
best thing which was a heavy steel gauge
wire<00:02:20.640> which<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> pain<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.050> butt<00:02:22.200> to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
wire which was a pain in the butt to

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.130 
wire which was a pain in the butt to
threat<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.190> got<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.240> done<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.570> there's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
threat but I got it done and there's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.960 
threat but I got it done and there's
this<00:02:25.530> isn't<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> key<00:02:26.130> ring<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.520> half<00:02:26.730> inch

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
that ready and it is a bit of a hard

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.580 
that ready and it is a bit of a hard
pull<00:02:47.370> uh<00:02:47.610> oh<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> BuzzFeed<00:02:49.470> right

pull uh oh is that a BuzzFeed right

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.760 
pull uh oh is that a BuzzFeed right
that's<00:02:49.800> fine<00:02:49.950> didn't<00:02:50.130> go<00:02:50.220> anywhere<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.000> um

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
that's fine didn't go anywhere but um

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.260 
that's fine didn't go anywhere but um
works<00:02:52.770> great<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.250> nice<00:02:53.400> tight<00:02:53.580> arm<00:02:53.610> now

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
works great it's a nice tight arm now

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.930 
works great it's a nice tight arm now
originally<00:02:54.959> he<00:02:55.170> wanted<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.940> path

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
originally he wanted this is a path

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.670 
originally he wanted this is a path
brass<00:02:57.300> breach<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:58.020> he<00:02:58.170> was<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.470> use

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
brass breach because he was going to use

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.160 
brass breach because he was going to use
stream<00:02:59.040> lines<00:02:59.220> in<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.520> so<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.690> angel<00:03:00.989> breached

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
stream lines in it so the angel breached

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.660 
stream lines in it so the angel breached
wouldn't<00:03:01.770> make<00:03:01.860> any<00:03:02.040> sense<00:03:02.160> because<00:03:02.520> it's

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
wouldn't make any sense because it's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.360 
wouldn't make any sense because it's
painted<00:03:03.000> but<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.330> do<00:03:03.860> streamlined<00:03:04.860> accepting

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
painted but to do streamlined accepting

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.100 
painted but to do streamlined accepting
it's<00:03:05.790> really<00:03:06.120> expensive<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.690> takes<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.959> lot<00:03:07.080> of

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
it's really expensive it takes a lot of

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.620 
it's really expensive it takes a lot of
time<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.850> overall<00:03:08.850> that's<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.330> lot<00:03:09.480> more

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
time and overall that's just a lot more

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.780 
time and overall that's just a lot more
money<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.410> what<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:10.770> decided<00:03:10.890> on<00:03:11.340> was<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.550> half

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
money so what we decided on was a half

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.270 
money so what we decided on was a half
brass<00:03:12.090> breach<00:03:12.650> which<00:03:13.650> works<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.100> lot<00:03:14.220> better

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
brass breach which works a lot better

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.650 
brass breach which works a lot better
with<00:03:14.610> stream<00:03:14.790> lines<00:03:14.970> too<00:03:15.150> because<00:03:15.360> there's<00:03:15.540> no

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
with stream lines too because there's no

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.259 
with stream lines too because there's no
dead<00:03:15.870> space<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:17.370> willing<00:03:17.850> long<00:03:17.970> barrel

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
dead space and the willing long barrel

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.340 
dead space and the willing long barrel
doesn't<00:03:18.540> really<00:03:18.690> matter<00:03:18.870> which<00:03:19.080> streamlines

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
doesn't really matter which streamlines

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.750 
doesn't really matter which streamlines
because<00:03:19.680> they're<00:03:19.830> going<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.040> fishtail<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.700> go

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
because they're going to fishtail and go

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.780 
because they're going to fishtail and go
all<00:03:20.940> over<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.269> place<00:03:21.450> anyway<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.440> um<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.950> did

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
all over the place anyway so um I did

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.130 
all over the place anyway so um I did
the<00:03:23.880> half<00:03:24.060> brass<00:03:24.330> mod<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.930> I've<00:03:25.019> been

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
the half brass mod and I've been

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.380 
the half brass mod and I've been
tinkering<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.739> with<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.459> all<00:03:26.670> morning<00:03:27.030> and

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
tinkering this with this all morning and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.380 
tinkering this with this all morning and
a<00:03:28.290> half<00:03:28.830> brass<00:03:29.070> mod<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.820> shaved<00:03:30.209> out

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
a half brass mod is just a shaved out

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.050 
a half brass mod is just a shaved out
barrel<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.959> brass<00:03:31.140> insert<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.910> there<00:03:32.910> was

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
barrel and a brass insert and there was

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.330 
barrel and a brass insert and there was
too<00:03:33.239> much<00:03:33.390> friction<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.410> dart<00:03:34.739> tooth

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
too much friction and the dart tooth

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.430 
too much friction and the dart tooth
wouldn't<00:03:35.940> push<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.720> dart<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.260> way<00:03:37.320> into

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
wouldn't push the dart all the way into

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.770 
wouldn't push the dart all the way into
the<00:03:37.590> barrel<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.310> after<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.820> five<00:03:39.299> hours<00:03:39.330> of

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the barrel so after like five hours of

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.930 
the barrel so after like five hours of
tinkering<00:03:40.380> today<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.920> decided<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.670> know<00:03:41.820> what

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
tinkering today I decided you know what

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.610 
tinkering today I decided you know what

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.120 
and we'll keep going so what I did
instead<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:50.010> added<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:51.269> que<00:03:51.959> 26<00:03:52.560> spring<00:03:52.860> to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
instead is I added a que 26 spring to

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.100 
instead is I added a que 26 spring to
the<00:03:53.250> longshot<00:03:53.670> spring<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.600> now<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:54.870> hitting

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
the longshot spring so now it's hitting

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.229 
the longshot spring so now it's hitting
really<00:03:55.920> nice<00:03:56.160> ranges<00:03:56.610> even<00:03:56.880> without<00:03:57.090> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
really nice ranges even without the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.660 
really nice ranges even without the
brass<00:03:57.420> inserts<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.049> it's<00:03:58.200> getting<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:58.620> 80<00:03:59.280> to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
brass inserts so it's getting like 80 to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.820 
brass inserts so it's getting like 80 to
100<00:04:00.060> feet<00:04:00.269> because<00:04:00.600> streamlines<00:04:01.049> are<00:04:01.230> rather

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
100 feet because streamlines are rather

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.789 
100 feet because streamlines are rather
inconsistent<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:02.970> it's<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.660> not<00:04:03.840> there<00:04:04.019> here

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
inconsistent but it's it not there here

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.900 
inconsistent but it's it not there here
we<00:04:04.860> go

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:17.350 

I<00:04:13.840> think<00:04:14.840> that's<00:04:15.170> all<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.530> had<00:04:15.830> loaded<00:04:16.360> yep

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
I think that's all I had loaded yep

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.460 
I think that's all I had loaded yep
that's<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.500> um<00:04:18.760> it's<00:04:19.760> very<00:04:20.060> nice<00:04:20.470> very

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
that's it so um it's very nice very

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.140 
that's it so um it's very nice very
crafty<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:22.490> really<00:04:22.910> really<00:04:23.150> like<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.940> works

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
crafty I really really like it it works

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.840 
crafty I really really like it it works
great<00:04:26.330> I<00:04:26.600> have<00:04:26.720> no<00:04:26.840> complaints<00:04:27.020> I'll<00:04:27.850> bring

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
here there we go so here we go it's a

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.140 
here there we go so here we go it's a
very<00:04:42.170> smooth<00:04:42.500> i<00:04:43.960> really<00:04:44.960> like<00:04:45.140> it<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:46.150> this

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
very smooth i really like it and this

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.990 
very smooth i really like it and this
it's<00:04:47.690> not<00:04:47.870> quite<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.770> shade<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.280> blue<00:04:49.640> that<00:04:49.670> my

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
it's not quite the shade of blue that my

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.520 
it's not quite the shade of blue that my
urban<00:04:50.360> long<00:04:50.540> shot<00:04:50.780> was<00:04:50.960> because<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.290> didn't

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
urban long shot was because I didn't

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.760 
urban long shot was because I didn't
have<00:04:51.710> any<00:04:51.890> more<00:04:52.070> of<00:04:52.100> that<00:04:52.190> color<00:04:52.550> but<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:54.620> would

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
have any more of that color but it would

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.920 
have any more of that color but it would
take<00:04:55.010> me<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.220> while<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.490> ship<00:04:55.940> that<00:04:56.150> color<00:04:56.420> to<00:04:56.780> me

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
take me a while to ship that color to me

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.540 
take me a while to ship that color to me
and<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.470> wanted<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.800> get<00:04:57.920> this<00:04:58.130> done<00:04:58.400> and

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
to glue around the plunger so it doesn't

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.790 
to glue around the plunger so it doesn't
scratch<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.910> paint<00:05:23.120> oh<00:05:23.270> that's<00:05:23.650> bent<00:05:24.650> a

little bit this one done no I'll give
you<00:05:28.700> that<00:05:28.820> one<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.210> I'll<00:05:29.419> do<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:29.930> wall<00:05:30.140> around

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
you that one and I'll do the wall around

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.670 
you that one and I'll do the wall around
it<00:05:30.530> but<00:05:30.980> um<00:05:31.160> yeah<00:05:31.580> after<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.060> while<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.690> pulling

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
it but um yeah after a while of pulling

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.860 
it but um yeah after a while of pulling
back<00:05:33.950> those<00:05:34.430> springs<00:05:34.880> this<00:05:35.120> actually<00:05:35.510> bends

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
back those springs this actually bends

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.230 
back those springs this actually bends
which<00:05:36.560> I<00:05:36.650> think<00:05:36.860> it's<00:05:36.980> really<00:05:37.130> funny<00:05:37.340> um<00:05:37.700> it

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
which I think it's really funny um it

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.730 
which I think it's really funny um it
pretty<00:05:38.600> much<00:05:38.750> happens<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.110> all<00:05:39.169> my<00:05:39.320> long<00:05:39.500> shots

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
pretty much happens to all my long shots

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.940 
pretty much happens to all my long shots
but<00:05:40.070> um<00:05:40.220> what<00:05:41.030> you<00:05:41.180> do<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.600> put<00:05:42.590> this<00:05:42.710> wall

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
but um what you do is put this wall

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.350 
but um what you do is put this wall
around<00:05:43.220> it<00:05:43.400> so<00:05:43.550> it<00:05:43.580> doesn't<00:05:43.669> scratch<00:05:44.000> the

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
around it so it doesn't scratch the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.560 
around it so it doesn't scratch the
paint<00:05:44.600> in<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.740> priming<00:05:46.250> bar<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.970> have<00:05:47.450> the

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
paint in this priming bar I have the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.540 
paint in this priming bar I have the
same<00:05:47.780> thing<00:05:48.050> here<00:05:48.740> on<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:48.890> other<00:05:48.950> side<00:05:49.100> so<00:05:49.460> it

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
same thing here on the other side so it

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.210 
same thing here on the other side so it
looks<00:05:49.700> really<00:05:49.850> nice<00:05:50.740> look<00:05:51.740> how<00:05:51.890> smooth<00:05:52.190> my

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
looks really nice look how smooth my

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.380 
looks really nice look how smooth my
camera<00:05:52.790> motion<00:05:52.970> is<00:05:54.040> this<00:05:55.040> camera<00:05:55.610> takes<00:05:55.910> 60

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
camera motion is this camera takes 60
