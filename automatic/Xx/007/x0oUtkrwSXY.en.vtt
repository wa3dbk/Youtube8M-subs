00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hey folks Matt Vermeer to the image comm

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.309 
hey folks Matt Vermeer to the image comm
so<00:00:02.760> our<00:00:02.850> last<00:00:03.030> video<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:03.659> were<00:00:03.780> talking<00:00:04.200> about

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
so our last video we were talking about

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.950 
so our last video we were talking about
the<00:00:04.620> differences<00:00:05.160> between<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.850> NEX<00:00:06.210> 6<00:00:06.660> and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the differences between the NEX 6 and

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.950 
the differences between the NEX 6 and
the<00:00:07.410> NEX<00:00:07.770> 7<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.429> gave<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> three<00:00:09.210> reasons<00:00:09.690> why

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
the NEX 7 I gave you a three reasons why

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.180 
the NEX 7 I gave you a three reasons why
you<00:00:10.650> might<00:00:10.920> want<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.610> NEX<00:00:12.120> 6<00:00:12.540> over<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.349> NEX<00:00:13.710> 7

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
you might want the NEX 6 over the NEX 7

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.039 
you might want the NEX 6 over the NEX 7
I'm<00:00:14.549> gonna<00:00:14.670> give<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.030> couple<00:00:15.450> reasons<00:00:15.630> why

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I'm gonna give you a couple reasons why

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.060 
I'm gonna give you a couple reasons why
you<00:00:16.710> might<00:00:16.920> want<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.699> NEX<00:00:18.150> 7<00:00:18.750> over<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> NEX<00:00:19.650> 6

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
you might want the NEX 7 over the NEX 6

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.700 
you might want the NEX 7 over the NEX 6
basically<00:00:20.820> there's<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.390> two<00:00:21.689> real<00:00:22.380> reasons

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
basically there's just two real reasons

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.310 
basically there's just two real reasons
there's<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> few<00:00:23.580> other<00:00:23.760> minor<00:00:23.850> ones<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
there's a few other minor ones so the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.769 
there's a few other minor ones so the
two<00:00:25.500> big<00:00:25.740> reasons<00:00:26.189> number<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:27.180> obviously

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
two big reasons number one is obviously

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.519 
two big reasons number one is obviously
the<00:00:28.019> sensor<00:00:28.470> 24<00:00:29.220> megapixels<00:00:30.029> versus<00:00:30.840> 16

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the sensor 24 megapixels versus 16

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.690 
the sensor 24 megapixels versus 16
megapixels<00:00:33.860> conversely<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.370> said<00:00:35.610> in

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
megapixels conversely to what we said in

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.940 
megapixels conversely to what we said in
the<00:00:35.730> last<00:00:35.820> video<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.809> you're<00:00:37.380> not<00:00:37.590> somebody

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the last video if you're not somebody

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.000 
the last video if you're not somebody
that<00:00:38.129> shoots<00:00:38.550> at<00:00:38.760> high<00:00:38.910> ISO<00:00:39.090> then<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.410> 24

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that shoots at high ISO then the 24

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.549 
that shoots at high ISO then the 24
megapixel<00:00:41.700> sensor<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.239> gonna<00:00:42.660> shine<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.440> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
megapixel sensor is gonna shine for you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.630 
megapixel sensor is gonna shine for you
at<00:00:43.710> base<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.730> OS<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.989> sony<00:00:46.320> 24<00:00:46.980> megapixel

aps-c<00:00:47.730> sensor<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.140> NEX<00:00:49.500> 7<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.160> probably

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
aps-c sensor in the NEX 7 is probably

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.779 
aps-c sensor in the NEX 7 is probably
the<00:00:51.719> best<00:00:52.110> sensor<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.129> market<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:53.730> now

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the best sensor on the market right now

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
the best sensor on the market right now
in<00:00:54.210> terms<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.690> resolving<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> most<00:00:55.530> detail

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
in terms of resolving the most detail

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.299 
in terms of resolving the most detail
and<00:00:56.370> giving<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.629> best<00:00:57.660> picture<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.190> if

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and giving you the best picture so if

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.189 
and giving you the best picture so if
you're<00:00:59.460> shooting<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.850> bass<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:01.020> you're

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you're shooting a bass a if you're

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.170 
you're shooting a bass a if you're
shooting<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.530> bass<00:01:01.770> iso's<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.640> you're<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
shooting a bass iso's if you're a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.960 
shooting a bass iso's if you're a
landscape<00:01:03.840> photographer<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.920> anything<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
landscape photographer or anything that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
landscape photographer or anything that
you<00:01:06.210> shoot<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.020> find<00:01:07.260> yourself<00:01:07.409> at<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you shoot you don't find yourself at the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.780 
you shoot you don't find yourself at the
higher<00:01:08.100> ISO<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.840> say<00:01:09.840> 800<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.560> under<00:01:10.890> then

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
higher ISO so say 800 and under then

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
higher ISO so say 800 and under then
that<00:01:12.000> sensors<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.750> an<00:01:12.840> advantage

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that sensors gonna be an advantage

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.950 
that sensors gonna be an advantage
instead<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> disadvantage

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
instead of a disadvantage

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
instead of a disadvantage
the<00:01:15.960> second<00:01:16.500> thing<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.009> you're<00:01:17.520> somebody<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the second thing if you're somebody that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.240 
the second thing if you're somebody that
wants<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.479> external<00:01:19.110> mic<00:01:19.380> jack<00:01:19.680> well<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
wants an external mic jack well then the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.300 
wants an external mic jack well then the
NEX<00:01:20.580> 7<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> you're<00:01:21.479> NEX<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.290> NEX<00:01:22.590> 6<00:01:22.950> doesn't

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
NEX 7 is you're NEX the NEX 6 doesn't

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.910 
NEX 7 is you're NEX the NEX 6 doesn't
have<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.210> simple<00:01:24.600> cut<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.200> dry<00:01:25.439> if

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
have one it's that simple cut and dry if

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
have one it's that simple cut and dry if
you<00:01:26.040> need<00:01:26.250> an<00:01:26.400> external<00:01:26.729> mic<00:01:27.060> jack<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you need an external mic jack go for the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.100 
you need an external mic jack go for the
NEX<00:01:28.560> 7<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.210> NEX<00:01:30.630> 6<00:01:30.960> is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
NEX 7 if you don't then the NEX 6 is

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
NEX 7 if you don't then the NEX 6 is
still<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> running<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> things

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
still in the running one of the things

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.960 
still in the running one of the things
that<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> would<00:01:33.810> mention<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.799> lot<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.850> us

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that I would mention is a lot of us

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.789 
that I would mention is a lot of us
aren't<00:01:36.210> bothering<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> external<00:01:37.650> mic

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
aren't bothering with the external mic

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
aren't bothering with the external mic
jacks<00:01:38.100> anyways<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:38.939> we're<00:01:39.240> using<00:01:39.479> an

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
jacks anyways because we're using an

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.499 
jacks anyways because we're using an
external<00:01:40.229> recorder<00:01:40.890> such<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> zoom<00:01:41.970> h2

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
external recorder such as the zoom h2

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
external recorder such as the zoom h2
that<00:01:42.540> I'm<00:01:42.869> using<00:01:43.049> right<00:01:43.229> here<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.220> we're

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that I'm using right here and then we're

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.940 
that I'm using right here and then we're
sinking<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.180> video<00:01:45.600> afterwards<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.770> me

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
sinking it in video afterwards to me

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.130 
sinking it in video afterwards to me
this<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> preferred<00:01:47.939> method<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> really

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
this is the preferred method so I really

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.530 
this is the preferred method so I really
don't<00:01:49.320> care<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:50.009> my<00:01:50.520> cameras<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> sink

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
don't care if my cameras have a sink

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.569 
don't care if my cameras have a sink
jack<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.049> nice<00:01:52.530> option<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.130> but

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
jack or not nice option to have but

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.609

doesn't really affect me or or the way I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.459 
doesn't really affect me or or the way I
do<00:01:55.770> video<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> lot<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.909> other<00:01:57.060> folks<00:01:57.469> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
do video or a lot of other folks the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.170 
do video or a lot of other folks the
other<00:01:58.619> minor<00:01:58.979> things<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.610> you're<00:01:59.759> gonna<00:01:59.880> see

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
other minor things that you're gonna see

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.560 
other minor things that you're gonna see
on<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> NEX<00:02:00.659> 7<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.790> little<00:02:02.790> bit<00:02:02.909> longer<00:02:03.329> battery

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
on the NEX 7 a little bit longer battery

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.130 
on the NEX 7 a little bit longer battery
life<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.189> much<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> talk<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.570> just

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
life not really much to talk about just

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
life not really much to talk about just
a<00:02:07.290> smidge<00:02:07.590> longer<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> NEX<00:02:08.580> 7<00:02:08.970> over<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
a smidge longer on the NEX 7 over the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.530 
a smidge longer on the NEX 7 over the
NEX<00:02:09.629> 6<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.619> smaller<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.489> lighter<00:02:11.580> again

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
NEX 6 it is smaller and lighter again

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.460 
NEX 6 it is smaller and lighter again
small

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
small

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
small
and<00:02:13.680> later<00:02:13.860> we're<00:02:14.100> talking<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.700> very<00:02:15.210> small

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and later we're talking to very small

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.540 
and later we're talking to very small
cameras<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.710> it's<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.340> you're

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
cameras here so it's not like you're

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.970 
cameras here so it's not like you're
talking<00:02:17.970> one<00:02:18.210> camera<00:02:18.690> that's<00:02:18.870> huge<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.800> one

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
talking one camera that's huge and one

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430 
talking one camera that's huge and one
that's<00:02:20.160> small<00:02:20.580> they're<00:02:21.180> almost<00:02:21.450> identical<00:02:21.900> in

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that's small they're almost identical in

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.680 
that's small they're almost identical in
size<00:02:22.650> anyway<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.610> smaller<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.270> lighter<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.660> a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
size anyway so smaller and lighter is a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.770 
size anyway so smaller and lighter is a
minor<00:02:25.050> issue<00:02:25.550> battery<00:02:26.550> life<00:02:26.760> -<00:02:27.000> minor<00:02:27.480> issue

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
minor issue battery life - minor issue

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.130 
minor issue battery life - minor issue
so<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:29.100> big<00:02:29.340> two<00:02:29.550> points<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.150> sensor<00:02:30.870> size

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
so your big two points are sensor size

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.860 
so your big two points are sensor size
and<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.040> external<00:02:32.370> mic<00:02:32.760> jack<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
and the external mic jack so if you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.840 
and the external mic jack so if you
think<00:02:34.020> either<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.500> those<00:02:34.740> are<00:02:34.980> something<00:02:35.250> that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
think either of those are something that

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.750 
think either of those are something that
is<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.900> more<00:02:37.410> important<00:02:37.800> for<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.160> than<00:02:38.550> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
is is more important for you than the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.060 
is is more important for you than the
NEX<00:02:39.090> seven<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.690> your<00:02:39.870> camera<00:02:40.260> over<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.710> NEX

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
NEX seven is your camera over the NEX

NEX seven is your camera over the NEX
