00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
back out there carburetors have been

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
back out there carburetors have been
synced<00:00:34.610> water<00:00:35.610> pump<00:00:35.910> looks<00:00:36.149> good<00:00:36.450> there<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
synced water pump looks good there is a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.229 
synced water pump looks good there is a
little<00:00:37.440> bit<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.770> gloop<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.149> I'm

right there there's a little bit of dink
not<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> big<00:00:53.160> deal<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.670> took<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> down<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> replace

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
not a big deal I took it down to replace

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.180 
not a big deal I took it down to replace
it<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.989> he's<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.260> no<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.469> good<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.920> patch

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
that with the jb weld stuff a little bit

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.470 
that with the jb weld stuff a little bit
of<00:01:00.690> corrosion<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.199> stuff<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.559> too

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
of corrosion and stuff in here too

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.840 
of corrosion and stuff in here too
same<00:01:03.480> deal<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:05.689> patching<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:10.850> there's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
same deal I'm patching that up there's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.010 
same deal I'm patching that up there's
don't<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.240> else<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> new<00:01:12.689> radiator

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
don't know what else it's a new radiator

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.980 
don't know what else it's a new radiator
the<00:01:13.380> old<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:14.060> was<00:01:15.060> flowing<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.659> really

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the old one was flowing really really

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.929 
the old one was flowing really really
fast<00:01:16.350> through<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.430> one's<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
fast through it so this one's got a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.160 
fast through it so this one's got a
little<00:01:18.090> more<00:01:18.210> resistance<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> flows<00:01:19.140> through

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
little more resistance it flows through

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.880 
little more resistance it flows through
but<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.040> quickly<00:01:21.320> issue<00:01:22.320> hasn't<00:01:22.770> gone

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
but not as quickly issue hasn't gone

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.390 
but not as quickly issue hasn't gone
away

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.870 

I'm<00:01:26.400> getting<00:01:26.700> ready<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.939> patch<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:29.430> intake

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
I'm getting ready to patch up the intake

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.940 
I'm getting ready to patch up the intake
here<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.350> not<00:01:34.350> sealant

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
here you can see it's a not sealant

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.120 
here you can see it's a not sealant
we're<00:01:35.369> gonna<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.939> sealing<00:01:36.240> real<00:01:36.540> well<00:01:36.720> in

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
we're gonna not sealing real well in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.730 
we're gonna not sealing real well in
there<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> I'm<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.420> reseal<00:01:39.869> around<00:01:40.439> this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
there so I'm going to reseal around this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.870 
there so I'm going to reseal around this
and<00:01:41.780> make<00:01:42.780> sure<00:01:42.930> that's<00:01:43.079> good<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.649> got<00:01:44.520> another

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and make sure that's good I got another

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.950 
and make sure that's good I got another
clamp<00:01:45.979> for<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:48.450> goes<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
clamp for the this goes on the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.550 
clamp for the this goes on the
carburetor<00:01:50.659> one<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> claims<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.200> missing

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
carburetor one of the claims was missing

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.260 
carburetor one of the claims was missing
I<00:01:52.649> was<00:01:52.799> zipping<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.790> there

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
I was zipping it on there

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.840 
I was zipping it on there
I<00:01:54.299> got<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> nucleant<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.820> here<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.850> that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
I got a nucleant for that here so that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.950 
I got a nucleant for that here so that
ought<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.590> I've<00:02:02.270> got<00:02:03.270> new<00:02:03.450> plugs<00:02:03.750> in

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
ought to do that I've got new plugs in

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.190 
ought to do that I've got new plugs in
it<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:05.369> wires<00:02:05.689> were<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> little<00:02:06.869> iffy<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
it the wires were a little iffy I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.430 
it the wires were a little iffy I
snipped<00:02:07.500> off<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.860> excess<00:02:08.280> trim<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.330> down

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
snipped off the excess trim that down

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.020 
snipped off the excess trim that down
got<00:02:10.440> them<00:02:10.560> connecting<00:02:11.009> better<00:02:11.160> got<00:02:11.580> nice<00:02:11.760> blue

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
got them connecting better got nice blue

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.309 
got them connecting better got nice blue
spark<00:02:12.330> now

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
spark now

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.649 
spark now
and<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.099> looks<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.209> coolants

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
and it looks like the the coolants

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.369 
and it looks like the the coolants
flowing<00:02:16.110> well<00:02:16.290> through<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> heads<00:02:18.379> and

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
flowing well through the heads and

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.780 
flowing well through the heads and
brought<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> test<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> other<00:02:20.129> side<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:20.730> I

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
brought the test the other side but I

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.339 
brought the test the other side but I
think<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.150> does<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.299> same<00:02:21.599> as<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> first<00:02:22.110> one

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
think it does the same as the first one

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.830 
think it does the same as the first one
it<00:02:22.650> did<00:02:22.829> last<00:02:23.040> when<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> pulled<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.549> apart<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.540> I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
it did last when I pulled it apart so I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.000 
it did last when I pulled it apart so I
kind<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> want<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.379> snake<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.769> out<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
kind of want to snake it out and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.210 
kind of want to snake it out and
everything<00:02:26.189> but<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.610> don't<00:02:27.209> see<00:02:27.599> an<00:02:27.689> issue<00:02:28.220> with

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
everything but I don't see an issue with

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.430 
everything but I don't see an issue with
I<00:02:31.640> don't<00:02:32.640> know

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
I don't know

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.800 
I don't know
carburetors<00:02:34.440> been<00:02:34.590> done<00:02:34.819> heads<00:02:35.819> are<00:02:36.150> flowing

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
carburetors been done heads are flowing
