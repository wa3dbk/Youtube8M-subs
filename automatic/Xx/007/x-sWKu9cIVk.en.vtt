00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
and annoyed that they will probably be

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.280 
and annoyed that they will probably be
using<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.200> lot<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.980> whole<00:03:08.160> nosebleed<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
using that a lot the whole nosebleed and

using that a lot the whole nosebleed and
I'm<00:03:10.290> I'm<00:03:11.070> not<00:03:11.310> gonna<00:03:11.460> really<00:03:11.790> say<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.420> that's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
I'm I'm not gonna really say that that's

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.750 
I'm I'm not gonna really say that that's
making<00:03:13.110> this<00:03:13.260> less<00:03:13.740> enjoyable<00:03:14.070> but<00:03:14.610> it's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
making this less enjoyable but it's

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.310
