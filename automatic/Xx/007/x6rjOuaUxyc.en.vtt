00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.960
 new district 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:28.600
 drying punch from and simone bought 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:31.050
 talk about them now they have a good Monique he 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.050
 fell down 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:45.210
 hello this is my nickname that she stands 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.210
 is empty 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.230
 given empty 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.410
 it is you 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.410
 will take 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 this face is perfect 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:49.920
 let's go a little bit 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:02.240
 not broke 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:10.960
 how bullshit do it like that 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.960
 lay down close on the piece of iron 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.640
 but 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.710
 I certainly think the draw was incomprehensible 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:51.290
 as if we fell to the benefit so give 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.290
 red vein layer can be bought 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.290
 recommends 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.930
 the first minus of these sleds is that they are not 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.230
 getting out luggage storage is very bad it 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.530
 very bad if we get hungry before 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:25.620
 finished off the day with myself a clean plus one i 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:25.620
 I fight to fight under your breath like a tray 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.709
 anything 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.980
 stable under the feet can be the difference 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.790
 fucking i'm for him all if anything come up with 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.620
 peanuts 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.620
 but you are not a magician truck dance sunset 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:17.950
 the nurse is comfortable that 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.950
 and herzog dancing wow and what's the catch 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.990
 up windows 8 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.990
 whole 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:57.460
 yes your ass I can jump an hour and then 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.460
 Fuh it's for my cracked 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.460
 cracked 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:11.169
 and so we learned that as a leasing she 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.120
 very good but a little on February 1 this 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.909
 she is not at all cracked 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.219
 reusable matrix is ​​broken if 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.250
 used adequately if used 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:24.120
 only adequately that principle she can 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.120
 serve much longer 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:42.300
 come on and still 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:59.450
 fine 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:06:03.670
 and ilya everything works everything works 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.670
 the tree is not all as it should be 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:48.210
 the next moron on the other side 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:48.210
