00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.299
 the process of carbonic maceration is the traditional fermentation system 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.299
 of the river harvesters 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.869
 It is a winemaking method that is carried out in pairs and usually lasts 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.869
 two to three weeks 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.839
 The carbonic maceration consists in the fermentation of the whole bunches without 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.039
 separate mutuals 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.919
 the weight of the clusters caused the breakage of a small part of the 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.919
 grains and therefore the generation of mus 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.800
 the yeasts contained in the skin of the grapes pass to the must and develop 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.800
 in it causing the beginning of fermentation 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 the fermentation of the must causes carbon dioxide hence the name of this 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.220
 process 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.240
 this carbonic gas also called product fume in the inert atmosphere and 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.070
 thus the absence of oxygen causes intracellular fermentation which is 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.770
 as fermentation is called within the grapes themselves that have not been 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.770
 shattered and that stay attached to his face 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.940
 in this case they are the enzymes of the UBA and not the yeasts 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.490
 those that influence the fermentation process 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.220
 periodically consistent results are made in this sixteenth 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 accumulated in the bottom of the mafia throw it on the clusters to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.909
 get a permanent contact of the liquid with the clusters in santa fe 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.950
 When the presentation ends, the end of the cycle known as the world 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.350
 of art the minute zero little by little hiccup the appointment 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 At this time the grapes are stepped on 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.560
 a gang steps on and moves all the content of the art in the operation 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.190
 called cut 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.230
 and after which all the work is piled up forming 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.720
 This treading has as a function the breaking of those summers that have 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.939
 remained intact to extract the fermented must inside 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.580
 the wall of the juice can be observed how the weight of the water makes the child 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.780
 summary through the edges of the clusters to the floor of the hand 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:19.429
 the result the visa that so-called heart wine of higher quality the 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:21.259
 structure has alcoholic side 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.259
 throughout the process of carbonic maceration 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.409
 Finally, the tensing of the remaining pasta consists of ten concerts 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.409
 phones 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.379
 with it you have at home 2-3 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.379
 that a greater amount of elements of the city is extracted 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.239
 with the three resulting wines the decoration and press 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.439
 the mixture determined by the harvester is made to obtain the final wine 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.129
 most of the wine made with the carbonic maceration system is 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.290
 destined to be consumed as young wine for its richness of fruity aromas and 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.409
 floral
