00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
forming of the public space so there's a

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.640 
forming of the public space so there's a

the Capitol and with the Tower of light
every<00:01:13.320> courtroom<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.820> building<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
every courtroom in this building is a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.560 
every courtroom in this building is a
shape<00:01:15.840> vessel<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.920> get<00:01:17.130> natural<00:01:17.790> light<00:01:18.000> which

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
shape vessel to get natural light which

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
shape vessel to get natural light which
allows<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.350> movement<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.830> natural<00:01:20.250> light

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
allows the movement of natural light

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.630 
allows the movement of natural light
over<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> shelf<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.950> side<00:01:23.190> of<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
over a shelf that's on the side of the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.160 
over a shelf that's on the side of the
jury<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> feeling<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> courtroom

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
jury so the feeling of the courtroom

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.740 
jury so the feeling of the courtroom
then<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.370> one<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.300> change<00:01:27.570> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
then is really one of the change of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
then is really one of the change of
light<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> day<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.890> change<00:01:29.190> of<00:01:29.310> light<00:01:29.490> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
light in the day the change of light in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.790 
light in the day the change of light in
the<00:01:29.700> seasons<00:01:30.150> something<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.140> adds<00:01:31.410> the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
the seasons something that adds the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.770 
the seasons something that adds the
human<00:01:32.160> dimension<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> nature<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
human dimension to the nature of this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.630 
human dimension to the nature of this
public<00:01:34.170> space

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.360 

the<00:01:37.150> idea<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:38.020> natural<00:01:38.440> light<00:01:38.860> then<00:01:39.070> also

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
the idea of natural light then also

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.640 
the idea of natural light then also
allows<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.300> building<00:01:40.690> which<00:01:40.930> becomes<00:01:41.560> a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
allows the building which becomes a

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.320 
allows the building which becomes a
space<00:01:41.860> forming<00:01:42.340> building<00:01:42.760> that<00:01:43.000> brings

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
space forming building that brings

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.650 
space forming building that brings
public<00:01:43.930> weighting<00:01:44.410> into<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.160> wonderful<00:01:45.730> place

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
public weighting into a wonderful place

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.930 
public weighting into a wonderful place
where<00:01:47.410> instead<00:01:48.190> of<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.370> double<00:01:48.550> loaded

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.750 
where instead of a double loaded
corridor<00:01:49.360> being<00:01:49.570> darkened<00:01:50.050> on<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.260> inside

really<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.330> about<00:02:06.720> light<00:02:07.020> whether<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
really is about light whether it's the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.950 
really is about light whether it's the
inside<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.490> courtroom<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.060> also<00:02:09.300> the
