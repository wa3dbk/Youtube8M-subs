00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
using the eyeliner that's more of a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.840 
using the eyeliner that's more of a
mousse<00:01:46.110> texture

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.760 

so<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.720> what<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:55.960> looks<00:01:56.140> like<00:01:56.320> with<00:01:56.560> the

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
so this is what it looks like with the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:12.059 
so this is what it looks like with the
bottom<00:01:57.100> eyeliner

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.309 

now<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.760> have<00:02:12.999> both<00:02:13.209> my<00:02:13.420> eyes<00:02:13.450> done<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
now I have both my eyes done and the

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.229 
now I have both my eyes done and the
next<00:02:14.530> thing<00:02:14.680> I'm<00:02:14.829> going<00:02:14.859> to<00:02:15.010> do<00:02:15.189> is<00:02:15.430> my<00:02:15.609> mascara

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
next thing I'm going to do is my mascara

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.929 
next thing I'm going to do is my mascara
mascara<00:02:16.769> without<00:02:17.769> oh<00:02:18.069> here<00:02:18.340> are<00:02:18.370> both<00:02:18.670> my<00:02:18.909> eyes

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
mascara without oh here are both my eyes

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.349 
mascara without oh here are both my eyes
and<00:02:19.659> then<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.409> do<00:02:20.469> bottom<00:02:21.129> mascara<00:02:21.700> go<00:02:22.090> from

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
and then I do bottom mascara go from

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:27.390 
and then I do bottom mascara go from
side<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.810> side<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.319> helps<00:02:26.859> spread<00:02:27.159> your

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
side to side it just helps spread your

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.300 
side to side it just helps spread your
eyelashes<00:02:27.939> apart<00:02:28.269> go<00:02:28.599> like<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:33.099> here's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
eyelashes apart go like that so here's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.640 
eyelashes apart go like that so here's
my<00:02:33.370> first<00:02:33.730> one<00:02:34.030> or<00:02:34.420> both<00:02:34.659> of<00:02:34.719> my<00:02:34.959> finished<00:02:35.409> eyes

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
my first one or both of my finished eyes

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.770 
my first one or both of my finished eyes
probably<00:02:36.430> look<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.639> lot<00:02:36.849> different<00:02:36.909> from<00:02:37.540> how<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
probably look a lot different from how I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.959 
probably look a lot different from how I
did<00:02:38.139> in<00:02:38.469> the<00:02:38.590> beginning<00:02:38.709> but<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.400> guess<00:02:39.760> that's

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
did in the beginning but I guess that's

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.339 
did in the beginning but I guess that's
kind<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.359> point<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.689> makeup<00:02:41.109> though<00:02:41.319> I

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
kind of the point of makeup though I

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.979 
kind of the point of makeup though I
