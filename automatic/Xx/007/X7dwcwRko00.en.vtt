00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
back and one that pulls them in so think

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.100 
back and one that pulls them in so think
of<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> Sun<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.840> ocean

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
of it as when the Sun is up the ocean

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.540 
of it as when the Sun is up the ocean
tends<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> go<00:01:40.590> further<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.610> from<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.060> beach

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
tends to go further out from the beach

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.240 
tends to go further out from the beach
while<00:01:43.330> on<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.570> moon<00:01:43.750> when<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:44.260> moon<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.710> up<00:01:44.770> it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
while on the moon when the moon is up it

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.730 
while on the moon when the moon is up it
focuses<00:01:45.970> more<00:01:46.180> on<00:01:46.240> high<00:01:46.810> tides<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.470> tries<00:01:47.710> to

wait<00:02:42.640> there's<00:02:43.060> two<00:02:43.270> versions<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.750> every<00:02:43.990> skill

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
wait there's two versions of every skill

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.490 
wait there's two versions of every skill
and<00:02:44.970> there's<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.060> moon<00:02:46.330> form<00:02:46.630> now<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.140> moon

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
and there's a moon form now the moon

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.800 
and there's a moon form now the moon
form<00:02:47.770> of<00:02:48.010> both<00:02:48.489> skills<00:02:48.790> are<00:02:48.880> right<00:02:49.030> there<00:02:49.150> that

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
form of both skills are right there that

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.800 
form of both skills are right there that
giant<00:02:50.110> sword<00:02:50.830> pulsing<00:02:51.760> thing<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.270> spinning

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
giant sword pulsing thing is a spinning

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.500 
giant sword pulsing thing is a spinning
thing<00:02:52.989> not<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.410> one<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> other<00:02:53.890> one<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
thing not this one the other one and the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.720 
thing not this one the other one and the
one<00:02:55.810> with<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.080> was<00:02:56.320> like<00:02:56.470> jumping<00:02:56.860> up<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
one with that was like jumping up in the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.479 
one with that was like jumping up in the
air<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.030> smashing<00:02:58.480> down<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:58.959> one<00:02:59.560> so

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
air and smashing down is that one so

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.860 
air and smashing down is that one so
basically<00:03:00.760> how<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.209> works<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.540> you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
basically how that one works is you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.020 
basically how that one works is you
smash<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> bunch<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.680> times<00:03:02.890> press<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.790> again

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
smash a bunch of times press it again

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.580 
smash a bunch of times press it again
and<00:03:04.209> he'll<00:03:04.660> basically<00:03:04.780> jump<00:03:05.200> in<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.380> air<00:03:05.410> and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
and he'll basically jump in the air and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.320 
and he'll basically jump in the air and
start<00:03:05.770> pulling<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.310> down<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:07.060> it's<00:03:07.180> basically

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
start pulling it down so it's basically

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.860 
start pulling it down so it's basically
a<00:03:07.540> vertical<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:09.150> slanted<00:03:10.150> vertical<00:03:10.510> type<00:03:10.630> thing

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
a vertical a slanted vertical type thing

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.680 
a vertical a slanted vertical type thing
