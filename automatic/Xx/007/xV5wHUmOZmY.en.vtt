cheaper and I've seen a guy who made it
with<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.810> aluminum<00:01:09.810> materials<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:11.070> seems

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
with the aluminum materials and it seems

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.370 
with the aluminum materials and it seems
to<00:01:11.340> work<00:01:11.549> great<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.119> I'm<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> go

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
and this value do serious made of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.700 
and this value do serious made of
aluminum<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.610> bought<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.270> at<00:01:49.479> home<00:01:50.350> depot

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
aluminum and I bought it at home depot

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.880 
aluminum and I bought it at home depot
for<00:01:51.000> 1250<00:01:52.000> or<00:01:52.030> something<00:01:52.509> like<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.710> 12<00:01:53.710> us

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
for 1250 or something like that 12 us

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.179 
for 1250 or something like that 12 us
and<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:57.100> far<00:01:57.429> so<00:01:57.789> far<00:01:58.299> what<00:01:58.539> I've<00:01:58.570> made<00:01:58.929> is<00:01:59.229> I

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
and so so far so far what I've made is I

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.359 
and so so far so far what I've made is I
just<00:02:00.850> basically<00:02:01.179> traced<00:02:01.780> out<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.799> rain<00:02:03.039> on

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
just basically traced out the rain on

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.609 
just basically traced out the rain on
the<00:02:03.729> bottom<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.209> the<00:02:04.299> bowl<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:05.110> cut<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:05.500> out

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
the bottom of the bowl and I cut it out

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.660 
the bottom of the bowl and I cut it out
and<00:02:05.830> I<00:02:06.640> make<00:02:06.819> sure<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:07.060> is<00:02:07.179> a<00:02:07.450> very<00:02:08.440> snug<00:02:08.830> fit<00:02:09.100> so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
and I make sure it is a very snug fit so

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.970 
and I make sure it is a very snug fit so
then<00:02:09.880> so<00:02:10.630> then<00:02:10.660> there's<00:02:10.959> no<00:02:11.200> life<00:02:11.440> going<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.830> be

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
then so then there's no life going to be

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.930 
then so then there's no life going to be
escaping<00:02:12.540> from<00:02:13.540> back<00:02:13.840> when<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:15.040> still<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
escaping from back when I still with the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.170 
escaping from back when I still with the
contact<00:02:16.450> cement<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.760> glue<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.790> i'll<00:02:19.030> be

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
contact cement the glue that i'll be

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.320 
contact cement the glue that i'll be
using<00:02:19.390> if<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.049> cut<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.560> lose<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:22.180> need

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
using if you cut a to lose and you need

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.990 
using if you cut a to lose and you need
more<00:02:22.480> glue<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.930> hold<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.319> place<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.000> also
