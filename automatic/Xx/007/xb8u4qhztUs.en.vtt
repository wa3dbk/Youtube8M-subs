00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
if you roosted then yeah obviously kind

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
of deserved it but reverse boosting I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.380 
of deserved it but reverse boosting I
don't<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> killing<00:00:54.180> yourself

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
don't know it's kind of killing yourself

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.520 
don't know it's kind of killing yourself
I<00:00:54.660> don't<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:54.980> understand<00:00:55.980> why<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.879> I

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
I don't really understand why but I

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.720 
I don't really understand why but I
guess<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.739> cheating<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> system<00:00:59.160> because

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
guess it's cheating the system because

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.860 
guess it's cheating the system because
since<00:01:00.000> its<00:01:00.149> skill<00:01:00.359> base<00:01:00.480> matchmaking

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
since its skill base matchmaking

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.760 
since its skill base matchmaking
anyways<00:01:03.870> yeah<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.200> guess<00:01:04.350> when<00:01:04.560> you<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:05.750> reset

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
anyways yeah I guess when you get reset

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.530 
anyways yeah I guess when you get reset
you'll<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.250> five<00:01:08.580> hours<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.090> 12<00:01:09.420> hour

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you'll get the five hours or 12 hour

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.850 
you'll get the five hours or 12 hour
suspension<00:01:10.220> then<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.580> will<00:01:11.850> come<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
suspension then you will come back it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
suspension then you will come back it
