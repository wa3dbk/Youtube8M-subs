00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.999
 of used cell phones in Bogota 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.620
 to put a password on a device 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.390
 with Android operating system we must 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.740
 do the following will enter 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.130
 applications settings

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.180
 screen there are several options let's look at the 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.820
 first password 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.140
 that is, we select password 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.860
 we have to enter the have so 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.750
 minus 4 characters and a letter is not that 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.790
 the time will ask us that the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.280
 we confirm let's accept 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.280
 if you pressed the off button 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.630
 to lock the screen 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.150
 and I do it again then it's going to 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.210
 automatically ask to enter the 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.440
 number that or the password that confirms 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.850
 for the team 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.559
 now if I want to change a pattern 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.439
 every time I entered security of the 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.130
 password I'm not going to select 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.200
 patroness 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.539
 asks us to play a pattern then 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.119
 by joining the dots in one way or another 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.470
 a pattern is created that he will keep 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.030
 so you can unlock the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.390
 screen this case is going to be one more 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.390
 simple 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.470
 We give continue and industry that 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.470
 we confirm 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 and it is saved again to block 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.470
 the screen and when you try to unlock the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.370
 asks me to use the pattern of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.990
 lock that ends with figures 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.630
 now once again to bring options 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.760
 to ask for that security system if 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.890
 I do not want any selection or none 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.360
 and to lock the screen is simply going 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.880
 to have to slide it a little bit 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.940
 I will use the touch function of the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.940
 device 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.380
