00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 good morning everyone and welcome back from 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.730
 fabrice bertuzzi guerin sportive one 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.730
 the answer for you is still Rome 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 protagonist of our pill because 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.269
 few words it is useless to dwell on it 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.240
 Roma team is the one who gives the most 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.660
 to study to us talent scouts in short 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.050
 people 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.230
 the departure of baldini and with him of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.039
 paolino baldini for the top and in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:35.059
 that of London with the top and does not have anyway 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:38.399
 the people's dreams are undermined 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.510
 giallorosso is in fact sabatini has put 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.329
 indeed he has focused on some 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
 some players bought them and between the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.140
 as authentic talents 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 I'm talking about the 1995 Croatian jet team 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.739
 go I don't know if it's the real pronunciation from 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.270
 the right pronunciation this not 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.070
 master the Croatian but feeling 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.750
 from the commentary in the local language 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.060
 in short, this should be this 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.540
 a player taken from the zagreb dynamo 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.010
 this year for the substantial sum of 5 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.080
 million EUR 5 million short 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.340
 euro for a 95 who made thirteen 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.890
 matches in the Croatian series not 89 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.830
 matches in the Croatian national minors is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.350
 a figure of all respect, however, that has 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.860
 had the luck and joy of seeing st 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 live player like myself 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 and I can tell you that this central 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.400
 defensive right foot is an authentic 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.790
 promise hardly get out of balance like that 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.710
 so much for 17-18 year olds but here 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.680
 we are facing a player a little 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.040
 different from the other player who left 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.579
 from the first in frames is from the first 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.950
 second minutes of the game video 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.840
 one realizes that he has something 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.149
 particular but also to say something 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.149
 ancient and immediately 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.900
 snaps the memory parallel with 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.470
 our great defenders of the past to 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.020
 head held high when he leaves 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.850
 central defensive but also able to do 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.040
 the median in front of the defense proper 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.400
 for this beautiful setting a 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.940
 head high and this right 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.959
 very interesting for a defender 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.630
 central 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.080
 so much so that I hypothesize that teen by 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.540
 can play the dual role is central 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.010
 defensive is central low of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.030
 midfield that even the fullback 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.989
 right because also excellent 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.239
 progression 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:42.190
 here is this head-up movement 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:46.560
 a bit fast with this bangs e 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.570
 hair the movement vaguely recalls 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.510
 expect not to overdo it but take a 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.660
 that benefit become a bit of a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.209
 very young rudy krol and i know i'm 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.850
 talking about a soccer extraterrestrial 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.160
 but in short, we must also do some 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.960
 some 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.880
 overreacting from time to time some remember 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.950
 vaguely frank baresi 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.790
 precisely because of this ability to 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.190
 starting from your own driblare area 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.520
 take space and throw deep 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.880
 the advance is something inherent is 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.730
 a guy who super 185 so it's not 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.420
 physically very well set up for the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.210
 his age has a remarkable technique 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.520
 I reiterate for a defender a need 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.400
 of rare and true game we have seen 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.330
 within the rocket context that maybe 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.900
 this environment is not so conclusive 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.080
 competitive and selective but really 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.230
 in short, it is already possible in the small 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.430
 also identify why this like 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.670
 I repeat I saw him play in a game 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.080
 right back and it was something 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.960
 extraordinary perhaps the best game 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.880
 that I saw him do in the thirteen like 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.890
 the one between the dynamo of zagreb because a 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.500
 this ball control anticipates 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.960
 always however people propose 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.160
 in short, he is really launching a player 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.130
 very interesting what is missing 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.500
 this player immediately makes me say 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.870
 no jacket just enough who who 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.960
 is that he has some confidence with the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.870
 aspects of our football reality 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.010
 tacticians and then this can play but 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.500
 we know it's not like that 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.870
 I mean who has seen players 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.350
 come from the Croatian league is 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.970
 catapulted into more leagues 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.640
 competitive as difficult as that 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.040
 Italian I only give a small example 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.630
 also hole sicily centrovanti taken from 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.370
 pescara to which I turn with 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.650
 be careful because this cannot not 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.020
 may have been hit by an era blow 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.700
 it can't be very strong 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.070
 a player who doesn't know who he is 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.550
 play this though to say that 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.810
 the importance of the setting is so much 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.940
 important as heavy as it is 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.150
 technical tactical and athletic depth 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.570
 so if this guy 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.680
 will succeed in its procedures 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.050
 particularly complex times of 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.380
 acclimatization to make his own 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.320
 enormous qualities can be seen 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.850
 also for us Italian spectators there 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.250
 we will certainly find a star 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.960
 important and congratulations to the Rome that 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.250
 brought this great player of the 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.520
 future with tim jazz by centran defensive 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.320
 tried in 1985 we ended up today 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.860
 a third ps answer for everyone 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.860
 the sports ones
