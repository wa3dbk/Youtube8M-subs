the top four per section here just a
cardboard<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.289> everyone<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.630> main

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
cardboard to everyone this is the main

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.130 
cardboard to everyone this is the main
juicing<00:01:48.289> board<00:01:48.909> it's<00:01:49.909> gone<00:01:50.090> plug<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:51.020> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
juicing board it's gone plug on the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.080 
juicing board it's gone plug on the
bottom<00:01:51.439> here<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.610> also<00:01:52.759> have<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:52.909> make

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
bottom here and you also have to make

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.149 
bottom here and you also have to make
sure<00:01:53.119> that<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.539> is<00:01:53.750> in<00:01:53.960> before<00:01:54.830> you<00:01:54.860> start

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
sure that this is in before you start

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.180 
sure that this is in before you start
juicing<00:01:55.520> otherwise<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:57.229> juice<00:01:57.440> just<00:01:57.920> pours

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
juicing otherwise the juice just pours

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.490 
juicing otherwise the juice just pours
out<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.520> hole<00:01:58.729> all<00:01:59.659> down<00:01:59.960> your<00:02:00.049> juicer<00:02:00.380> and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
out that hole all down your juicer and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.480 
out that hole all down your juicer and
makes<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.740> mess<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.220> your<00:02:01.390> countertop<00:02:03.490> the

makes a mess on your countertop the
reason<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:04.850> juicer<00:02:05.179> so<00:02:05.360> quick<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:05.840> cause

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
reason this juicer so quick is cause

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.279 
reason this juicer so quick is cause
it's<00:02:06.110> got<00:02:06.409> a<00:02:06.740> much<00:02:07.520> bigger<00:02:07.789> /<00:02:08.330> than<00:02:09.110> the

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
it's got a much bigger / than the

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.500 
it's got a much bigger / than the
horizontal<00:02:09.860> masticating<00:02:10.399> juicers<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.269> even

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
horizontal masticating juicers so even

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.059 
horizontal masticating juicers so even
though<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.690> works<00:02:11.870> at<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.140> same<00:02:12.319> speed<00:02:12.769> that

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
though it works at the same speed that

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.930 
though it works at the same speed that
can<00:02:13.760> juice<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.330> lot<00:02:15.290> more<00:02:15.440> produce<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.760> same

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
can juice a lot more produce in the same

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.979 
can juice a lot more produce in the same
space<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.330> time<00:02:19.030> okay<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.180> white<00:02:20.450> section<00:02:20.780> on
