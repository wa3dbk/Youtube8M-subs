sound<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> game<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:50.970> there<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> reason

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
sound in the game but there is a reason

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
sound in the game but there is a reason
you<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:51.930> dead<00:01:52.170> silence<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> game

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you know dead silence is in the game

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.319 
you know dead silence is in the game
which<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.310> feel<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.820> there<00:01:54.000> should<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
which I feel is if there should be a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.569 
which I feel is if there should be a
count<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> two<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> guess<00:01:55.950> accountants<00:01:56.460> or

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
count of two but I guess accountants or

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
count of two but I guess accountants or
I<00:01:56.670> pro<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.180> too<00:01:57.299> sure<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.540> there's<00:01:57.810> no

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
I pro I'm not too sure if there's no

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560 
I pro I'm not too sure if there's no
counter<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> dead<00:01:59.130> silence<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.210> sitrep

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
counter to dead silence but sitrep

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.999 
counter to dead silence but sitrep
really<00:02:00.810> helps<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.079> when<00:02:01.590> people<00:02:01.619> use

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
really helps because when people use

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
really helps because when people use
assassin<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.700> they're<00:02:02.790> camping<00:02:03.270> or<00:02:03.479> they'll

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
assassin and they're camping or they'll

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.480 
assassin and they're camping or they'll
just<00:02:04.200> hidden<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.710> UAV<00:02:05.159> which<00:02:05.340> is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
just hidden on the UAV which is

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.660 
just hidden on the UAV which is
completely<00:02:05.850> fine<00:02:06.799> dead<00:02:07.799> silence<00:02:08.009> allows<00:02:08.429> them

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
completely fine dead silence allows them

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
completely fine dead silence allows them
to<00:02:08.700> sneak<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.599> behind<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.470> lot

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
to sneak up behind you and that's a lot

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.440 
to sneak up behind you and that's a lot
of<00:02:10.679> stuff<00:02:11.009> there's<00:02:11.430> quite<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> few<00:02:11.940> factors

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
of stuff there's quite a few factors

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.030 
of stuff there's quite a few factors
that<00:02:12.569> come<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.989> place

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
that come in place

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.380 
that come in place
while<00:02:14.189> playing<00:02:14.430> very<00:02:14.700> aggressive<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.299> you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
while playing very aggressive that you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.140 
while playing very aggressive that you
have<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.069> guess<00:02:17.519> take<00:02:17.730> advantage

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
have to you know I guess take advantage

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.670 
have to you know I guess take advantage
of<00:02:18.269> in<00:02:18.420> some<00:02:18.569> way<00:02:18.719> you<00:02:18.780> got<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.109> be<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.409> really

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
of in some way you got to be a really

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.899 
of in some way you got to be a really
smart<00:02:20.099> player<00:02:20.310> while<00:02:20.549> still<00:02:20.790> playing

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
smart player while still playing

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.910 
smart player while still playing
aggressive<00:02:21.359> like<00:02:21.480> right<00:02:21.659> now<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.049> know<00:02:22.590> they're

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
aggressive like right now I know they're

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.410 
aggressive like right now I know they're
gonna<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.159> spawning<00:02:23.400> around<00:02:23.700> here<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:24.090> right

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
gonna be spawning around here and right

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.479 
gonna be spawning around here and right
now<00:02:24.450> they're<00:02:24.810> either<00:02:24.900> gonna<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.319> spawning<00:02:25.620> to

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
now they're either gonna be spawning to

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.910 
now they're either gonna be spawning to
my<00:02:26.609> left<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.030> right<00:02:27.299> behind<00:02:27.599> me<00:02:27.989> but<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.650> pushed

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
my left and right behind me but I pushed

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.319 
my left and right behind me but I pushed
forward<00:02:29.219> anyway<00:02:29.459> because<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.700> had<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.879> feeling<00:02:30.090> I

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
forward anyway because I had a feeling I

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.729 
forward anyway because I had a feeling I
could<00:02:30.480> see<00:02:30.629> one<00:02:30.810> guy<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.079> on<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.560> there<00:02:31.650> was

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
could see one guy was on a and there was

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.160 
could see one guy was on a and there was
actually<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> few<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.400> them<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.810> biggest

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
actually a few of them and the biggest

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.740 
actually a few of them and the biggest
tip<00:02:34.379> for<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:35.120> guess<00:02:36.120> when<00:02:36.299> playing<00:02:36.480> very

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
tip for I guess when playing very

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.929 
tip for I guess when playing very
aggressive<00:02:37.230> when<00:02:37.319> Russian<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.829> spawns<00:02:38.129> is<00:02:38.400> to

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
aggressive when Russian the spawns is to

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.089 
aggressive when Russian the spawns is to
know<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.150> spawning<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:40.019> or<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.530> least<00:02:40.799> have

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
know the spawning that or at least have

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.970 
know the spawning that or at least have
an<00:02:41.280> educated<00:02:41.970> guess<00:02:42.359> of<00:02:42.720> where<00:02:43.409> we're<00:02:43.799> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
an educated guess of where we're the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.339 
an educated guess of where we're the
enemy<00:02:44.099> team<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.549> going<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.939> be<00:02:45.060> spawning<00:02:45.389> a<00:02:45.689> lot

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
enemy team is going to be spawning a lot

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.349 
enemy team is going to be spawning a lot
of<00:02:46.470> time<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.859> can<00:02:46.980> use<00:02:47.159> it<00:02:47.340> use<00:02:47.639> your<00:02:47.819> UAV<00:02:48.060> to

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
of time you can use it use your UAV to

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.740 
of time you can use it use your UAV to
your<00:02:48.450> advantage<00:02:49.489> not<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.639> UAV<00:02:51.000> well<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.359> UAV

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
navigate the map and right now i know

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.219 
navigate the map and right now i know
they're<00:04:18.120> gonna<00:04:18.180> be<00:04:18.359> spawning<00:04:18.630> here<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:18.900> heard

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
they're gonna be spawning here I heard

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.439 
they're gonna be spawning here I heard
enemies<00:04:19.709> taking<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.159> saw<00:04:20.849> one<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.090> my<00:04:21.150> teammates

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
enemies taking a saw one of my teammates

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.540 
enemies taking a saw one of my teammates
just<00:04:21.659> died<00:04:21.810> over<00:04:22.049> there<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.529> I<00:04:23.099> see<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.460> they

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
just died over there and I see that they

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.040 
just died over there and I see that they
have<00:04:23.580> beaten<00:04:24.090> basically<00:04:24.450> my<00:04:24.570> teammates<00:04:24.930> on

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
have beaten basically my teammates on

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.300 
have beaten basically my teammates on
cna<00:04:25.469> so<00:04:25.529> they're<00:04:25.800> probably<00:04:25.830> going<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.219> be

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
cna so they're probably going to be

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.470 
cna so they're probably going to be
