00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hey people here is the thorsten again 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.359
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.690
 and this time it's about one 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.110
 more precisely a camera 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.400
 compact camera so maybe you are 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.439
 sooner or later, as well as mine 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.660
 Last year I just went there 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.980
 I was looking for a small one 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.119
 compact camera with me but synonymous 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.880
 So manual settings can be done 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.030
 everything is iso time as manual 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.730
 can adjust itself and that should 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.290
 just a little one for me 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.680
 while the camera is also fast 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.960
 my pants pocket or something and yes me 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.670
 I have now about a year and I wanted 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.750
 it just a little bit something 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.980
 say or 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.969
 Just think about my thoughts 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.730
 Why do I tell this camera? 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.379
 bought and maybe you are up 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.109
 looking for something like that and then helps 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.219
 through that may continue so it goes 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.930
 here specifically to the sony cyber shot 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:12.840
 dsc rx 100 and there are already those 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.360
 ericsson 2, however, only has it 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.500
 a few things that are not really that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.600
 in my opinion are of benefit or 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.400
 for me, too, are not of use so 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.330
 a blitzschuh for example the need 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.130
 I'm not with this camera and 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.100
 folds display has also the successor 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.259
 nor has this camera synonymous 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.740
 but I do not need it now either 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.200
 really the camera also takes pictures in the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.630
 raw format that was also important to me 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.170
 can of course also in jpeg format 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.659
 take pictures or both 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.920
 at the same time as one of the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.570
 reflex cameras knows the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.060
 light intensity was also important to me 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.960
 from objective that is here from 18 to 49 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.909
 So in the forest 18 and 18 is also 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.830
 already a little something there you can 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.150
 then even in bad light 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.600
 take pictures on any parties 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:12.060
 or so and still have a good one 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.390
 quality yes as I said manual mode 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.980
 is possible so you can really do everything 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.190
 completely manually adjust the whole 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.130
 things and that was important to me as well 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.110
 you just then specifically with on site 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.210
 the blur can play and so on 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.610
 that 's of course with such a small one 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.620
 camera not so extreme in mine 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.520
 mirror reflex with the around sheep but 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.300
 if you can get out a bit and then 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.520
 you still there 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.720
 to work with that, I'm just 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.570
 a few pictures always 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.950
 then you see ever again I so 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.190
 I have been through have there sometimes a 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.260
 portrait shoot with so tried 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.220
 just that was so coincidental on the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.660
 fast just a few pictures 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.220
 participated in the test 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.720
 I have it on my concert with it 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.320
 also takes pictures in the camera 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.810
 test 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.570
 I blind you a bit 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.270
 you can find one here or here again 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.880
 on my blog the link to it you will find 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.920
 a video description what else is there 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 to say the food is so important 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.000
 things that are actually relevant to me 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.019
 it is now so at the camera 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.019
 then come like that 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:29.910
 moment and of course a lot with 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:34.110
 other a charger so really only 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.800
 a charger where you then the part 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.800
 the socket is plugged in and this cable is in 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.630
 the camera and then the battery of the 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.690
 inserted battery charges next to it 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.610
 You can also do the cable easily 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.160
 to use as a data cable to the pictures 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.820
 to copy to the pc 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.370
 these are normal usb cable and yes 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.420
 now it's up to me so that's me 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.240
 somehow stupid with the battery in the 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.970
 Camera load because I have no idea 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.030
 always like several batteries at one 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.290
 camera and then when I charge a battery 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.890
 I do not want to go with me in time 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.470
 The father taking a picture with the camera 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.150
 That's why I have one more 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.770
 external load so a charging shell 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.140
 bought it from patina and there were 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.160
 even two more batteries so two 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.620
 additional batteries 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.000
 that is, for example, one of them is the other 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.210
 Now in the camera and that's the one 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.070
 original battery from sony and now have 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.250
 So I have a total of three batteries for the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.020
 camera and can all the synonymous 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.360
 original battery empty in this 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.650
 load additional charging cradle 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.169
 I find that very convenient because then you 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.550
 always has full batteries and you can too 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.900
 with three rechargeable batteries my whole day 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.479
 maybe a little bit, maybe 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.190
 Be photographing on the go and watching 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.560
 with with such a small camera is that 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.000
 of course very beneficial 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.540
 Another advantage is that the 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.840
 or the original of course here should 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.610
 a cable is one can also videos 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.180
 take or take pictures 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.270
 while keeping this cable in the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.530
 socket has dh 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.420
 So you can also film during the film 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.370
 for example, the whole thing about the 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.890
 let it run then you save 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.460
 she just battery and I think so synonymous 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.350
 very convenient the extra 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.660
 charging cradle costs around 35 euros 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.010
 I think I have you all 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.640
 things sometimes linked in the video 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.810
 there he could look and write 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.300
 just let's see if that's something for you 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.760
 is the camera so expensive around the time 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.470
 400 euros 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.290
 and that's really right 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.980
 good part so the processing is right 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.140
 and the quality is really tip-top 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.980
 sony knows who knows the quality 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.250
 I think 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.900
 and is there really then you are once 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.550
 the money and then you have one 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.830
 pretty a cool camera a good one 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.600
 camera and if you have situations 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.220
 where you do not like big 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.510
 reflex camera with tractors is 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.500
 something in the super suitable 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:17.040
 here are also so stop there 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.330
 you can then, for example, a 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.950
 so kurt so a strap on it 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.480
 that means when you 're on the go 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.940
 Somewhere around you can just that 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.170
 Camera also hang around the neck and 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.490
 can then quickly make a picture 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:32.440
 and hanging her up again bothers her 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:34.810
 do not stop that just by the way yes 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.670
 I'm not going any further now 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.510
 technical data as I said the 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:43.120
 Camera power raw format has 20 1 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.610
 megapixel or 20 2 even i am now 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.340
 just not exactly sure but also 20 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.760
 megapixel has his work and the camera 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.760
 photographed in 3: 2 format, the 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.080
 I also found it important because many 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.240
 digital cameras or compact cameras 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.980
 photograph quoted in 4 3 format and the 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.350
 somehow always looks a bit 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.100
 weird so I just me 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.900
 The 3 to 2 win format 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.150
 through the whole mirror reflex cameras 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.740
 and that's why I thought that was great too 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:15.200
 that the 32 photographs directly natively 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.800
 Of course you can also do a lot to 31 21 16 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:22.190
 9 and so adjust but yes 3 to 2 is 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.400
 just really the full resolution good 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.840
 That's it, as I said technical data 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.070
 I have some blogs for you 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.750
 written and also in the video 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.690
 description if you like that a bit 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.310
 more interested, just have a look 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.560
 otherwise you will also find the sony 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.480
 a few more infos at amazon 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.110
 of course, too 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:44.390
 and yes that 's it, I hope I could 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.280
 they know what chalk begin on 

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.870
 looking for something that even a 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.710
 bit if you still have my channel 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.560
 do not subscribe 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.670
 then put it down here then 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.610
 we'll see each other in the next video 

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.410
 again, no new videos will be missed 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.460
 I would definitely look forward to it 

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.460
 next time and
