00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.920
 the corn these years present the new hybrids what is not frequent 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.719
 is to vote 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.719
 a new seed company 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.789
 engineer osvaldo castro so this is a corn that is debuting 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.949
 in Córdoba and in the Argentine Republic 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.550
 if this is the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.429
 the year of the release of these materials 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.199
 percent we come out with a simple one triple to the market 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.200
 We are still holding very good results in both roast with a batch 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.360
 field 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.400
 first datum sowers which is the origin of samuels 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.510
 the origin of the weight 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.640
 all eta minutes for research in 26 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.470
 with sunflower in santa cruz de la sierra 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.940
 espartaco de la sierra bolivia company was in tdt for a theme of inclusive 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.740
 Over there 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.740
 There are little or materials that will be temporary 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.930
 serious problem that the area has for the subject 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.100
 both the similar conditions 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.830
 This is demolition inc in port and is the few with few are the 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.950
 materials that currently have com 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.770
 good behavior to that situation 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.730
 there we started to select the first lines for health and good read 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.100
 then we were selecting the best and biobío mind for tasks 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.810
 productive 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.020
 that with respect to what was solid because corn when it first started 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.320
 This Saturday's hour in Santa Cruz de la Sierra adapt it to the year or year and a half 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.180
 this is narrowing the first line 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.410
 making the first Iberians also in those conditions 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.620
 i time 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.470
 the year 2000 start the temperate program 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.770
 in the pre-anesthesia room 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.100
 ii coquettishly that what now 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.610
 they are launching this lot here in the province of córdoba 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.229
 here in the outskirts of córdoba have lots in different places of the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.340
 province but today we have come to this particular that is in the area 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.700
 we would say of what I could still sewn the green belt the sedeco 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.140
 good what we have seen as really strengthen in the work of plasticity 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.299
 the materials 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.780
 in different situations 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.520
 today the border slogan 10% a 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.069
 the oscar producer 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.019
 per forum for now mainly reasons the high cost that has 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.279
 the implantation of the crop I am doomed to have the potential magic 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.920
 so much the psoe I do not believe as 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.250
 today even talking about Adame's core zone seems 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.369
 In one word 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:28.499
 from before because the same thing today and there is planted corn with high technology in 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.959
 large part of the country in 80% of the area in different situations made corn 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.869
 I'm going to give everything that situation is to say 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:40.809
 no environment not very favorable more than anything dv ed we had to have the material 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:45.349
 behaves very well easy a very good fight in a great thinker cent 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.419
 It has very good flynt quality 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.780
 and it's deep 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.330
 this year an average of spies in December d to exceed 200 grams 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.980
 up to 310 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.810
 and all of it 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.250
 of the master by spies that I know what in handling indolence of plant this in 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.780
 different situations of environment the flight had very good with for good a 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.149
 behavior the power sense 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:13.319
 has very good very good demos performance achieved very good performances in 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.870
 train 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.699
 in extreme stress 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.719
 this polo good qualities that you have free to make a very good spy not 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.209
 This fact makes the winner a tool that today has the producer 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.449
 what is really interesting if you plan to take into account 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.510
 in flight is this the pulsation album that it is a corn is the ing 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.440
 percent that has a particular program the respect to the corn 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.939
 climent as it happens with some other companies that then buys the production 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.709
 if we have a program that the bank ag calculation throw it 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.700
 I have dedicated three years 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.120
 percent down to provide brake materials does not generate oceanic without events 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.169
 transgenic 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.249
 stop is that the company is without braking contribution 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.679
 good and if not link with those who are currently marketing in 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:05.680
 end is where they come in to keep the idea because we have 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.139
 several materials that 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.639
 that go very well with the same characteristic we see that the market 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.659
 you are needing that 10% and you have made merchandise there is little 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.919
 materials are left in nothing the conditions 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.729
 i mark denny chin we have also 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.099
 so much that how do you also see the 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.900
 and hybrids and read what we also have very good materials for 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.340
 to spread 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.400
 and if you have a hundred per cent the research carried out by the company 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.939
 in that sense the bank 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:38.460
 of the company's test let's say read how much about materials or tests 

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:44.589
 At the moment it is constituted today we are with 2,500 glass in evaluation 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:46.390
 permanent on parchment 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.250
 by the way so early in a downtown area of ​​tucumán city in terms 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.890
 technicians 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.380
 spies what happens is crime of the mili in toribio that all year we go 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.340
 taking out of 100 seats lived to continue evaluating and from there are 10 20 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.960
 hybrids that are going we will soon go to the area but 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.550
 the leader of the wing the contribution to the research is very strong
