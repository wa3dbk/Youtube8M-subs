00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.910 
angry but in my humble opinion I
honestly<00:01:31.720> think<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.350> breaking<00:01:33.340> fast<00:01:33.760> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
honestly think that breaking fast and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.800 
honestly think that breaking fast and
rushing<00:01:35.920> your<00:01:36.040> moves<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.490> not<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.390> optimal

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
rushing your moves is not the optimal

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.650 
rushing your moves is not the optimal
way<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:37.990> be<00:01:38.230> breaking<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:39.600> personally<00:01:40.600> believe

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
way to be breaking I personally believe

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.420 
way to be breaking I personally believe
that<00:01:40.900> when<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.290> are<00:01:41.560> practicing<00:01:41.770> your<00:01:42.190> art

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
that when you are practicing your art

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.000 
that when you are practicing your art
form<00:01:42.730> and<00:01:42.880> practicing<00:01:43.480> what<00:01:43.930> you<00:01:43.990> love<00:01:44.380> you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
form and practicing what you love you

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.220 
form and practicing what you love you
don't<00:01:45.160> need<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.310> rush<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:45.850> why<00:01:46.480> rush<00:01:46.870> it<00:01:46.900> you

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
don't need to rush it why rush it you

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.200
