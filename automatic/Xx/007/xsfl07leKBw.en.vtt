00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
me to ask me about the case just because

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.359 
me to ask me about the case just because
of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> design<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.890> especially<00:01:44.009> nice

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
of the design and it's especially nice

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
of the design and it's especially nice
way<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> give<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:45.000> phone<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.990> special<00:01:46.470> look

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
way to give your phone a special look

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260 
way to give your phone a special look
we've<00:01:47.369> also<00:01:47.490> got<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.790> going<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
we've also got this going on at the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
we've also got this going on at the
front<00:01:48.509> here<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:49.229> doesn't<00:01:49.500> interfere<00:01:49.680> with

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
front here but doesn't interfere with

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.399 
front here but doesn't interfere with
laying<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> table<00:01:50.340> design<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.079> back<00:01:52.110> here

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
laying the table design on the back here

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.230 
laying the table design on the back here
with<00:01:52.530> its<00:01:52.649> glossy<00:01:52.920> finish<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.090> guys

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
with its glossy finish and as you guys

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.060 
with its glossy finish and as you guys
can<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.750> virtually<00:01:55.110> unscratched<00:01:55.470> now

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
can see it's virtually unscratched now

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.260 
can see it's virtually unscratched now
the<00:01:56.130> reason<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.610> because<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.119> case

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the reason for this is because the case

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.450 
the reason for this is because the case
it's<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.689> high<00:01:57.899> points<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> melting<00:01:59.280> part

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's on high points of the melting part

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's on high points of the melting part
and<00:01:59.640> that's<00:01:59.729> good<00:01:59.939> for<00:01:59.969> preserving<00:02:00.420> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and that's good for preserving that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.289 
and that's good for preserving that
glossy<00:02:00.810> finish<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.759> downside<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.210> this

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
glossy finish the one downside to this

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.910 
glossy finish the one downside to this
is<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.570> when<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> sits<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> surface<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
is that when it sits on a surface and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.410 
is that when it sits on a surface and
your<00:02:05.009> phone<00:02:05.130> vibrates<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.939> rocks<00:02:06.180> back<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
your phone vibrates it rocks back and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.290 
your phone vibrates it rocks back and
forth<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.930> makes<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.259> funny<00:02:07.500> sound<00:02:08.060> next<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.209> do

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
forth and makes a funny sound next we do

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.330 
forth and makes a funny sound next we do
have<00:02:09.450> some<00:02:09.599> dirt<00:02:09.810> buildup<00:02:10.200> right<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> top

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
have some dirt buildup right at the top

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.530 
have some dirt buildup right at the top
here<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.879> don't<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> cameras

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
here and I don't know if the cameras

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
here and I don't know if the cameras
going<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> pick<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> up<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.290> is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
going to pick it up but it is

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.930 
going to pick it up but it is
along<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.739> top<00:02:13.800> there<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.340> you'll<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.849> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
along the top there and you'll have to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.190 
along the top there and you'll have to
clean<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:15.330> case<00:02:15.540> once<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.930> let's<00:02:16.110> get

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
clean up this case once and let's get

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.260 
clean up this case once and let's get
that<00:02:16.319> out<00:02:16.819> lastly<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:17.910> terms<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> durability

height multiple times from texting and
it's<00:02:24.390> held<00:02:24.720> up<00:02:24.810> pretty<00:02:24.959> well<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.830> there's<00:02:26.069> one

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
it's held up pretty well but there's one

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 
it's held up pretty well but there's one
issue<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.330> terms<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.599> durability<00:02:27.720> that's<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
issue in terms of durability that's the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.680 
issue in terms of durability that's the
creek<00:02:28.500> eNOS<00:02:28.739> if<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.370> squeeze<00:02:29.700> along<00:02:29.940> the

a special look what's really nice about

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.460 
a special look what's really nice about
these<00:02:45.600> case<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.350> actually

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
these case this is that you can actually

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.170 
these case this is that you can actually
mix<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.920> match<00:02:47.040> them<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.880> have<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.030> do

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
mix and match them so all I have to do

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.380 
mix and match them so all I have to do
is<00:02:48.269> pop<00:02:48.450> off<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.630> bottom<00:02:48.959> here<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:50.269> take<00:02:51.269> the

is pop off the bottom here and take the
bottom<00:02:51.630> from<00:02:51.780> another<00:02:51.959> case<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.690> then<00:02:54.690> pop<00:02:55.049> it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
bottom from another case and then pop it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.910 
bottom from another case and then pop it
on<00:02:56.330> for<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.360> whole<00:02:57.480> different<00:02:57.750> look<00:02:57.920> again

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
on for a whole different look again
