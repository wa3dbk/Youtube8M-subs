with<00:01:40.909> Shawn<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:41.150> we<00:01:41.600> would<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:41.780> think<00:01:42.110> of

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
with Shawn and we would just think of

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.910 
with Shawn and we would just think of
names<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.370> we<00:01:43.880> just<00:01:44.180> had<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.360> list<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:44.810> like<00:01:45.020> 40

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
names so we just had a list of like 40

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.149 
names so we just had a list of like 40
different<00:01:46.280> names<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.620> that<00:01:48.620> was<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.979> one

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
different names and that was the one

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.420 
different names and that was the one
name<00:01:49.430> we<00:01:49.670> we<00:01:50.000> all<00:01:50.150> felt<00:01:50.420> good<00:01:50.540> about<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.810> I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
name we we all felt good about it I

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.490 
name we we all felt good about it I
think<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:53.810> was<00:01:53.990> sort<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.380> obvious

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
think that it was sort of the obvious

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.880 
think that it was sort of the obvious
choice<00:01:55.210> but<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.990> all<00:01:57.110> felt<00:01:57.320> good<00:01:57.440> about<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.680> and

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
choice but we all felt good about it and

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.890 
choice but we all felt good about it and

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
however I realized the very likely

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.159 
however I realized the very likely
potential<00:06:05.880> that<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.360> things<00:06:06.570> I<00:06:06.690> won't<00:06:06.930> review

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
potential that the things I won't review

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.600 
potential that the things I won't review
yet<00:06:07.410> could<00:06:07.650> cause<00:06:07.890> a<00:06:07.919> large<00:06:08.250> amount<00:06:08.550> of

yet could cause a large amount of

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.430 
yet could cause a large amount of
backlash<00:06:09.000> so<00:06:09.330> I<00:06:09.600> asked<00:06:09.870> for<00:06:10.050> a<00:06:10.110> certain<00:06:10.290> amount

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
backlash so I asked for a certain amount

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.130 
backlash so I asked for a certain amount
of<00:06:10.590> trust<00:06:10.950> that<00:06:11.160> I<00:06:11.520> will<00:06:11.940> get<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.450> them<00:06:12.570> it'll

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
of trust that I will get to them it'll

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.540 
of trust that I will get to them it'll
