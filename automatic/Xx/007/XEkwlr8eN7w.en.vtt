00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.609
 super writers the first half none 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.230
 easy match really pulled around 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.550
 on a red wall 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.620
 yes it was very defensive 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.340
 tank and we were backwards what a 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.080
 wide and opening with a good long 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 julienne's ball 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.230
 I am also broad that can finish that opportunity 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.699
 happy corea then 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.140
 of course give up more space 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.119
 rituals head 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.920
 yes that's right and I think we are 2000 or 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.340
 Have had small chances of making it real 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.380
 completely closed I think 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.300
 and then he is also in opportunities 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.829
 those who got the fantastic done 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.719
 the coach was there before the game 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.530
 he counted on call your head on 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.910
 benji 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 to under score now just have that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.469
 I think we both do very well 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.390
 relieved for me a goal after 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.219
 long time and benji checks injury 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.230
 he also scores a goal 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.730
 so yes we are both there or blaming 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.890
 We are broad that we address the three points 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.620
 the profile known gentlemen though 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.860
 reaction lykle room very relieved think 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 I 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.760
 it were important three points to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.629
 Do good business on the play or point of view 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.010
 in 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.229
 now next week at a direct 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.790
 competitor might just as good days 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.080
 can do business then 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.299
 then one looks good i think 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 but yes we must every day 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.619
 contest to the best some trust the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.180
 actually coach during the break because me 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.430
 looked rather animated coach the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 first half 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.450
 yes that we might have more spaces 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.189
 give and that we must be patient 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.380
 keep playing football that we have no chances 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.330
 may we give and that we are well done 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.590
 think only in header 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.570
 on the second post but for the rest 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.369
 his mouscron has not been dangerous 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.659
 it would have been easier if you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.579
 had a bit more pace in the game 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.329
 can bring worst head 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.960
 woman i think it is especially important 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.000
 was that we soon may change because their 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 mouscron that all crooked with it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600
 head towards the ball and the ground heavy 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.829
 crops than other side 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 that is also what the short said is below 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.770
 the peace and that we the two for that better 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.119
 in to things 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.310
 benji de ceulaer not an easy one 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.140
 match at home against mouscron 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.759
 for not easy I mean that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.350
 have given away very little to nothing 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.460
 today i think they have a chance in the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.890
 second half have had that couple 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.420
 chance so in itself I think to tradle 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.950
 have done steam very well one day and 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.149
 very few have given away two 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.990
 goals scored there will also be more 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.160
 to be 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.690
 so i think we have a lot 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.009
 games played are fun but they do 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.209
 pulled from a red in minutes 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.280
 on the wall 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.470
 indeed so then you also know the whole thing 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.650
 Many club come to play on their own 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.299
 6 meters but it is up to us and 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.769
 to find a solution 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.660
 indigo and the first half stands out 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.040
 it is exactly where I think I am 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.840
 and then those dogs second half year then 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.099
 textbooks for us their can me 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.060
 imagine that goal is yours 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.739
 virtue of this 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.549
 yes indeed i mean eh so my 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.260
 second base place this season so this 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.730
 a lot of virtue that I am back on the field 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.099
 can stand i have oh look of their cavities 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.840
 certainly here in genk so I am very happy 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.549
 with the goal indeed with clichÃ© 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.980
 but at the press conference where i put it 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.510
 on the curare among other writers 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.769
 then score as a drink anyway 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.049
 not between you have done that 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.120
 indeed so i also think it's on one 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.130
 ordinary very good group we have 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.930
 also very good players and I think 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.670
 through today all together very well 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.239
 collective very good collective 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.239
 played matches
