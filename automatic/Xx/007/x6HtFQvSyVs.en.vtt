00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.949
 to make any business successful he 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.290
 very easy and very easy for him 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.840
 follow it may seem too 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.540
 simple and you can say it in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.430
 principle and no advice even really 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.550
 this is the best advice you can 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.309
 get and the only method for something 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.670

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.610
 month for a year but that's my goal 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.780
 and yes you join her to her 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.359
 achieve i need to stick to the plan 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:08.540
 first step you should be a system by 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.100
 which should work how to do it 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.020
 first of all you take the calendar and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.619
 write out every week when you have 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.869
 have time 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.950
 if you have a normal job from nine to 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.720
 five anytime 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.250
 your time may be in the morning maybe 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.140
 in the evening you can work during 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.799
 lunch break it depends on 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.479
 where are you from your life and other things but if 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.159
 you have time she has you every 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.200
 the day you watch tv or 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.460
 play video games but when you have 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.990
 time working on it you now even 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 mark on the calendar when you will 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.229
 work on your oh stop projects this 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.840
 very simple what i do i dedicate one 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:54.390
 day of the week the whole shooting then another 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:58.340
 I dedicate half a day to processing and already in 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.340
 I upload photos for a week 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:09.569
 tagging and stuff it's about 2 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.810
 half a day of work if you want to do that 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.860
 same as me 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.599
 and achieve my goals of 35,000 dollars and you 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.870
 know all this time think my goals 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.120
 can be achieved in any case, here is my 1 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.970
 thing to prepare and which 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.440
 need to do to highlight a certain 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.450
 the amount of time you can 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.790
 take off and use this time spent 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.940
 for example if you have an hour you are a little 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.300
 prepare to decide what to shoot here 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.430
 traffic jams is it in the street are these three bottles and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.959
 anything that you can shoot and you 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.459
 must be pretty decent 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.709
 number of shots you can 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.260
 get it can be really 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.670
 Any photo that takes up 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.670
 stock photo varies from something very 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.690
 simple for example handshaking something of something 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.810
 really hard do what you 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.580
 I can see very cool photos on 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.640
 which was just a walking person or 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.830
 beautiful landscapes it's not really 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.760
 what matters is that you make yourself up 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:14.829
 special schedule and follow them i 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.640
 would recommend here that one day a week 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.220
 you are shooting this optional porn day 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.560
 4 hours for example dear ford 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.799
 share some of the time spent working through what 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.290
 you'll get to take a 5:00 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.459
 after that I would spend another three hours 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.130
 four photo processing we'll talk 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.870
 More on how to handle I would 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.769
 dedicated throughout the week from 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.930
 half an hour to an hour a day on tags and 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.060
 upload photos on out of fuel in 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.010
 Basically, this is what I wanted to share with 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.900
 by you in this video to achieve 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.459
 any goal first of all to you 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.489
 you need to set yourself this goal and 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.470
 secondly you need to make a plan like 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.480
 to achieve this goal and thirdly you need 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.370
 stick to this plan if you 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.109
 want to succeed just follow 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.200
 that if you can't stick 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.060
 goals you will not achieve it if you do not 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.250
 clear goal you do not even know why 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.019
 start if you can not determine 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.299
 procedure or method as your goal 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.769
 you will never succeed 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.229
 do on constantly 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.660
 avi so define these things for yourself 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.520
 follow them i know if you will it 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.479
 doing it will be your first step 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.370
 wait for more video on the way to success 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.240
