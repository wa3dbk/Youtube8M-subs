00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.090
 because I am going to prepare neither more nor less 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.400
 that an intel custard that are 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.410
 tremendously delicious in a recipe 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.610
 of course very simple to prepare and 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.700
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.210
 put the following 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 three egg yolks 25 grams of sugar 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.230
 white 15 grams of butter 140 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 grams of cookies in this case I will 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.630
 use balance cookies that I 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.580
 they came in my box of taste box 160 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.710
 grams of nutella and in this case I will 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.540
 use a homemade nutella git and you 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 you want to know the recipe for how it is done 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.239
 below I leave the link in the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.979
 description 125 ml of cream or cream 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.009
 milk 250 milliliters of whole milk and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.900
 a few official lists and already with 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.050
 all this we can begin to elaborate the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.050
 recipe 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.950
 two 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 and 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.950
 The first thing we have done is to place 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.530
 the cookies in a chopper are going to 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.330
 add the softened butter and what 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.260
 let's do now is to cover everything very 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.260
 well and crush it 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.880
 once it is well crushed we are going to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.970
 go filling the base with cookies 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.370
 our glasses now we will take a dipper and 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.010
 let's pour the whole milk in there 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.140
 goes perfect and the cream 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.240
 then we have put in our 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.160
 case to heat over low heat and we're going 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.110
 to leave heating until we see that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.150
 it starts to boil while it goes 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.950
 heating the saucepan we will go separating 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.530
 the yolks of the eggs with the help of 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.479
 a separator for example like this and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 let's throw the yolks in a bowl 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.450
 apart 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.220
 once the egg whites are separated 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.110
 buds we have incorporated the sugar 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.580
 white to the yolks and we will beat them 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.069
 very well with some rods until 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.079
 everything is completely incorporated 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.849
 once we see that our milk already 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.549
 has started to boil we will remove the case 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.590
 of the fire then we will incorporate 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.719
 little by little in the milk to the yolks of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.740
 egg and let's go beating slowly 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.660
 with the help of rods 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.610
 once it is all well mixed 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.280
 we will return to pass the content of the bowl 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.040
 to our case 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.020
 now we have placed the bucket again in 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.000
 the fire and we will reheat it 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.740
 over low heat until we see that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.780
 begins to boil it is important that 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.340
 during the process we stop it from removing 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.340
 of an instant to prevent us from 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.200
 stick our custard when we see 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.000
 that this has started to boil let's 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.709
 remove our fire box no 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.360
 matter if we see that the custard are 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.190
 a little liquid because when mixed with 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.620
 you're not going to thicken it 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.850
 now we will incorporate the nutella to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.310
 our custard 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.170
 once done all night we're going to 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.000
 mix very well with the help of a tongue 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.180
 and we will remove it until we see 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.010
 that is completely incorporated 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.599
 then we have filling 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.870
 our glasses with Custard 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.180
 nutella 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.530
 once boiled we will let cool 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.450
 our nutella custard to 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.190
 room temperature and when 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.250
 cool we'll put it in for a minimum 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.110
 of 3 hours in the refrigerator once 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.730
 cooled our custard we have placed 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.440
 the pistachios in a mortar and now the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.780
 let's crush when you get chips 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.579
 little ones once he has taken out the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.250
 pistachios we will throw the pieces by 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.540
 over our custard and once 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.760
 who has finished our custard 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.590
 see what good looks they have of 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.850
 I'm dying to try it 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.540
 that I am going to do of course 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.540
 of jacks 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.330
 or not 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.370
 my god I have eaten the custard of a 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.470

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.480
 super cream appointment with that flavor to the hotel 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.650
 and the contrast with pistachios and 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.620
 cookie that make it completely 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.390
