reasons<00:00:40.840> number<00:00:41.740> one<00:00:41.920> what<00:00:42.640> we're<00:00:42.820> doing<00:00:43.150> with

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
reasons number one what we're doing with

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.940 
reasons number one what we're doing with
this<00:00:43.570> system<00:00:44.020> is<00:00:44.170> we're<00:00:44.620> going<00:00:44.770> to<00:00:44.830> be<00:00:44.920> using

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
this system is we're going to be using

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.490 
this system is we're going to be using
all<00:00:45.340> of<00:00:45.400> our<00:00:45.610> kitchen<00:00:45.910> waste<00:00:46.300> and<00:00:46.630> all<00:00:47.200> of

those kitchen scraps are now no longer

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.260 
those kitchen scraps are now no longer
in<00:00:49.840> your<00:00:50.110> landfill<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.010> it's<00:00:51.190> reducing<00:00:51.730> your

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
in your landfill so it's reducing your

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.440

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
total household waste that waste is then

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.440 
total household waste that waste is then
being<00:00:55.900> turned<00:00:56.290> into<00:00:56.650> compost<00:00:57.550> with<00:00:58.210> these

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
being turned into compost with these

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.500 
being turned into compost with these
worms<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.080> that<00:00:59.890> compost<00:01:00.520> is<00:01:00.790> really<00:01:01.330> going

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
worms and that compost is really going
