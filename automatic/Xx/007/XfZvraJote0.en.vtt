00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.550
 serotonin is a very brain chemical 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.040
 important that helps raise your status 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.460
 of encouragement and prevents you from feeling bad or 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.460
 depressed there are chemical methods to 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.789
 raise your serotonin level and also 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.010
 there are natural means the article speaks 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.260
 about the natural means that 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.590
 you can use to raise your levels 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.609
 of serotonin to make you feel happy 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.729
 full and full of energy again method 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.729
 1 increases serotonin through the 

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:40.539
 diet the myths of serotonin and the 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:42.550
 food unfortunately there are many 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.149
 myths about food and 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.219
 repercussion on serotonin levels 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.280
 these are the foods rich in 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:55.030
 tryptophan automatically increase the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.760
 fake serotonin most of the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.979
 foods contain tryptophan a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.559
 amino acid that competes with others 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:06.040
 amino acids to be absorbed by the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.970
 body transport system the turkey 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.770
 he is rich in 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.640
 but if you eat a lot you will not take 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.820
 automatically your levels of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.060
 serotonin if you eat a lot of banana 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.180
 will automatically increase your levels of 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.030
 serotonin the bananas if they contain 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.850
 serotonin but it can not go through 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.750
 the blood-brain barrier and so 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.880
 both humans can not take advantage of it 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.000
 avoid simple carbohydrates and eat 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.710
 the complex carbohydrates these are 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.500
 absorb in the body so 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.050
 different than the simple 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.680
 simple carbohydrates like rice and 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.570
 white bread raise your blood levels 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.090
 quickly causing a peak in the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.880
 insulin secretion which falls 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.300
 after a while the carbohydrates 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.759
 complexes are absorbed more slowly by 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.369
 your body and therefore the 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.680
 Massive peaks that occur with the intake 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.250
 of simple carbohydrates 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.830
 the complex carbohydrates are 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.680
 legumes such as lentils or peas bread 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.430
 Whole grain whole grain pasta 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.890
 whole grain rice with starchy vegetables 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.709
 sweet potatoes and turnips 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.340
 simple carbohydrates are white bread 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.510
 white rice normal pasta cakes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.470
 sweets and other products with sugar 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.110
 Refined avoids caffeinated foods 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.209
 especially energy drinks the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.030
 caffeine inhibits the production of 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.580
 serotonin which also explains why 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.040
 what takes away hunger drinks 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.600
 energetics contain large quantities 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.340
 of sugar which the body processes 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.380
 quickly but they give a slump 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.500
 energy after the insulin 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.500
 ends up being secreted if you have to 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.610
 drink caffeinated beverages wait until 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.730
 after eating eat healthy fats 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.190
 such as omega 3 fatty acids 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.860
 it is believed that this is affected in function 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.700
 of serotonin in the brain the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.650
 people with low serotonin levels 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.470
 they usually have work which is 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.260
 essential for the brain and that is taken 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.200
 of the foods like fish oils 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.260
 which are especially high in 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.980
 this type of fatty acids can you 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.129
 find omega 3 in fish like the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.329
 salmon and fish oil nuts 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:46.470
 seeds and seed oil like that of 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:49.000
 flax seed eat dark chocolate 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.790
 this improves serotonin levels 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.150
 due mainly to resveratrol 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.940
 whose concentration depends on the content 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.430
 of cocoa so milk or other 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.579
 chocolate products will not have the 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.980
 the same amount the resveratrol increases 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.879
 both endorphin levels as 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.609
 of serotonin method 2 other ways of 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.130
 elevate serotonin exercise so 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.500
 regular 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.130
 Exercise is a great way to increase 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.770
 your serotonin levels exercise 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.920
 causes an increase in tryptophan the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.680
 which is a precursor of serotonin the 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.500
 tryptophan continues elevated when 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.110
 you finish exercising which 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.680
 promotes an improvement of mood 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.720
 hours after the exercise you perform 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.080
 It must be appropriate according to your condition 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.600
 physical the constant release of 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.750
 Serotonin is linked with exercise 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.390
 with which you feel comfortable not with the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.050
 exercise that makes you extra limits 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.870
 how did an English study find out if not 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.050
 you have time to exercise all 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.200
 the days try to walk 30 minutes to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.570
 one hour a day this will help you burn 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.360
 calories and increase your levels of 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.750
 tryptophan causing an increase in 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.140
 serotonin looks for places with lots of light 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.000
 the light probably helps the synthesis 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.430
 of serotonin 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.830
 the investigations have found a 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.530
 positive correlation between the synthesis 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.620
 of serotonin and the total hours of light 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.770
 solar during the day in humans post 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.080
 Morten serotonin levels are more 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.950
 high during the summer that during the 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.750
 winter improve your mood 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.720
 It can be as easy as opening the 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.510
 curtains in your room is about 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.420
 get natural light during the day 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.490
 artificial during night light 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.610
 natural is better to raise the 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.710
 serotonin than led lights 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.280
 artificial fluorescent ou light 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.010
 Artificial especially at night blocks 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.400
 the production of melatonin which 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.919
 helps your body sleep well 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.070
 Invests in a massage several studies 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.770
 show that massage therapy 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.680
 helps to decrease the stress hormone 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.140
 cortisol at the same time it increases 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.260
 serotonin levels and increases the 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.430
 dopamine this double effect adds 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.340
 much value to the most 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.250
 stress interferes with serotonin 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.200
 prolonged periods of stress 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.380
 can detect levels of 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.570
 serotonin too much stress has a 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.990
 impact on the capacity of your body 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.970
 to produce and synthesize serotonin is 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.190
 why you should stay away from 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:48.310
 Stress situations as much as possible 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.170
 possible and find healthy ways 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.530
 to control it 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.800
 if you have stress for your lifestyle 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:01.080
 try to practice yoga meditation 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.080
 deep breathing exercises
