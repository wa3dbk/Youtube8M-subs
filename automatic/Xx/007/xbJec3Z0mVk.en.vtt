so many problems with online and how

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.690 
so many problems with online and how
they're<00:02:10.440> reviewed<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> first<00:02:11.250> place

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
they're reviewed in the first place

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.130 
they're reviewed in the first place
how<00:02:12.180> they're<00:02:12.330> seen<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> first<00:02:12.810> place<00:02:12.959> I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
how they're seen in the first place I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.890 
how they're seen in the first place I
don't<00:02:13.170> really

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
don't really

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500 
don't really
that<00:02:14.230> Ubisoft<00:02:15.129> idea<00:02:15.760> for<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.090> crew<00:02:16.360> is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
that Ubisoft idea for the crew is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.000 
that Ubisoft idea for the crew is
actually<00:02:16.629> better<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.349> actually<00:02:17.530> think<00:02:17.799> it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
actually better I actually think it's

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.080 
actually better I actually think it's
worse

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
worse

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.270 
worse
I<00:02:19.120> think<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.290> what<00:02:20.439> they<00:02:20.560> should<00:02:20.860> do<00:02:21.069> is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
I think that what they should do is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.710 
I think that what they should do is
basically<00:02:21.459> turn<00:02:21.909> everything<00:02:22.180> on<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.629> have

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
basically turn everything on and have

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.210 
basically turn everything on and have
people<00:02:22.930> have<00:02:23.110> people<00:02:23.439> playing<00:02:23.739> for<00:02:23.920> like<00:02:24.010> two

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
people have people playing for like two

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.640 
people have people playing for like two
weeks<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:25.269> know<00:02:25.720> before<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.200> review<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.530> think

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
weeks you know before the review I think

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.170 
weeks you know before the review I think
that<00:02:26.980> there's<00:02:27.159> nothing<00:02:27.430> wrong<00:02:27.700> with<00:02:27.760> that

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
that there's nothing wrong with that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.449 
that there's nothing wrong with that
I<00:02:28.209> do<00:02:28.510> wonder<00:02:28.959> sometimes<00:02:29.079> if<00:02:29.709> because<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.250> the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
I do wonder sometimes if because of the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.849 
I do wonder sometimes if because of the
somewhat<00:02:31.150> universal<00:02:31.810> belief<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.439> and

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
somewhat universal belief and and

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.979 
somewhat universal belief and and
thought<00:02:33.220> process<00:02:33.730> behind<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.209> crew<00:02:34.510> from<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
thought process behind the crew from a

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.420 
thought process behind the crew from a
lot<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.170> people<00:02:35.409> I've<00:02:35.500> talked<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.069> that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
lot of people I've talked to is that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.110 
lot of people I've talked to is that
it's<00:02:37.209> not<00:02:37.420> very<00:02:37.659> good<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.400> little<00:02:39.670> nervous

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
it's not very good I'm a little nervous

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.080 
it's not very good I'm a little nervous
that<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.530> idea<00:02:42.189> and<00:02:42.489> change<00:02:42.879> has

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
that that this idea and change has

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.300 
that that this idea and change has
occurred<00:02:43.359> because<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:44.079> that<00:02:44.590> feedback<00:02:45.099> from

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
occurred because of that feedback from

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.149 
occurred because of that feedback from
the<00:02:45.459> beta<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.000> these<00:02:46.780> odd<00:02:47.109> suggestions<00:02:47.889> of

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
the beta and these odd suggestions of

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
not listening to people because somebody

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.589 
not listening to people because somebody

along<00:03:18.370> enough<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.329> it<00:03:19.449> that<00:03:19.629> they<00:03:19.720> just<00:03:19.959> think

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
along enough of it that they just think

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.210 
along enough of it that they just think
it's<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.349> wash<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.799> they're<00:03:20.889> like<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.160> don't

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
it's a wash and they're like I don't

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.099 
it's a wash and they're like I don't
like<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.639> regardless<00:03:22.090> if<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.389> very<00:03:22.629> end<00:03:22.900> is

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
like it regardless if the very end is

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.379 
like it regardless if the very end is
really<00:03:23.410> good<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.829> so<00:03:24.489> I'm<00:03:24.669> really<00:03:24.940> worried

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
really good and so I'm really worried

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.670 
really good and so I'm really worried
that<00:03:25.419> impressions<00:03:26.139> are<00:03:26.230> gonna<00:03:26.319> replace

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
that impressions are gonna replace

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.759 
that impressions are gonna replace
reviews<00:03:27.250> especially<00:03:27.940> for<00:03:28.510> games<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:29.440> this

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
reviews especially for games like this

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.069 
reviews especially for games like this
and<00:03:30.069> I'm<00:03:30.430> really<00:03:30.760> worried<00:03:31.209> division<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.900> gonna

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
and I'm really worried division is gonna

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.890 
and I'm really worried division is gonna
come<00:03:32.319> under<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.680> same<00:03:33.069> just<00:03:33.849> idiotic<00:03:34.239> level

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
come under this same just idiotic level

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.680 
come under this same just idiotic level
of<00:03:35.109> you<00:03:35.709> know<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:36.310> hinting<00:03:37.000> around<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.599> you

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
should only pay attention to very

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.369 
should only pay attention to very
specific<00:03:39.669> reviews<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.299> if<00:03:40.659> you<00:03:40.780> really<00:03:41.139> look

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
some of us were informed of it it really

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.420 
some of us were informed of it it really
did<00:03:46.209> basically<00:03:46.479> seem<00:03:47.079> like<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.409> was<00:03:47.530> saying<00:03:47.739> if

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
did basically seem like it was saying if

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.550 
did basically seem like it was saying if
somebody<00:03:48.819> says<00:03:49.060> something<00:03:49.090> negative<00:03:49.629> don't

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
somebody says something negative don't

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.689 
somebody says something negative don't
listen<00:03:50.859> and<00:03:51.449> that's<00:03:52.449> really<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.139> only<00:03:53.699> thing

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
listen and that's really the only thing

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.189 
listen and that's really the only thing
you<00:03:54.729> could<00:03:55.030> take<00:03:55.239> out<00:03:55.449> of<00:03:55.479> this<00:03:55.720> because<00:03:56.079> if

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
you could take out of this because if

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.420 
you could take out of this because if
somebody<00:03:56.470> says<00:03:56.709> something<00:03:56.889> positive<00:03:57.750> well

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
somebody says something positive well

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.250 
somebody says something positive well
you<00:04:00.430> would<00:04:00.669> listen<00:04:00.879> because<00:04:01.419> that<00:04:01.959> would<00:04:02.139> mean

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
you would listen because that would mean

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.050 
you would listen because that would mean
things<00:04:02.560> were<00:04:02.709> working<00:04:02.919> but<00:04:03.579> if<00:04:03.699> somebody<00:04:04.000> says

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
things were working but if somebody says

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.119 
things were working but if somebody says
something<00:04:04.239> negative<00:04:04.780> they've<00:04:05.590> got<00:04:05.799> an<00:04:05.979> out

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
something negative they've got an out

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.610 
something negative they've got an out
well<00:04:06.669> the<00:04:07.150> person<00:04:07.389> looked<00:04:07.959> at<00:04:08.109> it<00:04:08.260> too<00:04:08.379> quickly

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
well the person looked at it too quickly

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.830 
well the person looked at it too quickly
so<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.699> really<00:04:10.209> bothers<00:04:10.479> me<00:04:10.540> I'd<00:04:10.690> like<00:04:10.810> to

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
videos on games that have

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400 
videos on games that have
you<00:04:26.910> know<00:04:27.030> reach<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.540> kind<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.870> stuff<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.290> I

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
you know reach that kind of stuff and I

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.080 
you know reach that kind of stuff and I
have<00:04:28.530> no<00:04:28.650> problem<00:04:28.979> doing<00:04:29.100> that<00:04:29.220> but<00:04:29.699> I<00:04:29.729> really

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
have no problem doing that but I really

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.400 
have no problem doing that but I really
feel<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.300> when<00:04:30.570> somebody<00:04:30.810> says<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.169> term

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
feel that when somebody says the term

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.530 
feel that when somebody says the term
review<00:04:31.889> that's<00:04:32.100> sort<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.460> final<00:04:33.210> until

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
review that's sort of final until

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.840 
review that's sort of final until
something<00:04:33.930> major<00:04:34.169> happens<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.889> I<00:04:35.250> think

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
something major happens and I think

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.890 
something major happens and I think
people<00:04:35.970> are<00:04:36.090> more<00:04:36.240> comfortable<00:04:36.540> with<00:04:36.810> a

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
people are more comfortable with a

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900 
people are more comfortable with a
review<00:04:37.530> video<00:04:37.770> than<00:04:38.190> an<00:04:38.310> impressions<00:04:38.729> video

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
review video than an impressions video

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.710 
review video than an impressions video
but<00:04:39.060> I'd<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.389> know
