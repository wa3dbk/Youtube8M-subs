00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 by víctor de terra -mexico- professor 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.620
 In addition to the speculation that 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
 they gave after the game against 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.300
 honduras is no longer also the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.790
 that at least users 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.400
 do a survey and that the tica hobby 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.340
 he also thinks that he let himself be won 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.890
 a little bit that will help you put your hand to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.779
 honduras because all those who did 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.890
 they think that way they are supremely 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.109
 wrong 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.660
 I have seen through my years 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.430
 serious journalists from mexico 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:40.059
 like laura orvañanos like francis ramón 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.190
 fernandez as those who are clients 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.710
 reputed - found in five six and 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.500
 seven worlds and ames I did not know how to speak 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.910
 those crap I think that in about two 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.030
 or three journalists who are disguised 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.769
 of clowns have the disguise of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.330
 journalist but they are not journalists and 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.210
 they have to learn to respect the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.760
 countries something now that costa rica and the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.129
 people who act with the country so that 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.140
 Costa Rica did what it wanted that I look for 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.520
 We could not do it but we did not 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.040
 we had done what you are 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.050
 saying it was not a lack of respect in 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.700
 a country and you that's why they are 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.940
 paying you want to be for the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.940
 world 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.869
 savior at this point the world does not have 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.840
 that learn to respect a team like 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.000
 Don Jose Ramon and Mr. goodbye to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.190
 I know them 17 who are talking 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.110
 the things some clowns are dressed or 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.630
 disguised as journalists but that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.980
 it is also requested by the non- ethical 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.830
 tell gossip 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.300
 they are his inventions so stuck in a 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.250
 problem will soon be out 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.770
 of the world that we have the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.750
 blame you without guilt we do not 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.670
 let's put in we are respectful 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.290
 well the spirit tomorrow I will 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.120
 try a team that I know has 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.890
 good players who has things 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.840
 important I'm not here respecting 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.120
 a team as a doctor does not fit me 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.260
 it goes through the head we finalize 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.260
 thank you very much gentlemen
