00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
remember that the fishtail braid is

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.199 
remember that the fishtail braid is
tricky<00:02:42.590> but<00:02:42.860> as<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.220> keep<00:02:43.340> going<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.910> gets<00:02:44.120> a

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
tricky but as you keep going it gets a

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.289 
tricky but as you keep going it gets a
lot<00:02:44.390> easier<00:02:45.760> remember<00:02:46.760> while<00:02:46.940> you're<00:02:46.970> doing

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
lot easier remember while you're doing

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.160 
lot easier remember while you're doing
this<00:02:47.920> when<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.010> take<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.549> piece<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.450> pull<00:02:51.079> it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
this when you take a piece and pull it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.470 
this when you take a piece and pull it
over<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.590> opposite<00:02:51.980> side<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:53.209> want<00:02:53.389> to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
over to the opposite side you want to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.900 
over to the opposite side you want to
make<00:02:53.630> sure<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:54.139> you<00:02:54.260> are<00:02:54.500> tightening<00:02:55.340> as<00:02:55.609> you

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
make sure that you are tightening as you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.640 
make sure that you are tightening as you
go<00:02:56.060> but<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.810> want<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.049> make<00:02:57.170> sure<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.380> it

go but you want to make sure that it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280 
go but you want to make sure that it
kind<00:02:57.829> of<00:02:57.889> loosens<00:02:58.660> eventually<00:02:59.660> so<00:02:59.989> once<00:03:00.170> you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
kind of loosens eventually so once you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.490 
kind of loosens eventually so once you
reach<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.530> back<00:03:00.889> of<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.750> section<00:03:02.750> instead

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
reach the back of that section instead

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.050 
reach the back of that section instead
