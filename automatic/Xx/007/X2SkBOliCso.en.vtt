you're working with but watch what it

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.910 
you're working with but watch what it
does<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.270> inside<00:01:55.900> of<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.470> when

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
does to the inside of you when

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.010 
does to the inside of you when
something's<00:01:57.400> clicks<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.300> switches<00:01:58.720> it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
something's clicks it switches it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.590 
something's clicks it switches it
triggers<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.100> then<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.550> explodes<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.360> now

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
triggers and then just explodes and now

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.499 
triggers and then just explodes and now
you<00:02:01.660> go<00:02:02.140> home<00:02:02.530> from<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.220> event<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.210> say

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
you go home from that event and you say

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.680 
you go home from that event and you say
the<00:02:04.720> same<00:02:04.990> words<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:06.580> people<00:02:07.000> hear<00:02:07.300> something

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
the same words but people hear something

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.630 
the same words but people hear something
completely<00:02:08.140> different<00:02:08.380> coming<00:02:09.250> early<00:02:09.550> to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
completely different coming early to

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.400 
completely different coming early to
convention<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.179> think<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.600> very<00:02:10.720> essential

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
convention I think is a very essential

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.470 
convention I think is a very essential
part<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.130> overall<00:02:12.340> experience<00:02:12.819> because

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
part of the overall experience because

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.300 
part of the overall experience because
we're<00:02:13.630> all<00:02:13.780> going<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.080> experience<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> magic

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
we're all going to experience the magic

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.790 
we're all going to experience the magic
that<00:02:15.340> takes<00:02:15.760> place<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.480> event<00:02:16.780> itself<00:02:16.900> but

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
that takes place in the event itself but

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.130
