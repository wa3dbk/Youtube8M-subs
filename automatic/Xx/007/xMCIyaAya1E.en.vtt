00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 I mean that's robin and hearty 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.009
 welcome to the text gamigo here it is 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.009
 As always, no news and gamings 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.130
 they have persuaded me that bryan 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 cranston worldwide corner heisenberg 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.779
 motherfucker advantage buck would have lex 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.420
 luthor playing in the nel of steel title 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.820
 and now where the fact is lex luthor 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 cast and should be at least six 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.930
 be a part of a movie 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.439
 but also just because he already burst 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.390
 there to taste 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 For a long time he works on google 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.110
 dare to drive by itself so far 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.090
 still be a driver 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 Now you are working on a taxi from 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.530
 a robot drove completely alone 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 so as not in toto recall so 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.079
 more new but the one with a black one 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 no matter in three knew 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.570
 a new study against that dark wave 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.410
 2 play smarter makes the test 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.090
 people were in two groups 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.649
 the one has over the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.879
 longer period sims played the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 others over the longer period 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.170
 intense starcraft 2 and there it out 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.329
 come that the starcraft 2 players am 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.270
 a higher cognitive flexibility 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 that means using knowledge quickly 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.390
 and who says unlocked before the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.000
 multiplayer knows what that means 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.040
 World of Warcraft will be free to play 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.690
 not immediately but sometime now 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.700
 is an item shop in development of 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.760
 well of warcraft should have been for eight years 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.800
 the absolute king of the abos it seems 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.550
 he too probably at some point 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.500
 to end 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.090
 that is definitely the question 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.710
 is only when after the failure of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 star was the old republic as abo in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.640
 the success of guild wars 2 as the am 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.290
 fastest in the west selling the emo 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.630
 all times and the announcement of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.520
 everquest next as free to play 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.530
 we'll see the end of the abo model 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.660
 predicted and although it is positive 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.550
 Examples like eve online and also 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.649
 world of warcraft with its 77 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.869
 million subscribers are not exactly 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.550
 Weakness it looks like it would be 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.890
 subscriptions in the future no longer that 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.340
 Previous model was still so now 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.509
 the world online announced as abo mmo 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.460
 many consider this a bad one 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.690
 Decision included me so far 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.300
 are as good as all 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.860
 paid mmo next to world of 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.869
 warcraft failed i'm looking forward to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.979
 in any case, very much on the us fund online 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.899
 I 've been around for a long time 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.700
 not so much looking forward to a mmo that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.760
 last time, though, was the time 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.530
 republic and we all know it like that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.370
 the trade is the star wars 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.380
 before that, what a damage arises 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.110
 actually if in such a movie like that 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.989
 Everything is gone so the alliance 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.910
 insurance has now calculated more 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.769
 what the hobbit movie would have cost 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.480
 if the offenders insured with them 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.540
 So that would have been everything 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.190
 would have been real and calculated that way 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.510
 For example, what was tasted when 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.610
 one generates the sender his 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.310
 cut off arms would have to replace 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.680
 it must then be 5000 euros 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.540
 pain relief given by the alliance 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.630
 however, costs of treatment fall 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.299
 only 500 euro one because there has net 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.360
 saved by his last 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.260
 inexpensive hook spies prostheses 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.280
 loss of earnings damages are calculated 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.820
 to 200 euros 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.660
 the leader kicks 100 euro daily 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.049
 however, he is quick on the 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.790
 legs 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.730
 There were only two days out there 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.030
 movie was made on 25 giant wolves vox 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.230
 Killed every harm amounts to 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.879
 25 million euros 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.100
 because this species is extinct 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.500
 threatened and is therefore 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.900
 ultimately there was really fat damage 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.220
 causes this break in the arm can yes 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.380
 actually also the liability speak 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.100
 damage totals 3.1 million 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.890
 Euro 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.470
 georg are extremely cheap ware that 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.820
 are only former half year 3.1 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.860
 million would have been correct then 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.270
 worth it for gaddafi dwarfs and the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.830
 hobbits and everyone else involved 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.840
 because the film has a total of one 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.780
 However, that has taken up billions 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.340
 Whole be and the whole production 500 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.560
 Millions cost the next time 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.330
 it would just be a lot cheaper the man 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.260
 slaughtered real orks and the before 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.540
 insured last days only before the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.700
 gamescom reports but there were parallel 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.870
 yet another fair and that's the emergency 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.150
 games fixed 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.950
 this is not about games but that is 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.080
 not this festival is about games 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.840
 because it's more about creativity and creativity 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.920
 the beauty you can do 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.750
 not win you can not lose 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.220
 you can just beautiful things 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.840
 we just wonder why the whole thing 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.220
 so separately from gamescom 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.260
 He has certainly taken place 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.670
 still been somewhere root 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.290
 powerful why that sort of thing 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.610
 a bit to integrated because on the 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.080
 There is also a fair amount of food 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.670
 indie games in blatant 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.350
 have artistic claim and also 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.710
 Video games general can art 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.170
 his 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.940
 especially games like minecraft or 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.530
 products park this is a new game 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.020
 that was presented at gamescom 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.450
 where you play and machine yourself 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.580
 measure are completely free to create 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.530
 art projects or actually even 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.300
 tools and thus art too 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.290
 create 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.330
 definitely I have so horny shit 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.710
 minecraft built but nobody sees it 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.940
 However, one must also say that 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.220
 this game at gamescom 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.140
 would probably go down positively 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.570
 you have to say about the NOT games everyone 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.280
 gets along well there is no 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.320
 Frustration because you are against the whole hardcore 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.580
 Awesome gamer just lose and 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.770
 maybe that's just one of them 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.450
 Therefore , these games on the 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.370
 to present gamescom as you can with it 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.080
 easily reach new target groups 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.150
 not everyone likes the stark fat ones 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.000
 action battlefield games but max 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.110
 a little more experimental 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.910
 what would you say if such 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.560
 artificial game at gamescom too 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.820
 it would be the fair 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.680
 you would enrich them, too 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.250
 try writing your opinion in 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.250
 the comments 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.100
 and no textform red I have 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:52.060
 Join them now 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:53.830
 but also ekström mediums data 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.140
 there are two videos over there you can 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.980
 subscribe to 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.980
 I was not so long more 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.790
 two videos 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.230
 to sing properly with a lot 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.570
 Schmackes 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.170
 lorenz over there again I want the 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.840
 Do not transition the transition to facebook 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.210
 we find the view from below 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.650
 individual case exactly will I would 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:34.370
 turn now as the worst 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:35.860
 Endeavor could come quickly 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.000
 that would have everything 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.000
 whatever so much
