00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.369 

over<00:00:08.149> the<00:00:08.240> past<00:00:08.450> few<00:00:08.629> days<00:00:08.780> I've<00:00:09.019> been<00:00:09.049> looking

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:09.379 
over the past few days I've been looking

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:11.500 
over the past few days I've been looking
at<00:00:09.469> the<00:00:09.559> way<00:00:09.709> that<00:00:10.670> I'm<00:00:10.789> doing<00:00:10.940> the<00:00:11.119> vegetable

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
at the way that I'm doing the vegetable

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.840 
at the way that I'm doing the vegetable
gardens<00:00:11.869> of<00:00:12.049> the<00:00:12.080> sustainable<00:00:12.650> house<00:00:12.850> and

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
gardens of the sustainable house and

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.060 
gardens of the sustainable house and
I've<00:00:14.059> decided<00:00:14.299> to<00:00:14.510> introduce<00:00:14.750> a<00:00:15.230> trial<00:00:15.920> a

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
I've decided to introduce a trial a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.099 
I've decided to introduce a trial a
concept<00:00:16.550> that<00:00:16.730> was<00:00:16.970> originally<00:00:17.510> advanced<00:00:17.990> by

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
concept that was originally advanced by

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.520 
concept that was originally advanced by
Linda<00:00:18.859> Woodrow<00:00:19.279> in<00:00:20.029> her<00:00:20.330> book<00:00:20.570> the

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
Linda Woodrow in her book the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.340 
Linda Woodrow in her book the
permaculture<00:00:21.920> home<00:00:22.250> garden<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:23.539> it's<00:00:24.110> a

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
permaculture home garden and it's a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.070 
permaculture home garden and it's a
mandala<00:00:24.830> garden<00:00:25.369> system<00:00:25.880> which<00:00:26.720> integrates

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
mandala garden system which integrates

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.460 
mandala garden system which integrates
chickens<00:00:28.240> directly<00:00:29.240> into<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:29.869> garden<00:00:30.020> and

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
chickens directly into the garden and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.709 
chickens directly into the garden and
the<00:00:30.740> way<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:30.949> works<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:31.430> we<00:00:32.029> have<00:00:32.059> a<00:00:32.239> chicken

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
the way it works is we have a chicken

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.889 
the way it works is we have a chicken
dome<00:00:33.050> which<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:33.920> is<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.270> structure<00:00:35.270> of<00:00:35.420> here

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
dome which this is the structure of here

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.889 
dome which this is the structure of here
and<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:37.460> chickens<00:00:37.760> live<00:00:37.969> inside<00:00:38.269> the<00:00:38.420> dome<00:00:38.600> in

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
and the chickens live inside the dome in

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.250 
and the chickens live inside the dome in
the<00:00:38.960> dome<00:00:39.170> sits<00:00:40.159> on<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.399> garden<00:00:40.819> bed<00:00:41.059> has<00:00:42.050> sort

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
the dome sits on a garden bed has sort

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.079 
the dome sits on a garden bed has sort
of<00:00:42.289> station<00:00:42.769> six<00:00:43.219> stations<00:00:43.639> or<00:00:43.819> twelve

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
of station six stations or twelve

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.540 
of station six stations or twelve
stations<00:00:44.479> around<00:00:44.569> a<00:00:44.719> full<00:00:44.899> system<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:45.800> every

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
stations around a full system and every

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.840 
stations around a full system and every
two<00:00:46.699> weeks<00:00:46.999> the<00:00:47.889> chicken<00:00:48.889> dome<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:49.399> moved<00:00:49.670> from

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
two weeks the chicken dome is moved from

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.729 
two weeks the chicken dome is moved from
station<00:00:50.299> to<00:00:50.329> station<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:50.989> it<00:00:51.079> takes<00:00:51.289> about<00:00:51.409> six

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
station to station so it takes about six

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.819 
station to station so it takes about six
months<00:00:51.969> for<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.719> chicken<00:00:54.170> dome<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.559> go<00:00:54.649> all

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
months for the chicken dome to go all

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.680 
months for the chicken dome to go all
the<00:00:54.979> way<00:00:55.010> around<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.999> come<00:00:56.299> back<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
the way around and come back to the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.799 
the way around and come back to the
station<00:00:56.929> it<00:00:57.229> started<00:00:57.679> on<00:00:57.799> and<00:00:58.600> basically<00:00:59.600> what

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
station it started on and basically what

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.059 
station it started on and basically what
happens<00:01:00.049> is<00:01:00.139> when<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.319> chickens<00:01:00.620> are<00:01:00.769> in<00:01:00.859> now

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
happens is when the chickens are in now

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:03.549 
happens is when the chickens are in now
they<00:01:01.819> actually<00:01:01.999> dissipate<00:01:02.929> the<00:01:03.079> area<00:01:03.379> they

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
they actually dissipate the area they

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.070 
they actually dissipate the area they
they<00:01:04.100> don't<00:01:04.369> clear<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:04.869> initially<00:01:05.869> they'll

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
they don't clear it initially they'll

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.219 
they don't clear it initially they'll
clear<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:07.090> weeds<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.450> seeds<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.049> like

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
clear it of weeds and seeds and the like

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.900 
clear it of weeds and seeds and the like
you'll<00:01:09.470> throw<00:01:09.740> your<00:01:09.770> mulch<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:10.430> there<00:01:10.640> they

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
you'll throw your mulch in there they

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.970 
you'll throw your mulch in there they
will<00:01:11.060> spread<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.570> out<00:01:11.630> they'll<00:01:12.620> do<00:01:12.770> what

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
will spread that out they'll do what

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.550 
will spread that out they'll do what
chickens<00:01:13.310> do<00:01:13.460> basically<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.330> then<00:01:14.990> when<00:01:15.470> they

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
chickens do basically and then when they

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.650 
chickens do basically and then when they
come<00:01:15.740> back<00:01:15.800> in<00:01:16.070> six<00:01:16.280> months<00:01:16.520> time<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:17.240> garden

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
come back in six months time the garden

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.660 
come back in six months time the garden
is<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:17.990> largely<00:01:18.320> spent<00:01:18.740> most<00:01:19.100> vegetables<00:01:19.580> will

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
is is largely spent most vegetables will

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.070 
is is largely spent most vegetables will
grow<00:01:19.700> within<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.180> six<00:01:20.390> month<00:01:20.570> period<00:01:20.630> the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
grow within a six month period the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.920 
grow within a six month period the
garden<00:01:21.890> slider<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.310> spent<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.850> has<00:01:23.060> plant

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
garden slider is spent it has plant

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.860 
garden slider is spent it has plant
material<00:01:24.560> left<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:25.070> has<00:01:25.240> weed<00:01:26.240> it's<00:01:26.480> weeds

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
material left it has weed it's weeds

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.930 
material left it has weed it's weeds
only<00:01:27.260> come<00:01:27.440> in<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:27.770> has<00:01:27.920> bugs<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.550> there

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
only come in and has bugs in there

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.000 
only come in and has bugs in there
chickens<00:01:29.720> go<00:01:29.870> back<00:01:30.050> onto<00:01:30.260> it<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.560> clear<00:01:30.860> it

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
chickens go back onto it and clear it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.470 
chickens go back onto it and clear it
over<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.430> two<00:01:31.580> weeks<00:01:31.820> they're<00:01:32.000> on<00:01:32.120> there<00:01:32.330> of

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
over the two weeks they're on there of

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.690 
over the two weeks they're on there of
all<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.960> as<00:01:33.560> well<00:01:33.770> as<00:01:33.890> manuring<00:01:34.400> it<00:01:34.550> while

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
all of that as well as manuring it while

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.870 
all of that as well as manuring it while
they're<00:01:34.850> there<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.740> anyway<00:01:36.980> so<00:01:37.040> I've<00:01:37.640> started

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
they're there so anyway so I've started

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.810 
they're there so anyway so I've started
by<00:01:38.060> building<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:39.110> chicken<00:01:39.500> dome<00:01:39.860> frame<00:01:40.280> now

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
by building a chicken dome frame now

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.430 
by building a chicken dome frame now
I've<00:01:40.940> done<00:01:41.120> this<00:01:41.240> slightly<00:01:41.720> differently<00:01:42.200> too

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
I've done this slightly differently too

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.690 
I've done this slightly differently too
to<00:01:42.680> Linda<00:01:42.920> wood<00:01:43.040> Rose<00:01:43.310> design<00:01:44.060> but<00:01:45.430> very<00:01:46.430> very

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
to Linda wood Rose design but very very

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.430 
to Linda wood Rose design but very very
slightly<00:01:47.030> differently<00:01:47.480> basically<00:01:48.230> all<00:01:48.320> I've

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
slightly differently basically all I've

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.720 
slightly differently basically all I've
done<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.620> drop<00:01:49.010> this<00:01:49.990> top<00:01:50.990> cross<00:01:51.470> rail<00:01:51.740> down<00:01:52.700> a

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
done is drop this top cross rail down a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.510 
done is drop this top cross rail down a
little<00:01:53.030> bit<00:01:53.270> which<00:01:53.810> changes<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.560> angle<00:01:54.710> on<00:01:55.220> it

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
little bit which changes the angle on it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.920 
little bit which changes the angle on it
you<00:01:55.610> can<00:01:55.700> see<00:01:55.820> at<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.970> top<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.659> angle

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
you can see at the top that the angle

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.990 
you can see at the top that the angle
changes<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.380> bit<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:58.250> reason<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.610> did<00:01:58.790> that<00:01:58.820> is

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
changes a bit the reason I did that is

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.910 
changes a bit the reason I did that is
it<00:01:59.210> means<00:01:59.510> that<00:01:59.810> all<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.080> pieces<00:02:00.290> are<00:02:00.500> pulling

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
it means that all the pieces are pulling

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.230 
it means that all the pieces are pulling
against<00:02:01.310> each<00:02:01.430> other<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:01.940> actually

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
against each other and it actually

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.690 
against each other and it actually
provides<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.630> lot<00:02:02.780> more<00:02:02.810> rigidity<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.370> unit

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
provides a lot more rigidity to the unit

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.570 
provides a lot more rigidity to the unit
I'm<00:02:05.390> also<00:02:05.600> going<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.990> cover<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.380> base<00:02:06.580> design

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
I'm also going to cover the base design

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.210 
I'm also going to cover the base design
so<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.330> bottom<00:02:08.690> rail<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:09.979> top

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
so that this bottom rail and this top

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.089 
so that this bottom rail and this top
rail<00:02:10.459> are<00:02:11.019> 150<00:02:12.019> centimeters<00:02:12.500> apart

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
rail are 150 centimeters apart

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.550 
rail are 150 centimeters apart
so<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.870> 180<00:02:15.189> centimeter<00:02:16.239> roll<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.389> wire<00:02:17.599> should

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
so a 180 centimeter roll of wire should

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.520 
so a 180 centimeter roll of wire should
be<00:02:18.620> able<00:02:18.889> to<00:02:19.069> income

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
be able to income

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.030 
be able to income
thus<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.040> whole<00:02:20.069> thing<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:22.260> allow<00:02:22.560> for<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
thus the whole thing and and allow for a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.480 
thus the whole thing and and allow for a
150<00:02:23.700> mil<00:02:23.880> wrap<00:02:24.510> over<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:25.230> either<00:02:25.410> end<00:02:25.770> that

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
150 mil wrap over at either end that

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.860 
150 mil wrap over at either end that
will<00:02:26.610> add<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> great<00:02:27.120> deal<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.330> strength

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
will add a great deal of strength

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.660 
will add a great deal of strength
because<00:02:28.410> it'll<00:02:28.740> largely<00:02:29.010> be<00:02:29.160> one<00:02:29.340> piece<00:02:29.520> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
because it'll largely be one piece of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.910 
because it'll largely be one piece of
wire<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.600> I'll<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.780> holding<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.230> place<00:02:31.260> we

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
wire that I'll be holding in place we

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.250 
wire that I'll be holding in place we
will<00:02:32.069> need<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> put<00:02:32.400> pleats<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.930> sort<00:02:34.200> of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
will need to put pleats on this sort of

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.949 
will need to put pleats on this sort of
portion<00:02:34.860> here<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.520> when<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> actually<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.750> that

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
portion here so when I actually do that

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.150 
portion here so when I actually do that
that<00:02:37.140> job<00:02:37.380> which<00:02:37.530> will<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.800> next<00:02:37.920> few

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
that job which will be in the next few

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.699 
that job which will be in the next few
days<00:02:38.310> I'll<00:02:39.180> come<00:02:39.239> back<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.989> add<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.620> this

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
days I'll come back and add to this

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.860 
days I'll come back and add to this
video<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.640> little<00:02:42.300> bit<00:02:42.390> later<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:42.600> they'll

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
video so a little bit later on they'll

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.420 
video so a little bit later on they'll
be<00:02:42.930> an<00:02:42.989> addendum<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.860> you'll<00:02:44.370> be

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
be an addendum to this and you'll be

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.610 
be an addendum to this and you'll be
able<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.610> see<00:02:44.760> see<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.500> other

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
able to see see that on there the other

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.400 
able to see see that on there the other
change<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.459> she<00:02:47.640> had<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> at<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> top<00:02:49.110> here

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
change is that she had a at the top here

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.070 
change is that she had a at the top here
Linda<00:02:50.250> Woodrow<00:02:50.550> had<00:02:50.760> wire<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:51.630> had<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
Linda Woodrow had wire and then had a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.050 
Linda Woodrow had wire and then had a
tarp<00:02:52.590> covering<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.489> was<00:02:53.640> tied<00:02:54.030> down

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
tarp covering it was tied down

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.910 
tarp covering it was tied down
separately<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.080> provide<00:02:55.320> shelter<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.769> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
separately to provide shelter to the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.220 
separately to provide shelter to the
chickens<00:02:56.480> I'm<00:02:57.480> actually<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.959> use<00:02:58.050> a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
chickens I'm actually going to use a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.800 
chickens I'm actually going to use a
shade<00:02:58.769> cloth<00:02:58.890> covering<00:02:59.370> for<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.300> top<00:03:00.510> which<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
shade cloth covering for the top which I

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.390 
shade cloth covering for the top which I
think<00:03:01.019> will<00:03:01.170> actually<00:03:01.440> lighten<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.250> it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
think will actually lighten it it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.040 
think will actually lighten it it
doesn't<00:03:02.580> really<00:03:02.670> need<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.360> through<00:03:03.840> wire

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
doesn't really need to be through wire

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.699 
doesn't really need to be through wire
at<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.380> point<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.950> don't<00:03:05.819> think<00:03:06.150> anyway<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.650> I

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
at that point I don't think anyway so I

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.580 
at that point I don't think anyway so I
used<00:03:07.920> sort<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.220> 50%<00:03:08.550> shade<00:03:08.940> cloth<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:10.290> then

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
used sort of 50% shade cloth and then

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.259 
used sort of 50% shade cloth and then
I'll<00:03:10.739> still<00:03:11.040> use<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.489> top<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.970> tie<00:03:12.090> down

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
I'll still use the top and tie down

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.160 
I'll still use the top and tie down
separately<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:14.459> yeah<00:03:14.760> these<00:03:15.600> cross<00:03:15.959> pieces

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
separately so so yeah these cross pieces

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.630 
separately so so yeah these cross pieces
that<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.620> see<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:16.860> red<00:03:17.100> thing<00:03:17.400> that's

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that you can see this red thing that's

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.340 
that you can see this red thing that's
just<00:03:17.819> simply<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.269> help<00:03:18.390> move<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.930> around<00:03:19.050> at

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
just simply to help move it around at

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.170 
just simply to help move it around at
the<00:03:19.410> moment<00:03:19.470> but<00:03:20.280> basically<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.880> reason<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the moment but basically the reason I

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.610 
the moment but basically the reason I
wanted<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.450> show<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.720> video<00:03:21.840> at<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.350> stage

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
wanted to show this video at this stage

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.800 
wanted to show this video at this stage
was<00:03:23.040> basically<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.940> show<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.239> frame<00:03:24.510> which<00:03:24.780> is

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
was basically to show the frame which is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.340 
was basically to show the frame which is
PVC<00:03:25.440> pipe<00:03:25.950> I'll<00:03:26.310> wire<00:03:26.790> together<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:27.510> my<00:03:28.019> hunt

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
PVC pipe I'll wire together with my hunt

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.720 
PVC pipe I'll wire together with my hunt
for<00:03:28.739> mill<00:03:29.690> galvanized<00:03:30.690> high<00:03:30.900> wire<00:03:31.190> but<00:03:32.190> but

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
for mill galvanized high wire but but

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.130 
for mill galvanized high wire but but
also<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.030> show<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.209> size<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.840> because

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
also to show the size of it because

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.479 
also to show the size of it because
we'll<00:03:34.260> know<00:03:34.380> originally<00:03:34.709> set<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:34.950> up<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.190> set<00:03:35.400> it

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
we'll know originally set it up I set it

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.979 
we'll know originally set it up I set it
up<00:03:35.579> sort<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.209> know<00:03:36.239> away<00:03:36.750> from<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
up sort of you know away from the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.710 
up sort of you know away from the
chickens<00:03:37.320> down<00:03:37.530> there<00:03:37.739> near<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.980> shed<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.720> I

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
chickens down there near the shed and I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.039 
chickens down there near the shed and I
looked<00:03:40.470> at<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.769> thought<00:03:41.420> Linda<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:42.900> her

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
looked at it and thought Linda in her

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.360 
looked at it and thought Linda in her
book<00:03:43.700> specifies<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.880> up<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.060> 12<00:03:45.360> chickens

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
book specifies that up to 12 chickens

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.440 
book specifies that up to 12 chickens
12:10<00:03:47.370> tor<00:03:47.610> chickens<00:03:47.910> can<00:03:48.060> live<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.329> this

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
12:10 tor chickens can live in this

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.810 
12:10 tor chickens can live in this
depending<00:03:49.320> on<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.500> size<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.890> chicken<00:03:50.070> and

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
depending on the size of the chicken and

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.039 
depending on the size of the chicken and
I<00:03:50.910> looked<00:03:51.090> at<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.209> size<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:51.540> thought<00:03:51.690> jeez

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
I looked at the size and thought jeez

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.500 
I looked at the size and thought jeez
it's<00:03:52.200> small<00:03:52.500> I'm<00:03:52.920> not<00:03:53.070> sure<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.250> 10<00:03:53.730> chickens

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
it's small I'm not sure that 10 chickens

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.509 
it's small I'm not sure that 10 chickens
will<00:03:54.780> really<00:03:55.109> fit<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.470> all<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.709> well<00:03:55.890> so

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
will really fit in a all that well so

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.800 
will really fit in a all that well so
I've<00:03:56.579> actually<00:03:56.700> brought<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.209> up<00:03:57.329> next<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.720> my

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
I've actually brought it up next to my

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.120 
I've actually brought it up next to my
chicken<00:03:57.989> pen<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.470> can<00:03:58.620> compare<00:03:58.890> sizes

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
chicken pen so I can compare sizes

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.490 
chicken pen so I can compare sizes
directly<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.720> don't<00:04:00.989> even<00:04:01.079> tell<00:04:01.320> me<00:04:01.350> any

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
directly and I don't even tell me any

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.080 
directly and I don't even tell me any
problems<00:04:01.799> at<00:04:01.890> all<00:04:02.040> because<00:04:02.489> as<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:02.730> can<00:04:02.880> see

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
problems at all because as you can see

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.020 
problems at all because as you can see
I've<00:04:03.840> come<00:04:04.049> back<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.320> way<00:04:04.500> actually<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.880> can

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
I've come back this way actually you can

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.670 
I've come back this way actually you can
see<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.600> site<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.989> area<00:04:07.320> within<00:04:07.500> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
see that the site the area within the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.009 
see that the site the area within the
circle<00:04:08.100> with<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> diameter<00:04:08.810> area<00:04:09.810> within

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
circle with the diameter area within

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.160 
circle with the diameter area within
here<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:11.100> actually<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.970> bit<00:04:12.269> smaller<00:04:12.660> probably

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
here is actually a bit smaller probably

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.190 
here is actually a bit smaller probably
about<00:04:13.410> maybe<00:04:14.400> half<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.480> area<00:04:15.840> that's

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
about maybe half of the area that's

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.900 
about maybe half of the area that's
available<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.070> chickens<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.669> their

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
available to the chickens in their

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.670 
available to the chickens in their
permanent<00:04:18.690> run<00:04:18.810> here<00:04:19.019> in<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.169> permanent<00:04:19.440> run

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
permanent run here in the permanent run

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.610 
permanent run here in the permanent run
and<00:04:20.000> there's<00:04:21.000> currently<00:04:21.180> 16<00:04:21.870> chickens<00:04:22.320> in

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and there's currently 16 chickens in

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.420 
and there's currently 16 chickens in
here<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.520> as<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.390> can<00:04:24.510> see<00:04:24.620> room<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:26.130> space

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
here and as you can see room and space

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.330 
here and as you can see room and space
is<00:04:26.789> not<00:04:27.000> really<00:04:27.479> much<00:04:27.599> of<00:04:27.659> an<00:04:27.870> issue<00:04:27.990> so<00:04:28.979> I

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
is not really much of an issue so I

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.010 
is not really much of an issue so I
think<00:04:29.460> given<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.150> fact<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.539> the<00:04:30.690> chickens

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
think given the fact that the chickens

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.780 
think given the fact that the chickens
are<00:04:31.289> moving

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
are moving

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.540 
are moving
every<00:04:33.790> two<00:04:33.970> weeks<00:04:34.210> off<00:04:34.540> onto<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.590> new<00:04:35.740> location

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
every two weeks off onto a new location

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.390 
every two weeks off onto a new location
I<00:04:36.580> actually<00:04:37.060> think<00:04:37.389> 12<00:04:37.780> chickens<00:04:38.169> even<00:04:39.100> 12

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
I actually think 12 chickens even 12

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.740 
I actually think 12 chickens even 12
sort<00:04:39.639> of<00:04:39.700> large<00:04:39.910> chickens<00:04:40.300> like<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.510> eyes<00:04:40.600> of

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
sort of large chickens like the eyes of

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.690 
sort of large chickens like the eyes of
ground<00:04:40.900> crosses<00:04:41.260> here<00:04:41.530> or<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:42.400> only

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
ground crosses here or the only

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.210 
ground crosses here or the only
adolescent<00:04:43.270> Austral<00:04:43.570> orcs<00:04:43.810> but<00:04:43.990> Ostrom<00:04:44.830> ups<00:04:45.040> i

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
adolescent Austral orcs but Ostrom ups i

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.890 
adolescent Austral orcs but Ostrom ups i
think<00:04:45.669> will<00:04:45.820> actually<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.240> quite<00:04:46.270> happy<00:04:46.780> in

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
think will actually be quite happy in

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.390 
think will actually be quite happy in
here<00:04:47.139> and<00:04:47.320> i<00:04:47.800> don't<00:04:48.040> think<00:04:48.070> we'll<00:04:48.250> have<00:04:48.310> too

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
here and i don't think we'll have too

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.510 
here and i don't think we'll have too
many<00:04:48.490> problems<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.540> rounded<00:04:50.220> nature<00:04:51.220> of<00:04:51.340> it

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
many problems the rounded nature of it

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.760 
many problems the rounded nature of it
also<00:04:52.120> means<00:04:52.480> that<00:04:52.600> no<00:04:52.780> one<00:04:52.960> can<00:04:53.139> get<00:04:53.290> cornered

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
also means that no one can get cornered

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.580 
also means that no one can get cornered
and<00:04:54.010> picked<00:04:54.430> on<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.230> you<00:04:56.230> know<00:04:56.320> someone's

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
and picked on so you know someone's

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.510 
and picked on so you know someone's
getting<00:04:56.770> chased<00:04:56.950> they<00:04:57.100> just<00:04:57.250> sort<00:04:57.370> of<00:04:57.400> run

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
getting chased they just sort of run

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.370 
getting chased they just sort of run
around<00:04:57.639> circles<00:04:58.180> as<00:04:58.389> opposed<00:04:58.660> to<00:04:58.810> I'm<00:04:59.110> being

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
around circles as opposed to I'm being

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.840 
around circles as opposed to I'm being
bailed<00:04:59.830> up<00:05:00.010> in<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.160> corner<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.610> really

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
bailed up in a corner and really

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.360 
bailed up in a corner and really
hammered<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:01.480> well<00:05:02.139> I<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.380> actually<00:05:02.830> think<00:05:03.130> this

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
hammered so well I I actually think this

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.810 
hammered so well I I actually think this
will<00:05:03.639> work<00:05:03.970> really<00:05:04.750> really<00:05:04.900> well<00:05:05.820> be

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
will work really really well be

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.430 
will work really really well be
interesting<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.180> see<00:05:07.330> how<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.810> does<00:05:07.930> pan<00:05:08.229> out

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
interesting to see how it does pan out

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.420 
interesting to see how it does pan out
as<00:05:08.740> we<00:05:09.280> move<00:05:09.820> forward<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.070> next<00:05:12.190> steps

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
as we move forward and so the next steps

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.430 
as we move forward and so the next steps
is<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.850> we've<00:05:13.060> yry<00:05:13.630> this<00:05:13.900> out<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.169> finish

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
is that we've yry this out and finish

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.250 
is that we've yry this out and finish
this<00:05:14.620> off<00:05:14.830> we'll<00:05:15.580> set<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.000> perch<00:05:16.300> system<00:05:16.810> which

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
this off we'll set a perch system which

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.140 
this off we'll set a perch system which
overhangs<00:05:17.680> sort<00:05:18.100> of<00:05:18.160> just<00:05:18.370> have<00:05:18.490> a<00:05:18.700> pier<00:05:18.970> so

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
overhangs sort of just have a pier so

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.290 
overhangs sort of just have a pier so
the<00:05:19.240> chickens<00:05:19.510> can<00:05:19.690> get<00:05:20.440> up<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.710> perch<00:05:21.300> and

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
the chickens can get up to the perch and

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.180 
the chickens can get up to the perch and
it<00:05:22.510> will<00:05:22.630> organise<00:05:23.020> some<00:05:23.440> like<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:23.650> lair<00:05:23.950> by

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
it will organise some like a lair by

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.210 
it will organise some like a lair by
flying<00:05:24.520> box<00:05:24.850> and<00:05:25.090> some<00:05:25.270> water<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.380> then<00:05:27.070> what
