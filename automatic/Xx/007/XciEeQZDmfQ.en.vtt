always<00:01:47.579> elegant<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.240> effortless<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> can

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
always elegant and effortless so I can

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
always elegant and effortless so I can
dress<00:01:49.649> over-the-top<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.490> still<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149

your<00:02:00.360> own<00:02:00.600> personality<00:02:01.350> without<00:02:01.979> trying<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
your own personality without trying to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.120
