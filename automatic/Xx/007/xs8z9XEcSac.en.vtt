this series for instance they would

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.800 
this series for instance they would
either<00:03:30.700> think<00:03:31.090> they<00:03:31.209> don't<00:03:31.390> like<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.600> Oda

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
anime for instance I think Lee nodded

anime for instance I think Lee nodded
off<00:03:35.350> six<00:03:35.650> or<00:03:35.800> seven<00:03:36.130> oda<00:03:36.670> nobunaga<00:03:36.790> anime<00:03:37.690> in

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
off six or seven oda nobunaga anime in

off six or seven oda nobunaga anime in
this<00:03:37.930> past<00:03:38.200> year<00:03:38.380> or<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:39.070> so<00:03:39.459> that's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
this past year or so and so that's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.820 
this past year or so and so that's
pretty<00:03:40.060> ridiculous<00:03:40.630> if<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.020> think<00:03:41.350> about<00:03:41.500> it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
pretty ridiculous if you think about it

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.380 
pretty ridiculous if you think about it
and<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.250> can<00:03:42.370> understand<00:03:42.790> why<00:03:42.880> Seoul<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.330> be

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
and I can understand why Seoul and be

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.670 
and I can understand why Seoul and be
turned<00:03:43.600> off<00:03:43.810> from<00:03:43.930> watching<00:03:44.350> this<00:03:44.410> at<00:03:44.590> the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
turned off from watching this at the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.990 
turned off from watching this at the
exact<00:03:44.920> same<00:03:45.100> time<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.310> can<00:03:45.550> see<00:03:45.670> why<00:03:45.790> people

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
exact same time I can see why people

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.760 
exact same time I can see why people
would<00:03:46.450> instantly<00:03:46.930> turn<00:03:47.140> off<00:03:47.410> from<00:03:47.620> this

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
would instantly turn off from this

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.320 
would instantly turn off from this
series<00:03:48.070> from<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.310> first<00:03:48.489> episode<00:03:48.700> because<00:03:49.180> of

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
series from the first episode because of

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.420 
series from the first episode because of
the<00:03:49.420> animation<00:03:49.930> art<00:03:50.230> style<00:03:50.590> but<00:03:51.100> if<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.280> can

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
the animation art style but if you can

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.880 
the animation art style but if you can
look<00:03:51.610> past<00:03:51.640> that<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:53.020> might<00:03:53.260> be<00:03:53.440> able<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.680> find

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
look past that you might be able to find

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.710 
look past that you might be able to find
a<00:03:54.010> good<00:03:54.160> story<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.550> hopefully<00:03:55.060> people<00:03:55.390> will

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
a good story and hopefully people will

the art style and they thought it was

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.590 
the art style and they thought it was
