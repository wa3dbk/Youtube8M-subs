goes<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.840> either<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.579> put<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
goes on like this either way you put the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
goes on like this either way you put the
back<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.240> first<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.689> put<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> top<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.320> first

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
back on first you put the top on first

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.130 
back on first you put the top on first
and<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.460> slides<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.909> very<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:48.899> easily

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and it just slides in very very easily

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800 
and it just slides in very very easily
there<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.920> go<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.360> like

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there you go it's on just like that like

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
there you go it's on just like that like
I<00:01:51.960> said<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.439> looks<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.860> incase

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
I said it just looks like in incase

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.830 
I said it just looks like in incase
slider<00:01:54.530> just<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:56.540> couple<00:01:57.540> things<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
slider just a little couple things I

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.539 
slider just a little couple things I
really<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.259> dislike<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.070> case<00:01:59.250> okay

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
really just dislike about this case okay

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.109 
really just dislike about this case okay
first<00:01:59.850> look<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.570> things<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.140> slim<00:02:02.030> there<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
first look at things it's slim there is

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
first look at things it's slim there is
a<00:02:03.149> lay<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> table<00:02:03.540> design<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.590> case<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
a lay on the table design so in case you

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.050 
a lay on the table design so in case you
happen<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> drop<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.790> ground<00:02:05.880> or

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
happen to drop it on the ground or

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.280 
happen to drop it on the ground or
anything<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> screen<00:02:06.630> hopefully<00:02:07.110> won't

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
anything the screen hopefully won't

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
anything the screen hopefully won't
crack<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.759> lip<00:02:09.119> will<00:02:09.300> be

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
crack because this little lip will be

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.040 
crack because this little lip will be
protecting<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.910> very<00:02:12.150> slim<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:12.780> very

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
protecting it it is very slim it's very

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.880 
protecting it it is very slim it's very
light<00:02:13.319> very

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
light very

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
light very
a<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:14.220> thin<00:02:14.490> case<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:15.450> made<00:02:15.600> out

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
a very thin case and but it's made out

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.170 
a very thin case and but it's made out
of<00:02:15.750> hard<00:02:15.960> plastic<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.440> which<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.590> quite<00:02:16.860> nice

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
of hard plastic so which is quite nice

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.250 
of hard plastic so which is quite nice
compared<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.569> mean<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.020> kind<00:02:19.200> of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
compared to this I mean you can kind of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.010 
compared to this I mean you can kind of
see<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.150> spec<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.569> lot<00:02:21.780> chunkier

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
see that this the spec is a lot chunkier

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.420 
see that this the spec is a lot chunkier
maybe<00:02:22.410> because<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.860> know<00:02:22.950> there's<00:02:23.220> more

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
maybe because you know there's more

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.590 
maybe because you know there's more
protection<00:02:23.910> there's<00:02:24.030> two<00:02:24.240> layers<00:02:24.480> of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
protection there's two layers of

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.900 
protection there's two layers of
projection<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.280> one's<00:02:26.430> only<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.670> very

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
projection but this one's only a very

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.510 
projection but this one's only a very
it's<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.240> thin<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:27.810> hard<00:02:28.230> shell<00:02:28.650> plastic

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
it's of thin very hard shell plastic

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.860 
it's of thin very hard shell plastic
case<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.880> little<00:02:30.120> bit<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.300> thin<00:02:30.600> leather

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
on the fake leather on the back now so

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.420

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
around with it look it does that with

around with it look it does that with
one<00:03:45.540> hand<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.440> easily<00:03:46.739> slides<00:03:47.220> off<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
one hand it is so easily slides off the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.520 
one hand it is so easily slides off the
fit<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.060> not<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.540> great<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.350> can

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
fit is not that great and you can

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.340 
fit is not that great and you can
actually<00:03:49.620> hear<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.010> i<00:03:50.160> hope<00:03:52.340> near<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:54.350> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
actually hear it i hope near that the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.229 
actually hear it i hope near that the
case<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.799> bends<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.280> on<00:03:56.430> both<00:03:56.640> sides<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.090> look

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
case it bends in on both sides and look

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.400 
case it bends in on both sides and look
even<00:03:57.540> here<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.070> see<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.400> side<00:03:59.700> is

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
even here you can see that this side is

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.140 
even here you can see that this side is
actually<00:04:01.410> popped<00:04:02.220> out<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.430> little<00:04:02.700> bit<00:04:02.910> and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
actually popped out a little bit and

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.509 
actually popped out a little bit and
when<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.200> wanted<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.709> try<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.040> keep<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.370> in

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
when I wanted you to try to keep it in

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.030 
when I wanted you to try to keep it in
there<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:06.180> always<00:04:06.570> tends<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.079> slide<00:04:07.410> off<00:04:07.440> just

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
there it always tends to slide off just

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.710 
there it always tends to slide off just
because<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.489> have<00:04:08.700> no<00:04:08.850> idea<00:04:09.180> why<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.329> made<00:04:09.600> the
