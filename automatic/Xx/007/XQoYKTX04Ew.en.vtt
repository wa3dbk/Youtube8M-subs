 BP CEO

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:04.750
 dancers yes 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.950
 and they then have certain items with each other 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.260
 and sometimes that is 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.290
 8 then it is really a bitterbal feeling something else as normal 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.240
 because they work more 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.640
 for those who are very good for the line 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.540
 This is good for the development of the speed 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.350

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.930
