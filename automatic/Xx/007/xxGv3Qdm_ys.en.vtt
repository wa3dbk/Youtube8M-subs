right word but um yeah and your dress I

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.760 
right word but um yeah and your dress I

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
thought this would look so cute with

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.000 
thought this would look so cute with
like<00:05:08.980> a<00:05:09.930> crop<00:05:10.930> top<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.500> high-waisted<00:05:11.650> shorts

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
like a crop top and high-waisted shorts

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.580 
like a crop top and high-waisted shorts
or<00:05:12.880> even<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.600> could<00:05:13.840> wear<00:05:13.990> this<00:05:14.140> to<00:05:14.200> school

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
or even I could wear this to school

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.950 
or even I could wear this to school
since<00:05:15.220> obviously<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.910> can't<00:05:16.120> wear<00:05:16.240> cropped<00:05:16.840> up

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
since obviously I can't wear cropped up
