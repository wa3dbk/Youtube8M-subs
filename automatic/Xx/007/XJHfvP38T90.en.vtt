00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.300
 We've been together for a year now, so I think ... 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.300
 ... that we should move our relationship to a higher level. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.300
 - Now ?! - We've been talking about this for months. 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100
 Deacone, what's the problem? 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.000
 Tomorrow I have a math exam. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 - Tomorrow's math test ?! - Can you shut your mouth shut? 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.700
 People always talk about how hard it is to be teen. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.100
 It's so hard ... 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.200
 I'll tell you what's really hard ... 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 ... to be a boy ... 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.200
 ..and think all day just for one ... 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 ... and have no chance of getting it. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.300
 That should be us. 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.100
 This will never be us ... 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.100
 ... this one, next year or any other year. 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.100
 Okay, so I can't find a baby on the normal way ... 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300
 ... but we have the talent and imagination to try something else ... 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.200
 - Let's do one ... - Do what? 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.300
 Film! 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.000
 This is a great idea, I have a perfect scifko! 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.500
 TENHLE TYPE OF FILM NO! 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.800
 Just a question, how do we force the baby to play with us? 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.300
 Boys, why are you dressed like Darren Hole? 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.100
 - This is our new style. - You look familiar, buddy. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.100
 - I'm Ashley. - And you have a job! 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 - What about the guy? - What do you think? 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.100
 Boys, you're going to be a school legend! 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 So you're doing a project here, okay? 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.300
 Yeah, we do, but we can't talk much about it. 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.100
 Now that we're doing this movie, it looks like it's going to be the best year ... 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.100
 Guys, my best friends are here! 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.200
 - Could I invite you to dance? - Nooo ... yeah! 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.100
 Well, depending on how it works in my diary. 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.000
 But when fantasy becomes reality ... 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.300
 Do we really do that? 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 - I'm going to direct. - Fine. 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 I want you to play it a little moderately ... 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.300
 ..free to make it a little too much. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.200
 - ... and making the movie ... - Let's go! 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.800
 These photos of young guys are so exciting ... 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.300
 I think I forgot to close the door ... 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.300
 ... becomes something they can barely handle ... 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.300
 - I can't help .. - Fine, cut! 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.100
 NATIONAL LAMPOON SHOWS: BEGINNING CARE 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.100
 Didn't I do it well? 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.300
 No, no, you were really great! 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 I need to go to the bathroom ... 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.200
 Isn't it in our cellar? ------------------------------ 7adb39f854e7--
