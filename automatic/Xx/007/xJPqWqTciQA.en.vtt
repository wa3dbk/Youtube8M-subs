small portions a day not just loading up
and<00:03:55.229> that's<00:03:55.769> why<00:03:55.919> we<00:03:56.489> have<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.939> weight<00:03:57.239> epidemic

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
and that's why we have a weight epidemic

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.559

in<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.379> United<00:03:58.680> States<00:03:59.030> because<00:04:00.030> people<00:04:00.449> have

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569

carbohydrate is yeah in the morning you

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.499 
carbohydrate is yeah in the morning you

paradox<00:04:14.250> or<00:04:14.400> what<00:04:14.519> people<00:04:14.729> believe<00:04:15.120> but<00:04:15.509> it's

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
paradox or what people believe but it's

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.170 
paradox or what people believe but it's
true<00:04:15.780> especially<00:04:16.320> as<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.919> get<00:04:17.070> older<00:04:17.549> kind<00:04:18.090> of

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
true especially as you get older kind of

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.610 
true especially as you get older kind of
stay<00:04:18.329> on<00:04:18.449> that<00:04:18.570> regiment<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.049> little<00:04:19.259> bit<00:04:19.380> more

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
stay on that regiment a little bit more

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.769 
stay on that regiment a little bit more
because<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.370> know<00:04:20.489> you're<00:04:20.669> naturally<00:04:21.329> your

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:21.779 
because you know you're naturally your

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.870 
because you know you're naturally your
metabolism<00:04:22.500> will<00:04:22.590> start<00:04:22.800> slowing<00:04:23.010> down<00:04:23.159> over

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
metabolism will start slowing down over

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.330 
metabolism will start slowing down over
so<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.810> kind<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.260> find<00:04:25.440> some<00:04:25.740> way<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.920> tweak<00:04:26.190> it

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
so you kind of find some way to tweak it

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.060 
so you kind of find some way to tweak it
or<00:04:26.490> get<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.060> back<00:04:27.570> start<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.110> up<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:28.500> know<00:04:28.620> so

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
or get it back start it up you know so

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.710 
or get it back start it up you know so
you<00:04:29.580> got<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.850> each<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.090> these<00:04:30.180> wait<00:04:30.390> that's<00:04:30.690> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
you got it each of these wait that's the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.910 
you got it each of these wait that's the
hardest<00:04:31.020> thing<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.170> drop<00:04:31.380> through<00:04:31.560> somebody

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
hardest thing to drop through somebody

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.710 
hardest thing to drop through somebody
said<00:04:32.040> because<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.030> know<00:04:33.120> they<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:33.570> you

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
said because you know they think so you

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.240 
said because you know they think so you
can<00:04:33.840> always<00:04:33.930> wait<00:04:34.200> don't<00:04:34.560> eat<00:04:34.650> but<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.010> think

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
can always wait don't eat but I think

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.700 
can always wait don't eat but I think
they're<00:04:35.370> thinking<00:04:35.400> about<00:04:35.700> McDonald's<00:04:36.660> or<00:04:37.050> you

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
they're thinking about McDonald's or you

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.200 
they're thinking about McDonald's or you
know<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:37.830> mean<00:04:38.070> some<00:04:38.370> Mexican<00:04:38.790> food<00:04:38.820> or
