were on three-point oh but smokin 1337
I've<00:00:17.670> decided<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:19.100> rebuild<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.279> ROM<00:00:20.460> it's

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
I've decided to rebuild the ROM it's

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.170 
I've decided to rebuild the ROM it's
built<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.240> hosses<00:00:21.900> rom<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.430> definitely

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
built on hosses rom and it's definitely

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.890 
built on hosses rom and it's definitely
got<00:00:24.449> some<00:00:24.630> great<00:00:24.869> improvements<00:00:26.689> it's<00:00:27.689> built

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
got some great improvements it's built

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
got some great improvements it's built
on<00:00:27.990> hostas<00:00:28.439> rum<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> brings<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.820> lot<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
on hostas rum but it brings in a lot of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.350 
on hostas rum but it brings in a lot of
the<00:00:30.330> advantages<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:32.489> lot<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.210> other

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the advantages of a lot of other

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.540 
the advantages of a lot of other
different<00:00:33.570> roms<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.260> I'll<00:00:34.980> cover<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
different roms and I'll cover that in a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.200 
different roms and I'll cover that in a
bit<00:00:35.809> but<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.050> right<00:00:37.170> off<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> bat<00:00:38.000> it<00:00:39.000> uses

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
bit but just right off the bat it uses

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.869 
bit but just right off the bat it uses
some<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> synergy<00:00:40.170> edits<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> if<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> use

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
some of synergy edits so if you use

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
some of synergy edits so if you use
synergies<00:00:42.420> ROM<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.890> it'll

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
synergies ROM and you like that it'll

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.760 
synergies ROM and you like that it'll
have<00:00:44.399> some<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> those<00:00:44.879> speed<00:00:45.239> tweaks<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
have some of those speed tweaks it is

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.360 
have some of those speed tweaks it is
undervolting<00:00:47.480> compatible<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> that's<00:00:50.160> good

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
undervolting compatible so that's good

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
undervolting compatible so that's good
to<00:00:50.670> squeeze<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.690> extra<00:00:51.899> battery

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
to squeeze out a little extra battery

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.150 
to squeeze out a little extra battery
life<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:54.660> has<00:00:54.809> native<00:00:55.079> screenshot<00:00:55.680> built<00:00:55.949> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
life it has native screenshot built in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.700 
life it has native screenshot built in
but<00:00:56.969> most<00:00:57.149> devs<00:00:57.449> are<00:00:57.600> including<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.410> now

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
but most devs are including that now

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.150 
but most devs are including that now
that<00:00:59.550> they<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.000> figured<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:01.440> for

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that they got that figured out as for

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.910 
that they got that figured out as for
the<00:01:02.190> apps<00:01:02.539> we<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> Sprint<00:01:04.589> bloat

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the apps we have all the Sprint bloat

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.090 
the apps we have all the Sprint bloat
ware<00:01:05.700> removed<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.650> ROM<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.830> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
ware removed from that the ROM so you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
ware removed from that the ROM so you
won't<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> worry<00:01:08.430> about<00:01:08.580> any<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> we

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

a<00:02:10.880> team<00:02:11.810> at<00:02:12.610> Colonel<00:02:13.610> built<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:14.450> can

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
a team at Colonel built in so we can

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.800 
a team at Colonel built in so we can
overclock<00:02:15.260> up<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.680> 1.8<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:17.360> can<00:02:17.510> control

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
overclock up to 1.8 and you can control

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
can do that all right in here so it does
