 Now what on the official site is that 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.770
 How to play If you look at pv 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.340
 Well this is the avatar's space-time difference pose, isn't it? 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.970
 But I think that can be seen 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.050
 Perhaps 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.949
 Kedomo it has decided to Tteyuu guy probably Une Doshuku Eemaa Goku 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:33.290
 Maybe the type is with a hero type 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:37.760
 That is to say part to Maa space-time transfer in the space-time transfer 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:42.570
 The campaign was already all supermarkets 3 or it was that neighborhood 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:49.360
 In Vegeta super size Saiyan 3 not devil Buu pure also 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.560
 Since I do not have space-time Days, it is only Goku that can definitely be in this well Clay is 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.810
 The first piece made is a country 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.130
 Yes cherry blossoms when moving a little with this 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.770
 What I this is Well obviously 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.510
 The journal 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.190
 It seems like a state-owned dragon has appeared for years 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.480
 It's 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.480
 I have an atmosphere 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.180
 Old summer 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.210
 Well then 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210
 The 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.799
 Oh dear 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.360
 Well maybe Neet 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.729
 Well, space-time transfer is 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:37.060
 Detailed low type after the holidays Rei 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:39.409
 Kana I think I Well Maware 4 hero first minute Kaifu City Wu of sound countries 4 in Shiro type 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.979
 even though it was gm 5 series 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.539
 Well I expected a little elite or Berserker, but somehow it is a hero type 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.539
 I did not think so 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.230
 a building 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.230
 8 hold 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.979
 I've been flying a little so let's see it this time 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 Hmm 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.540
 I think is space-time transfer 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.890
 I can not go here 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.340

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.340
 I have not do 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.860
 Ghost not a Goku layer 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.310
 Great 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.310
 Or presentation 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.829
 I tried this kind of expectation 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.829
 Splash one after Well 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.680
 I think this guy 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.920
 It is safe to know that one of the better ones is also understood 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.170
 Well Gokuwa 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.170
 I'm sure you're in the merge sky 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.160
 Moreover Nde Deshikure of the character Miyaten likely of Shukurei 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.710
 You say you I guess down round 4 as well so easily not Oite 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.710
 Cormorant I think I Shikure is like a god but the neighborhood 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.870
 Effect but no matter how is he might Mou 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.210
 I do not expect anything so well This time it is a really regrettable group gm 3 bullets is James 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.450
 I was a 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.240
 Yes 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.630
 Oh dear 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.470
 I can only hope for a single piece of clay 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.220
 Maybe even in area battles you will rarely use the j 6 Thunder card 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.220
 May not 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.200
 Yes Well, at least this time such Tokosune the tried and expectations of Shikure 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.200
