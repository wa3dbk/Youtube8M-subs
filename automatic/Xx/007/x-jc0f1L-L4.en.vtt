00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
here to play dr. Neffs today is an aim

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.970 
here to play dr. Neffs today is an aim
they<00:00:19.100> inspired<00:00:19.640> look<00:00:19.970> which<00:00:20.240> is<00:00:20.830> similar<00:00:21.830> to

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
they inspired look which is similar to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.380 
they inspired look which is similar to
George<00:00:22.250> Lynch<00:00:22.490> I<00:00:22.610> mean<00:00:22.730> it's<00:00:22.850> a<00:00:22.910> diminished

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
George Lynch I mean it's a diminished

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.570 
George Lynch I mean it's a diminished
scale<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.170> he<00:00:24.770> does<00:00:24.920> a<00:00:24.950> lot<00:00:25.130> of<00:00:25.220> that<00:00:25.310> stuff<00:00:25.460> at

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
scale so he does a lot of that stuff at

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.400 
scale so he does a lot of that stuff at
his<00:00:25.730> playing<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:26.240> guess<00:00:26.420> they're<00:00:26.660> slightly

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
his playing so I guess they're slightly

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.710 
his playing so I guess they're slightly
relevant<00:00:27.590> I<00:00:28.130> don't<00:00:28.760> care<00:00:28.910> he<00:00:29.300> doesn't<00:00:29.630> have

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
relevant I don't care he doesn't have

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.270 
relevant I don't care he doesn't have
the<00:00:29.810> same<00:00:29.990> style<00:00:30.170> but<00:00:30.380> now<00:00:30.770> I'm<00:00:30.890> just<00:00:31.039> blabbing
