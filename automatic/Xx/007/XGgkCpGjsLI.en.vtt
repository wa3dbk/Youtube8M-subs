00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
three separate sections I'm going to

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.469 
three separate sections I'm going to
start<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.790> and<00:01:07.939> if<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.149> helps<00:01:09.390> you

start with this one and if it helps you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480 
start with this one and if it helps you
can<00:01:09.600> split<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> section<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> middle

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
can split the section down the middle

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.390 
can split the section down the middle
and<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.130> start<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and I'm just going to start with the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.170 
and I'm just going to start with the
middle<00:01:14.990> cross<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.170> over<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.500> another<00:01:16.740> piece

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
middle cross it over with another piece

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.930 
middle cross it over with another piece
this<00:01:18.180> piece<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:18.690> pull<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:19.940> and

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
this piece right here pull that over and

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.070 
this piece right here pull that over and
just<00:01:21.000> continue<00:01:21.690> down<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.049> line<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.750> same

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
just continue down the line the same

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.230 
just continue down the line the same
exact<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.860> super<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.729> pretty<00:01:26.940> easy<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:32.240> ok

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
exact thing super so pretty easy and ok

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.350 
exact thing super so pretty easy and ok
and<00:01:33.840> once<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.740> where<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> wanted<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.520> I'm

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and once I get where I wanted to be I'm

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.250 
and once I get where I wanted to be I'm
going<00:01:36.690> to<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.290> pin<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.970> secure<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
going to use a pin and secure it in

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.280 
going to use a pin and secure it in
place

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.870 

all<00:01:48.290> right<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.710> moving<00:01:49.190> on<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.460> second

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
all right and moving on to the second

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.080 
all right and moving on to the second
one<00:01:50.620> this<00:01:51.640> will<00:01:52.640> be<00:01:53.560> my<00:01:54.560> second<00:01:55.130> section<00:01:55.520> here

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.550 

again<00:01:59.090> if<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.330> want<00:01:59.510> you<00:01:59.660> can<00:01:59.780> separate<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
again if you want you can separate the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.440 
again if you want you can separate the
section<00:02:00.980> in<00:02:01.190> half<00:02:03.820> it's<00:02:04.820> not<00:02:05.000> necessary

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
section in half it's not necessary

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.910 
section in half it's not necessary
though<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:05.810> I<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.050> wanted<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.380> show<00:02:06.620> you<00:02:06.680> all

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
though so I just wanted to show you all

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.660 
though so I just wanted to show you all
this<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:09.320> show<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.530> how<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:09.710> you<00:02:10.040> can<00:02:10.310> use

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
this to show you how that you can use

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.060 
this to show you how that you can use
that<00:02:10.970> technique<00:02:11.540> not<00:02:11.870> only<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.470> such<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.770> large

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
that technique not only on such a large

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.850 
that technique not only on such a large
scale<00:02:13.220> but<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.790> smaller<00:02:14.150> scale<00:02:14.420> too<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.380> it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
scale but on a smaller scale too and it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.320 
scale but on a smaller scale too and it
just<00:02:16.040> gives<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.580> variation<00:02:17.180> on<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:20.120> know<00:02:20.300> a

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
just gives a variation on you know a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.970 
just gives a variation on you know a
simple<00:02:20.720> style<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.440> know<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.680> course<00:02:21.890> I

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
simple style you know of course I

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.430 
simple style you know of course I
couldn't<00:02:22.220> use<00:02:22.520> flat<00:02:22.850> Swift's<00:02:23.390> or<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:24.320> know

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
couldn't use flat Swift's or you know

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.080 
couldn't use flat Swift's or you know
you<00:02:24.500> could<00:02:24.770> have<00:02:24.860> braided<00:02:25.160> but<00:02:27.100> because<00:02:28.100> the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
you could have braided but because the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.040 
you could have braided but because the
look<00:02:29.330> at<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.600> cream<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.470> gives<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.920> hair<00:02:32.050> it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
look at this cream it gives the hair it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.250 
look at this cream it gives the hair it

and this is the Finnish style I'm not a
bad<00:03:47.900> look<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.530> hopefully<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.640> looks<00:03:49.849> nice<00:03:54.280> okay

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
and this is pretty much like my second

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.470 
and this is pretty much like my second
third<00:03:57.440> day<00:03:57.680> here<00:03:58.010> or<00:03:58.040> whatever<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.909> I<00:03:59.209> still

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
third day here or whatever and I still

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.030 
third day here or whatever and I still
haven't<00:03:59.629> had<00:03:59.840> some<00:03:59.989> moisturizer<00:04:00.470> after<00:04:00.829> using

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
haven't had some moisturizer after using

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.819 
haven't had some moisturizer after using
the<00:04:01.250> curly<00:04:01.970> curl<00:04:02.209> cream<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:02.780> my<00:04:03.440> hair<00:04:03.620> still

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
the curly curl cream so my hair still

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.220 
the curly curl cream so my hair still
feels<00:04:03.860> nice<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.519> soft<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.840> reason<00:04:06.140> why

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
feels nice and soft and the reason why

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.589 
feels nice and soft and the reason why
this<00:04:06.290> hairstyle<00:04:06.739> is<00:04:07.370> more<00:04:08.090> business

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
this hairstyle is more business

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.300 
this hairstyle is more business
appropriate<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:09.319> because<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:10.069> hair<00:04:10.190> is

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
appropriate is because the hair is

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.850 
appropriate is because the hair is
pulled<00:04:10.549> back<00:04:10.670> out<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.090> my<00:04:11.180> face<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.560> twists
