 it was he who came to get me to bring me the hÃ©rault 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.389
 508 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.539
 two movies 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.539
 it is done 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.869
 do this his survival 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.369
 you are better to have sealed 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.269
 she is formal 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.999
 show up recently I went upstairs like that it's more chic 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.409
 from tel-aviv friday april 8th to august 15th 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:31.569
 really do 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.590
 it's what we call everyone we French felt at the wheel 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.670
 the front 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.190
 the car reacted within this road behavior of pleasure too 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.180
 because of a thing really above censorship measures 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.880
 but I always felt great when he gets to score 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.780
 but which sometimes can also become a real ride comfort 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.220
 the site of your bank of Vizille locks up 2010 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.519
 I close the parenthesis which is a real comfort of rolling belkacem 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.700
 vancouver 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.020
 but at the same time he admired his site 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.630
 do not hesitate any more indeed on a music and a station located at the wheel 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.240
 this is how one can show the very good road holding very 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 pleasant to drive at the telethon comfort level 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.530
 the firmness of the seats 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.880
 but that's really someone who is in the limelight right from the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.900
 departure after escaping will not go into the rank 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.600
 the trend was at the level of interior ergonomics every 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.550
 turtledoves 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.090
 the detail in germany some waited for a long time a 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.110
 good driving position yesterday with a setting in every way the flights have 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.010
 been suspended without going through it 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.960
 this is the bet is successful 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.560
 the back of the retreats console was approaching selection that's all that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.590
 actually relates to taking short-term also - July 6 if 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.390
 I had known 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.370
 the decision of the eu 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.110
 this walkout of pubic stress to implant priest for the moment it 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.250
 does not exist yet 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.280
 at the level of difficulty claridge - pas-de-Calais very quickly on and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.390
 endorsed the very effective that voice spoken in my life she is in 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 the focused and tries to film in a few days 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.870
 there we went to something special at the base 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.759
 veronique courjault is still here it's really a video 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.749
 potential buyers at the motor level having trade 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.379
 Asians I think it's necessary south of the big cycle 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.729
 travel agents 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.639
 miyagi at 110 yen against 140 what you think is enough or those who 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.129
 think this version 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.639
 the room to receive more than ten years 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.839
 but for the rest of the year 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.869
 very very well said gamar delman of 170 at end is perfect to stop 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:39.709
 the country can not exist but especially with the automatic transmission it is a 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.559
 rolling comfort does not mean that we do not go very fast these dams 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.390
 I do not know what we are looking for, but only one of them participates in the most 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.029
 Reliable and comfort of this measurement 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.029
 the Swiss girl was very very interesting in many 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.370
 the level is a first he pointed out on cnn he feared that his 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.429
 bedroom 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.959
 visibly more popular advertised in English yes but I did 90% 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.180
 the 5 year warranty saying worried sometimes where om 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.860
 of form 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.759
 the evening 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.169
 I know that it peter ali conclusions% and if you had to give a note to this 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.719
 car on 20 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.049
 so I give these on a ferry that's just one thing is sure this 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.549
 social goods merchant and on the list of more statutory cars 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.679
 really really good the future of this machine 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.179
 compared to a more OEM edition the hall for the sail 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.249
 that militant movements of far left and it's very nice and quite 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:38.169
 calm apart from a war-worthy status why I find that 37 miles to 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.539
 less than 200 people 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.539
 I find this results from the the new Peugeot 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.650
 this console the movie takes 2000 people buried 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.040
 there we have a naval ceiling lamp of the piano lacquer him the lights a 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.939
 little crystal again 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.559
 placed under treatment 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:56.729
 so that's one in 20 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.529
 or rather rather convinced is its structure css part of an actor rather 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.909
 convinced yesterday that only one thing that I regret while still what it takes 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.199
 it is that the design department 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.289
 so it's true it's discreet and it's true that rockets 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:14.499
 the cfdt she has not touched yet is really because also since the last 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.729
 from the dalongeville era locked 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.930
 e I find it a little fadasse 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.930
 it was in the air of time to achieve once again 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.990
 when you push the cap a bit far 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.719
 I would have liked 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:32.309
 waiting to hear again in some of the talks calls 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.969
 to audi 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.809
 something more marked still want to come back in 50 countries 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:37.259
 here
