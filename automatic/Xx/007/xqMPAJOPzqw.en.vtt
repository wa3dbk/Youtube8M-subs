00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900

Wars 2 stress test so this is currently
the<00:00:24.080> best<00:00:24.200> graphics<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.860> game<00:00:25.010> has<00:00:25.250> up<00:00:25.490> until

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
the best graphics the game has up until

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.600 
the best graphics the game has up until
now<00:00:26.410> it<00:00:27.410> hasn't<00:00:27.590> been<00:00:27.770> completely<00:00:28.190> optimized

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
now it hasn't been completely optimized

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.740 
now it hasn't been completely optimized
yet<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:28.940> it's<00:00:29.060> still<00:00:29.210> pretty<00:00:29.330> much<00:00:29.420> running

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
yet so it's still pretty much running

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.950 
yet so it's still pretty much running
off<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:29.990> CPU<00:00:30.530> rather<00:00:30.860> than<00:00:31.039> GPU<00:00:31.750> it's<00:00:32.750> most

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
off the CPU rather than GPU it's most

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.780 
off the CPU rather than GPU it's most
likely<00:00:33.050> there<00:00:33.530> busy<00:00:34.070> updating<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:34.670> they're

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
likely there busy updating it so they're

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.640 
likely there busy updating it so they're
probably<00:00:34.879> optimize<00:00:35.449> it<00:00:35.629> at<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.809> end<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.379> we'll

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
probably optimize it at the end so we'll

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.700 
probably optimize it at the end so we'll
probably<00:00:36.830> only<00:00:37.010> see<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:38.090> finish<00:00:38.480> quality<00:00:39.140> and

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
probably only see the finish quality and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.490 
probably only see the finish quality and
release<00:00:40.390> it<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.600> stress<00:00:41.900> test<00:00:42.080> it<00:00:42.230> might<00:00:42.379> be

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
release it is a stress test it might be

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.900 
release it is a stress test it might be
a<00:00:42.530> bit<00:00:42.680> laggy<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.129> this<00:00:43.280> video<00:00:43.550> although<00:00:43.820> it

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
a bit laggy in this video although it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.729

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
skills when I joined the stress test

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.380 
skills when I joined the stress test
throughout<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.680> starts<00:01:31.070> today<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:32.030> was

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
throughout the starts today I was

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.550 
throughout the starts today I was
picking<00:01:32.600> up<00:01:32.750> between<00:01:33.460> 70<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.720> 120<00:01:35.720> frames<00:01:36.200> per

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
picking up between 70 to 120 frames per

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.940 
picking up between 70 to 120 frames per
second<00:01:37.630> which<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.750> pretty<00:01:38.930> impressive

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
second which is pretty impressive

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.800 
second which is pretty impressive
obviously<00:01:40.790> while<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:40.939> record<00:01:41.330> now<00:01:41.570> I'm<00:01:41.689> only

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
obviously while I record now I'm only

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.440 
obviously while I record now I'm only
picking<00:01:42.020> up<00:01:42.229> about<00:01:42.500> 20<00:01:42.950> or<00:01:43.040> 30<00:01:43.240> but<00:01:44.240> not

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
picking up about 20 or 30 but not

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.010 
picking up about 20 or 30 but not
recording<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.380> lot<00:01:45.710> more<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.390> big<00:01:47.689> step

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
recording a lot more so it's a big step

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.200 
recording a lot more so it's a big step
up<00:01:48.049> from<00:01:48.350> where<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.740> last<00:01:48.950> stress<00:01:49.759> test<00:01:50.030> was

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
up from where the last stress test was

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.630 
up from where the last stress test was
where<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:51.020> was<00:01:51.439> only<00:01:51.619> getting<00:01:51.770> about<00:01:52.070> 30<00:01:52.340> frames

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
where I was only getting about 30 frames

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.370 
where I was only getting about 30 frames
per<00:01:52.850> second<00:01:53.330> anyway<00:01:55.600> regardless<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:57.170> whether

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
per second anyway regardless of whether

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.310 
per second anyway regardless of whether
I<00:01:57.439> was<00:01:57.619> recording<00:01:57.890> or<00:01:58.130> not<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:59.360> they<00:01:59.930> are<00:02:00.049> doing

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
I was recording or not so they are doing

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.030 
I was recording or not so they are doing
their<00:02:00.439> jobs<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.770> looks<00:02:00.920> like<00:02:01.100> pretty<00:02:01.490> well<00:02:03.040> the
