00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone I test game to 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 manpower rocket 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.790
 china came and play scotch very much yes yes me 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.099
 want the name 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.230
 yeah i finally got this one from 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.130
 obtain below 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.560
 shell what selden had i would buy 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 fully had that is fully automatic 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.449
 I have done my hands 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.099
 have been 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.520
 yes small piece just after just the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.370
 really need to move is moss 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 the orth which I already at an 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.930
 move their dress all done yourself 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 but that is also possible automatically 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.680
 you're also working hard couple 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.610
 we want to be in terms of coupling teeth 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.590
 normal shedding some goodies to make 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 the other than says 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.980
 put down t-shirts hung 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.980
 exist so you see after 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 normal stone suddenly hair was quiet 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.780
 own 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.129
 but I suspect that may come what wait 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.270
 sit behind this 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.810
 a little couple becomes a chair there 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.280
 made there is energy is over 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.270
 solar panels 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 And yes, the long ones are just heavy 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.140
 the piece of factory need it 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.140
 and here is sara 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.330
 holly berry mindset and only this one 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:34.850
 behind and all almost exhausted them 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.850
 decentralized here they are almost ready 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.080
 it just works very easily how it 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.640
 often does not explain that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.210
 both of the gave a closure of her 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.310
 read along all the blocks so that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.310
 disappears and the block comes 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690
 at the top 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.340
 this is where the pumps come and goes 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.240
 moved with it 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.690
 so we would then just mess with what 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.920
 golden thing in his speed it up 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.160
 spoony may speed 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.200
 and then yes that 1000 goes with that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.930
 diamond things are one 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.570
 they kind of look like I have 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.120
 set to hall where you green and mine 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.500
 yellow is still green in April 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.360
 that's why I turn right and torture 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.730
 they can almost be a block in that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.850
 comes flying anyway 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.890
 that way oh well i am my i am one 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.690
 colorblock you can learn by because there 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.910
 his brain is dying 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.790
 could come from behind so I go 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.720
 my left click that you diet with 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.950
 is after the web that same 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.070
 every time around of those blocks 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.359
 in the other direction quickly cubes 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.030
 all these things have been done and 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:57.060
 only been busy today and the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:00.750
 day that quite combines large trees 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.359
 kind of a machine against that one 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.030
 the other connecting rod to 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.100
 colin like gravel that meshes diamond 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:14.490
 What about is that there are usually 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:17.400
 special blocks what goes here in this 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.700
 test the down that this is all special 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.890
 s but it is that which remains and this 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.450
 spa am not a cashier yet 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.760
 well what am I doing with those firs 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.630
 is energy roof really with trade 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.640
 I grab then visaed I want him to stop 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 necklace this thing that can be all with the 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.470
 hand I know but no time 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.470
 had 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.880
 how does this then continue 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.730
 your machine in two years small 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.950
 than fabrics made to tests that will be 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.990
 two really made of it through 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.540
 from a little power 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.520
 plus a mattress where a double a huge 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.230
 makes the fabric twice from the second 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.960
 physically those two are you 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.360
 rods do not cook the case and hereby 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.410
 she comes to some sort of machines 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.410
 everything in every desired place 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.100
 how is it then with a connecting rod that 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.780
 the door paper just lay it just one 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.790
 gravel and a cold I didn't bring much 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.000
 but 12 that man to the whole piece too 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.340
 I think it's pretty leaders it 's minus 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.740
 what happens then the yes couples and you 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.020
 can all be constant within they here such 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.270
 all over the coast every December 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.550
 this one is almost full and I am very sorry 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.510
 continuously felt to life 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.830
 to become 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.830
 well then comes to even more such a box 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.710
 key back to these bins 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.560
 it also nice to have a task to get on support 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:52.070
 okay this what each evacuated but 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:54.260
 these places also play a role on a case-by-case basis 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.310
 well that's all in this chest 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.490
 ends up 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.570
 she has to go to this one through a little pump 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.510
 chest stopped 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.920
 when years later look language i can now 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.920
 for example, turn it on 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.780
 there comes a couple and then 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.710
 is that via here already via automatic 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.810
 over tjes 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.180
 so back to that bit that thought 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.490
 winning players 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.750
 yes I will show it there because 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.330
 I've made a real to them 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.010
 but then with 6 cars and 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.400
 from this with 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.010
 snow white well how is that again 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.990
 in between with a pump with over 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.430
 command boarding two but you come 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.730
 so we don't have a point of it 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.730
 nature 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.600
 that goes after here 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:48.260
 that you wear my firm so well 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.060
 with the kolere sets on the bottom 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.650
 I only got him cobblestone 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.290
 so it can only happen 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.480
 down and couple stand and the top one 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.520
 the only people can share in the 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.830
 grindstones national couple stone s &amp; g 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.290
 it goes down via the black button 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.840
 the case that what goes wrong she doesn't know 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.090
 but remember what happen 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.850
 comes the headline stone Halsstraat mine 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.970
 work exactly the same block is come again 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:19.220
 here going Willett after his 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:22.270
 yes thing well then it becomes 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.270
 next to one made of 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.280
 c is immediately pumped before how see 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:36.890
 all that you see we finish with it 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:44.630
 rather than otherwise drag 4 8 black 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:47.530
 boxes mine but the yellow try 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.530
 couples come down 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.250
 well that's how it works with six of these things 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.250
 to sit 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.250
 positive 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:02.240
 if you don't play upper rows here 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.240
 again with all immediate IT things 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.330
 it is thus brought to that guidance 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.450
 through that guidance 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:12.600
 no he brought that box then it comes 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:18.710
 here and a yes like this other i 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.710
 such a first busy kids 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.610
 but this was about I think I kinda 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.380
 what more will do with it but I see that 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.240
 well 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.160
 I went after what by the way did say 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.720
 nice and busy am cindy very fast 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.580
 instance 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.770
 meant that comes not so crazy anymore 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.360
 goal is just to have a girlfriend 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:40.380
 saying what she is passing by is another one 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.110
 living quacks but none of the day one 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.870
 or four and five at a time and 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.730
 then really it was all started here 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.680
 cubes 

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:54.870
 but it might quickly studies came 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:57.320
 more online tomorrow I might look at that 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.320
 lonneker
