00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.969
 and all these two nights so we get 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.940
 found today for a new 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.470
 zombie video on buried will surely 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.300
 the cause of them so it was a little 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.610
 long time so the players in ten years in 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.970
 then counting for the occasion of this 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.890
 video 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.589
 finally the gameplay is not me it's 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.910
 sir flavie 57 who discovered his 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.189
 head or permanent so besides a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.290
 big gg to him and to thank him for 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.820
 have kindly given me his 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.350
 gameplay and well just I'm going 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.310
 put his black bag description 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.370
 frankly it's the minimum 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.559
 and so that's all it was 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 now I'll see you by the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.270
 after which it will serve me right there 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.579
 subsequently attacked how to unlock it so 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.070
 for this so devote himself should be 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.199
 minimum two players 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.809
 you will first have the player he wants 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.519
 to have permanent cough will have to return 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.800
 in the mansion get killed by a 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.359
 witch and the other player will not have to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.340
 resuscitate him so let him die 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.080
 and during that time he will have to go to 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.390
 the outside of the mansion in this little 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.160
 yard just before the labyrinth of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.680
 so that the other player will miss 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.360
 miss him then at that moment down there 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.030
 if you have done well at the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.640
 maneuver you will have to appear a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.860
 glow verne which means 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 obtaining a permanent asset will have to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.480
 appear and at that moment so you 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.840
 you will be sure that you lawrence were 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.580
 all these heads or permanent and so to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.120
 what is it used so there are two cases of 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.100
 figure in which these tattoos serves so 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.420
 if you are alone in the mansion 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.310
 which the other player was 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.950
 outside the witches will not arise 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 not so that's so I know everything 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.980
 just enough huge pears 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.570
 bananas and in the in the mansion without 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.270
 no witch comes to us 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.400
 shit and in the other case so if 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.960
 the other player in the mansion what 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.120
 should happen quite frequently as 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.650
 the witches at that moment appears 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.630
 too much but they will not be attracted 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.490
 by you so a little in the way of a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.400
 barrier of confusion except that there no 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.039
 it's not a glitch it's all there 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.690
 special permanent for that among the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.760
 arrivals as an example in a short time where 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.050
 so you see there the witch goes on 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.819
 she is not attracted to him 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.349
 it's frankly a little being 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.120
 permanent which will be very useful 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.290
 I understood that we had 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.910
 need I believe for the stage of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.600
 other lanterns like that 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.950
 for the secret maxis by you will avoid 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.070
 to get attacked by witches 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.900
 also so you will lose you are 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.920
 sure you are obliged to put your 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.780
 money in the bank 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.370
 every time you go into the mansion 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.560
 to make sure you do not get stung 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.120
 all our money just so 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.550
 So here it is a diversion that there 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.470
 will I think very useful and so I 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.210
 thanks again mister plate x from me 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.270

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.490
 that my when she will have pleased you and that 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.600
