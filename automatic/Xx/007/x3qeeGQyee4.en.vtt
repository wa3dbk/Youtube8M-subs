 come off at the most inopportune moment 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 Prefer models with durable 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.760
 frame and mesh windows when u 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.910

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.930
 Carrying for cats is needed first 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.680
 in order for the cat to go somewhere 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.829
 transport to the country on vacation 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 veterinary clinic because every 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.989
 transportation of a cat is colossal 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.780
 stressful for the animal and carrying bag 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.530

 comfortable when the pet needs to be translated 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 for short distances if you 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.049
 have to go a long way or you 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.030
 use the car 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.729
 choose plastic 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.950
 Carrying there can and bowl for food 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.090
 put and take care of her on the road 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.579
 much easier 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 examine the side mount and the door 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.650
 lattice they should be securely fixed 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.479
 and fit tightly each other and of course 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.159
 do not forget to put on one soft 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.170
 cushion to cats 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 she is comfortable being inside very 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.460
 Well if the carrier appears in your 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.289
 home immediately with the animal in such 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.719
 case, the cat will be perceived as 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.759
 security island and hide inside 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.579
 which means it's easier to carry any 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.280

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.810
 carry cats in plastic bags 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.969
 packages or about troops 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.560

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.119
 discomfort and maybe even there 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.970
