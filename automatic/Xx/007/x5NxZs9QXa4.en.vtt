see<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.990> small<00:02:01.229> put<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> knot<00:02:02.040> on

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
see that it's very small put a knot on

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.520 
see that it's very small put a knot on
the<00:02:02.340> end<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.880> doesn't<00:02:02.939> pull<00:02:03.479> through<00:02:03.530> but

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the end so it doesn't pull through but

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.240 
the end so it doesn't pull through but
on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> far<00:02:04.979> end<00:02:05.250> also<00:02:05.909> put<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.659> knot<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.409> leave

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
on the far end also put a knot and leave

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
on the far end also put a knot and leave
a<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.429> loop<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.259> don't<00:02:10.500> think

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
a little loop like that I don't think

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.130 
a little loop like that I don't think
you'll<00:02:10.740> see<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.009> little<00:02:11.220> loop<00:02:11.459> there<00:02:12.140> I'm

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you'll see that little loop there I'm

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.230 
you'll see that little loop there I'm
going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.590> fold<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.700> get

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
going to fold it in to get

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.390 
going to fold it in to get
two<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.660> matching<00:02:16.080> ends<00:02:16.320> together<00:02:16.680> nice<00:02:17.370> and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
two of matching ends together nice and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.730 
two of matching ends together nice and
flush<00:02:17.880> there<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.450> we're<00:02:18.660> going<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.930> go<00:02:19.140> be

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
flush there and we're going to go be

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.080 
flush there and we're going to go be
careful<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.160> don't<00:02:20.220> stick<00:02:20.550> your<00:02:20.700> finger

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
careful you don't stick your finger

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.030 
careful you don't stick your finger
you'll<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.960> take<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.230> back<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> little<00:02:22.800> bit

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
you'll have to take it back a little bit

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800 
you'll have to take it back a little bit
because<00:02:23.370> otherwise<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:24.090> will<00:02:24.270> rip<00:02:24.540> through

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
because otherwise it will rip through

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.710 
because otherwise it will rip through
the<00:02:25.050> foam<00:02:25.430> bring<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.640> thread<00:02:27.270> all<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.540> way

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the foam bring the thread all the way

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.830 
the foam bring the thread all the way
through<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.180> then<00:02:30.360> when<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.600> get<00:02:30.780> to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
through like so and then when you get to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.020 
through like so and then when you get to
this<00:02:31.200> you've<00:02:31.560> got<00:02:31.710> your<00:02:31.860> loop<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.790> then

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
this you've got your loop you can then

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.540 
this you've got your loop you can then
put<00:02:33.450> your<00:02:33.570> needle<00:02:33.750> through<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.980> that

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
put your needle through that and that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.670 
put your needle through that and that
actually<00:02:35.730> will<00:02:36.330> tie<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.810> end<00:02:36.870> off<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:39.120> so

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
actually will tie that end off like so

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.380 
actually will tie that end off like so
make<00:02:40.680> sure<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:41.130> pull<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.460> tight<00:02:41.730> each<00:02:42.000> time

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
make sure you pull it tight each time

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.870 
make sure you pull it tight each time
okay<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.800> all<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.130> down<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.460> side<00:02:44.700> and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
okay so we do all that down the side and

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.160 
okay so we do all that down the side and
on<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.050> end<00:02:46.200> as<00:02:47.040> well<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.840> there<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.990> go

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
on the end as well and there you go

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.280 
on the end as well and there you go
that's<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.710> finished<00:02:50.190> project<00:02:51.140> we've<00:02:52.140> got

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
that's the finished project we've got

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.750 
that's the finished project we've got
the<00:02:52.470> big<00:02:52.650> one<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.100> put<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.400> little<00:02:53.520> one<00:02:53.730> on

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
the big one and I put the little one on

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.610 
the big one and I put the little one on
the<00:02:53.880> inside<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.690> I'm<00:02:55.050> going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.200> insert<00:02:55.350> my

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the inside and I'm going to insert my

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.940 
the inside and I'm going to insert my
original<00:02:56.400> wind<00:02:57.060> sock<00:02:57.360> inside<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
original wind sock inside that the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.190 
original wind sock inside that the
reason<00:02:59.310> for<00:02:59.490> having<00:02:59.640> several<00:03:00.240> layers<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.780> it's

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
reason for having several layers is it's

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.160 
reason for having several layers is it's
like<00:03:01.410> trapping<00:03:02.220> heat<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.120> more<00:03:03.270> layers<00:03:04.050> you

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
like trapping heat the more layers you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.860 
like trapping heat the more layers you
have<00:03:04.290> clothing<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.190> better<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.610> can<00:03:05.790> be<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
have clothing the better it can be to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.510 
have clothing the better it can be to
keep<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.140> warm<00:03:07.380> it's<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.010> same<00:03:08.190> with<00:03:08.370> this

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
keep you warm it's the same with this

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.970 
keep you warm it's the same with this
this<00:03:09.000> acts<00:03:09.210> as<00:03:09.390> baffles<00:03:09.900> multi<00:03:10.350> baffles<00:03:10.800> for

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
this acts as baffles multi baffles for

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.740 
this acts as baffles multi baffles for
the<00:03:11.040> wind<00:03:11.250> it'll<00:03:12.000> stop<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.270> wind<00:03:12.510> getting

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the wind it'll stop the wind getting

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.870 
the wind it'll stop the wind getting
through<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.590> cheap<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.190> doesn't<00:03:14.520> look<00:03:14.700> great

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
through it's cheap it doesn't look great

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.610 
through it's cheap it doesn't look great
but<00:03:16.040> as<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.160> said<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.490> tonight's<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.120> cheap

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
but as I said it tonight's just cheap

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.170 
but as I said it tonight's just cheap
make<00:03:19.620> sure<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.250> can't<00:03:20.520> see<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.970> through

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
make sure that you can't see it through

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.270 
make sure that you can't see it through
the<00:03:21.330> lens<00:03:21.360> that's<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.020> other<00:03:22.080> thing<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:23.130> there

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
the lens that's the other thing so there

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.750 
the lens that's the other thing so there
you<00:03:23.370> go

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
you go

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.980 
you go
one<00:03:23.970> cheaper<00:03:24.480> nasty<00:03:24.930> but<00:03:25.110> very<00:03:25.350> effective
