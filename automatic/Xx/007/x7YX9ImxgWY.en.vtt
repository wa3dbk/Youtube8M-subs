00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.420
 Missing you good if you are watching 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.469
 this video because the title tite called the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.429
 attention 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.190
 Ah yes I'm a teenager and I live with 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.020
 Good name, she, I'm 15 years old. 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.640
 I decided it's a channel and a blog for 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 share my story and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.080
 to help people who are going through 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.680
 this and also be helped for 13 years I 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.019
 I was diagnosed with alopecia and when 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 was in January 2014 I had to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.370
 cut the hair because it was very ugly 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.850
 and I would not be able to continue with 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.950
 that hair then from that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.760
 I wear handkerchiefs and apart from that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.620
 day I learned to live with alopecia 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.160
 ball piece is not a very positive thing 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.550
 to get along but you always take 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.430
 positive things, the image of the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.060
 sunset orange but you always take 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.770
 positive things and it 's because of 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.210
 That's what I'm here for today. 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.330
 If you had a play 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.090
 watching I can tell you that it is not the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.220
 End of the world, you'll get used to it. 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.619
 You'll learn how to live with it, and you. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 will always take advantage of this as per 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 example you do not need to wake up so 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.159
 early to be a cause of hair and a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.770
 thing I learned in the meantime is that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.729
 hair is not everything in our life 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.460
 the hair did not lack in that time years 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.520
 I feel like some people who have this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.079
 problem of feeling depressed did not want to 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.079
 leaving home did not want to be seen with 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.470
 People I did not start had it but 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:50.310
 today I spent a euro not so much 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.149
 That's a problem, and you learn to live together. 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.240
 with this, people will usually 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.340
 Look, you learn to live with it. 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.420
 usually as if it were something you know 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.500
 It always happened and I started this 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.580
 blog because I watched xique ba karina 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.489
 the karina 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.530
 only she ended up dying and she did 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.920
 videos 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.610
 for people with cancer is 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.900
 feel beautiful because she feels 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.280
 beautiful she wanted to show the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.069
 people that we could feel 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.790
 beautiful feels good and she inspired me a lot 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.220
 make this blog and a channel and so 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.840
 here but also because I always wanted to 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.840
 have a blog and a channel and now the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.250
 opportunity and now is doing and 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.440
 blog I'm also counting a little 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.790
 about my life taking a little 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.530
 about things in my everyday life and I'm 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.350
 doing it as if it were a daily 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.769
 a life because I want to show it to the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.280
 people that is not so hard baby 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.830
 with this and I also want to show that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.970
 Can you pass it by in a way? 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.019
 positive 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.870
 good for example I never wanted 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.239
 try a wig because I do not 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.730
 I think I would feel good about a 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.440
 wig for example and that's it's a thing 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.140
 that several people in various opinions 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.060
 for example if someone loses their hair with 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.200
 sure will opt for a wig 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.019
 first thing she'll want 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.890
 wig but I do not and I 'm super happy 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.709
 like this 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.630
 but it's normal so it's obvious that I'm not 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:34.220
 Happy with what I'm going through 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:37.269
 very happy because it's a new chance to 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.920
 start like this 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.739
 so I'm here to talk too 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.930
 about this and this I know it's going to 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.329
 passing through this can count down 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.420
 this story because I'm going to love ale and 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.220
 if you want to follow the journey as 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.079
 It's going to be from now on, it's just 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.380
 You will follow in my blog that I go 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.989
 let down here link and one thing 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.299
 I did not want to talk and if nobody knows 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.220
 that I have I have something for 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.070
 example a rare disease and no one knows 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.079
 which is because nobody knows why either 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.060
 and what happens to me has appeared 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.750
 So, out of nowhere, nobody knows why. 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.970
 No one can deal because of this. 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.350
 so if you want to read like mine 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.120
 story like this 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.880
 I also think that I very much hope that 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.620
 You accompany me that you like and 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.330

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.420

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.820
 lost but I know I'll be able to 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.140
