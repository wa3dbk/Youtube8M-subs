 In other words, normal recovery is horny. 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:36.070
 The average number of people who drink polluted air is constantly decreasing 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:39.730
 After five years, the average life expectancy is 50 years. After 10 years, the average life expectancy is 40 years old. 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:44.199
 Then develop a technique that will make it clean in relation. 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:49.600
 It is not possible to clear the disclosure with current technology. 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:56.170
 It is possible to slow the speed of pollution do so, even if it forward 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:58.920
 By the year 2100, 50 years from now , mankind is expected to be destroyed. 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.920

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:50.200
 The value of money shall be known moments and then let all the shit 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:54.490
 The economy will fail, all kinds of crime will come, and the region will be a word. 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.430
 I think it's only a matter of throwing away the planet . 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:03.190
 I heard there was a recently discovered planet 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:08.830

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.500
 Huh 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:48.569
 The problem is that you have to decide what to do. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.519
 How much money do you need to make a space ship to that planet ? 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:56.129
 n 5,000 people can get roughly 3,000 won worth 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:00.090
 So to build a peddling base 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:05.849
 It'll need at least 2,000've been advised u 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.620

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.760
 By polluting the air sseuni write something if they receive support from a hat if the tax write 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.829
 It could be. 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.910
 If you think that people sacrificing for the humanity of the taxpayers who can not ride the ship 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.890
 It will. 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:37.560
 Someone has to survive. We sacrifice cattle for the sake of society. 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.209
