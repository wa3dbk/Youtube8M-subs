00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
right on and I did replace the shifter

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.990 
right on and I did replace the shifter
and<00:02:35.110> linkage<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:36.040> did<00:02:36.250> tear<00:02:36.490> off<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.790> knob<00:02:36.970> on

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
and linkage it did tear off the knob on

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.580 
and linkage it did tear off the knob on
the<00:02:37.240> shifter<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.959> had<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> new<00:02:38.350> one

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
the shifter so I had to get a new one

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.400 
the shifter so I had to get a new one
other<00:02:39.490> than<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.750> there's<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.870> couple<00:02:41.020> scuffs

little<00:02:44.620> buff<00:02:45.100> or<00:02:45.370> wax<00:02:45.640> will<00:02:45.820> take<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.060> out

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
little buff or wax will take that out

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.660 
little buff or wax will take that out
which<00:02:46.300> I'll<00:02:46.420> probably<00:02:46.660> do<00:02:46.989> before<00:02:47.350> by<00:02:47.670> no

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
some miles on it we look here you can

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.850 
some miles on it we look here you can

still<00:03:26.200> has<00:03:26.380> some<00:03:26.620> miles<00:03:26.860> on<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.190> though<00:03:27.430> not

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
still has some miles on it though not

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.110 
still has some miles on it though not
very<00:03:27.820> many<00:03:28.390> miles<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:30.000> couldn't<00:03:31.000> need<00:03:31.090> a

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
very many miles on it couldn't need a

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.670 
very many miles on it couldn't need a
replacement<00:03:31.450> within<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.959> near<00:03:32.110> future<00:03:32.320> but

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
replacement within the near future but

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.600 
replacement within the near future but
at<00:03:32.980> least<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.250> thousand<00:03:33.640> miles<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.910> left<00:03:34.239> Oh

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
at least a thousand miles to left Oh

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.530 
at least a thousand miles to left Oh
last<00:03:36.610> thing<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:36.910> guess<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.180> we're<00:03:37.269> going<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.450> do

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
last thing I guess so we're going to do

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:46.570 
last thing I guess so we're going to do
is<00:03:37.690> start<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.049> bike<00:03:38.170> up<00:03:38.410> for<00:03:38.739> you

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:56.059 

here<00:03:47.580> goes<00:03:47.760> nothing

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.220 

you<00:03:56.909> see<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.329> starts<00:03:57.659> up<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> typical

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
you see it starts up like a typical

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.679 
you see it starts up like a typical
Harley<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.670> battery<00:03:59.999> is<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.120> little<00:04:00.299> bit<00:04:00.420> on<00:04:00.569> it
