but<00:03:10.209> it's<00:03:10.330> not<00:03:10.420> doing<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.020> it's<00:03:11.350> hung<00:03:11.590> up<00:03:11.830> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
but it's not doing it it's hung up and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.090 
but it's not doing it it's hung up and
that<00:03:13.750> means<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.350> holding<00:03:14.890> all<00:03:15.010> the

that means that this is holding all the

that means that this is holding all the
energy<00:03:15.400> inside<00:03:15.850> here<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.180> it's<00:03:16.300> getting<00:03:16.540> very

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
energy inside here and it's getting very

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.720 
energy inside here and it's getting very
hot<00:03:17.290> probably<00:03:18.190> wouldn't<00:03:18.370> even<00:03:18.430> be<00:03:18.520> able<00:03:18.610> to

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
hot probably wouldn't even be able to

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.030 
hot probably wouldn't even be able to
touch<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.570> try<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:20.200> get<00:03:20.320> close<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.800> it

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
touch it if you try to get close to it

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.880 
touch it if you try to get close to it
so<00:03:21.570> therefore<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:23.170> suspect<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:23.650> have<00:03:23.680> about

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
so therefore you suspect you have about

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.800 
so therefore you suspect you have about
starter<00:03:24.310> simply<00:03:24.730> putting<00:03:25.000> your<00:03:25.120> hand<00:03:25.360> near<00:03:25.630> it

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
starter simply putting your hand near it

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.070 
starter simply putting your hand near it
and<00:03:26.200> if<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.400> hot<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.910> touch<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.180> hot<00:03:28.750> that

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
and if it's hot to the touch so hot that

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.880 
and if it's hot to the touch so hot that
it<00:03:29.230> almost<00:03:29.560> burned<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:29.980> then<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:32.019> more<00:03:32.739> than

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
it almost burned you then it's more than

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.620 
it almost burned you then it's more than
likely<00:03:33.070> it's<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.910> good<00:03:34.060> chance<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.540> have

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
likely it's a good chance that you have

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.009 
likely it's a good chance that you have
a<00:03:34.690> bad<00:03:34.870> starter<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:37.530> another<00:03:38.530> thing<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.130> that

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
a bad starter and another thing is that

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.360 
a bad starter and another thing is that
since<00:03:41.019> this<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.320> rebuild<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.890> could<00:03:42.010> possibly

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
since this is rebuild you could possibly

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.990 
since this is rebuild you could possibly
tell<00:03:43.320> maybe<00:03:44.320> if<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.680> get<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:45.040> close<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:45.670> that

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
tell maybe if I get in close here that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.270 
tell maybe if I get in close here that
this<00:03:46.330> starter<00:03:47.160> has<00:03:48.160> probably<00:03:48.430> been<00:03:48.610> hit<00:03:49.000> it's

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
this starter has probably been hit it's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.590 
this starter has probably been hit it's
the<00:03:51.280> last<00:03:51.489> problem<00:03:51.700> with<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.030> is<00:03:52.150> getting<00:03:52.390> hung

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
the last problem with it is getting hung

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.840 
the last problem with it is getting hung
up<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.019> probably<00:03:53.800> they<00:03:53.920> probably<00:03:54.340> been<00:03:54.670> hit

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
up and probably they probably been hit

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.979 
up and probably they probably been hit
by<00:03:55.030> some<00:03:55.060> sort<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.600> hammer

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
by some sort of a hammer

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.930 
by some sort of a hammer
they<00:03:56.769> probably<00:03:57.130> try<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.459> start<00:03:57.700> their<00:03:57.820> car

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
they probably try to start their car

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.250 
they probably try to start their car
with<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.180> hammer<00:03:58.360> each<00:03:58.510> time<00:03:58.780> or<00:03:58.959> something

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
with the hammer each time or something

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.110 
with the hammer each time or something
and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.960 
and
just<00:04:02.750> get<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:03.830> started<00:04:04.160> till<00:04:04.340> they<00:04:04.460> finally

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
just get it started till they finally

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.520 
just get it started till they finally
just<00:04:05.180> gave<00:04:05.360> up<00:04:05.570> or<00:04:05.780> something<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.200> and

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
just gave up or something in that and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.740 
just gave up or something in that and
decided<00:04:06.920> need<00:04:07.190> your<00:04:07.460> starter<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:08.450> anyway

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
decided need your starter but anyway

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.070 
decided need your starter but anyway
that's<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.440> basics<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.660> what<00:04:11.660> happens<00:04:11.960> when

that's the basics of what happens when

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.710 
that's the basics of what happens when

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
they get hung up also if you know of any

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.560 
they get hung up also if you know of any
oil<00:04:14.960> leaks<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:16.790> know<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:16.940> have<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.180> net<00:04:17.390> or

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
oil leaks and you know you have a net or

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.120 
oil leaks and you know you have a net or
you<00:04:17.780> know<00:04:17.930> you're<00:04:18.140> having<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.710> add<00:04:18.800> oil<00:04:18.830> to

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
you know you're having to add oil to

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.820 
you know you're having to add oil to
your<00:04:19.370> vehicle

your vehicle

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.600 
your vehicle
definitely<00:04:21.830> get<00:04:21.950> that<00:04:21.980> checked<00:04:22.280> out<00:04:22.370> as<00:04:22.490> soon

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
definitely get that checked out as soon

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.750 
definitely get that checked out as soon
as<00:04:22.640> possible<00:04:22.760> for<00:04:23.420> a<00:04:23.750> couple<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.230> reasons

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
as possible for a couple of reasons

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.940 
as possible for a couple of reasons
number<00:04:25.760> one<00:04:26.000> is<00:04:26.420> it's<00:04:27.290> affecting<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.800> wall

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
number one is it's affecting the wall

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.690 
number one is it's affecting the wall
pressure<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.960> well<00:04:29.960> is<00:04:30.470> not<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:31.400> end<00:04:31.490> pump

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
pressure and well is not the end pump

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.180 
pressure and well is not the end pump
throughout<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.030> engine<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:33.620> its<00:04:33.770> best

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
throughout the engine and to its best

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.380 
throughout the engine and to its best
ability<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:36.970> another<00:04:37.970> reason<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.900> that<00:04:40.390> if

all<00:04:48.920> sending<00:04:49.280> it<00:04:49.550> or<00:04:49.760> oil<00:04:50.060> pressure<00:04:50.270> switch

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
all sending it or oil pressure switch

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.810 
all sending it or oil pressure switch
typically<00:04:51.770> get<00:04:51.920> typically<00:04:52.430> amount<00:04:52.640> in<00:04:52.730> the

typically get typically amount in the
other<00:04:52.970> oil<00:04:53.120> filter<00:04:53.420> that<00:04:53.750> will<00:04:55.030> cause<00:04:56.030> the

other oil filter that will cause the

other oil filter that will cause the
starter<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.200> fail<00:04:57.380> prematurely<00:04:57.680> which<00:04:58.460> is<00:04:58.640> not

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
starter to fail prematurely which is not

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.950 
starter to fail prematurely which is not
good<00:04:59.000> you'll<00:04:59.180> be<00:04:59.270> spending<00:04:59.540> money<00:04:59.810> on<00:04:59.870> a
