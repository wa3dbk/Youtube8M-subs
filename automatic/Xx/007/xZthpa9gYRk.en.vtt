you're doing PT comes in 5 gallon and 6
gallon<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.780> conical<00:01:46.409> fermenter<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:47.220> all

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
gallon and then conical fermenter go all

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
gallon and then conical fermenter go all
the<00:01:47.549> way<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.670> 7<00:01:48.299> gallon<00:01:48.659> all<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.259> way<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.439> to
