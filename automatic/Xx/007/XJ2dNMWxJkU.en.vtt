00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
now if you want to have a seven

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.570 
now if you want to have a seven
passenger<00:00:18.810> capacity<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> go<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.490> to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
passenger capacity you have to go up to

passenger capacity you have to go up to
the<00:00:20.699> QX<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.270> that's<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.539> big<00:00:21.720> heavy<00:00:21.900> truck<00:00:22.260> and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.920 
the QX but that's a big heavy truck and
kind<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.550> costly<00:00:23.910> also<00:00:24.330> cost<00:00:24.510> me<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> gas

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
kind of costly also cost me at the gas

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.670 
kind of costly also cost me at the gas
pump<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.830> here's<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.340> solution<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.300> JX<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
pump so here's a solution the JX this is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.710 
pump so here's a solution the JX this is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
kind of a first for infinity because

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.340 
kind of a first for infinity because
it's<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:08.280> front-wheel<00:01:08.790> drive<00:01:09.060> vehicle<00:01:09.140> with<00:01:10.140> a

a<00:01:15.299> first<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.810> infinity<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.380> infinity<00:01:16.830> you're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
a first for infinity and infinity you're

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
a first for infinity and infinity you're
really<00:01:17.520> focused<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> two<00:01:18.420> areas<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> is

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
really focused on two areas and that is

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
really focused on two areas and that is
how<00:01:19.979> much<00:01:20.130> room<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> second<00:01:21.180> row

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
how much room you have in the second row

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.870 
how much room you have in the second row
and<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.840> third<00:01:21.869> row<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.560> infinity<00:01:23.549> puts<00:01:23.729> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and the third row as infinity puts it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
and the third row as infinity puts it
usually<00:01:24.240> being<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> third<00:01:24.840> row<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
usually being the third row is kind of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.469 
usually being the third row is kind of
the<00:01:25.439> penalty<00:01:25.799> box<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.119> card<00:01:27.360> is

actually room for a full-size adult not

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.359 
actually room for a full-size adult not
exactly<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> most<00:01:31.320> comfortable<00:01:31.740> place<00:01:31.920> but

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
exactly the most comfortable place but

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.580 
exactly the most comfortable place but
better<00:01:32.909> than<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.240> competition<00:01:33.390> i<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
second rose you can see there's a ton of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.730 
second rose you can see there's a ton of
space<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.630> granted<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.320> seats<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:37.710> the

space here granted this seats all the
way<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.009> front<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.400> trust<00:01:38.880> me<00:01:38.939> there's<00:01:39.119> plenty

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
way up front but trust me there's plenty

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.730 
way up front but trust me there's plenty
of<00:01:39.450> room<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.320> what's<00:01:40.470> really

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
of room here but what's really

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.039 
of room here but what's really
innovative<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.450> how<00:01:42.570> much<00:01:42.750> room<00:01:42.990> you

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
innovative is not just how much room you

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.340 
innovative is not just how much room you
have<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.950> how<00:01:44.340> easy<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> access<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
have but how easy it is to access the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.740 
have but how easy it is to access the
third<00:01:46.560> row<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.420> very<00:01:48.479> easy

anything comes in the way this car can
sense<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.520> sensors<00:02:05.969> come<00:02:06.210> basically

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
sense it now the sensors come basically

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.589 
sense it now the sensors come basically
from<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:08.129> part<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.489> bumper<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.479> way

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
to spend quite that much money there are

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.910 
to spend quite that much money there are
a<00:02:56.060> lot<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.210> options<00:02:56.720> technology<00:02:57.410> package<00:02:57.590> do

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
a lot of options technology package do

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.710 
a lot of options technology package do
you<00:02:57.980> need<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.280> rear<00:02:58.460> seat<00:02:58.700> entertainment<00:02:58.730> you

you need the rear seat entertainment you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.690 
you need the rear seat entertainment you
need<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.960> navigation<00:03:00.590> that's<00:03:00.950> up<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.460> but

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
need the navigation that's up to you but

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.730 
need the navigation that's up to you but
I<00:03:01.730> think<00:03:01.790> you'll<00:03:02.120> find<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.630> average<00:03:02.780> JX

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
I think you'll find that the average JX

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.440 
I think you'll find that the average JX
under<00:03:03.950> lots<00:03:04.130> around<00:03:04.250> 47<00:03:04.760> thousand<00:03:05.240> dollars

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
under lots around 47 thousand dollars

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.730 
under lots around 47 thousand dollars
and<00:03:05.570> that's<00:03:05.690> kind<00:03:05.990> of<00:03:06.020> on<00:03:06.170> par<00:03:06.440> with<00:03:06.470> the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
and that's kind of on par with the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.830 
and that's kind of on par with the
competitors<00:03:07.280> from<00:03:07.460> Audi<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.970> Acura<00:03:08.390> maybe

competitors from Audi and Acura maybe

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.710 
competitors from Audi and Acura maybe
about<00:03:09.170> five<00:03:09.860> percent<00:03:10.040> cheaper<00:03:10.610> we<00:03:11.510> really

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
about five percent cheaper we really

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.060 
about five percent cheaper we really
like<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.110> car<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.590> think<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.800> should<00:03:12.950> drive
