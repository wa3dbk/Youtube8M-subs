00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.160
 the first 

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.560
 all the machines from the vacuum cleaners to the cars are formed 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.170
 for a series of pieces 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.360
 These pieces are designed by specialized companies that first build a 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.830
 prototype and then the necessary tools to manufacture the pieces 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.730
 the 3d designs of the chosen pieces are created in a computer 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.730
 keller to the machines that will build the prototype 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.710
 the 3d drawing is divided into thousandths cross sections 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.949
 centimeter thick 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.390
 that program of being 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.090
 and goes to a tray filled with a liquid resin sensitive to light 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.930
 The laser light hardens the resin that takes the shape of the earth capable 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.590
 and finally build the prototype 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.280
 the prototype is rotated under ultraviolet light to dry the resin 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.660
 then polished, the prototype is painted according to the specifications 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.660
 design 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.860
 there is another method of prototyping that develops almost from the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.560
 same way but that uses a fine plastic powder the place of residence 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.290
 the computer and the laser to melt the plastic according to the shape of the party and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.290
 also capable house 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.190
 the hardened prototype of the plastic powder that is not 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.960
 has allowed 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.770
 there is a third method that does not use a laser 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.550
 the computer simply wanted the machinery to carve the prototype in 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 a hard material for example wood 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.010
 when the prototype is ready it is used to make a model of the piece to 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.380
 from a durable resin 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.560
 with this model a mold will be created and used to make the piece of metal 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.689
 channels are placed that want the molten metal towards the mount 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.040
 then the mold is filled with a mixture of sand and agents 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.040
 binders 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.749
 the surface is listed for tracking 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.469
 the sand mixture takes about 15 minutes to harden into a mold 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.749
 then you can melt the piece 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.749
 is poured magnesium heated to 700 degrees 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.299
 and is covered with sand to prevent the metal from reacting with the air 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.919
 the metal takes between 10 and 20 minutes to harden 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.829
 a vibrating tape breaks the mold 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.279
 To create pieces that require a better finish on the surface molds are used 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.279
 of plaster 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.900
 the mold passed to an oven where it will dry at 300 degrees centigrade during a 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.119
 maximum of 72 hours but not yet ready to be used 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.469
 first the operators have to drill some respirators if not the 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.189
 metal will not reach all the nooks 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.189
 if filters are placed so that impurities do not penetrate 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.319
 operators pour molten magnesium 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.019
 and once again they seal the vegetable with sand 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.609
 the letter metal between 20 minutes and an hour to cool down 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.029
 then you can break the plaster and remove the piece of metal 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:19.530
 The channels through which the metal was poured and polished are cut 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.529
 party with sanders 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:28.729
 finally it is painted using a special spray paint that adheres to the 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.729
 magnesium the fifa is already finished 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.540
 if we stop to think about it, even the machines that make these pieces 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.520
 they are made up of pieces that were made so it is an endless circle
