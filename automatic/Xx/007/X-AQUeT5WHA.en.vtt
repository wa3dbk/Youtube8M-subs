00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
servers that you've saved so you can

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.330 
servers that you've saved so you can
just<00:05:15.030> easily<00:05:15.270> log<00:05:15.600> into<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.070> file

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
just easily log into that is the file

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.400 
just easily log into that is the file
that<00:05:17.490> saves<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.479> data<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.139> don't<00:05:19.289> have

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
that saves that data so you don't have

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.230 
that saves that data so you don't have
to<00:05:19.560> refined<00:05:20.160> all<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.520> servers<00:05:20.849> that<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.060> like

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
to refined all the servers that you like

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.290 
to refined all the servers that you like
going<00:05:21.449> to<00:05:22.520> but<00:05:23.520> that's<00:05:23.639> basically<00:05:23.970> it

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
going to but that's basically it

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.120 
going to but that's basically it
you<00:05:24.389> can<00:05:24.539> do<00:05:24.630> screenshots<00:05:25.259> and<00:05:25.470> stuff<00:05:25.650> but<00:05:25.860> I

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
you can do screenshots and stuff but I

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.219 
you can do screenshots and stuff but I
don't<00:05:26.310> do<00:05:26.820> screenshots<00:05:27.360> in<00:05:27.570> game<00:05:27.780> that<00:05:28.080> the

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
don't do screenshots in game that the

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.270 
don't do screenshots in game that the
only<00:05:28.380> reason<00:05:28.620> there's<00:05:28.740> a<00:05:28.770> screenshot<00:05:29.160> there

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
only reason there's a screenshot there

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.250 
only reason there's a screenshot there
because<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.580> hit<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.820> button<00:05:29.970> by<00:05:30.210> accident<00:05:30.260> so

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
because I hit the button by accident so

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.839 
because I hit the button by accident so
that's<00:05:32.220> pretty<00:05:32.430> much<00:05:32.520> it

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
that's pretty much it

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.330 
that's pretty much it
um<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:35.870> shortcut<00:05:36.870> that<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.110> gave<00:05:37.349> you<00:05:37.560> make

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
um the shortcut that I gave you make

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.290
