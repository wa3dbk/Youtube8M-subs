00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.929
 Eberstadt Zilch 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.460
 near Darmstadt 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
 with a population density of about 3000 inhabitants 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.500
 Over 140 nationalities live together here in the district 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.730
 in the sixties seventies with mostly high-rise building 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.080
 originated 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.670
 to find an area like her transferable to many neighborhoods in Germany 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.690
 will be 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.600
 also for children and adolescents there is much done 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.860
 in the context of the district assembly also the interests of the smallest become 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.160
 taken seriously 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.980
 so also a volunteer and volunteer initiative of parents and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.270
 other adults 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.470
 who want to be present at central places for teenagers at night 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.940
 the night walkers 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.030
 The prevention program should work in two directions 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.430
 the Eberstädter should be able to go without fear by the quarter at night 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.050
 and the adolescents who often feel misunderstood marginalized 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.610
 would 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.960
 know his contact person 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.250
 it is therefore an essential goal of the initiative 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.390
 for the teens to say there 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.350
 Building trust with the young people 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.590
 As a result, communities are not going to grow alone again 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.060
 and if you have problems you can turn around well we will try 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.640
 wants to continue 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.260
 come on 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.880
 young people need role models 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.970
 Adults who give them security in the face of Eon helped Apulia and in 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.570
 In some cases, by fine-tuning may here 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.210
 and there are consistently positive testimonials 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.310
 we are her grandchild Bodhi also very worth seeing 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.320
 and also have a group of people 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.250
 have addressed the flyers and have 2 8 percent 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.250
 which the night walkers asked and what he gets there for Jordan earthquake 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.780
 no coal for it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.830
 and he did not want to believe it then left over are still main 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.869
 descendants we have ourselves 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.479
 the initiative is not now the job of social workers with the 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.639
 police 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.329
 the night walkers are convinced that if they can contribute to the 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.129
 To reduce juvenile delinquency 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.519
 she likes to go out in the evening 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.519
 The police in their city welcomes this commitment 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.570
 because matured 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.939
 which made private individuals their framework of society 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.219
 outside the police duties 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.049
 Communication finds 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.689
 not all respect 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.889
 only in the fields instead 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.419
 Idea of ​​this extraordinary disturbs 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.329
 where the police are involved 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.689
 and we have to reopen our attitude as well 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.179
 Chris Ferguson 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:03:00.919
 if the oil slick pays off this commitment even with direct conclude 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:06.789
 Bon in Dortmund does not talk us anything before every tour and then we open up 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.619
 the events through 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.619
 to do this, they are being bullied by a social worker diploma 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.129
 the glimpse of the initiative is Stockholm 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.109
 Ralf-Peter Katzer contact occurs 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.279
 since 1987, adults are out on the streets at night 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:27.649
 In the meantime, Sweden counts around 200,000 nightwalkers each year 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.299
 distributed over 300 places 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.839
 SID 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.679
 Dr 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.009
 per share in the previous year 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.929
 also in Norway Dehne Mark and Estonia Norway are their school 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.269
 I think it's a total protest Laufenberg 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.930
 I really want them 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.199
 they talked to us, they were really interested in us 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.569
 and it rarely follows that adults send a bit of what the adolescent 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.109
 doing so in the night and that in turn are running quite cups bounced 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.309
 during the night walkers and so on 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.569
 what really felt like when my sister came home from the bank 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.689
 Do not be afraid to stay on the ball in the dark alone 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.869
 Night walkers of the contract 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:15.489
 The poor Dorfen I wanted to get out of where I was beaten and stuff 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.370
 then the markets hope that find new apartment Prof because I am 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.370
 I really have money 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.379
 and from hiking destination lies with us 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.610
 the bomb will burst the trouble 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.819
 Although it is probably still a long way that is not missing in Germany 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.680
 Overnight had several neighbors 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.449
 1 but a central task our society must be 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.120
 to do here as this 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.219
 and to make oneself strong for such projects 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.219
 and to be there for our youth 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.669
 the light intensity 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:28.699
 It is important
