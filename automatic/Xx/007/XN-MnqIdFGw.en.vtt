00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
move on two axes so that it can both

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.510 
move on two axes so that it can both
conform<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.600> users<00:01:52.960> body<00:01:53.140> shape<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.650> move

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
conform to the users body shape and move

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.930 
conform to the users body shape and move
with<00:01:54.820> his<00:01:54.970> natural<00:01:55.180> flexing<00:01:55.750> motions<00:01:56.940> the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
with his natural flexing motions the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.580 
with his natural flexing motions the
restriction<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.720> movement<00:01:59.170> on<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.380> third

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
restriction of movement on the third

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.560 
restriction of movement on the third
axis<00:02:00.040> prevents<00:02:00.490> twisting<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.150> cup<00:02:01.360> around

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
axis prevents twisting of the cup around

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.960 
axis prevents twisting of the cup around
the<00:02:01.990> shank<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.470> stabilizes<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.490> shank<00:02:03.760> on<00:02:03.940> a
