00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
water once that gravel gets thought out

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.070 
water once that gravel gets thought out
and<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> starts<00:01:33.030> moving<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.510> we<00:01:33.660> can<00:01:33.810> sluice

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
and it starts moving and we can sluice

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.179 
and it starts moving and we can sluice
again

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.520 

so<00:01:42.850> we're<00:01:42.969> just<00:01:42.999> gonna<00:01:43.210> go<00:01:43.450> kind<00:01:43.689> of<00:01:43.780> slow<00:01:44.020> let

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
so we're just gonna go kind of slow let
