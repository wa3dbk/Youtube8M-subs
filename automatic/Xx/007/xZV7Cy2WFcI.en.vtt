00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
every time instead of over so that the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.069 
every time instead of over so that the
hair<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.910> layer<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> looks<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.900> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
hair is one layer and it looks like the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.710 
hair is one layer and it looks like the
braid<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:53.130> like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.460> layer<00:00:53.700> on<00:00:53.970> top<00:00:54.180> of

it<00:00:54.900> and<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.399> feel<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.880> really<00:00:57.270> pops

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
you're going to just continue to keep

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.620 
you're going to just continue to keep
reverse<00:01:22.259> braiding<00:01:23.160> up<00:01:23.399> until<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.209> get<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.569> the

reverse braiding up until you get to the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.389 
reverse braiding up until you get to the
point<00:01:24.899> where<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> would<00:01:25.289> do<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> hi<00:01:26.069> piggy<00:01:26.640> tail

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
point where you would do a hi piggy tail

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.180 
point where you would do a hi piggy tail
and<00:01:29.399> I<00:01:30.209> did<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.600> wet<00:01:30.899> hair<00:01:30.929> well<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.830> actually

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
and I did it on wet hair well I actually

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.240 
and I did it on wet hair well I actually
like<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> look<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.060> dry<00:01:33.420> hair<00:01:33.450> better<00:01:34.250> but

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
like the look on dry hair better but

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.510 
like the look on dry hair better but
just<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:36.030> did<00:01:36.690> on<00:01:36.810> way<00:01:36.990> easier<00:01:37.709> to<00:01:37.830> manage<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
just I did on way easier to manage so

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.219 
just I did on way easier to manage so
keep<00:01:38.700> braiding<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.179> until<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.569> becomes<00:01:40.050> its

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
keep braiding it until it becomes its

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.109 
keep braiding it until it becomes its
own<00:01:40.289> individual<00:01:41.190> braids<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.880> you've<00:01:41.970> got

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
own individual braids so that you've got

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.340 
own individual braids so that you've got
something<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.479> hold<00:01:42.569> onto<00:01:42.750> when<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> put<00:01:43.289> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
something to hold onto when you put it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.380 
something to hold onto when you put it
in<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.500> ponytail<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:45.000> you're<00:01:45.090> doing

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
in a ponytail and then when you're doing

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.290 
in a ponytail and then when you're doing
your<00:01:45.420> ponytail<00:01:46.050> you're<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.190> go<00:01:47.910> all<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
your ponytail you're going to go all the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.260 
your ponytail you're going to go all the
way<00:01:48.720> until<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.740> end<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:51.000> one

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
way until the very end and just make one

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.480 
way until the very end and just make one
loop<00:01:51.539> that<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.319> split<00:01:52.590> into<00:01:52.860> two<00:01:53.190> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
loop that can be split into two and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
loop that can be split into two and
that's<00:01:54.060> what's<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> make<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.929> bow

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that's what's going to make your bow

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.169 
that's what's going to make your bow
you're<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.099> to<00:01:56.160> take<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.459> extra<00:01:56.610> hair<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
you're going to take the extra hair and

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.389 
you're going to take the extra hair and
you<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.420> need<00:01:57.599> long<00:01:57.840> hair<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.440> this<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you do need long hair to do this if you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.820 
you do need long hair to do this if you
don't<00:01:59.789> you<00:02:00.060> could<00:02:00.209> probably<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.959> do<00:02:01.530> one

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
don't you could probably just do one

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.699 
don't you could probably just do one
little<00:02:02.009> lap<00:02:02.310> butter<00:02:03.119> layer<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.410> braid

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
little lap butter layer and so braid

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.430 
little lap butter layer and so braid
