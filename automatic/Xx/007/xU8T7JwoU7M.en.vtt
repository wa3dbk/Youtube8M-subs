 many 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.809
 if you go and ask 100 Americans

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.460
 and here we are talking about a figure 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.870
 that of george gap is legendary 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.440
 authentic champion of versatility in the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.540
 football 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.729
 at the end of the ten years then 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.010
 football was played as in football in the 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.379
 rugby ie players opted for 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.390
 both phases of the game there was not one 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.180
 specialized stage for defense is one 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.330
 specialized phase for the attack 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.610
 the keeper died at age 25 and on the bed of 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.770
 death told knut roni his own 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 then coach and my time but not 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.500
 I'm scared 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.200
 a rock day when the team will be 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.850
 in trouble and everything is going wrong by ai 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.760
 guys who give everything they have 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.310
 and they win a game for me the getter 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.869
 I don't know where I will be that day but it will be 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.119
 to know and I will be happy 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.860
 here in this sentence e 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.770

 wenhuan wimm one for the getter e 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.350
 of course the opportunity to do 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.290
 that speech rock in the m there too 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.240
 stadium notre dames arms a big one 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.899
 rivalry then and partly also of 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.509
 now 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.850
 and of course notre dames favored with 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.130
 a team decimated by injuries is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.960
 definitely in difficulty listening to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.900
 rho message 12 to 6 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.640

 interpreted the role of a gap that one 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.720

 part waits for reagan control 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.290
