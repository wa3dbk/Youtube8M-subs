00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.539
 what happened to him in those final minutes before the game against

 its parent club really a very special constellation after eleven years 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.439
 in the club 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:13.879

 many mistakes a good deal of caution, no chances to remember 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.649
 less constructive in the first 25 minutes 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.570
 After half an hour, Tiebreak had to come out with a knee injury 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.570
 Schönbächler he is sitting 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.470

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.390
 creative break 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.390
 which is why the same as stock free kick 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.610
 Just here the policeman was announced Wednesday 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.800

 Lippi 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:17.899
 technically strong 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.899
 but in Johnny Leoni he found his master 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.670
 in Berlin 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.670
 a real scoring opportunity 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.190
 the answer of the Zurich gave the guests with this remarkable solo 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.659
 however, the rail connection was abseiling to be weaker 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.880
 right foot, therefore, quite safe 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.290
 Nuzzolo in the sold-out arena a logical folding side know Kate 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.580

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
 secure with Siegert 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.270
 UG and Thermik the steadfast expired was about a shot from Nikci 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.670

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 admitted once 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.649

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.209
 once so Noll 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.110
