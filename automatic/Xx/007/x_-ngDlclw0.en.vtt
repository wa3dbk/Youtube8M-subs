so<00:00:11.820> let's<00:00:16.250> piay<00:00:17.250> we're<00:00:17.609> passionate<00:00:17.850> about

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
so let's piay we're passionate about

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.170 
so let's piay we're passionate about
technology<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.770> about<00:00:19.949> innovation<00:00:20.820> the

and<00:00:26.130> that's<00:00:26.340> why<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.910> set<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.360> this

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and that's why we set up this

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.840 
and that's why we set up this
competition<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.440> help<00:00:28.650> bring<00:00:29.370> some<00:00:29.700> of<00:00:29.820> that

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
competition to help bring some of that

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.300 
competition to help bring some of that
next<00:00:30.240> generation<00:00:30.540> through<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.770> think<00:00:32.189> my

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
next generation through I think my

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.830 
next generation through I think my
standard<00:00:32.669> has<00:00:32.850> been<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.270> high<00:00:33.420> there's

standard has been really high there's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
standard has been really high there's
been<00:00:34.020> some<00:00:34.200> really<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.890> exciting

respond<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> basically<00:00:59.790> our<00:01:00.059> design<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.630> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
respond it is basically our design is to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.110 
respond it is basically our design is to
prevent<00:01:01.140> forest<00:01:01.620> fires<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.670> does<00:01:02.880> this<00:01:03.059> by

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
prevent forest fires and it does this by

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.930 
prevent forest fires and it does this by

various senses such as temperature
humidity<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.110> moisture<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> will<00:01:08.220> send

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
humidity and moisture then it will send
