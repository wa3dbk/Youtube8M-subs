okay<00:00:04.620> here's<00:00:04.830> what<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.009> have<00:00:05.160> so<00:00:05.370> far<00:00:05.569> the<00:00:06.569> only

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
okay here's what I have so far the only

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.090 
okay here's what I have so far the only
thing<00:00:06.870> I've<00:00:06.960> connected<00:00:07.229> to<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.189> new<00:00:09.020> ignition

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
thing I've connected to the new ignition

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.949 
thing I've connected to the new ignition
switch<00:00:11.100> connector<00:00:11.610> I've<00:00:12.360> got<00:00:12.539> two<00:00:12.690> ground

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
switch connector I've got two ground

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.019 
switch connector I've got two ground
wires<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.529> that<00:00:13.650> corresponds<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.730> what's

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:15.029 
wires and that corresponds with what's

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.150 
wires and that corresponds with what's
in<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.209> directions<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.049> haven't<00:00:16.949> plugged

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
in the directions I haven't plugged

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.090 
in the directions I haven't plugged
anything<00:00:17.520> into<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.880> clear<00:00:18.180> one<00:00:18.359> just<00:00:18.539> yet

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
anything into this clear one just yet

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.820 
anything into this clear one just yet
and<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:21.240> want<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.480> point<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.900> actually

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
and I just want to point out I actually

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
and I just want to point out I actually
have<00:00:23.190> a<00:00:23.520> neutral<00:00:24.120> safety<00:00:24.300> switch<00:00:24.690> it<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
have a neutral safety switch it is

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.980 
have a neutral safety switch it is
clearly<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.220> manual<00:00:26.850> transmission<00:00:26.970> truck<00:00:27.600> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
clearly a manual transmission truck and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.840 
clearly a manual transmission truck and
I<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.770> a<00:00:28.800> neutral<00:00:29.130> safety<00:00:29.460> switch<00:00:29.670> that's

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
I have a neutral safety switch that's

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.350 
I have a neutral safety switch that's
right<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.360> uh<00:00:31.369> but<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.460> think<00:00:32.789> I'm<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
right here uh but I think I'm going to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
right here uh but I think I'm going to
bypass<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.289> don't<00:00:35.160> recommend<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.789> I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
bypass it I don't recommend it I

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.970 
bypass it I don't recommend it I
shouldn't<00:00:36.420> recommend<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.499> it's<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
shouldn't recommend it because it's it's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.770 
shouldn't recommend it because it's it's
there<00:00:38.280> for<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.519> reason

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
there for a reason

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
there for a reason
but<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.679> going<00:00:40.859> to<00:00:40.920> bypass<00:00:41.069> it<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.640> don't

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
but I'm going to bypass it I don't

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.139 
but I'm going to bypass it I don't
recommend<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.969> but<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
recommend that you do that but if you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.469 
recommend that you do that but if you
want<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.979> that's<00:00:46.979> totally<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.300> I'm

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
want to that's totally up to you so I'm

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.419 
want to that's totally up to you so I'm
going<00:00:48.659> to<00:00:48.690> bypass<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:49.469> neutral<00:00:49.859> safety<00:00:49.979> switch

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
going to bypass my neutral safety switch

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.799 
going to bypass my neutral safety switch
and<00:00:51.710> just<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.920> worry<00:00:52.949> about<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and just not worry about it so like I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.989 
and just not worry about it so like I
said<00:00:54.929> I<00:00:55.019> got<00:00:55.139> two<00:00:55.319> ground<00:00:55.949> wires<00:00:56.190> plugged<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
said I got two ground wires plugged in

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.229 
said I got two ground wires plugged in
there<00:00:57.179> and<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.199> I've<00:00:58.289> been<00:00:58.440> doing<00:00:58.769> with<00:00:59.239> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
there and what I've been doing with the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.549 
there and what I've been doing with the
harness<00:01:00.829> is<00:01:01.829> separating<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:04.110> ignition

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
harness is separating out the ignition

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.700 
harness is separating out the ignition
wires<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> plug<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.680> they<00:01:07.680> were

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
wires that I need to plug into they were

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.959 
wires that I need to plug into they were
bound<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.259> zip<00:01:10.259> ties<00:01:10.729> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.789> far

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
bound up with the zip ties kind of far

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.749 
bound up with the zip ties kind of far
down<00:01:12.180> down<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.579> what<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
down down to about here and so what I

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.889 
down down to about here and so what I
did<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.149> clip<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> zip<00:01:16.140> tie<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.649> pull<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.899> the

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
did is I clip a zip tie I pull out the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.840 
did is I clip a zip tie I pull out the
four<00:01:19.109> wires<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.649> I<00:01:19.740> need<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.100> only

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
four wires that I need actually only

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.719 
four wires that I need actually only
three<00:01:21.770> but<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> would<00:01:22.950> separate<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.490> out

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
three but I would separate these out

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.630 
three but I would separate these out
reuse<00:01:24.719> it<00:01:24.869> tie<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.109> so<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> didn't<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:26.460> all

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
reuse it tie it so it didn't get all

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.170 
reuse it tie it so it didn't get all
screwy<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.159> just<00:01:29.159> blow<00:01:29.399> up<00:01:29.430> into<00:01:29.789> a<00:01:29.909> rat's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
screwy and just blow up into a rat's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.969 
screwy and just blow up into a rat's
nest<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.649> just<00:01:31.770> went<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.219> along<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
nest on me so I just went up along the

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
nest on me so I just went up along the
bundle<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.130> separated<00:01:35.789> out<00:01:35.969> these<00:01:36.149> wires

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
bundle here separated out these wires

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
bundle here separated out these wires
till<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.320> them<00:01:37.380> real<00:01:37.590> close<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:38.039> to<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
till I got them real close here to the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.580 
till I got them real close here to the
fuse<00:01:38.520> panel<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.840> route<00:01:40.259> them<00:01:40.380> up

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
fuse panel so that I can route them up

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.389 
fuse panel so that I can route them up
over<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.759> steering<00:01:42.119> column<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.920> up<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.250> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
over the steering column and up here to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.709 
over the steering column and up here to
the<00:01:44.490> ignition<00:01:44.909> switch<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.450> need<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
the ignition switch which you need to

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.469 
the ignition switch which you need to
get<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.079> from<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.249> side<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.359> what

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
get to from this side so that's what

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.749 
get to from this side so that's what
I've<00:01:48.570> been<00:01:48.600> doing<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.200> far<00:01:49.409> I'm<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> get

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
I've been doing so far I'm going to get

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.700 
I've been doing so far I'm going to get
these<00:01:50.880> kind<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.210> rounded<00:01:51.539> up<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
these kind of rounded up and get the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.709 
these kind of rounded up and get the
length<00:01:52.999> correct<00:01:53.999> I'm<00:01:54.179> going<00:01:54.359> to<00:01:54.420> cut<00:01:54.630> them

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
length correct I'm going to cut them

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.489 
length correct I'm going to cut them
long<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.509> some<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:58.259> leeway

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
long so that I have some some leeway

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.010 
long so that I have some some leeway
there<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.210> that's<00:02:00.210> why<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.359> separated<00:02:00.840> these

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
there but that's why I separated these

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.749 
there but that's why I separated these
out<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.590> route<00:02:02.159> them<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
out so I can route them up get the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.520 
out so I can route them up get the
proper<00:02:03.119> length<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.479> need<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.520> then<00:02:05.520> crimp<00:02:05.819> the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
proper length I need and then crimp the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.480 
proper length I need and then crimp the
little<00:02:07.530> connectors<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.360> end<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.750> then

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
little connectors on to the end and then

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.090 
little connectors on to the end and then
plug<00:02:11.490> them<00:02:11.610> into<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.560> little<00:02:13.560> connect<00:02:13.920> the

I'll take the tape off before I plug

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.580 
I'll take the tape off before I plug
them<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.349> but<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.610> keep<00:02:56.760> them<00:02:56.910> together

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
them in but just to keep them together

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.080 
them in but just to keep them together
because<00:02:58.590> as<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.980> can<00:02:59.099> see<00:02:59.280> here<00:02:59.519> in<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> in

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
because as you can see here in the in

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.330 
because as you can see here in the in
the<00:03:00.269> wiring<00:03:00.870> diagram<00:03:01.380> there's<00:03:02.069> three

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the wiring diagram there's three

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.000 
the wiring diagram there's three
locations<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:03.150> battery<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.690> got<00:03:03.840> one<00:03:04.079> two

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
locations for battery you got one two

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.610 
locations for battery you got one two
and<00:03:05.400> three<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.930> also<00:03:07.079> have<00:03:07.579> two<00:03:08.579> places<00:03:09.620> for

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
and three you also have two places for

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.620 
and three you also have two places for
ignition<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.910> that's<00:03:12.090> kind<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.390> what<00:03:12.510> I've

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
ignition so that's kind of what I've

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.289 
ignition so that's kind of what I've
done<00:03:12.660> here<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:14.209> I've<00:03:15.209> plugged<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:17.299> kind
