will work and I'm going to since I'm
using<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.980> by<00:02:24.130> today<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.880> throwing<00:02:25.299> in<00:02:25.420> the

using a by today and throwing in the
cash<00:02:25.810> flows<00:02:26.109> when<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.739> use<00:02:26.920> about<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.220> half<00:02:27.489> cup<00:02:27.760> a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
cash flows when I use about a half cup a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.490 
cash flows when I use about a half cup a
little<00:02:28.150> bit<00:02:28.239> more<00:02:28.359> than<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.600> half<00:02:28.780> cup<00:02:29.019> because

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
little bit more than a half cup because

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.050 
little bit more than a half cup because
it<00:02:29.739> will<00:02:29.829> chop<00:02:30.100> down<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:30.940> approximately

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
it will chop down so it's approximately

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.390 
it will chop down so it's approximately
half<00:02:31.690> cup<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.500> Vitamix<00:02:32.950> i<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.220> put

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
half cup and the Vitamix i can put

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.340 
half cup and the Vitamix i can put
everything<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.940> together<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:34.390> once<00:02:34.630> i<00:02:34.900> put<00:02:35.290> a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
everything in together at once i put a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.880 
everything in together at once i put a
pinch<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.799> salt<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:38.320> give<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> little<00:02:38.650> extra

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
pinch of salt just give a little extra

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.640 
pinch of salt just give a little extra
flavor<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.489> I'm<00:02:39.549> going<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.760> blend<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.090> up

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.410 

the<00:02:43.650> Vitamix<00:02:44.100> makes<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.550> nice<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.000> creamy<00:02:45.210> and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the Vitamix makes it nice and creamy and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.970 
the Vitamix makes it nice and creamy and
smooth<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:47.720> now<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.170> comes<00:02:49.380> out<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
smooth and so now if it comes out to the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.120 
smooth and so now if it comes out to the
fin<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.550> your<00:02:51.300> day<00:02:51.960> is<00:02:52.140> warm<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.800> comes<00:02:52.980> out

too thin and the coconut butter melts

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.900 
too thin and the coconut butter melts
too<00:02:54.900> much<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.710> can<00:02:55.920> set<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.400> up<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.760> little

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
too much you can set that up a little

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.210 
too much you can set that up a little
bit<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.720> actually<00:02:58.110> nice<00:02:58.290> once<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.800> little<00:02:59.100> bit

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
bit it's actually nice once a little bit

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.820 
bit it's actually nice once a little bit
thinner<00:02:59.580> when<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.810> get<00:03:00.960> it<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.590> it
