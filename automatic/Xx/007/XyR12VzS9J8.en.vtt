let's just say they take that one there
the<00:00:18.900> Jack<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.560> Diamonds<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.510> so<00:00:21.510> then<00:00:21.660> we're

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the Jack of Diamonds and so then we're

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.300 
the Jack of Diamonds and so then we're
going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.170> your<00:00:22.289> control<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.070> Jacka

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
going to do is your control the Jacka

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.800 
going to do is your control the Jacka
diverts<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> bottom<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> way<00:00:24.779> I

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
diverts to the bottom and the way I

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.540 
diverts to the bottom and the way I
usually<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.500> I'll<00:00:25.680> ripping<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
usually do it is I'll ripping on the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.759 
usually do it is I'll ripping on the
sides<00:00:26.730> back<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.180> put<00:00:27.359> their<00:00:27.480> garden<00:00:27.750> show<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
sides back and put their garden show it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.220 
sides back and put their garden show it
again<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.240> I'll<00:00:30.240> push<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> card<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.960> but

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
again and I'll push the card in but

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.810 
again and I'll push the card in but
while<00:00:31.410> pushing<00:00:31.619> up<00:00:31.890> I'm<00:00:32.099> gonna<00:00:32.399> pull<00:00:32.790> my

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
while pushing up I'm gonna pull my

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.930 
while pushing up I'm gonna pull my
fingers<00:00:33.239> back<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.610> card<00:00:35.850> will

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
fingers back to so that the card will

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.979 
fingers back to so that the card will
stay<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.899> top<00:00:37.110> packet<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> bottom<00:00:38.489> one

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
stay on the top packet at the bottom one

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.450 
stay on the top packet at the bottom one
so<00:00:39.989> putting<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.860> kind<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.190> pull

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so putting in you just kind of like pull

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.299 
so putting in you just kind of like pull
the<00:00:41.579> cart<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.860> it'll<00:00:43.860> stay<00:00:43.890> on

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the cart up like this so it'll stay on

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.680 
the cart up like this so it'll stay on
the<00:00:44.520> bottom<00:00:44.820> part<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.180> instead<00:00:45.629> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the bottom part right here instead of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.080 
the bottom part right here instead of
going<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:46.050> top<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.789> then<00:00:47.789> you'll<00:00:47.969> have

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
this little gap right there and then

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.069 
this little gap right there and then

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
little bit fast or some people might

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.609 
little bit fast or some people might
catch<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.540> interrupt<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> trick

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
catch on to it and interrupt the trick

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
cards not on top that is probably not on

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950
