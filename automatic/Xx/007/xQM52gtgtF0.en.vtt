00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
forward and and I said this what

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.080 
forward and and I said this what
happened<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:53.010> place<00:02:53.280> crews<00:02:53.520> took<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.820> step

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
happened was place crews took a step

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.460 
happened was place crews took a step
back<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.390> countered<00:02:54.960> him<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.260> then<00:02:55.350> he<00:02:55.440> just

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
back and countered him and then he just

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.200 
back and countered him and then he just
cleared<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> ground<00:02:56.070> again<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.730> he<00:02:57.030> never

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
cleared the ground again and he never

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.850 
cleared the ground again and he never
done<00:02:57.480> he<00:02:57.750> never<00:02:57.930> done<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.170> right<00:02:58.260> thing<00:02:58.470> but

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
done he never done the right thing but

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.030 
done he never done the right thing but
maybe<00:02:59.370> even<00:03:00.060> if<00:03:00.180> he<00:03:00.270> had<00:03:00.450> gone<00:03:00.630> forward<00:03:01.040> even

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
maybe even if he had gone forward even

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.170 
maybe even if he had gone forward even
if<00:03:02.280> he'd<00:03:02.400> had<00:03:02.520> gone<00:03:02.670> forward

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
if he'd had gone forward

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.330 
if he'd had gone forward
he<00:03:03.480> looked<00:03:03.690> beaten<00:03:03.870> anyway<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.830> know<00:03:04.920> and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
he looked beaten anyway and you know and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.040 
he looked beaten anyway and you know and
I<00:03:05.400> think<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.090> know<00:03:06.240> if<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.630> look<00:03:06.810> at<00:03:06.900> the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
I think you know if you look at the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.860 
I think you know if you look at the
fight<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:08.100> didn't<00:03:08.610> have<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.060> tools<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.540> do<00:03:09.720> it

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
fight it didn't have the tools to do it

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.750 
fight it didn't have the tools to do it
he<00:03:09.960> wasn't<00:03:10.170> able<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.610> is

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
he wasn't able to do it and this is

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.340 
he wasn't able to do it and this is
sibylla's<00:03:12.150> at<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.630> don't<00:03:12.690> think<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> foot

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
sibylla's at and I don't think the foot

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.370 
sibylla's at and I don't think the foot
even<00:03:13.470> mattered<00:03:14.010> forget<00:03:14.610> about<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:16.020> chance

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
even mattered forget about a chance

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.020 
even mattered forget about a chance
party<00:03:16.740> would<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:16.980> give<00:03:17.280> him<00:03:17.400> another<00:03:17.430> chance

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
party would you give him another chance

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.540 
party would you give him another chance
I<00:03:18.060> think<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.050> pointless<00:03:19.320> have<00:03:20.190> another

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
I think it's pointless have another

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.370 
I think it's pointless have another
fight<00:03:20.850> because<00:03:21.300> who<00:03:21.630> would<00:03:21.810> want<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.080> pay<00:03:22.320> for

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
fight because who would want to pay for

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.020 
fight because who would want to pay for
look<00:03:22.680> listen<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.100> what<00:03:23.250> all<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.520> callers<00:03:23.910> are

look listen to what all the callers are

look listen to what all the callers are

people<00:03:27.290> I'd<00:03:28.290> watch<00:03:28.530> him<00:03:28.710> again<00:03:29.240> I'd<00:03:30.240> give<00:03:30.540> him

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
people I'd watch him again I'd give him

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.740 
people I'd watch him again I'd give him
another<00:03:30.810> chance<00:03:31.010> me<00:03:32.010> as<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.220> boxing<00:03:32.640> as<00:03:33.210> a<00:03:33.270> boxer

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
another chance me as a boxing as a boxer

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.780 
another chance me as a boxing as a boxer
looking<00:03:34.020> at<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.230> site<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.770> don't<00:03:35.190> think<00:03:35.490> he

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
looking at that site I don't think he

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.400 
looking at that site I don't think he
has<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.210> tools<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.900> don't<00:03:37.080> think<00:03:37.320> he

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
has the tools to and I don't think he

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.080 
has the tools to and I don't think he
could<00:03:37.560> do<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.520> really<00:03:38.790> don't<00:03:39.000> think

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
could do it and I really don't think

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.820 
could do it and I really don't think
coming<00:03:39.450> forward<00:03:39.930> with<00:03:40.020> me<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.380> would<00:03:40.590> make<00:03:40.800> a

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
coming forward with me it would make a

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.680 
coming forward with me it would make a
difference<00:03:40.920> he'd<00:03:41.340> walk<00:03:41.520> onto<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.910> punch<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.540> he

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
difference he'd walk onto a punch and he

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.750 
difference he'd walk onto a punch and he
get<00:03:42.840> knocked<00:03:43.050> out<00:03:43.200> maybe<00:03:43.710> in<00:03:43.920> hindsight<00:03:44.370> when

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
get knocked out maybe in hindsight when

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.820 
get knocked out maybe in hindsight when
you<00:03:44.880> look<00:03:45.060> at<00:03:45.180> what<00:03:45.330> he<00:03:45.450> was<00:03:45.480> saying<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.170> and

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
you look at what he was saying and and

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.380 
you look at what he was saying and and
all<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.250> all<00:03:47.490> of<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.790> comments<00:03:48.240> that<00:03:48.330> he

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
all of this all of the comments that he

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.360 
all of this all of the comments that he
makes<00:03:49.050> afterwards<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.800> know<00:03:49.860> hindsight's<00:03:50.280> a

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
makes afterwards you know hindsight's a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.220 
makes afterwards you know hindsight's a
great<00:03:50.580> saying<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.450> look<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.870> think

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
great saying and you look and you think

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.200 
great saying and you look and you think
then<00:03:52.410> it's<00:03:52.860> body<00:03:53.070> language<00:03:53.490> before<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.000> four

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
then it's body language before the four

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.290 
then it's body language before the four
before<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.960> fight<00:03:55.500> he<00:03:55.710> sold<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.460> to<00:03:56.610> me<00:03:56.760> but

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
before the fight he sold it to me but

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.820 
before the fight he sold it to me but
maybe<00:03:57.570> when<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:57.960> look<00:03:58.140> at<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.350> again<00:03:58.560> look<00:03:58.710> at

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
maybe when you look at it again look at

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.990 
maybe when you look at it again look at
the<00:03:58.920> change<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.490> tone<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.730> his<00:03:59.940> voice

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the change in the tone of his voice

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.720 
the change in the tone of his voice
maybe<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:01.110> fact<00:04:01.410> he<00:04:01.770> was<00:04:01.920> happy<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.400> go<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
maybe in fact he was happy to go the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.210 
maybe in fact he was happy to go the
distance<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:04.410> not<00:04:04.620> get<00:04:04.830> knocked<00:04:05.010> out

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
distance and and not get knocked out

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.700 
distance and and not get knocked out
because<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.820> think<00:04:06.330> if<00:04:06.420> he<00:04:06.540> walked<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:07.050> like

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
because I think if he walked on like

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.150 
because I think if he walked on like
that<00:04:07.860> possibly<00:04:08.520> because<00:04:09.210> he's<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:09.840> much

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
that possibly because he's so much

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.190 
that possibly because he's so much
superior<00:04:11.160> skill<00:04:11.850> wise<00:04:12.060> maybe<00:04:12.540> Klesko<00:04:13.050> would

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
superior skill wise maybe Klesko would

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.630 
superior skill wise maybe Klesko would
have<00:04:13.290> knocked<00:04:13.500> him<00:04:13.620> out<00:04:13.710> maybe<00:04:14.070> he<00:04:14.280> knew<00:04:14.460> that

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
have knocked him out maybe he knew that

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.670 
have knocked him out maybe he knew that
maybe<00:04:15.030> he<00:04:15.150> sat<00:04:15.360> on<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:15.720> morning<00:04:16.080> David<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.470> but

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
maybe he sat on this morning David a but

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.200 
maybe he sat on this morning David a but

only me as a commentator I was wrong I

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.310 
only me as a commentator I was wrong I
thought<00:04:52.090> he<00:04:52.300> would<00:04:52.450> come<00:04:52.630> forward<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.140> thought

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
thought he would come forward it thought

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.750 
thought he would come forward it thought
he<00:04:53.440> would<00:04:53.590> burst<00:04:53.800> out<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.190> corner<00:04:54.520> and

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
he would burst out of the corner and

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.850 
he would burst out of the corner and
attack<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.480> have<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.630> chance<00:04:55.930> but<00:04:56.230> what<00:04:56.710> I

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
attack and have a chance but what I

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.070 
attack and have a chance but what I
think<00:04:56.950> is<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:57.700> difficult<00:04:58.000> for<00:04:58.300> everybody<00:04:58.840> to

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
think is so difficult for everybody to

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.770 
think is so difficult for everybody to
check<00:04:59.290> is<00:04:59.590> the<00:05:00.490> UNMIK<00:05:00.970> nonnamous<00:05:01.450> way<00:05:01.720> in

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
check is the UNMIK nonnamous way in

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.140 
check is the UNMIK nonnamous way in
which<00:05:02.050> he<00:05:02.200> took<00:05:02.410> he<00:05:02.980> took<00:05:03.220> his<00:05:03.370> defeat<00:05:03.760> he

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
which he took he took his defeat he

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.690 
which he took he took his defeat he
didn't<00:05:04.480> at<00:05:04.660> any<00:05:04.870> stage<00:05:05.290> say<00:05:05.680> look<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.490> was

if<00:05:27.790> he<00:05:27.910> just<00:05:28.120> said<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.540> I<00:05:28.750> think<00:05:29.140> it<00:05:29.260> would

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
if he just said that I think it would

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.380 
if he just said that I think it would
have<00:05:29.470> been<00:05:29.500> much<00:05:29.800> easier<00:05:29.830> for<00:05:30.790> all<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.090> people

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
who subscribed to watch him fight it

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.190 
who subscribed to watch him fight it
would<00:05:33.850> have<00:05:33.970> been<00:05:34.060> much<00:05:34.180> easier<00:05:34.240> easier<00:05:34.990> for

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
would have been much easier easier for

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.870 
would have been much easier easier for
them<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.500> have<00:05:35.590> taken<00:05:35.950> that<00:05:36.070> but<00:05:36.400> he<00:05:36.490> didn't<00:05:36.760> do

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
them to have taken that but he didn't do

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.750 
them to have taken that but he didn't do
that<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.450> it<00:05:37.630> just<00:05:37.870> so<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.350> seemed

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
that and it just so it seemed

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.130
