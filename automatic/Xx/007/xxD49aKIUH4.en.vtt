 Thank you

 good morning sometimes it is true yes the 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.900
 really like you do not have time do not you 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.910
 you want to be passing the pincer or the 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.210
 tubes like the good looks for example 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.180
 there is a very easy way to comb you and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.069
 our life model that comes the day of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.649
 today because in projection is to make some 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:41.530
 little ones with iron as you are 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.319
 as well as cops or in natural cells 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.749
 well no sir do not ask me how 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:49.589
 they do it is very easy already it was possible to the 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:55.449
 iron can the only thing you do is 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:57.129
 turn it once and lower it just 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.679
 remember that the iron has to be 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.469
 preferably a little more round if you 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:06.430
 fix here we already have a very curl 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.590
 natural nothing too much like them 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.750
 you know not from kirchner's loop to where 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.910
 they look like 15 years old it was not the most 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.710
 weak and in your me more logical I 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.990
 ask a while ago to get wet but 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.910
 us exactly what you have to 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.950
 is that it is much easier with the 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.830
 iron because at the same time you 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.890
 is ironing to padrÃ­simo where this 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.780
 I'm doing my hair if I explain 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.600
 when I go to zero with the front the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.760
 heat level or not this does not have to 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.310
 being very hot is more in fact between 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.070
 less hot people are less 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.130
 China will give up less exactly 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 nothing else is to turn it once remember not 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.040
 they turn it over again they pull it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.280
 and let it go I would have thought that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.010
 now smooth upside down to think if by 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.130
 example you left very Chinese and you do not like 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.100
 you give him a pastera is a pass like that and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.680
 it is bigger here very beautiful woman 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.009
 Well, you're already like that, super father 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.720
 something so very fast not that and good for 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.479
 example if we wanted to do the best 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.380
 a collected here we can make a 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.380
 little bit of crepe 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.330
 as a high school girl 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.630
 that is, what you can do is a little 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.820
 crepe on top they are fixed what 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.770
 take from above and with the comb but 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.700
 when you try to pancake 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.800
 like granny if you have one thing 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.010
 very rare no no no no more we know a 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.140
 little piece of hair what you can do 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.440
 is to grab it and already with some kids 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.310
 down the asia you have a little grabs 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.920
 a rubber band, a band or a clip 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.010
 exactly and well you already look super 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.600
 father is fine for minutes like 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.150
 those that are fashionable now 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.130
 much the braids I have mobility already with 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.900
 all your braid here very kind father is 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.810
 exactly what can be the same and is 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.990
 pick up a little more of the sides I would 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.480
 I suggest you use more wax than 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.760
 gel because it will look more natural is 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.710
 a queen 2 if it is greased but 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.570
 obviously you do not have to abuse the 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.550
 product because I am also 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.650
 pregnant 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.510
 what you can do is pick it up because 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.660
 also if not the hairstyle looks like very 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.230
 stiff so you can do it then 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.540
 little of the sides just like I picked it up 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.800
 this up and what you do is make 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.800
 like a knot 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:45.600
 you make a knot and then you make another one 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:49.260
 knot ok ok then you already have a hairstyle 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.390
 as well as easy and quick parents and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.330
 Well, now you suddenly put this 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.270
 so more spray and you finish it and everything 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:03.450
 you can do with olivia see now 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.450
 and you do it like this is father sera 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:12.660
 because we are already using our 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.180
 clear scraped braids 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.670
 9 comes a lot very much the braid 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.580
 but as loose as well as water where 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.800
 natural you can make them aside 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.660
 hand its the same you can do from the side we 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.750
 let's affect it like rickety already 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.150
 you can do it in two the presses the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.030
 you can grab and do it in two the 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.430
 divide in 12 the hair and you are grabbing 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.910
 nothing else the shores 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:45.200
 and the pure edges and the squeeze 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.050
 ok the shore and you squeeze and it's going 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.910
 a braid so cute and so easy to 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.970
 do that is what they say it is 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.820
 as of the market if to see if the 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.800
 we reached to close I never had 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.050
 we visit is done or looks beautiful is 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.030
 you see beautiful it looks like you have a lot 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.880
 more hair than that is father too 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.000
 then the most lazy are only 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.980
 you grab the edges and you're going to squeeze 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.770
 obviously, if you do it and with a lot of 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.200
 calm down but look to see if they reach 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.850
 focus is very pretty and it's fine 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.950
 do it also fast because as 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.650
 we say the joke of adapting in mobile 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.950

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.620

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.090
