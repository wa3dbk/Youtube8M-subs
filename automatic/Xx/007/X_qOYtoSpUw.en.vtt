I'm<00:02:22.610> wondering<00:02:22.880> why<00:02:23.180> they<00:02:23.390> decided<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.900> put

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
I'm wondering why they decided to put

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.280 
I'm wondering why they decided to put
toast<00:02:24.459> at<00:02:25.459> level<00:02:25.790> 55<00:02:26.269> unlock<00:02:26.720> which<00:02:26.959> is<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
toast at level 55 unlock which is the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.590 
toast at level 55 unlock which is the
max<00:02:27.500> level<00:02:27.739> before<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.190> proceed<00:02:28.360> why<00:02:29.360> would

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
max level before you proceed why would

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.240 
max level before you proceed why would
they<00:02:29.750> do<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.170> knowing<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.860> there's<00:02:31.040> so

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
they do this knowing that there's so

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.979 
they do this knowing that there's so
many<00:02:31.489> DB's<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.299> are<00:02:32.390> gonna<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.780> in<00:02:32.900> the

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
many DB's that are gonna be up in the

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.220 
many DB's that are gonna be up in the
air<00:02:33.110> why<00:02:33.670> take<00:02:34.670> away<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.420> ability<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.900> hide

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
air why take away the ability to hide

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.800 
air why take away the ability to hide
from<00:02:36.470> them<00:02:36.650> it's<00:02:36.829> really<00:02:37.280> annoying

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
from them it's really annoying

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.449 
from them it's really annoying
it<00:02:38.989> makes<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.350> extremely<00:02:39.739> hard<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.190> stay<00:02:40.370> alive

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
it makes it extremely hard to stay alive

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.520 
it makes it extremely hard to stay alive
this<00:02:40.850> is<00:02:41.000> probably<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.540> lowest<00:02:41.720> KD<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.500> I

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
this is probably the lowest KD that I

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.379 
this is probably the lowest KD that I
have<00:02:42.829> in<00:02:43.040> any<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.489> call<00:02:43.699> duties<00:02:44.030> because

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
have in any of the call duties because

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.390 
have in any of the call duties because
of<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.930> think<00:02:45.380> my<00:02:45.560> candy<00:02:45.859> right<00:02:45.980> now<00:02:46.040> is

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
of that I think my candy right now is

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.900 
of that I think my candy right now is
like<00:02:46.579> a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
like a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.390 
like a

eat<00:03:30.500> in<00:03:30.680> my<00:03:30.860> opinion<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.310> easiest<00:03:31.340> way<00:03:31.910> to

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
eat in my opinion the easiest way to

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.850 
eat in my opinion the easiest way to
attain<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.570> warship<00:03:32.960> is<00:03:33.170> just<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.620> run<00:03:33.740> the

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
attain the warship is just to run the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.010 
attain the warship is just to run the
orbital<00:03:34.250> VSAT<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.970> then<00:03:35.480> combine<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:35.840> with

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
orbital VSAT and then combine it with

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.220 
orbital VSAT and then combine it with
the<00:03:36.230> warthog<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:37.670> wart<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.420> orbital<00:03:38.840> VSAT

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
the warthog the wart the orbital VSAT

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.930 
the warthog the wart the orbital VSAT
like<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.560> said<00:03:39.770> my<00:03:39.920> last<00:03:40.100> video<00:03:40.490> is<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.760> same

like I said my last video is the same

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.480 
like I said my last video is the same
exact<00:03:41.270> setup<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:41.660> ran<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.620> orbital<00:03:43.070> deset

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
exact setup I ran the orbital deset

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.790 
exact setup I ran the orbital deset
every<00:03:43.880> killed<00:03:44.240> that<00:03:45.050> your<00:03:45.260> teammates<00:03:45.590> get

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
while it's up it gives you ten points

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.260 
while it's up it gives you ten points

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
run the orbital heat the orbital V set

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
run the orbital heat the orbital V set
build<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.340> into<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.640> warthog<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.390> then<00:04:09.490> go<00:04:10.490> to

hopefully people don't start shooting it
down<00:04:13.550> too<00:04:13.820> often<00:04:14.150> because<00:04:14.390> these<00:04:14.540> high<00:04:14.750> kill

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
down too often because these high kill

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.599 
down too often because these high kill
streaks<00:04:15.320> are<00:04:15.500> extremely<00:04:16.160> hard<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.459> get

streaks are extremely hard to get

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.030 
streaks are extremely hard to get
they're<00:04:17.270> not<00:04:17.450> easy<00:04:17.660> whatsoever<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.620> anybody

extremely good hipfire and black ops 2

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.960

is no different the guns kill really

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.150 
is no different the guns kill really
fast<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.900> turn<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.110> corner<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.770> makes

fast and to turn a corner and it makes

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.560

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
it really hard to rush because they can

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.879 
it really hard to rush because they can
just<00:05:16.600> hold<00:05:17.020> down<00:05:17.259> that<00:05:17.289> trigger<00:05:17.710> and

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
just hold down that trigger and

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.129 
just hold down that trigger and
spray-and-pray<00:05:18.250> I<00:05:18.850> mean<00:05:19.509> I<00:05:19.600> did<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.780> little<00:05:20.020> bit

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
spray-and-pray I mean I did a little bit

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.749 
spray-and-pray I mean I did a little bit
in<00:05:20.199> my<00:05:20.289> last<00:05:20.500> video<00:05:20.710> using<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:20.979> mp7<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.610> laser

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
in my last video using the mp7 and laser

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.370 
in my last video using the mp7 and laser
sight<00:05:22.090> I<00:05:22.120> mean<00:05:22.360> that's<00:05:22.539> one<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:22.990> best<00:05:23.199> ways

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
sight I mean that's one of the best ways

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.890 
sight I mean that's one of the best ways
to<00:05:23.820> get<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:24.880> kill<00:05:25.150> if<00:05:25.300> you're<00:05:25.419> struggling<00:05:25.720> to

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
to get a kill if you're struggling to

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.300 
to get a kill if you're struggling to
get<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.080> kill<00:05:26.320> put<00:05:26.500> on<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.680> laser<00:05:26.860> sight<00:05:27.160> and
