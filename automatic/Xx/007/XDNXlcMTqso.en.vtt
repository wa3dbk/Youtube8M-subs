00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
first two layers or underwater

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.810 
first two layers or underwater
and<00:01:03.320> then<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:03.500> got<00:01:03.650> these<00:01:03.800> ones<00:01:04.040> looked<00:01:04.489> down

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.860 
you're going to do is just come out by
one<00:01:55.510> block<00:01:55.720> on<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:58.030> I've<00:01:58.240> traced<00:01:58.480> the<00:01:58.600> outline

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
one block on and I've traced the outline

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.510 
one block on and I've traced the outline
again<00:01:59.110> this<00:01:59.320> time<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.710> still<00:01:59.830> of<00:01:59.979> going<00:02:00.190> all

the way around you're just gonna go out

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.570 
the way around you're just gonna go out
by<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:03.790> block<00:02:04.650> just<00:02:05.650> like<00:02:05.830> this<00:02:08.369> keep<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.520> on

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
by one block just like this keep it on

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.630 
by one block just like this keep it on
the<00:02:09.670> back<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.030> just<00:02:10.320> on<00:02:11.320> this<00:02:11.470> back<00:02:11.680> part<00:02:12.310> here

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the back and just on this back part here

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.610 
the back and just on this back part here
which<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.540> going<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.750> build<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.080> motor<00:02:14.260> itself

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
which is going to build the motor itself

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.040 
which is going to build the motor itself
so<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:14.950> put<00:02:15.220> one<00:02:15.430> block<00:02:15.610> one<00:02:15.940> fence<00:02:16.480> here<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
so you put one block one fence here I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.190 
so you put one block one fence here I
come<00:02:17.920> down<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.790> go<00:02:18.940> out<00:02:19.090> like<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.239> really

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
easy just finished off doing the out

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.680 
easy just finished off doing the out
like<00:02:22.360> this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.870 

and<00:02:29.500> there<00:02:29.710> we<00:02:29.800> go<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:29.950> all<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.490> is<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.850> just

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
and there we go so all it is is just

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880 
and there we go so all it is is just
coming<00:02:31.330> out<00:02:31.390> by<00:02:31.600> one<00:02:31.810> more<00:02:32.020> block<00:02:32.230> around<00:02:32.800> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
coming out by one more block around the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.160 
coming out by one more block around the
outside<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:34.570> what<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.900> going<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.050> do

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
outside of this and what you going to do

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.390 
outside of this and what you going to do
now<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.680> fill<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.480> full<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:37.660> great<00:02:37.900> wall

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
now is just fill in full with great wall

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.040 
now is just fill in full with great wall
this<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.550> going<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.730> be<00:02:39.790> your<00:02:39.910> deck<00:02:40.120> area<00:02:40.510> okay

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050

this is going to be your deck area okay
so<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.320> next<00:02:41.500> bit<00:02:41.680> we're<00:02:41.800> going<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.040> do<00:02:42.190> is

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
so the next bit we're going to do is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.220 
so the next bit we're going to do is
just<00:02:42.520> going<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.730> build<00:02:43.480> up<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> back<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> little

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
just going to build up the back a little

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.870 
just going to build up the back a little
bit<00:02:44.320> more<00:02:45.420> across<00:02:46.420> there<00:02:47.610> knock<00:02:48.610> out<00:02:48.760> this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
bit more across there knock out this

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.460 
bit more across there knock out this
block<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.810> why<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.020> but<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> black

piece of wool just in here so this is
kind<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:54.030> motor<00:02:55.030> for<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.450> actual<00:02:55.980> propeller

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980

but this year and you just put fencing

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.530 
but this year and you just put fencing
around<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:50.170> outside<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:51.460> jump<00:04:51.760> on<00:04:51.970> one<00:04:52.360> high

around the outside and jump on one high
of<00:04:52.690> Melanson<00:04:53.170> 1<00:04:53.380> 2<00:04:53.800> 2<00:04:54.490> 3<00:04:54.870> 4<00:04:55.870> is<00:04:56.860> likely<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.250> same

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
of Melanson 1 2 2 3 4 is likely the same

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.670 
of Melanson 1 2 2 3 4 is likely the same
especially<00:04:59.169> with<00:04:59.290> lower<00:04:59.470> high

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
especially with lower high

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.050 
especially with lower high
that's<00:05:02.680> pretty<00:05:02.980> much<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.220> that's<00:05:03.460> pretty<00:05:03.880> much

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
that's pretty much it that's pretty much

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.140 
that's pretty much it that's pretty much
the<00:05:04.240> ship<00:05:04.420> really<00:05:05.020> really<00:05:05.200> easy<00:05:05.350> build<00:05:06.150> I'll

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
have to do is you have to place down

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.310 
have to do is you have to place down
just<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:51.010> over<00:05:51.160> here<00:05:51.430> just<00:05:51.750> place<00:05:52.750> down<00:05:52.960> two

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
just it over here just place down two

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.040 
just it over here just place down two
blocks<00:05:53.470> first<00:05:54.000> put<00:05:55.000> down<00:05:55.150> your<00:05:55.270> bed<00:05:55.420> muck<00:05:55.960> out

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
blocks first put down your bed muck out

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.240 
blocks first put down your bed muck out
these<00:05:56.230> two<00:05:56.380> blocks<00:05:56.560> and<00:05:56.770> then<00:05:56.860> put<00:05:57.010> it<00:05:57.100> down

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
these two blocks and then put it down

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.710 
these two blocks and then put it down
because<00:05:57.580> if<00:05:57.850> you<00:05:57.940> just<00:05:58.120> try<00:05:58.270> and<00:05:58.330> build<00:05:58.480> it<00:05:58.630> on

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
because if you just try and build it on

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.750 
because if you just try and build it on
top<00:05:59.100> it<00:06:00.100> doesn't<00:06:00.370> work

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
top it doesn't work

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.810 
top it doesn't work
since<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.600> way<00:06:01.720> we<00:06:01.870> don't<00:06:02.050> do<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:02.350> and<00:06:02.790> what<00:06:03.790> I

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
since the way we don't do it and what I

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.150 
since the way we don't do it and what I
do<00:06:03.940> is<00:06:04.180> I've<00:06:04.330> used<00:06:04.360> like<00:06:04.930> for<00:06:05.230> example<00:06:05.890> if

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
do is I've used like for example if

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.920 
do is I've used like for example if
these<00:06:06.280> were<00:06:06.400> chests<00:06:06.820> use<00:06:07.000> check<00:06:07.450> chests<00:06:07.840> on

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
these were chests use check chests on
