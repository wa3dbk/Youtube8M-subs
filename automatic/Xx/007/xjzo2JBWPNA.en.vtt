a device to count the the the luck
factor<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.190> mean<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.090> luck<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.570> matchups<00:00:43.559> and

stuff I think I pretty much well
slaughtered<00:00:45.989> him<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.530> mean<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:46.829> was

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
slaughtered him on that I mean there was

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
slaughtered him on that I mean there was
one<00:00:46.980> hand<00:00:47.340> where<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.640> I'd<00:00:47.820> raised<00:00:48.030> preflop<00:00:48.270> he

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
one hand where if I'd raised preflop he

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.639 
one hand where if I'd raised preflop he
would<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.809> had<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> call<00:00:49.200> because<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> way

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
would have had to call because the way

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.670 
would have had to call because the way

have<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> math<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
have to because if I like the math of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
have to because if I like the math of
being<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.390> ahead<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.810> ship<00:01:45.990> position<00:01:46.380> without

having had had to bluff at the beginning

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.620 
having had had to bluff at the beginning
was<00:01:49.229> enough<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.670> place<00:01:51.360> more

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
was enough to to actually place more

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.789 
was enough to to actually place more
stable<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.500> addressed

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
stable and I don't think I addressed

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.380 
stable and I don't think I addressed
that<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> might<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.909> played<00:01:54.060> poorly

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that I think I might have played poorly

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
that I think I might have played poorly
I'm<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.810> sure<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:56.009> when<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.310> comes<00:01:56.430> out

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I'm not sure you know when it comes out

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
I'm not sure you know when it comes out
on<00:01:56.640> TV<00:01:57.000> right<00:01:57.210> well<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> would<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.259> could

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
on TV right well I would know if I could

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.920 
on TV right well I would know if I could
look<00:01:58.920> back

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
look back

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.800 
look back
no<00:02:01.470> actually<00:02:01.950> I'm<00:02:02.850> trying<00:02:03.120> to<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.480> when

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
no actually I'm trying to think of when

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.500 
no actually I'm trying to think of when
they<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.350> decks<00:02:04.560> hitting<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.510> it's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
they see when the decks hitting you it's

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.260 
they see when the decks hitting you it's
a<00:02:06.870> lot<00:02:07.470> harder<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.759> you're<00:02:08.880> put<00:02:09.030> when

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
a lot harder to know if you're put when

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.940 
a lot harder to know if you're put when
the<00:02:09.300> deck<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.630> average<00:02:10.110> against<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.530> it's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the deck is average against you it's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.280 
the deck is average against you it's
much<00:02:11.130> easier<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:12.060> sit<00:02:12.240> back<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.600> say<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.960> played

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
much easier to sit back and say I played

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.690 
much easier to sit back and say I played
that<00:02:13.410> well<00:02:13.620> or<00:02:13.920> poorly<00:02:14.100> but<00:02:14.310> when<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.520> decks

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
that well or poorly but when the decks

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.070 
that well or poorly but when the decks
hitting<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.030> you're<00:02:15.300> wondering<00:02:15.570> did<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.930> get

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
hitting you you're wondering did I get

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.390 
hitting you you're wondering did I get
maximum<00:02:16.410> extraction<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.160> know<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
maximum extraction because you know the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.240 
maximum extraction because you know the
ripples<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.940> getting<00:02:18.810> those<00:02:18.960> big<00:02:19.140> hands<00:02:19.500> part

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
monsters I might have missed but you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.850 
monsters I might have missed but you
know<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.110> don't<00:02:28.200> know<00:02:28.350> what<00:02:28.440> your<00:02:28.560> opponent

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860
