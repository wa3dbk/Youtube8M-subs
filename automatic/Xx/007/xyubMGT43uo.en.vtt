00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
like this this is just for now for the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.710 
like this this is just for now for the
preview<00:00:33.489> it<00:00:33.700> so<00:00:33.910> let's<00:00:34.090> just<00:00:34.120> come<00:00:34.329> over<00:00:34.450> here

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
preview it so let's just come over here

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.780 
preview it so let's just come over here
to<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.050> file<00:00:35.290> I<00:00:35.470> have<00:00:35.710> so<00:00:36.160> when<00:00:36.309> you<00:00:36.399> save<00:00:36.610> your

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
to the file I have so when you save your

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.250 
to the file I have so when you save your
project<00:00:37.239> these<00:00:37.420> are<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.630> files<00:00:37.840> that<00:00:38.050> you'll

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
project these are the files that you'll

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.200 
project these are the files that you'll
probably<00:00:38.380> see<00:00:38.800> and<00:00:39.040> since<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.610> previews<00:00:40.030> are

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
probably see and since the previews are

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.970 
probably see and since the previews are
changing<00:00:40.750> you<00:00:40.930> might<00:00:41.110> have<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.320> little<00:00:41.680> bit<00:00:41.829> of

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
changing you might have a little bit of

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.860 
changing you might have a little bit of
a<00:00:42.070> different<00:00:42.460> file<00:00:42.790> structure<00:00:43.300> but<00:00:43.600> this<00:00:43.750> is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
a different file structure but this is

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.080 
a different file structure but this is
very<00:00:44.050> similar<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:44.800> this<00:00:45.040> is<00:00:45.160> my<00:00:45.280> edge<00:00:45.490> project

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
very similar so this is my edge project

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.510 
very similar so this is my edge project
and<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:46.780> is<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.020> HTML<00:00:47.560> document<00:00:47.740> that<00:00:48.160> holds

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
and this is the HTML document that holds

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.070 
and this is the HTML document that holds
it<00:00:48.640> it's<00:00:48.820> called<00:00:49.090> header<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.660> then<00:00:49.840> over<00:00:50.050> here

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
it it's called header and then over here

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.660 
it it's called header and then over here
we<00:00:50.410> have<00:00:50.560> something<00:00:50.860> called<00:00:51.310> header

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
we have something called header

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.090 
we have something called header
underscore<00:00:52.360> edge<00:00:52.570> so<00:00:53.110> if<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:53.680> named<00:00:53.920> your

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
underscore edge so if you named your

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.980 
underscore edge so if you named your
file<00:00:54.370> something<00:00:54.700> else<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.360> won't<00:00:55.540> be<00:00:55.690> header

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
file something else it won't be header

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.140 
file something else it won't be header
but<00:00:56.320> it'll<00:00:56.470> be<00:00:56.560> underscore<00:00:57.040> edge<00:00:57.310> and<00:00:57.670> we<00:00:57.970> can

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
but it'll be underscore edge and we can

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.550 
but it'll be underscore edge and we can
open<00:00:58.329> this<00:00:58.630> in<00:00:58.920> Dreamweaver<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:01.110> right<00:01:02.110> here

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
open this in Dreamweaver and right here

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.399 
open this in Dreamweaver and right here
is<00:01:02.710> our<00:01:03.130> JavaScript<00:01:03.790> file<00:01:04.000> now<00:01:04.659> you<00:01:04.689> see<00:01:05.170> over

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
is our JavaScript file now you see over

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
in an existing web page this is

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.680 
in an existing web page this is
WordPress's<00:01:38.610> 2011<00:01:39.610> theme<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:40.120> came<00:01:40.390> over<00:01:40.570> here

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
WordPress's 2011 theme I came over here

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.230 
WordPress's 2011 theme I came over here
and<00:01:41.080> I<00:01:41.170> created<00:01:41.500> myself<00:01:41.740> an<00:01:42.070> iframe<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:42.760> thought

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
and I created myself an iframe I thought

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.880 
and I created myself an iframe I thought
this<00:01:43.360> was<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.570> easiest<00:01:43.960> solution<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.680> saw

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
this was the easiest solution I saw

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.740 
this was the easiest solution I saw
other<00:01:45.130> workarounds<00:01:45.790> but<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.119> thought<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.570> was

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
other workarounds but I thought this was

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.660 
other workarounds but I thought this was
really<00:01:47.020> convenient<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.950> placed<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.400> in<00:01:48.549> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
really convenient and I placed it in the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.000 
really convenient and I placed it in the
header<00:01:48.850> PHP<00:01:49.479> file<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.020> right<00:01:50.740> here<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
header PHP file and right here is the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.920 
header PHP file and right here is the
iframe<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:52.000> maybe<00:01:52.180> I'll<00:01:52.330> post<00:01:52.540> this<00:01:52.659> on<00:01:52.840> my

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
iframe so maybe I'll post this on my
