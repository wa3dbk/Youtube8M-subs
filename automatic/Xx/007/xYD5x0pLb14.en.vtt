nothing<00:00:20.250> creative<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.789> thought<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.300> idea

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
nothing creative I thought of that idea

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.050 
nothing creative I thought of that idea
a<00:00:21.600> second<00:00:22.050> time<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.550> I'd<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:23.760> want<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
a second time and I'd really want to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.519 
a second time and I'd really want to
build<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.330> ghost<00:00:24.570> trickster<00:00:25.019> something<00:00:25.439> if

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529

build like ghost trickster something if
such<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.830> think<00:00:25.980> an<00:00:26.039> archetype<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.310> was

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
such I think an archetype that was

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.830 
such I think an archetype that was
around<00:00:26.730> Halloween<00:00:26.880> that's<00:00:27.359> pretty<00:00:27.539> much<00:00:27.599> go

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
around Halloween that's pretty much go

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.710 
around Halloween that's pretty much go

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
about anyone else on that I'm sure some

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.410 
about anyone else on that I'm sure some
people<00:02:14.370> had<00:02:14.610> some<00:02:14.730> better<00:02:14.879> luck<00:02:15.060> than<00:02:15.209> me<00:02:15.270> on

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
people had some better luck than me on

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.710 
people had some better luck than me on
that<00:02:15.599> see<00:02:16.500> light<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.040> destruction<00:02:17.720> another

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that see light of destruction another

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.500 
that see light of destruction another
one<00:02:18.930> reasons<00:02:19.379> why<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.560> 10

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
one reasons why this 10

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.600 
one reasons why this 10
more<00:02:20.720> expensive<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.409> it<00:02:21.500> has<00:02:21.650> like<00:02:22.400> all

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
more expensive is that it has like all

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.890 
more expensive is that it has like all
the<00:02:22.760> packs<00:02:22.970> are<00:02:23.120> really<00:02:23.360> good<00:02:23.510> in<00:02:23.659> this<00:02:23.810> 10<00:02:24.080> so

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
the packs are really good in this 10 so

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.850 
the packs are really good in this 10 so
ceiling<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.019> something<00:02:27.290> else<00:02:27.409> from<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.739> to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
ceiling get something else from it to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.059 
ceiling get something else from it to
hopefully<00:02:28.189> we<00:02:28.280> get<00:02:28.370> some<00:02:28.519> other<00:02:28.579> good<00:02:28.849> cards

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
hopefully we get some other good cards

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.869 
hopefully we get some other good cards
we<00:02:31.069> have<00:02:31.489> wait<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> minute<00:02:32.329> uh<00:02:33.489> do<00:02:34.489> we<00:02:34.579> not<00:02:34.730> get<00:02:34.819> a

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
we have wait a minute uh do we not get a

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.890 
we have wait a minute uh do we not get a
