 Run the roofing world to collect it 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.359
 create the world here we enter steve and gram 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.020
 we wait 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:58.480
 we wait where what we go and I regin so far 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:01:03.630
 turn off so here it looks like it already appeared 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.580
 again he did open up the world strikingly 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.970
 it's like at least to me 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.910
 will be able to use what to include 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.050
 example played mode can be changed 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.650

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.820
 olicity 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:26.560
 and here cypher arms are highlighted to us 0.0 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:31.869
 . by me you itachi and 503 604 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:35.800
 these figures, we do not need should be 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.780
 look, we have a figure again 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.590
 show how to go cancel or 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.290
 online game 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.030
 network game here will be the world 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.740
 local network and here are the numbers 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.630
 should introduce our soul to join 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:57.220
 us on the server but there is one big but 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.510
 it doesn't always work like that 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.630
 say this bug always works 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.780
 why because here are some numbers 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.920
 three-digit and double-digit it rolls 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.700
 but if that's 192. there are one hundred and sixty 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.060
 eight . 0 here just does not decide what 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.820
 stones connected and chocolate to her if u 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.220
 you have a single number then this is not 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.410
 give a ride no one can 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.690
 connect as you see to me nobody 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.519
