seen<00:00:10.379> my<00:00:10.469> other<00:00:10.530> video<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.250> actually<00:00:11.700> built<00:00:12.299> or

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
seen my other video I actually built or

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.390 
seen my other video I actually built or
I'm<00:00:12.690> actually<00:00:12.900> building<00:00:13.379> a<00:00:13.559> phantom<00:00:14.070> from<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I'm actually building a phantom from the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.000 
I'm actually building a phantom from the
ground<00:00:14.610> up<00:00:14.820> it's<00:00:15.089> actually<00:00:15.329> already<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.560> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
ground up it's actually already or I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.250 
ground up it's actually already or I
would<00:00:17.340> say<00:00:17.519> 90%<00:00:17.910> done<00:00:18.449> inside<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.019> case

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
would say 90% done inside this case

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.320 
would say 90% done inside this case
right<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:19.679> so<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.760> guys<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.029> some<00:00:21.150> other

there<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.820> my<00:00:32.940> GoPro<00:00:33.150> 3<00:00:33.540> Black<00:00:33.780> Edition<00:00:33.810> I'm

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
there with my GoPro 3 Black Edition I'm

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560 
there with my GoPro 3 Black Edition I'm
using<00:00:34.980> my<00:00:35.070> own<00:00:35.220> transmitter<00:00:35.820> system<00:00:36.060> futaba

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
using my own transmitter system futaba

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.530 
using my own transmitter system futaba
8fg<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.010> S<00:00:38.130> edition<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.790> 14<00:00:39.180> channel

8fg or the S edition with the 14 channel

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
8fg or the S edition with the 14 channel
so<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.810> actually<00:00:39.990> all<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.220> I<00:00:41.250> could

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so it's actually all on one I could

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.070 
so it's actually all on one I could
actually<00:00:41.610> control<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.300> tilt<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
actually control the tilt like and

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.110 
actually control the tilt like and
adjust<00:00:43.410> remote<00:00:43.980> gains<00:00:44.310> on<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> dial<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.060> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
adjust remote gains on the dial so if I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.480 
adjust remote gains on the dial so if I
have<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.900> I<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.380> pretty<00:00:46.560> much<00:00:46.650> put<00:00:47.400> the

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
have to and I can pretty much put the

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.610 
have to and I can pretty much put the

bunch<00:01:21.749> of<00:01:21.840> batteries<00:01:22.259> I'm<00:01:22.439> using<00:01:22.649> Thunder

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
bunch of batteries I'm using Thunder

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.609 
bunch of batteries I'm using Thunder
Power<00:01:23.189> batteries<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.479> let<00:01:25.200> me<00:01:25.259> start<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
Power batteries so let me start with the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.200 
Power batteries so let me start with the
batteries<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.609> can<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.969> stock

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
batteries you can use the stock

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.239 
batteries you can use the stock
batteries<00:01:27.719> or<00:01:27.869> any<00:01:28.020> three<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.469> it<00:01:28.560> 22<00:01:28.890> hundreds

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
batteries or any three so it 22 hundreds

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.010 
batteries or any three so it 22 hundreds
but<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.609> tons<00:01:29.819> of<00:01:29.909> power<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.600> actually

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
but these tons of power are actually

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.649 
but these tons of power are actually
2700<00:01:31.890> milliamp<00:01:32.189> hour<00:01:32.340> batteries<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.060> they're

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
2700 milliamp hour batteries and they're

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.770 
2700 milliamp hour batteries and they're
the<00:01:33.749> same<00:01:33.960> size<00:01:34.969> dimension<00:01:35.969> as<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.539> stock

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the same size dimension as the stock

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.779 
the same size dimension as the stock
battery<00:01:37.079> except<00:01:37.619> they're<00:01:37.799> about<00:01:38.039> 10<00:01:38.490> grams

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
battery except they're about 10 grams

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.660 
battery except they're about 10 grams
heavier<00:01:39.179> which<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.319> me<00:01:40.439> 10<00:01:41.039> grounds<00:01:41.249> heavier

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
heavier which for me 10 grounds heavier

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.590 
but you get another you know additional
500<00:01:44.579> milliamp<00:01:44.789> hour<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.389> can<00:01:45.479> get

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
500 milliamp hour so you can get

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.319 
500 milliamp hour so you can get
anywhere<00:01:45.929> from<00:01:46.259> 30<00:01:46.560> seconds<00:01:47.249> to<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.880> minute<00:01:47.939> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.819 
anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute to
miss<00:01:48.569> extra<00:01:48.899> flight<00:01:49.109> time<00:01:49.319> so<00:01:49.499> that's<00:01:49.649> pretty

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
miss extra flight time so that's pretty

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
miss extra flight time so that's pretty
cool<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.609> you<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.939> solder<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.359> your<00:01:51.509> own

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
cool but you have to solder on your own

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.059 
cool but you have to solder on your own
connector<00:01:52.020> very<00:01:52.350> easy<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:52.859> building

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
connector very easy if you're building

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.590 
connector very easy if you're building
your<00:01:53.280> own<00:01:53.310> phantom<00:01:53.759> from<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> ground<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.329> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
your own phantom from the ground up you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.489 
your own phantom from the ground up you
can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.859> my<00:01:56.729> custom<00:01:57.149> phantom<00:01:57.539> right<00:01:58.259> over

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
can see my custom phantom right over

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.219 
can see my custom phantom right over
here<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.179> pretty<00:02:00.179> much<00:02:00.270> started<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.139> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
here I pretty much started with just a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.169 
here I pretty much started with just a
bare<00:02:01.409> frame<00:02:01.740> fine<00:02:02.130> I'm<00:02:02.490> using<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.909> stock

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
bare frame fine I'm using the stock

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.690 
bare frame fine I'm using the stock
speed<00:02:04.109> controls<00:02:04.499> I'm<00:02:04.889> using<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.219> sunny<00:02:05.399> sky

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700

22:12
brushes<00:02:07.649> motors<00:02:07.979> right<00:02:08.100> here<00:02:08.250> these<00:02:08.760> are<00:02:08.820> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
brushes motors right here these are the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.510 
brushes motors right here these are the
900<00:02:09.510> kV<00:02:09.780> motors<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.619> work<00:02:10.800> very<00:02:11.070> good<00:02:11.310> with

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
900 kV motors they work very good with

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.320 
900 kV motors they work very good with
the<00:02:11.640> 9<00:02:11.790> inch<00:02:11.940> propellers<00:02:12.390> I'm<00:02:12.720> getting

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
the 9 inch propellers I'm getting

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.040 
the 9 inch propellers I'm getting
about<00:02:13.690> seven<00:02:14.650> minutes<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.920> flight<00:02:15.100> time<00:02:15.340> with

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
about seven minutes of flight time with

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.360 
about seven minutes of flight time with
the<00:02:17.050> Thunder<00:02:17.290> power<00:02:17.470> battery<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.070> that's<00:02:18.250> not

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the Thunder power battery so that's not

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.740 
the Thunder power battery so that's not
too<00:02:18.610> bad<00:02:18.790> at<00:02:19.090> all

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
too bad at all

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.380 
too bad at all
Motors<00:02:20.410> run<00:02:20.590> good<00:02:20.830> no<00:02:21.310> signs<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.790> any<00:02:21.970> problems

so<00:02:22.540> far<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:23.050> about<00:02:23.260> ten<00:02:23.560> flights<00:02:23.890> with<00:02:24.160> my

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
so far I have about ten flights with my

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.370 
so far I have about ten flights with my
phantom<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.540> actually<00:02:25.840> flying<00:02:26.080> pretty

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
phantom and it's actually flying pretty

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.570 
phantom and it's actually flying pretty
good<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:27.940> my<00:02:28.260> wireless<00:02:29.580> fpv

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
good so you can see my wireless fpv

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.760 
good so you can see my wireless fpv
goggles<00:02:31.000> set<00:02:31.210> up<00:02:31.360> i<00:02:31.600> can<00:02:31.750> see<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.560> goggles

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770

or have a hook to a monitor and see what

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.230 
or have a hook to a monitor and see what
the<00:02:35.590> gopro<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.100> seeing<00:02:36.400> when<00:02:36.910> I'm<00:02:37.060> actually

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
the gopro is seeing when I'm actually

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.440 
the gopro is seeing when I'm actually
flying<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:38.340> still<00:02:39.340> need<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.550> mount<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.820> iOS<00:02:40.240> D

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
flying I still need to mount the iOS D

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.220 
flying I still need to mount the iOS D
right<00:02:41.260> now<00:02:41.470> there's<00:02:42.330> no<00:02:43.330> space<00:02:43.630> left<00:02:43.840> inside

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
right now there's no space left inside

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
right now there's no space left inside
for<00:02:44.470> me<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:45.420> mount<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.780> iOS<00:02:47.170> D<00:02:47.350> because<00:02:47.830> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
for me to mount the iOS D because the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.760 
for me to mount the iOS D because the
PMU<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.120> GCU<00:02:49.510> from<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.140> zenmuse<00:02:50.440> takes

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
PMU and the GCU from the zenmuse takes

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.160 
PMU and the GCU from the zenmuse takes
up<00:02:50.920> all<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.130> space<00:02:51.250> inside<00:02:51.840> DJI<00:02:52.840> just

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
up all the space inside DJI just

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.340 
up all the space inside DJI just
released<00:02:53.500> an<00:02:53.650> upgrade<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.160> board<00:02:55.120> kit<00:02:55.870> or<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
released an upgrade a board kit or the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.340 
released an upgrade a board kit or the
phantom<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.370> using<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.420> know<00:02:58.510> well<00:02:59.140> actually

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
phantom so using you know well actually

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.949 
phantom so using you know well actually
that<00:02:59.560> board<00:02:59.830> will<00:02:59.980> eliminate<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.730> PMU<00:03:01.600> and

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
that board will eliminate the PMU and

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.480 
that board will eliminate the PMU and
the<00:03:02.080> GC<00:03:02.410> yuccas<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.800> all<00:03:02.950> built<00:03:03.280> into<00:03:03.400> the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
the GC yuccas is all built into the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.100 
the GC yuccas is all built into the
board<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.030> can<00:03:04.300> save<00:03:04.510> actually<00:03:04.840> those<00:03:05.080> two

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
board so I can save actually those two

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.130 
board so I can save actually those two
spaces<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:06.250> iOS<00:03:06.670> D<00:03:06.880> so<00:03:07.150> hopefully<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:08.050> will

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
spaces the iOS D so hopefully that will

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.980 
spaces the iOS D so hopefully that will
be<00:03:08.230> available<00:03:08.650> soon<00:03:09.120> from<00:03:10.120> what<00:03:10.300> I<00:03:10.330> heard<00:03:10.570> end

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
be available soon from what I heard end

produce this from EPP buddy or in

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.840 
produce this from EPP buddy or in
anywhere<00:03:35.410> over<00:03:35.620> China<00:03:35.920> they're<00:03:36.310> very<00:03:36.519> cheap

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
anywhere over China they're very cheap

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.330 
anywhere over China they're very cheap
they're<00:03:37.150> cheaper<00:03:37.600> alternative<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:39.070> stock

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
they're cheaper alternative to the stock

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.770 
they're cheaper alternative to the stock
motors<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.880> motors<00:03:40.420> actually<00:03:40.720> a

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
motors and motors actually a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.710 
motors and motors actually a
well-balanced<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.940> install<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.300> didn't

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
well-balanced I install it I didn't

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.820 
well-balanced I install it I didn't
balance<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.110> motors<00:03:44.380> or<00:03:44.470> anything<00:03:44.620> like<00:03:44.769> that

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
balance the motors or anything like that

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.370 
balance the motors or anything like that
and<00:03:45.220> these<00:03:45.340> motors<00:03:45.730> work<00:03:46.140> fantastic<00:03:47.170> I<00:03:47.260> was

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
and these motors work fantastic I was

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.790 
and these motors work fantastic I was
able<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.650> fly<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.950> Sun<00:03:48.489> with<00:03:49.269> no<00:03:49.600> jello<00:03:50.320> at<00:03:50.500> all

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
able to fly a Sun with no jello at all

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.080 
able to fly a Sun with no jello at all
so<00:03:51.040> that's<00:03:51.130> very<00:03:51.550> very<00:03:51.730> good

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
so that's very very good

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.270 
so that's very very good
so<00:03:52.690> I'll<00:03:53.050> show<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:53.650> can<00:03:53.800> also<00:03:53.920> fill<00:03:54.160> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
so I'll show you you can also fill the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.979 
so I'll show you you can also fill the
frame<00:03:54.550> I<00:03:54.610> just<00:03:54.910> pulling<00:03:55.239> up<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.480> motors<00:03:55.780> by

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
frame I just pulling up the motors by

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.170 
frame I just pulling up the motors by
itself<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.590> there's<00:03:56.709> very<00:03:57.280> very<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:57.640> to

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
itself and there's very very little to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.920 
itself and there's very very little to
no<00:03:58.360> vibration<00:03:59.820> these<00:04:00.820> props<00:04:01.180> are<00:04:01.360> actually<00:04:01.600> 9s

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
no vibration these props are actually 9s

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.600 
no vibration these props are actually 9s
propellers<00:04:02.380> so<00:04:02.590> there<00:04:02.769> are<00:04:02.890> one<00:04:03.160> inch<00:04:03.340> bigger

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
propellers so there are one inch bigger

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.790 
propellers so there are one inch bigger
than<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.300> stock<00:04:04.630> plastic<00:04:04.959> repellers<00:04:05.560> but

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
than a stock plastic repellers but

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.650 
than a stock plastic repellers but
they're<00:04:05.980> very<00:04:06.190> very<00:04:06.310> stiff<00:04:06.940> these<00:04:07.570> are

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
they're very very stiff these are

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.830 
they're very very stiff these are
actually<00:04:07.900> stiffer<00:04:08.530> than<00:04:09.390> majority<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.570> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
actually stiffer than majority of the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.810 
actually stiffer than majority of the
propeller<00:04:11.200> stuff<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.830> I've<00:04:11.980> tried<00:04:12.459> out<00:04:12.610> in

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
propeller stuff that I've tried out in

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.300 
propeller stuff that I've tried out in
the<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.600> know<00:04:13.720> in<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.900> past<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.500> they're

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
the you know in the past and they're

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.610 
the you know in the past and they're
thicker<00:04:15.940> they're<00:04:16.269> heavier<00:04:16.630> but<00:04:17.350> there<00:04:17.500> are

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
thicker they're heavier but there are

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.259 
thicker they're heavier but there are
lots<00:04:17.890> different<00:04:18.489> that's<00:04:18.580> what<00:04:18.729> you<00:04:18.850> want<00:04:19.120> when

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
lots different that's what you want when

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.000 
lots different that's what you want when
you're<00:04:19.390> carrying<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.840> lot<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:20.019> weight<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.500> when

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
you're carrying a lot of weight and when

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.230 
you're carrying a lot of weight and when
you're<00:04:21.160> shooting<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.760> know<00:04:21.850> any<00:04:22.030> kind<00:04:22.120> of

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
you're shooting you know any kind of

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.100 
you're shooting you know any kind of
video<00:04:22.510> is<00:04:22.720> if<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.650> props<00:04:23.950> will<00:04:24.130> flex<00:04:24.430> they

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
video is if the props will flex they

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.710 
video is if the props will flex they
transfer<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.260> vibration

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
transfer that vibration

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.760 
transfer that vibration
down<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.140> thing<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.440> get<00:04:27.560> this

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
down to the thing and you get this

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.970 
down to the thing and you get this
little<00:04:27.920> you<00:04:28.280> know<00:04:28.310> jello<00:04:28.790> effect<00:04:29.200> so<00:04:30.200> one

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
little you know jello effect so one

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.440 
little you know jello effect so one
thing<00:04:31.190> about<00:04:31.280> these<00:04:31.490> props<00:04:31.850> these<00:04:32.360> are

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
thing about these props these are

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.490 
thing about these props these are
actually<00:04:32.690> from<00:04:32.840> tear<00:04:33.140> it

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
actually from tear it

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.600 
actually from tear it
they're<00:04:34.240> claimed<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.570> be<00:04:35.750> well<00:04:36.410> balanced<00:04:37.130> but

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
they're claimed to be well balanced but

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.670 
they're claimed to be well balanced but
when<00:04:38.120> I<00:04:38.150> got<00:04:38.360> them<00:04:38.570> all<00:04:38.780> four<00:04:39.140> was<00:04:39.320> actually

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
when I got them all four was actually

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.660 
when I got them all four was actually
pretty<00:04:40.190> bad<00:04:40.670> so<00:04:41.390> be<00:04:42.290> prepared<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.830> use<00:04:43.010> you

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
pretty bad so be prepared to use you

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.730 
pretty bad so be prepared to use you
know<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.820> propeller<00:04:44.630> balancer<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.320> balance<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
know a propeller balancer to balance the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.840 
know a propeller balancer to balance the
propellers<00:04:46.220> because<00:04:46.430> you're<00:04:46.640> definitely

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
propellers because you're definitely

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.050 
propellers because you're definitely
going<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.150> need<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.510> if<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.290> want<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:49.060> vibration

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
going to need it if you want a vibration

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.360 
going to need it if you want a vibration
free<00:04:50.540> setup<00:04:51.260> but<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:51.980> know<00:04:52.100> like<00:04:52.250> all

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
free setup but you know like all

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.010 
free setup but you know like all
propellers<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:53.000> want<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.690> know<00:04:53.810> balance

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
propellers you want to you know balance

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.440 
propellers you want to you know balance
balance<00:04:54.680> it<00:04:54.830> in<00:04:54.950> a<00:04:55.040> way<00:04:55.160> so<00:04:55.190> it's<00:04:55.610> not<00:04:55.670> that<00:04:56.000> bad

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
balance it in a way so it's not that bad

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.410 
balance it in a way so it's not that bad
takes<00:04:57.440> about<00:04:57.560> ten<00:04:58.100> minutes<00:04:58.130> for<00:04:58.520> all<00:04:58.610> four<00:04:58.940> or

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
takes about ten minutes for all four or

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.000 
takes about ten minutes for all four or
you<00:04:59.900> can<00:05:00.020> even<00:05:00.110> do<00:05:00.290> it<00:05:00.320> quicker<00:05:00.650> if<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.920> just

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
you can even do it quicker if you just

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.800 
you can even do it quicker if you just
want<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.220> rush<00:05:01.400> through<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:02.240> can<00:05:02.270> see<00:05:02.390> here

in<00:05:40.250> this<00:05:40.370> gimbal<00:05:40.640> works<00:05:40.970> fantastic<00:05:41.930> I<00:05:42.140> got<00:05:42.590> the

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
in this gimbal works fantastic I got the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.490 
in this gimbal works fantastic I got the
LED<00:05:42.919> module<00:05:43.610> right<00:05:43.760> out<00:05:44.060> here<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:45.200> reason<00:05:45.440> why

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
LED module right out here the reason why

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.140 
LED module right out here the reason why
I<00:05:45.530> put<00:05:45.740> outside<00:05:46.070> for<00:05:46.280> now<00:05:46.400> is<00:05:46.550> because<00:05:46.850> I<00:05:46.940> want

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
I put outside for now is because I want

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.230 
I put outside for now is because I want
to<00:05:47.479> get<00:05:47.570> access<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.229> USB<00:05:48.680> port<00:05:49.010> so<00:05:49.640> you

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
to get access to the USB port so you

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.969 
to get access to the USB port so you
know<00:05:50.360> I'm<00:05:50.660> still<00:05:51.110> tweaking<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.680> gains<00:05:51.860> a

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
know I'm still tweaking the gains a

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.800 
know I'm still tweaking the gains a
little<00:05:52.220> bit<00:05:52.340> getting<00:05:52.550> it<00:05:52.700> to<00:05:52.820> fly<00:05:53.060> just<00:05:53.540> right

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
little bit getting it to fly just right

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.840 
little bit getting it to fly just right
so<00:05:54.410> by<00:05:54.530> having<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.860> USB<00:05:55.220> outside<00:05:55.550> it<00:05:55.669> makes

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
so by having the USB outside it makes

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.640 
so by having the USB outside it makes
X's<00:05:56.300> you<00:05:56.540> know<00:05:56.630> it<00:05:56.750> makes<00:05:56.900> programming<00:05:57.290> a

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
X's you know it makes programming a

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.090 
X's you know it makes programming a
little<00:05:57.890> bit<00:05:57.979> easier<00:05:58.690> now<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.720> tip<00:06:00.110> if<00:06:00.290> you<00:06:00.950> guys

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
little bit easier now a tip if you guys

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.740 
little bit easier now a tip if you guys

hooked up turn on your GoPro hit record

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.570 
hooked up turn on your GoPro hit record
then<00:06:09.560> you<00:06:09.680> plug<00:06:09.919> in<00:06:10.040> the<00:06:10.100> better<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.490> the

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
then you plug in the better to the

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.640 
then you plug in the better to the
Phantom<00:06:11.000> reason<00:06:11.690> why<00:06:11.810> is<00:06:11.870> because<00:06:11.990> if<00:06:12.470> you<00:06:12.530> do

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
Phantom reason why is because if you do

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.010 
Phantom reason why is because if you do
