and down the middle once again and see

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.780

if<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:30.900> work<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.610> I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
if that will work but as you can see I

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
if that will work but as you can see I
hit<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> bar<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.380> Weber<00:01:34.770> he

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
hit the bar but look at this Weber he

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.649 
hit the bar but look at this Weber he
picks<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> keeper<00:01:36.000> he<00:01:36.119> falls<00:01:36.390> down

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
picks it up and the keeper he falls down

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.929 
picks it up and the keeper he falls down
from<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.930> penalty<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.189> actually<00:01:38.430> managed

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
from the penalty so it actually managed

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.510 
from the penalty so it actually managed

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
now some really nice work for me but we

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.190

getting<00:01:44.970> past<00:01:45.149> 2<00:01:45.420> players<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.780> bit<00:01:45.990> lucky

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
getting past 2 players a bit lucky

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440 
getting past 2 players a bit lucky
they're<00:01:46.409> getting<00:01:46.770> past<00:01:46.979> 1/3<00:01:47.340> getting<00:01:48.240> past

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
they're getting past 1/3 getting past

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.380 
they're getting past 1/3 getting past
another<00:01:48.869> player<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.759> had<00:01:51.119> went

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
another player and if this one had went

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.120 
another player and if this one had went
in<00:01:51.540> first<00:01:51.990> time<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.500> had<00:01:52.649> been<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> perfect

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
in first time it had been the perfect

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
in first time it had been the perfect
compilation<00:01:53.820> gold<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.299> unfortunately<00:01:54.960> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
compilation gold but unfortunately it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
compilation gold but unfortunately it
hit<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> post<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> leftover

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
hit the post so it will be a leftover

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.200 
hit the post so it will be a leftover
most<00:01:58.020> likely<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.979> yeah<00:01:59.130> he<00:01:59.340> ragequit<00:01:59.549> after

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
most likely but yeah he ragequit after

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.270 
most likely but yeah he ragequit after
that<00:02:00.390> goal<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.840> I'll<00:02:01.469> go<00:02:01.619> into<00:02:01.770> my<00:02:01.920> second

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that goal and I'll go into my second

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.639 
that goal and I'll go into my second
game<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.909> tournament<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.469> fall

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
game of this tournament and I think fall

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.109 
game of this tournament and I think fall
let's<00:02:04.890> keep<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.399> with<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.700> same<00:02:05.850> side

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
let's keep going with the same side

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
let's keep going with the same side
because<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.719> did<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> great<00:02:07.140> job<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> last

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
because they did a great job in the last

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
two players here but in the end I

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.259

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
the fourth penalty of this episode so we

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.619 
the fourth penalty of this episode so we
thought<00:02:45.769> CJ<00:02:46.769> he<00:02:46.950> steps<00:02:47.250> up<00:02:47.400> once<00:02:47.790> again<00:02:47.969> and<00:02:48.359> he

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
thought CJ he steps up once again and he

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.959 
thought CJ he steps up once again and he
hits<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> left<00:02:49.859> it<00:02:50.069> hits<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> post<00:02:50.639> and

I'm<00:02:51.120> up<00:02:51.299> one<00:02:51.750> nil<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:53.340> then<00:02:53.549> keep<00:02:54.180> doing<00:02:54.569> some

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
I'm up one nil and then keep doing some

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.809 
I'm up one nil and then keep doing some
flicks<00:02:55.500> here<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.859> that<00:02:56.010> was<00:02:56.189> quite<00:02:56.400> lucky<00:02:56.699> I

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
flicks here and that was quite lucky I

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.309 
flicks here and that was quite lucky I
got<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.209> ball<00:02:57.389> there<00:02:57.599> but<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.049> end<00:02:58.169> he

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
got the ball there but in the end he

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.250 
got the ball there but in the end he
managed<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:59.400> tackle<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.449> towards<00:03:00.810> me<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.139> I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
managed to to tackle it towards me and I

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.800 
managed to to tackle it towards me and I
went<00:03:01.439> another<00:03:02.310> penalty<00:03:02.730> yeah<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.629> insane

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
went another penalty yeah it's insane

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
went another penalty yeah it's insane
how<00:03:04.199> many<00:03:04.260> penalties<00:03:04.949> you<00:03:05.010> actually<00:03:05.400> get<00:03:05.609> when

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
how many penalties you actually get when

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.209 
how many penalties you actually get when
you<00:03:05.879> do<00:03:06.030> skin<00:03:06.299> moves<00:03:06.510> inside<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.109> box<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.739> it

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
you do skin moves inside the box it it

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.280 
you do skin moves inside the box it it
seems<00:03:08.609> like<00:03:08.790> if<00:03:08.939> you<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.269> get<00:03:09.629> it<00:03:09.750> hit<00:03:09.930> you

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
seems like if you just get it hit you

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.860 
seems like if you just get it hit you
you<00:03:10.709> win<00:03:10.949> the<00:03:11.069> penalty<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.609> CC<00:03:12.239> he<00:03:12.449> hits<00:03:12.719> it

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
you win the penalty and CC he hits it

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.959 
you win the penalty and CC he hits it
straight<00:03:13.109> into<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.439> top<00:03:13.620> corner<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.159> it's<00:03:14.730> a

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
straight into the top corner and it's a

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.140 
straight into the top corner and it's a
two<00:03:15.209> nil<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:16.139> then<00:03:16.889> quite<00:03:17.729> a<00:03:17.759> lot<00:03:17.909> getting

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
two nil and then quite a lot getting

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.849 
two nil and then quite a lot getting
balls<00:03:18.419> we<00:03:18.599> will<00:03:18.689> be<00:03:18.810> taking<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.229> keyboard<00:03:19.620> out

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859
