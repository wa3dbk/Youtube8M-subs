base<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.270> very<00:00:36.660> important<00:00:36.930> thing<00:00:37.050> about

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
base so very important thing about

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.830 
base so very important thing about
risotto<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.910> use<00:00:39.180> olive<00:00:39.360> oil<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
risotto is that you use olive oil if you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.590 
risotto is that you use olive oil if you
use<00:00:39.960> butter<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.559> finding<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> butter<00:00:41.600> flavors

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
use butter as finding the butter flavors

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.010 
use butter as finding the butter flavors
the<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.469> cook<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.800> too<00:00:43.980> too<00:00:44.399> hot<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.789> goes<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the you cook it too too hot it goes to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
the you cook it too too hot it goes to
the<00:00:46.110> burns<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.489> unpleasant

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the burns you get that so unpleasant

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.930 
the burns you get that so unpleasant
flavor<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.289> gonna<00:00:49.440> soften<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> onion<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

a<00:00:51.059> bit<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> celery<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> most<00:00:52.289> important

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
a bit of celery so the most important

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
a bit of celery so the most important
thing<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:52.860> risotto<00:00:53.480> in<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.719> book<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
thing about risotto in my book is that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.459 
thing about risotto in my book is that
you<00:00:55.410> actually<00:00:55.770> cook<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.969> rice<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:58.260> about

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you actually cook the rice for about

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.260 
you actually cook the rice for about
five<00:00:58.739> minutes<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> point<00:00:59.789> being<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
five minutes so the point being that the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970 
five minutes so the point being that the
the<00:01:00.390> rice<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> same<00:01:01.469> temperature<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the rice is the same temperature the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310 
the rice is the same temperature the
stock<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.210> when<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> stock<00:01:04.290> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
stock so when this when the stock is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.090 
stock so when this when the stock is
added<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> rice<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.339> absorbs<00:01:06.150> evenly<00:01:07.100> Bo
