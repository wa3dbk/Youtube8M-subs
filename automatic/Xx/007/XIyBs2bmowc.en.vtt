obvious<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.629> shrimp<00:00:39.960> two<00:00:40.140> ways

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
obvious going to be shrimp two ways

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
obvious going to be shrimp two ways
we're<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> start<00:00:41.040> off<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> cream

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
we're going to start off with the cream

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.549 
we're going to start off with the cream
cheese<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.239> always<00:00:42.989> put<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> cream<00:00:43.500> cheese

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
cheese I always put the cream cheese

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
cheese I always put the cream cheese
first<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.430> either<00:00:44.670> put<00:00:45.030> put<00:00:45.420> other

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
first so I can either put put other

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.619

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
things on top of it so it keeps me a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.740 
things on top of it so it keeps me a
little<00:00:48.840> bit<00:00:48.960> cleaner<00:00:49.200> than<00:00:49.440> normal<00:00:52.640> sometimes

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that have been peeled you can leave the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.690 
that have been peeled you can leave the
skin<00:01:04.800> on<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.220> slightly<00:01:05.460> different

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
skin on for a slightly different

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.260 
skin on for a slightly different
presentation<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.310> over<00:01:08.550> is<00:01:08.640> pushed<00:01:09.150> down

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
presentation and it over is pushed down

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.870 
presentation and it over is pushed down
the<00:01:09.420> edge<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.800> roll<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> over<00:01:13.670> now<00:01:14.670> this

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the edge and then roll it over now this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.760 
the edge and then roll it over now this
is<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> bigger<00:01:15.360> role<00:01:15.600> than<00:01:15.660> normal<00:01:16.170> hence<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
is a bigger role than normal hence the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.640 
is a bigger role than normal hence the

just<00:02:30.760> cut<00:02:31.000> them<00:02:31.060> into<00:02:31.239> even<00:02:31.629> bite<00:02:31.810> size<00:02:32.049> pieces

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080
