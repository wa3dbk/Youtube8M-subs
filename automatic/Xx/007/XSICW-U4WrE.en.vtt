00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.439
 the old rule of the king plays retinue for 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.210
 queens true even not on 100 and on all 300 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.099
 percent project beauty in motion 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.329
 created specifically for Diana 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.249
 cherry 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.039
 but in order for it to be brilliant 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.289
 the dancer could demonstrate 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.229
 There are no limits to Iran 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:29.159
 true 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.959
 really hurried to be on one key 

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.100
 in one breath with full dedication 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.359
 more politicians work 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:36.649
 and it's great that it's not easy 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.499
 partners to real man knights 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:41.519
 dedicated and beautiful 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.049
 lady such as alexander sergeev and 

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.540
 example of baymuradov 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.220
 as estimated because it was replaced by 742 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.400
 projects 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.990
 in a new place there were players who 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.210
 It has developed because of the high price 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.250
 surely we are yet another time and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.990
 hardly a patient 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.710
 Yes, I myself first from the beginning of the year 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.380
 prices 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.590
 almost two years ago 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.400
 only 7 of them alexei ratmansky system 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.430
 decided to implement this pricing project 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.720
 wooden nature scientists here they are 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.330
 have chosen 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.610
 anyway in non-residential men 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.190
 never arrived 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.430
 that's 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.790
 we started working very gradually 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.820
 long 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.680
 through the actions began to work 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.140
 delivered marked another and therefore not 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.390
 brought created america 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.660
 in USA 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.060
 I will soon Chkalovsky where 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.500
 this project has come true 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.390
 so that with his son Sergey Danilian 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.480
 airlines 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.810
 but its saturday night who live it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.210
 torbami million 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.160
 such data collection 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.560
 but this year already 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.600
 There is a convention that today 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.270
 also turned here for example 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.450
 but he drove him to the golden mask you need 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.640
 also entered also she and got a refund 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.249
 pass not only diana and 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.729
 sales start in Kiev are also interested 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.680
 golden mask is nice in the future 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.520
 the project is unconditional according to the title 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.190
 very beautiful and very difficult 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.890
 uneasy in every sense 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.340
 what was for you 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.730
 the greatest difficulty 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.360
 but the most difficult is of course the price for 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.389
 of course music and how 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:30.799
 color choreography 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.229
 Alexey 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.839
 ratmansky always puts 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.129
 on every corner in the composition 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.059
 complicated 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.199
 but he always starts 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.459
 some other 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.889
 quote 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.119
 and the first complicated things then if not 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:45.819
 forgives something 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.810
 I do something that has changed 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.569
 that's 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.879
 the world difficult but in this that is supposedly 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.139
 we canâ€™t lay it down yet 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.949
 much evyuk choreography 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:58.850
 put 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.210
 just above the text which lags behind the target 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.710
 says the news 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.839
 in general in this work 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.269
 In Kiev, by and large, just words 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.950
 who admitted that we are German and we play 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.629
 and we have to get hit 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.629
 what happened here and there turned out to be false 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.439
 project initially international first 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.059
 he was seen by the American public 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:23.809
 and only later than ours 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:25.099
 somewhere to speak 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.389
 census takers and 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.349
 such a grow due to a woman 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.920
 thought published 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.480
 depends very well understood by all new 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.099
 affairs 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.299
 and digital cameras are scams mans 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.389
 process over very well classic 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.949
 music but it's natural that colleagues who 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.210
 are looking to meet 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.099
 during the performance because 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.759
 can safely say that 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.049
 protesters 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.849
 minuses 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.379
 oao kamaz replaces i believe that by the 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.139
 challenging at home precisely here at the end 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:56.549
 Martha 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.180
 Abroad how everything became to me because everything 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.879
 such people are not familiar with people 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.650
 he was not going to marry the page 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.899
 with every fights 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.709
 and people don't know what exactly to vote 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.259
 process 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:10.729
 no fluff no feather what to meet
