00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
more strength but still we had the night

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.499

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.630 
surprised i'll talk a bit more about how
exactly<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.650> worked<00:02:16.800> out<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.130> me<00:02:17.190> but<00:02:17.430> i

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
were on penalties but still that's not

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.190 
were on penalties but still that's not
bad<00:02:25.610> lost<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.210> think<00:02:27.390> I'm<00:02:27.660> yeah<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.080> think

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
bad lost to I think I'm yeah I think

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.110 
bad lost to I think I'm yeah I think
that<00:02:28.440> yeah<00:02:28.680> 14<00:02:29.070> lost<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.550> her<00:02:29.610> fingers<00:02:29.760> how<00:02:30.030> it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that yeah 14 lost to her fingers how it

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640 
that yeah 14 lost to her fingers how it
was<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.540> one<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.810> them<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.140> disconnection

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
was and one of them was a disconnection

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.340 
was and one of them was a disconnection
as<00:02:31.920> well<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:33.330> wasn't<00:02:33.720> bad<00:02:33.840> at<00:02:34.020> all<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
as well so it wasn't bad at all that

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.290 
as well so it wasn't bad at all that
only<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.980> downsides<00:02:35.490> was<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.820> lack<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.000> pace

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
only like downsides was the lack of pace

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.900 
only like downsides was the lack of pace
with<00:02:36.570> van<00:02:37.320> Buyten<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> lack<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.610> pace

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
with van Buyten and the lack of pace

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.430 
with van Buyten and the lack of pace
with<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.180> confirmer<00:02:39.540> because<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.930> confirm<00:02:40.290> was

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
with a confirmer because a confirm was

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.680 
with a confirmer because a confirm was
was<00:02:40.770> an<00:02:40.890> absolute<00:02:41.400> tank<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.880> he<00:02:42.300> scored<00:02:42.600> a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
was an absolute tank like he scored a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.210 
was an absolute tank like he scored a
few<00:02:42.900> decent<00:02:43.170> goals<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.740> he's<00:02:43.860> got<00:02:43.980> great

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
few decent goals that he's got great

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.040 
few decent goals that he's got great
shot<00:02:44.550> power<00:02:44.760> some<00:02:45.270> great<00:02:45.480> strength<00:02:45.870> he's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
shot power some great strength he's

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.350 
shot power some great strength he's
actually<00:02:46.290> not<00:02:46.650> too<00:02:46.890> bad<00:02:46.920> but<00:02:47.160> he's<00:02:47.460> so<00:02:47.790> slow<00:02:48.120> it

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
actually not too bad but he's so slow it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000 
actually not too bad but he's so slow it
was<00:02:48.690> almost<00:02:48.900> impossible<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.830> myself

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010

was almost impossible to get myself
through<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.940> found<00:02:51.330> myself<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.720> trying

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
team at above 80 pace but still it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.030 
team at above 80 pace but still it
wasn't<00:03:33.270> half<00:03:33.570> bad<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.050> then<00:03:34.410> we<00:03:34.500> had<00:03:34.620> joe<00:03:34.800> hart

and go as well and giving us the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.660 
and go as well and giving us the
chemistry<00:03:37.620> with<00:03:37.770> company<00:03:38.190> he<00:03:38.370> had<00:03:38.460> full

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
chemistry with company he had full

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.220 
chemistry with company he had full
chemistry<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.510> course<00:03:39.750> he<00:03:39.870> still<00:03:40.110> is

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
chemistry and of course he still is

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.500 
chemistry and of course he still is
relatively<00:03:40.650> decent<00:03:41.100> with<00:03:41.220> for<00:03:41.490> chem<00:03:41.760> too<00:03:42.060> so

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
relatively decent with for chem too so

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.330 
relatively decent with for chem too so
he<00:03:42.630> wasn't<00:03:42.870> bad<00:03:43.140> at<00:03:43.350> all<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.160> end

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
he wasn't bad at all but that is the end

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.640 
he wasn't bad at all but that is the end
