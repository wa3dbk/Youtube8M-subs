00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.259
 to look trending not necessarily 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.629
 we have to put all the trends to 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.280
 the time in this video I'll share 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:15.370
 how to look trendy in this autumn-winter 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.410
 for a more modern look, use different 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.439
 shades of gray gives that accent 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.960
 minimalist and combine it with black the 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.110
 tap trending we are going to add it with 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.689
 the necklace always looks pretty 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.509
 basic and simple we can do them 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.489
 highlight with small details like me 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.880
 I'm doing it here with this necklace 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.670
 I really like the combination of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.489
 black and gray but we can not forget that 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.859
 we can give that tone that touch 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.749
 fun with the shoes and not 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.210
 we necessarily have to wear shoes 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.149
 of heel to see us trendy we can use 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.960
 low shoes but that are totally 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.129
 different than what we are 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.129
 used to seeing 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.930
 Autumn is one of my seasons 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.680
 favorites of the year because it allows you to use 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.680
 textures layers without dying of the cold and 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.580
 without dying of the heat the climate is only 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.770
 perfect I love color and style 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.230
 of this maxi skirt makes the look 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.320
 complete look completely modern 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.200
 Sophisticated and more trendy I like it 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.810
 very much the bohemian style and always a 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.520
 hat is my personal touch to make 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.520
 a totally different look 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.720
 soft natural and discreet colors 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.900
 like the nude they help us to see us super 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.440
 sophisticated and trendy without seeing us 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.770
 overloaded 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.110
 look for blouses or clothes that have that 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.110
 totally different detail for 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.390
 make it look modern but the same 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.280
 you can complement it with some 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.030
 jeans that we all have a jean in the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.310
 club but these jeans are beautiful 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.690
 keep it in the same range of colors and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.540
 that way you'll wear a cleaner look that 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.490
 they found these looks more trendy not 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.890
 forget that in the information box 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.230
 I leave the details of the clothes that 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.180
 I am using here this is a 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.090
