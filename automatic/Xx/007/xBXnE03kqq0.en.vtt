juice<00:04:56.990> in<00:04:57.260> this<00:04:57.440> case<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.830> think<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.100> do<00:04:58.160> up<00:04:58.370> with

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
juice in this case I think I do up with

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.200 
juice in this case I think I do up with
about<00:04:58.730> one<00:04:58.940> more<00:04:59.180> ounce<00:05:00.850> because<00:05:01.850> with<00:05:02.090> the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
about one more ounce because with the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.940 
about one more ounce because with the
