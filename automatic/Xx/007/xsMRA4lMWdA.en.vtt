00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.280 

let's<00:01:45.990> try<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.230> again<00:01:47.870> usually<00:01:48.870> works

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
let's try this again usually works

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.320 
let's try this again usually works
within<00:01:49.500> five<00:01:49.740> seconds<00:01:50.190> but<00:01:51.860> searching<00:01:53.150> do<00:01:54.150> one

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
within five seconds but searching do one

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.930 
within five seconds but searching do one
and<00:01:54.450> two<00:01:54.830> all<00:01:55.830> right<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.490> our<00:01:56.640> device

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940

and two all right there is our device
and<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.300> will<00:01:57.420> automatically<00:01:57.930> connect<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.440> it

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
and it will automatically connect to it
