00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.979 

one<00:00:00.210> of<00:00:00.299> the<00:00:00.359> problem<00:00:00.570> that<00:00:00.630> we<00:00:00.719> have<00:00:00.870> on

00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:00.989 
one of the problem that we have on

00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:02.590 
one of the problem that we have on
YouTube<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.439> that<00:00:01.589> instead<00:00:01.860> of<00:00:01.920> discussing

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:02.600 
YouTube is that instead of discussing

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.690 
YouTube is that instead of discussing
policy<00:00:03.600> we<00:00:03.840> end<00:00:04.020> up<00:00:04.200> discussing<00:00:04.670> ideology<00:00:05.670> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
policy we end up discussing ideology a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.849 
policy we end up discussing ideology a
lot<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.299> instead<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.049> for<00:00:07.259> instance<00:00:07.350> talking

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
lot so instead of for instance talking

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.160 
lot so instead of for instance talking
about<00:00:08.069> which<00:00:08.429> guns<00:00:08.760> should<00:00:09.300> be<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:09.750> sale<00:00:09.929> to

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
about which guns should be for sale to

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.930 
about which guns should be for sale to
private<00:00:10.650> citizens<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:11.219> end<00:00:11.490> up<00:00:11.610> talking<00:00:11.730> about

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
private citizens we end up talking about

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.150 
private citizens we end up talking about
the<00:00:12.120> abstract<00:00:12.269> idea<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.259> gun<00:00:13.500> control<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the abstract idea of gun control and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.740 
the abstract idea of gun control and
that<00:00:14.490> seems<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:14.880> problematic<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.509> me<00:00:15.570> when

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
that seems really problematic to me when

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.660 
that seems really problematic to me when
it<00:00:15.839> comes<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> big<00:00:16.560> civilizational<00:00:17.369> problem

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it comes to a big civilizational problem

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.010 
it comes to a big civilizational problem
like<00:00:17.820> climate<00:00:18.180> change<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.930> never

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
like climate change because we can never

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500 
like climate change because we can never
get<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> policy<00:00:20.279> conversation<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.330> long

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
get to the policy conversation as long

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.359 
get to the policy conversation as long
as<00:00:21.689> we're<00:00:21.840> stuck<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.410> an<00:00:22.890> ideological

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
as we're stuck in an ideological

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.550 
as we're stuck in an ideological
conversation<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.420> really<00:00:24.449> appreciated<00:00:25.199> your

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
conversation I really appreciated your

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.070 
conversation I really appreciated your
robust<00:00:26.369> defense<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:27.180> climate<00:00:27.630> science<00:00:27.960> in

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
robust defense of climate science in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.169 
robust defense of climate science in
your<00:00:28.199> speech<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.670> your<00:00:29.670> embrace<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
your speech and your embrace of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.790 
your speech and your embrace of
executive<00:00:30.660> action<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> end<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> think

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
executive action but in the end I think

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.400 
executive action but in the end I think
the<00:00:32.009> real<00:00:32.309> work<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:33.300> probably<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.200> have

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the real work is probably going to have

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.250 
the real work is probably going to have
to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.710> done<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.880> Congress<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.050> my

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to be done with Congress and so my

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.389 
to be done with Congress and so my
question<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> both<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.600> YouTube<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
question is is both about YouTube the

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.950 
question is is both about YouTube the
discourse<00:00:41.399> among<00:00:41.969> individuals<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:42.780> also

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
discourse among individuals but also

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
discourse among individuals but also
discourse<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> Congress<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:44.969> past

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
discourse in Congress how do we get past

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.630 
discourse in Congress how do we get past
that<00:00:45.510> ideological<00:00:46.110> rigidity<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that ideological rigidity and that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.389 
that ideological rigidity and that
divisive<00:00:48.180> nosov<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> policy<00:00:49.770> discussion<00:00:50.250> about

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
divisive nosov a policy discussion about

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.520 
divisive nosov a policy discussion about
what's<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.480> most<00:00:51.719> efficient<00:00:52.320> way

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
what's actually the most efficient way

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.360 
what's actually the most efficient way
to<00:00:53.160> reduce<00:00:53.489> our<00:00:53.699> carbon<00:00:53.850> emissions<00:00:54.110> well<00:00:55.370> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to reduce our carbon emissions well a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
to reduce our carbon emissions well a
couple<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.210> things<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.539> we've<00:00:57.690> tried<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> do

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
couple of things that we've tried to do

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.639 
couple of things that we've tried to do
is<00:00:59.420> first<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.690> focus<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.260> things<00:01:01.559> that

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
is first of all focus on things that

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.650 
is first of all focus on things that
even<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.460> there<00:01:02.579> wasn't<00:01:02.760> climate<00:01:03.210> change<00:01:03.449> we

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
even if there wasn't climate change we

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
even if there wasn't climate change we
should<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.170> anyway<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.129> has<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
should want to do anyway but has the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
should want to do anyway but has the
added<00:01:06.210> benefit<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.630> reducing<00:01:07.110> carbon<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
added benefit of reducing carbon in the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.330 
added benefit of reducing carbon in the
atmosphere<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.760> example<00:01:09.210> when<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:10.340> worked

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
atmosphere so for example when we worked

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.850 
atmosphere so for example when we worked
with<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.420> automakers<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:14.720> through<00:01:15.860> voluntary

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
with the automakers to through voluntary

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.670 
with the automakers to through voluntary
action<00:01:18.619> implement<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:21.259> doubling<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.470> fuel

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
action implement a doubling of fuel

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.539 
action implement a doubling of fuel
efficiency<00:01:22.799> standards<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.759> cars<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:25.549> that

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
efficiency standards on cars that that

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.649 
efficiency standards on cars that that
is<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> huge<00:01:27.930> impact<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:29.659> carbon

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
is going to have a huge impact on carbon

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.929 
is going to have a huge impact on carbon
in<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> atmosphere<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.799> also<00:01:31.979> good

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
in the atmosphere but it's also good

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.340 
in the atmosphere but it's also good
economics<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.990> means<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
economics because it means that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.840 
economics because it means that
consumers<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.979> saving<00:01:35.280> money<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> pump

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
consumers are saving money at the pump

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.899 
consumers are saving money at the pump
it<00:01:36.390> means<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.040> US<00:01:38.040> automakers<00:01:38.729> are

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
it means that US automakers are

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.810 
it means that US automakers are
competing<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:40.170> foreign<00:01:41.070> automakers<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
competing with foreign automakers that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.039 
competing with foreign automakers that
previously<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.600> had<00:01:43.070> had<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> corner<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
previously it had had a corner on the

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.510 
previously it had had a corner on the
the<00:01:46.049> small<00:01:46.560> car<00:01:46.799> market<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the small car market or the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.899 
the small car market or the
fuel-efficient<00:01:48.180> car<00:01:48.450> market<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.490> that's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
fuel-efficient car market and so that's

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.950 
fuel-efficient car market and so that's
gotten<00:01:51.509> us<00:01:51.689> part<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.649> way<00:01:52.740> there<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.750> next

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
gotten us part of the way there the next

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.300 
gotten us part of the way there the next
steps<00:01:55.380> though<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.130> more

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
steps though are going to be more

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.999 
steps though are going to be more
challenging<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.320> some<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.860> is

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
challenging and you know some of this is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.609 
challenging and you know some of this is
ideological<00:01:59.729> some<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.270> economic<00:02:00.619> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
ideological some of it is economic and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.190 
ideological some of it is economic and
and<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.490> partisan<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> tell
