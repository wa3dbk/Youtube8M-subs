00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.719 
want to do it that way or whatever but
as<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.560> saying<00:01:43.619> guys<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.220> laser<00:01:44.640> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
as I was saying guys this laser is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
as I was saying guys this laser is
actually<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.270> bad<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.020> blast<00:01:46.290> radius

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
actually not that bad the blast radius

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.920 
actually not that bad the blast radius
on<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.340> small<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.329> pretty<00:01:48.659> fun

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
on it is very small but it's pretty fun

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.039 
on it is very small but it's pretty fun
to<00:01:48.960> use<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.530> general<00:01:50.540> because<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.899> so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to use in general because it's just so

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.960 
to use in general because it's just so
different<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:53.130> acts<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.700> rail<00:01:53.939> gun

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
different it acts like a rail gun

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.260 
different it acts like a rail gun
honestly<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> use<00:01:57.030> any

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
honestly because it's if you use any

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.760 
honestly because it's if you use any
other<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.780> use<00:01:57.960> other<00:01:58.110> lasers<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
other if you use other lasers in the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.800 
other if you use other lasers in the
pre-sequel<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.610> about<00:01:59.880> acts<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.540> but

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
pre-sequel that's about acts like but

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
pre-sequel that's about acts like but
this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.170> rocket<00:02:01.619> launcher<00:02:01.920> which<00:02:02.070> doesn't

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
this is a rocket launcher which doesn't

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.999 
this is a rocket launcher which doesn't
make<00:02:02.640> sense<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.140> as<00:02:04.140> far<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.439> builds<00:02:04.829> go

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
make sense at all as far as builds go

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.370 
make sense at all as far as builds go
for<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.399> weapon<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.780> works<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.140> well<00:02:07.229> on

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
for this weapon it works really well on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.020 
for this weapon it works really well on
a<00:02:07.560> raelia<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.129> some<00:02:08.280> reason<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.789> don't<00:02:08.849> know

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
a raelia for some reason I don't know

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.479 
a raelia for some reason I don't know
why<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.629> does<00:02:10.220> claptrap<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.370> can

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
why but just does claptrap you can

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.530 
why but just does claptrap you can
probably<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.879> away<00:02:11.970> with<00:02:12.060> using<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.450> on

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
probably get away with using it on

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.970 
probably get away with using it on
collapse

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
collapse

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.649 
collapse
for<00:02:13.190> sure<00:02:13.370> with<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.909> being<00:02:14.090> an<00:02:14.150> explosive

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
for sure with it being an explosive

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.009 
for sure with it being an explosive
weapon<00:02:16.209> that's<00:02:17.209> really<00:02:17.420> all<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.569> think<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
weapon that's really all I can think of

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.539 
weapon that's really all I can think of
it's<00:02:18.230> honestly<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.799> fun<00:02:18.980> weapon<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.370> use

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
it's honestly just a fun weapon to use

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.820 
it's honestly just a fun weapon to use
so<00:02:19.909> if<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.569> have<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.870> gun<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.470> know<00:02:21.590> exactly

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
so if you have this gun you know exactly

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.080 
so if you have this gun you know exactly
what<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:22.069> talking<00:02:22.099> about<00:02:22.519> if<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.760> don't<00:02:22.970> have

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
what I'm talking about if you don't have

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.809 
what I'm talking about if you don't have
this<00:02:23.209> gun<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.590> want<00:02:24.769> to<00:02:24.860> get<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.099> just<00:02:25.310> try

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
this gun and you want to get it just try

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
I will say so myself that is pretty fun

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.920 
I will say so myself that is pretty fun
to<00:02:29.930> use<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.040> anyway<00:02:31.760> guys<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.390> know<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.900> a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
to use so anyway guys I know this is a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.770 
to use so anyway guys I know this is a
really<00:02:33.110> short<00:02:33.319> video<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:34.400> anyway<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.569> don't

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
really short video but anyway I don't

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.390 
really short video but anyway I don't
feel<00:02:35.989> like<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.200> gameplay<00:02:36.410> roll<00:02:36.769> on<00:02:36.890> from<00:02:37.129> here

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400
