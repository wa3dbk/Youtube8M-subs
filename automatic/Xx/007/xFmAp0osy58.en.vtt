00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 and hello everyone with you max and today we 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.440
 consider a couple of traps playing 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.730
 minecraft 146 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:18.270
 since it is the newest logical and 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:23.460
 for well, more precisely this is the first trap we 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.330
 go here we see the lever and I could push 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.480
 it moves us down and we fall 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:35.910
 standard trap probably many people know 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.079
 here probably very many know founded 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.270
 on so 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.270
 but she is very simple here 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.620
 the lever he holds more precisely 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.690
 Redstone is underway here here here 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.500
 here we special disguised it 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.320
 half block 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.510
 here it is a half block passage here from 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.150
 station up here and activates both pistons 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:06.320
 when you press the lever, the pistons are activated 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:12.190
 everything is very logical and pushing you in 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.190
 pit and so next following 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.780
 The following mechanism is based on the fact that 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.710
 presses against the wall and starts you 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:28.549
 plop on when 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.710
 runs for you presses but mine and 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.130
 there is a memory mechanism here for us 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.920
 no need here is a memory mechanism here 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.090
 this repeater is all based on it 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.950
 what he lets what he lets 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.679
 all over again 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 all electricity well if you can 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.140
 call all electricity and therefore 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.460
 seizes well that is based on 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.240
 something that presses you and no longer 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.450
 lets go and in order to again 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.039
 and renew this to piston for 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.649
 moved back you only need 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.280
 put back a repeater break 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.250
 put it back so here well 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.590
 the next one seems to me the best 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.860
 at all 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.940
 also use x-ray for this it for 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.360
 not to pay attention here 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.840
 fall here and as we see here 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.780
 I will immediately show the chest because under this 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.670
 dynamite and then i will show my name 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.049
 everything becomes on the fact that when you are so 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.359
 Here opens the chest is just 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.209
 impossible even if you break this 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.190
 that 's still can not be open so 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.890
 everything becomes about what is here 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.440
 the torch he feeds here these here 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.120
 this one here is sara stone and if you break 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.920
 more precisely to stop the current that is to stop 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.810
 stock if we break this chain 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.000
 redstone is activated here it is a chain 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.570
 and comes here here here and straight to 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.299
 dynamite 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.160
 and it will mostly undermine me for such 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.900
 rats trap like this we don't need 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.480
 so let me show you how 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.680
 it works 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.200
 they broke this one 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.540
 we break it here now hop hissed something 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.410
 oh-oh-oh hissed, this one, that's all 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.410
 will break now 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.840
 and here 's something like that so we probably 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.120
 need to get out I can show in 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.410
 principle how it is built is built very 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:43.069
 it's just the first time did just say 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:46.430
 this idea is not mine then ideas of one dude he 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.799
 also sits on youtube channel and does 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.970
 reviews that is on the youtube site and does 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.970
 Minecraft Reviews 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.209
 So 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.609
 in principle, we can make a standard 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:05.510
 shut up room retirement can do 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:05.510
 standard room in three blocks height 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.380
 So 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:20.470
 so here 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:23.660
 shut up you stupid cow okay by the way 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.390
 I will also link to his channel under 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.480
 video where to download x-ray I'll post it too 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.540
 under the video is more accurate nodus ordinary 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.500
 build someone else needs it for version 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.890
 minecraft 146 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.840
 so we built our room and immediately 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.440
 I will say what you need for not a few 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.750
 blocks 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:51.040
 from our little chest put 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:55.090
 here these are the things you need to put 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:00.370
 about well over the top of the block 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:04.270
 hold 1 volume shut the corners do 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.150
 sanda in general on not very low and here 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.700
 we spend time that it is necessary to lower 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.990
 immediately down here and doing here 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.510
 memory mechanism it is made very 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.820
 I just don't know how for you on 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:23.230
 applied to do just really easy for you 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.170
 super cow when useful here for me 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:30.450
 it's done just awfully just put 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.450
 so I did not put it there somehow 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.639
 so here 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:42.010
 it is also possible one block closer 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.010
 so here 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:51.900
 yes that's living with your hands here and spend 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.000
 here here here and here it is done 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.070
 very easy to fuck got a cow 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.070
 climb well so 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:10.830
 now let the table down here and here 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:14.289
 us it is activated but so no not so 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:19.500
 yes not so we will need 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:23.760
 yes we need the mechanism but 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.090
 too piss me off the cow and so the mechanism 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.410
 on the dam itself put foki we will be here 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:34.010
 this debt can be removed and so here 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.010
 as we see 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:42.639
 Yes, we have already put so we will 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.159
 here hop hop so he went out but as soon as 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.860
 interrupted goal turns out like this hop 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:50.340
 now we even put everything super 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:57.960
 closer we are so far away 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:57.960
 so here so here and so here 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.780
 but 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.300
 under the floor you can lay 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.819
 dynamite I do nâ€™t know what you want to poison 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.659
 I don't know him what will come next 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:20.139
 minecraft 1 4 7 and here it can 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:23.889
 be probably dynamite so 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:27.939
 oh what's not at all got there and next 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:30.699
 minecraft 147 will probably be dynamite and 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:32.960
 that's basically everything when you break here 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:37.090
 this one is a block 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.090
 so no not this one 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:45.030
 Mistakes are small excuse me when you 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.030
 break 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:52.540
 when you break this one block 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.330
 immediately when the circuit is interrupted and 

00:07:52.540 --> 00:08:01.510
 another redstone chain is activated and this 

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:04.820
 the chain goes to your tell it to your 

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:07.310
 to your room and do not know what you have 

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:10.450
 there will be something else under the floor of dynamite 

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.450
 be poison your 

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.270
 your offender 

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.190
 not all thanks for watching 

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.720
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.720
 thank you all bye
