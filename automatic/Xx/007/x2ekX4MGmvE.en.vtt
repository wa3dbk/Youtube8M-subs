00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
no I've got six so I guess I could use

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.049 
no I've got six so I guess I could use
the<00:01:01.540> money<00:01:01.600> hexacopter<00:01:02.170> as<00:01:02.290> well<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.850> we<00:01:03.940> go

the money hexacopter as well here we go
a<00:01:04.239> stack<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.809> them<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.520> you<00:01:06.520> know<00:01:06.640> probably

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
a stack of them and you know probably

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.090 
a stack of them and you know probably
all<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.780> expert<00:01:08.320> mini<00:01:08.560> quad<00:01:08.710> flies<00:01:08.890> are

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
all the expert mini quad flies are

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.800 
all the expert mini quad flies are
saying<00:01:09.280> why<00:01:09.460> would<00:01:09.759> you<00:01:09.850> want<00:01:10.060> prop<00:01:10.390> guards<00:01:10.750> I

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
saying why would you want prop guards I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.359 
saying why would you want prop guards I
mean<00:01:10.960> that's<00:01:11.170> an<00:01:11.350> inner<00:01:11.560> thing<00:01:11.799> isn't<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.159> and

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
mean that's an inner thing isn't it and

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.569 
mean that's an inner thing isn't it and
yeah<00:01:12.909> it's<00:01:13.420> an<00:01:13.570> anything<00:01:14.110> but<00:01:14.320> there<00:01:15.070> are<00:01:15.250> I

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
yeah it's an anything but there are I

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.370 
yeah it's an anything but there are I
can<00:01:15.850> think<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.119> applications<00:01:16.899> for<00:01:17.049> having

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
can think of applications for having

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.230 
can think of applications for having
these<00:01:17.530> if<00:01:17.649> you<00:01:17.740> want<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.070> demonstrate<00:01:18.280> mini

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
these if you want to demonstrate mini

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.879 
these if you want to demonstrate mini
quad<00:01:19.450> say<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:19.689> a<00:01:19.749> school<00:01:20.049> environment<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:20.859> you

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:20.889 
quad say in a school environment so you

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:23.730 
quad say in a school environment so you
know<00:01:21.340> around<00:01:21.759> children<00:01:22.270> in<00:01:22.719> you<00:01:23.109> know<00:01:23.259> just<00:01:23.619> in

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
know around children in you know just in

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.109 
know around children in you know just in
case<00:01:23.889> something<00:01:24.100> goes<00:01:24.249> wrong<00:01:24.429> a<00:01:24.490> prop<00:01:24.880> shroud

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
case something goes wrong a prop shroud

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.969 
case something goes wrong a prop shroud
is<00:01:25.270> gonna<00:01:25.420> mean<00:01:25.929> there's<00:01:26.139> no<00:01:26.259> angry<00:01:26.679> props

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
is gonna mean there's no angry props

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.190 
is gonna mean there's no angry props
near<00:01:27.579> children<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.600> can<00:01:28.719> be<00:01:28.810> really<00:01:29.049> handy

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
near children and it can be really handy

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.809 
near children and it can be really handy
if<00:01:29.439> you<00:01:29.530> really<00:01:29.770> actually<00:01:29.859> just<00:01:30.159> want<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.340> show

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
if you really actually just want to show

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.370 
if you really actually just want to show
people<00:01:30.850> how<00:01:31.179> these<00:01:31.329> things<00:01:31.509> work<00:01:31.719> and<00:01:31.959> in

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
people how these things work and in

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.199 
people how these things work and in
theory<00:01:32.889> in<00:01:33.219> theory<00:01:33.639> would<00:01:33.759> improve<00:01:34.060> the

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
theory in theory would improve the

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.419 
theory in theory would improve the
performance<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.840> flight<00:01:35.829> times<00:01:36.069> because

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
performance to the flight times because

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.039 
performance to the flight times because
one<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.209> reasons<00:01:37.569> propellers<00:01:37.959> are

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
one of the reasons propellers are

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.959 
one of the reasons propellers are
inefficient<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.709> that<00:01:39.189> when<00:01:39.609> they<00:01:39.729> spin

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
inefficient is that when they spin

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.639 
inefficient is that when they spin
around<00:01:39.999> ear<00:01:40.479> gets<00:01:40.719> thrown<00:01:40.899> towards<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.409> tips

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
around ear gets thrown towards the tips

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.010 
around ear gets thrown towards the tips
and<00:01:41.859> we<00:01:42.609> end<00:01:42.759> up<00:01:42.819> with<00:01:42.939> high<00:01:43.479> pressure<00:01:43.689> on<00:01:43.929> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
and we end up with high pressure on the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.209 
and we end up with high pressure on the
bottom<00:01:44.170> low<00:01:44.380> pressure<00:01:44.619> on<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.829> top<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.069> get<00:01:45.159> a

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
bottom low pressure on the top you get a

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.649 
bottom low pressure on the top you get a
big<00:01:45.340> tip<00:01:45.520> vortex<00:01:45.850> spinning<00:01:46.299> off<00:01:46.389> the<00:01:46.479> end<00:01:46.630> of

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
big tip vortex spinning off the end of

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.559 
big tip vortex spinning off the end of
the<00:01:46.719> prop<00:01:47.289> tips<00:01:47.529> which<00:01:48.009> creates<00:01:48.340> drag<00:01:48.700> if<00:01:49.359> you

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
the prop tips which creates drag if you

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.599 
the prop tips which creates drag if you
put<00:01:49.719> them<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:49.899> a<00:01:49.959> duct<00:01:50.229> then<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.069> high

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
put them in a duct then the high

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.309 
put them in a duct then the high
pressure<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.090> low<00:01:52.149> pressure<00:01:52.240> areas<00:01:52.899> cannot

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
pressure and low pressure areas cannot

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.349 
pressure and low pressure areas cannot
so<00:01:53.799> easily<00:01:54.039> meet<00:01:54.549> each<00:01:54.700> other<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.119> get

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
so easily meet each other so you get

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.330 
so easily meet each other so you get
more<00:01:55.509> lift<00:01:55.749> and<00:01:55.959> you<00:01:56.319> get<00:01:56.439> this<00:01:56.529> drag<00:01:56.799> so<00:01:57.249> you

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
more lift and you get this drag so you

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.969 
more lift and you get this drag so you
get<00:01:57.459> more<00:01:57.609> flight<00:01:57.789> time<00:01:58.560> I'll<00:01:59.560> see<00:01:59.770> if<00:01:59.859> their

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
get more flight time I'll see if their

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.349 
get more flight time I'll see if their
works<00:02:00.159> I'll<00:02:00.459> put<00:02:00.579> these<00:02:00.670> on<00:02:00.819> a<00:02:00.849> mini<00:02:01.029> quad<00:02:01.179> and

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
works I'll put these on a mini quad and

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.629 
works I'll put these on a mini quad and
try<00:02:01.599> them<00:02:01.779> out<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.380> here<00:02:02.560> this<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:02.979> really<00:02:03.490> good

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639 
try them out so here this is really good

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.149 
try them out so here this is really good
and<00:02:04.240> if<00:02:05.139> you're<00:02:05.439> out<00:02:05.560> there<00:02:05.590> if<00:02:05.829> you've<00:02:05.979> got<00:02:06.130> a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
and if you're out there if you've got a

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.739

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
the test now I got some other stuff in

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.100 
the test now I got some other stuff in
here<00:02:24.579> too<00:02:24.819> which<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.959> these<00:02:26.049> things

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
here too which and one of these things

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.280 
here too which and one of these things
in<00:02:26.500> here<00:02:26.530> really<00:02:26.890> really<00:02:27.250> excites<00:02:28.239> me

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
in here really really excites me

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
what did I do with it here it is so

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.300 
what did I do with it here it is so
we're<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.269> back<00:02:31.360> out<00:02:31.569> for<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:31.780> bench

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
we're on the back out for the bench

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.380 
we're on the back out for the bench
notice<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.430> can<00:02:33.549> see<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.790> bench<00:02:33.969> today<00:02:34.180> isn't

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
notice you can see the bench today isn't

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.220 
notice you can see the bench today isn't
it<00:02:34.510> wonderful

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
it wonderful

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.399 
it wonderful
yeah<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:37.180> actually<00:02:37.569> something<00:02:38.290> that's

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
yeah this is actually something that's

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.250 
yeah this is actually something that's
long<00:02:38.859> long<00:02:39.159> overdue<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.599> what<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.019> well

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
long long overdue and what is it well

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.140 
long long overdue and what is it well

according to the notes that were sent
with<00:02:43.239> us<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.349> an<00:02:44.469> xt60<00:02:45.159> plug<00:02:45.489> holder<00:02:45.849> these

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
with us it is an xt60 plug holder these

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.599 
with us it is an xt60 plug holder these
fit<00:02:46.299> over<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.689> m3<00:02:47.200> standard<00:02:47.739> hick<00:02:48.069> standoffs

on the frame and the power plug should

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.339 
on the frame and the power plug should
just<00:02:51.909> snap<00:02:52.090> them<00:02:52.269> makes<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.840> bit<00:02:52.959> tired<00:02:53.170> even

as we all know anyone who's got a mini
quad<00:02:56.980> knows<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:58.060> it's<00:02:58.629> very<00:02:58.900> easy<00:02:59.109> for<00:02:59.260> the

battery connector to get caught in the
prop<00:03:01.659> and<00:03:01.810> then<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.019> get<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.230> chop<00:03:02.709> on<00:03:02.799> your

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.399 
prop and then you get a chop on your
battery<00:03:03.639> leads<00:03:03.909> and<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.540> just<00:03:04.689> a<00:03:04.780> terrible

battery leads and it's just a terrible
anyway<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:05.859> this<00:03:06.099> should<00:03:06.459> which<00:03:06.909> effectively

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
anyway so this should which effectively

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.229 
anyway so this should which effectively

going<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.349> do<00:04:08.500> some<00:04:08.680> simple<00:04:08.919> tests<00:04:09.159> I'm<00:04:09.370> gonna

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
going to do some simple tests I'm gonna

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.890 
going to do some simple tests I'm gonna
see<00:04:09.760> whether<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.060> actually<00:04:10.120> does<00:04:10.750> increase

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
see whether it actually does increase

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.509 
see whether it actually does increase
the<00:04:11.109> flight<00:04:11.440> times<00:04:11.650> which<00:04:11.889> I<00:04:12.040> think<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.430> will

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
the flight times which I think it will

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.099 
the flight times which I think it will
cause<00:04:12.760> despite<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.209> way<00:04:13.329> give<00:04:13.629> that<00:04:13.780> proper

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
cause despite the way give that proper

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.710 
cause despite the way give that proper
fishin<00:04:14.349> see<00:04:14.470> I'm<00:04:14.560> talking<00:04:14.799> about<00:04:14.829> and
