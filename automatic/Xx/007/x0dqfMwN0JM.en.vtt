specific question sent in to me
I<00:00:12.740> have<00:00:13.740> never<00:00:13.980> been<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.639> great<00:00:14.940> fan<00:00:15.209> of<00:00:15.240> writing

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
I have never been a great fan of writing

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.109 
I have never been a great fan of writing
scripts<00:00:16.260> when<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> started<00:00:17.280> my<00:00:17.460> Toastmasters

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
scripts when I started my Toastmasters

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.970 
scripts when I started my Toastmasters
journey<00:00:18.360> but<00:00:19.019> something<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.679> learned

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
journey but something that I learned

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.509 
journey but something that I learned
later<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.849> is<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.779> writing<00:00:22.349> rewriting<00:00:23.009> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
later on is that writing rewriting and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.150 
later on is that writing rewriting and
rewriting<00:00:23.580> your<00:00:24.480> script<00:00:24.869> adds<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.830> lot<00:00:26.099> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
rewriting your script adds a lot of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.339 
rewriting your script adds a lot of
value<00:00:26.429> if<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.179> do<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> right<00:00:27.810> way

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
value if you do it the right way

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.019 
value if you do it the right way
now<00:00:29.070> let<00:00:29.250> me<00:00:29.310> talk<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.699> about<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
now let me talk to you about the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.060 
now let me talk to you about the
advantages<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.779> writing<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.439> rewriting<00:00:31.619> your

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
advantages of writing and rewriting your

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.910 
advantages of writing and rewriting your
script<00:00:32.430> when<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.510> write<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.530> script

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
script when you write your script

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.850 
script when you write your script
initially<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.559> economic

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
initially you don't have the economic

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
initially you don't have the economic
words<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.700> you're<00:00:38.879> looking<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:39.809> what

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
words that you're looking for now what

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.459 
words that you're looking for now what
this<00:00:40.260> means<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:41.000> there<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.059> words<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.989> your

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
this means is there are words in your

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.650 
this means is there are words in your
script<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.129> don't<00:00:44.430> add<00:00:44.670> value<00:00:44.699> to<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.390> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
script that don't add value to what you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.930 
script that don't add value to what you
were<00:00:45.809> saying<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.559> your<00:00:46.739> first<00:00:47.010> objective<00:00:47.280> has

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
were saying so your first objective has

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
were saying so your first objective has
to<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.530> taking<00:00:49.530> away<00:00:49.770> these<00:00:49.949> words<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:51.800> making

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to be taking away these words and making

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.720 
to be taking away these words and making
sure<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.570> condense<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.769> have<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
sure that you condense it and have the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.170 
sure that you condense it and have the
words<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:58.019> really<00:00:58.530> add<00:00:58.680> value<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.550> your

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
words that really add value to your

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.460 
words that really add value to your
speech<00:01:00.590> only<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.519> script<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:04.080> second

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
speech only in your script the second

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.429 
speech only in your script the second
part<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.060> optimizing<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.330> sentences<00:01:07.110> now

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
part is optimizing your sentences now

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.490 
part is optimizing your sentences now
sometimes<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:09.000> same<00:01:09.330> sentence<00:01:09.930> could<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
sometimes the same sentence could be

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.969 
sometimes the same sentence could be
written<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.520> many<00:01:11.729> ways<00:01:12.229> but<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.920> two

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
written in so many ways but one or two

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.469 
written in so many ways but one or two
of<00:01:14.670> such<00:01:15.330> ways<00:01:15.680> might<00:01:16.680> convey<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.060> feeling

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
of such ways might convey the feeling

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.950 
of such ways might convey the feeling
the<00:01:19.409> message<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> emotion<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.810> you're

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the message the emotion that you're

the message the emotion that you're
talking<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.350> much<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.490> effective<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:25.640> two

economic<00:01:29.909> words<00:01:30.540> take<00:01:31.290> away<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.280> words<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
economic words take away the words that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090 
economic words take away the words that
don't<00:01:33.060> add<00:01:33.270> value<00:01:33.380> every<00:01:34.380> time<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.710> rewrite

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
don't add value every time you rewrite

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.679 
don't add value every time you rewrite
your<00:01:35.280> speech<00:01:36.020> later<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.320> look<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:37.979> optimizing

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
your speech later on look at optimizing

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.139 
your speech later on look at optimizing
sentences<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.710> means<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.250> play<00:01:41.820> around

today is I focus on the sentence when I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.249 
today is I focus on the sentence when I
write<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> speech

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
write a speech

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.350 
write a speech
I<00:02:01.289> take<00:02:02.159> sentence<00:02:02.700> by<00:02:02.880> sentence<00:02:03.530> rephrase<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
I take sentence by sentence rephrase and

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.600 
I take sentence by sentence rephrase and
change<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.630> combination<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> words<00:02:07.799> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
change the combination of the words to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.480 
change the combination of the words to
make<00:02:08.820> sure<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.479> each<00:02:09.810> sentence<00:02:10.590> packs<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
make sure that each sentence packs a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.990 
make sure that each sentence packs a
punch<00:02:11.690> when<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> focus<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.290> sentence

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
punch when you focus on the sentence

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.080 
punch when you focus on the sentence
your<00:02:15.000> script<00:02:15.420> for

into place so how many times should you
write<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.790> rewrite<00:02:19.000> it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
write and rewrite it

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.869 
write and rewrite it
well<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:21.000> generally<00:02:22.000> take<00:02:22.440> 15<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.950> 20<00:02:24.310> scripts

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879
