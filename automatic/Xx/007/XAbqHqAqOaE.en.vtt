00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.609
 Welcome cashier back 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.980
 we'll do one together today 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.340
 Wintry pumpkin problems would 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.340
 important 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.460
 namely, such a small new 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.230
 you could say favorite recipe 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.570
 Austrian team but I know that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.610
 only a few days ago but almost since then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.470
 every day there is a capital problem 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.450
 We do not eat anything on the table 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.120
 tasty and just needed the stuff like 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.090
 it just does not work that way in winter anyway 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 there and yes we can in any case 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.700
 let them tell you a try 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.430
 he will know with her how to do that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.200
 runs directly with the questions because 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.390
 We make for our three recipes 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 maximum of three frogs maximum of three to 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.460
 few days 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.540
 thus there is simply much faster 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.390
 and tastes better and only have 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.110
 Advantages of how I am and what I need 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.769
 we hear 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.720
 exactly we need 3 kg on 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:18.290
 best to ride a nice tire when you are 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:20.100
 can not impress this 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:37.740
 need 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:39.510
 you see through the camera like that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.070
 we can even have a good concept there 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.600
 save an ingredient 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.670
 which of course we still necessarily 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.250
 need is our wonderful 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.760
 tenant 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.370
 a nice if you mixas now 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.900
 usually works the same way yes 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.630
 if you just without the key 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.490
 his first in difficult cases 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.320
 the map changes a bit of water 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:11.360
 and then it should also complain in the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:13.450
 post first three boxes first 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.450
 in it 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:35.080
 that's good the rest is 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.720
 maybe what is now if 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.250
 in addition to this monastery he went and 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.250
 once free him from the shell 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:07.739
 I have a piece of the job 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:04:10.770
 completely works by the way, even if 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.790
 it does not yet know a video now 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.340
 the displayed pumpkin pie made that 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.630
 is a bit the same recipe 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.630
 cake is also very very very good 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.000
 then I just need a pity the 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.419
 partly still the back is which 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.419
 told 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.259
 provide inspiration bowls guys but I think 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.250
 but of course you yourself now 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:37.870
 want to do then do more right now 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.870
 that's why not necessarily the two 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:09.009
 and then we are already done or 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:09.009
 So paid appropriately 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:26.990
 rugby is among the 60 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.630
 The water comes from said small ones 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:46.470
 to read standing writing again 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.470
 if that's too fast now maybe 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.539
 recipes or of course 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:09.999
 To be cordial high means Europe's back 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.789
 nowadays they are wondering why I did 

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:14.289
 not 37 bananas and two kilo dates 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:16.949
 The day is as well as the very slow 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.949
 oldest insider
