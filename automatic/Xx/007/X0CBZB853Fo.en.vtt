so<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.230> topic<00:00:18.560> is<00:00:18.650> digital<00:00:19.100> pathology<00:00:19.640> and<00:00:19.790> so

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
so the topic is digital pathology and so

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.300 
so the topic is digital pathology and so
how<00:00:21.170> many<00:00:21.320> people<00:00:21.619> have<00:00:21.770> any<00:00:21.980> medical

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
how many people have any medical

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.730 
how many people have any medical
background<00:00:22.430> at<00:00:22.910> all<00:00:23.200> raise<00:00:24.200> of<00:00:24.349> hands

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
background at all raise of hands

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.740 
background at all raise of hands
okay<00:00:25.250> that's<00:00:25.400> six<00:00:25.700> that's<00:00:25.820> better<00:00:26.450> than<00:00:26.600> most

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
okay that's six that's better than most

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.910 
okay that's six that's better than most
places<00:00:27.010> so<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:28.940> so<00:00:29.480> pathology<00:00:30.110> is<00:00:30.320> you<00:00:30.710> have<00:00:30.890> a

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
places so so so pathology is you have a

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.740 
places so so so pathology is you have a
tissue<00:00:31.220> sample<00:00:31.490> from<00:00:31.820> your<00:00:31.970> body<00:00:32.150> you<00:00:32.390> slice

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
tissue sample from your body you slice

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.720 
tissue sample from your body you slice
it<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:33.050> gross<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:33.830> stain<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.190> you<00:00:34.489> put<00:00:34.670> it

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
it you gross it you stain it you put it

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.700 
it you gross it you stain it you put it
on<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:34.879> glass<00:00:35.000> slide<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:36.379> put<00:00:36.559> on<00:00:36.620> a

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
on a glass slide and you put on a

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.500 
on a glass slide and you put on a
microscope<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.520> see<00:00:37.580> something<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:38.449> you

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
microscope you see something and you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.780 
microscope you see something and you
make<00:00:39.020> a<00:00:39.050> diagnosis<00:00:39.800> or<00:00:40.010> staging<00:00:40.489> or<00:00:40.580> whatever

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
make a diagnosis or staging or whatever

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.030 
make a diagnosis or staging or whatever
that's<00:00:41.000> all<00:00:41.180> pathology<00:00:41.780> now<00:00:42.650> you<00:00:42.710> do<00:00:42.920> it

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
that's all pathology now you do it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.340 
that's all pathology now you do it
digitally<00:00:43.250> that's<00:00:43.790> digital<00:00:44.000> pathology<00:00:44.629> so

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
digitally that's digital pathology so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.140 
digitally that's digital pathology so
sounds<00:00:46.010> like<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.370> know<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:46.519> you<00:00:46.610> take<00:00:46.879> the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
sounds like you know if you take the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.119 
sounds like you know if you take the
normal<00:00:47.449> process<00:00:47.870> digitize<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.350> something

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
normal process digitize it something

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.890 
normal process digitize it something
will<00:00:49.280> happen<00:00:49.430> it'll<00:00:49.820> be<00:00:49.909> more<00:00:50.089> efficient<00:00:50.629> you

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
will happen it'll be more efficient you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.320 
will happen it'll be more efficient you
could<00:00:51.080> do<00:00:51.229> more<00:00:51.530> in<00:00:51.710> less<00:00:51.739> time<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:53.030> standard

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
could do more in less time the standard

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.450 
could do more in less time the standard
play<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:54.049> comes<00:00:54.290> with<00:00:54.500> automating<00:00:55.370> a

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
play that comes with automating a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.990 
play that comes with automating a
process<00:00:55.820> but<00:00:56.629> I<00:00:56.690> would<00:00:56.960> make<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.170> premise<00:00:57.680> that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
process but I would make a premise that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.399 
process but I would make a premise that
what<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.089> about<00:00:59.330> to<00:00:59.600> happen<00:00:59.780> in<00:01:00.110> pathology

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
what is about to happen in pathology

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.350 
what is about to happen in pathology
through<00:01:01.010> digitization<00:01:01.430> is<00:01:01.670> about<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.150> cause<00:01:02.330> a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
through digitization is about to cause a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.200 
through digitization is about to cause a
major<00:01:03.159> disruptive<00:01:04.159> change<00:01:04.489> it's<00:01:04.729> about<00:01:04.970> to

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
major disruptive change it's about to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.719 
major disruptive change it's about to
cause<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.420> major<00:01:06.369> disruptive<00:01:07.369> change<00:01:07.610> in

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
cause a major disruptive change in

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.460 
cause a major disruptive change in
healthcare<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.299> that's<00:01:08.930> what<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.170> would<00:01:09.320> like

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
healthcare and that's what I would like

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.080 
healthcare and that's what I would like
to<00:01:09.590> walk<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.830> through<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:10.580> when<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:10.790> when<00:01:11.030> I

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
number before one is is to simply point

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.540 
number before one is is to simply point
out<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:33.260> whole<00:01:33.500> innovation<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.280> Bissel

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
out that whole innovation that Bissel

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.100 
out that whole innovation that Bissel
pathology<00:01:34.910> is<00:01:34.970> going<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.270> lead<00:01:35.480> in<00:01:35.630> healthcare

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
pathology is going to lead in healthcare

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.830 
pathology is going to lead in healthcare
there<00:01:37.010> is<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.160> need<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.460> step<00:01:37.910> back<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.450> look<00:01:38.690> at

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
there is a need to step back and look at

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.660 
there is a need to step back and look at
this<00:01:38.930> issue<00:01:39.050> somewhat<00:01:39.440> differently<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.610> I'm

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
this issue somewhat differently so I'm

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.370 
this issue somewhat differently so I'm
going<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.880> then<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.750> I'm<00:01:41.930> going<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.140> take<00:01:42.260> this

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
going to then I I'm going to take this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.570 
going to then I I'm going to take this
word<00:01:42.620> somewhat<00:01:43.040> differently<00:01:43.400> rather

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
word somewhat differently rather

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.210 
word somewhat differently rather
seriously<00:01:44.120> and<00:01:44.390> walk<00:01:45.080> you<00:01:45.260> through<00:01:45.500> some<00:01:45.770> some

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
seriously and walk you through some some

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.760 
seriously and walk you through some some
pictures<00:01:46.730> by<00:01:46.910> Picasso<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:48.050> make<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.410> point

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
pictures by Picasso to make that point

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.040 
pictures by Picasso to make that point
so<00:01:49.400> in<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:49.730> classic<00:01:50.210> world<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.540> looking<00:01:50.900> as

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
so in this classic world of looking as

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.500 
so in this classic world of looking as
in<00:01:51.410> looking<00:01:51.710> through<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> microscope<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:53.270> was

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
in looking through a microscope it was

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.960 
in looking through a microscope it was
easy<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.810> see<00:01:54.020> what<00:01:54.170> was<00:01:54.350> going<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.970> reality

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
easy to see what was going on reality

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.880 
easy to see what was going on reality
was<00:01:56.090> recognizable<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.050> even<00:01:57.770> though

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
was recognizable and even though

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.470 
was recognizable and even though
sometimes<00:01:58.100> fuzzy<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:59.030> picture<00:01:59.360> was

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
sometimes fuzzy the picture was

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.960 
sometimes fuzzy the picture was
understandable<00:02:00.190> but<00:02:01.190> then<00:02:01.400> things<00:02:01.670> started

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
understandable but then things started

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.210 
understandable but then things started
to<00:02:02.030> look<00:02:02.210> funny<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.230> if<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.380> rewind<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.890> tape<00:02:04.070> to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
to look funny so if I rewind the tape to

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.500 
to look funny so if I rewind the tape to
some<00:02:04.370> twenty<00:02:04.730> years<00:02:04.909> ago<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.330> first

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
some twenty years ago the first

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.020 
some twenty years ago the first
biomarkers<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:07.040> can<00:02:07.250> imagine<00:02:07.640> there<00:02:07.940> was

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
biomarkers you can imagine there was

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.339 
biomarkers you can imagine there was
some<00:02:08.179> complexity<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.840> had<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.140> be<00:02:09.229> dealt

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
some complexity that had to be dealt

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.570 
some complexity that had to be dealt
with<00:02:09.940> things<00:02:10.940> became<00:02:11.239> harder<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:11.690> recognize

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
with things became harder to recognize

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.729 
with things became harder to recognize
disjointed<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.019> could<00:02:15.170> still<00:02:15.319> tell<00:02:15.530> what

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
disjointed but you could still tell what

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.309 
disjointed but you could still tell what
was<00:02:15.890> going<00:02:16.129> on<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.989> harder<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:19.510> harder

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
was going on and harder and harder

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.209 
was going on and harder and harder
and<00:02:21.819> finally<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:22.879> became<00:02:23.180> impossible<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:25.040> see

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
and finally it became impossible to see

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.039 
and finally it became impossible to see
what<00:02:25.400> was<00:02:25.579> going<00:02:25.730> on<00:02:25.969> so<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.689> happening

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
what was going on so this is happening

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.259 
what was going on so this is happening
not<00:02:27.200> only<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.920> pictures<00:02:28.340> alone<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:29.060> also

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
not only in the pictures alone it's also

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.550 
not only in the pictures alone it's also
happened<00:02:29.689> to<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.870> business<00:02:30.170> model<00:02:30.500> of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
happened to the business model of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.770 
happened to the business model of
delivery<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.040> health<00:02:31.250> care<00:02:31.390> getting<00:02:32.390> harder

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
delivery of health care getting harder

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.929 
delivery of health care getting harder
and<00:02:32.959> harder<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.319> see<00:02:33.439> what<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.680> going<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.099> by

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
and harder to see what is going on by

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.610 
and harder to see what is going on by
looking<00:02:35.180> at<00:02:35.510> things<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.930> conventional<00:02:36.439> way

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
looking at things the conventional way

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.589 
looking at things the conventional way
that's<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.310> problem<00:02:37.549> looking<00:02:38.120> at<00:02:38.239> things<00:02:38.480> the

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
that's the problem looking at things the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.220 
that's the problem looking at things the
conventional<00:02:38.989> way<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:40.040> if<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:41.019> lay<00:02:42.019> those

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
conventional way so if I lay those

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.440 
conventional way so if I lay those
pictures<00:02:42.620> down<00:02:42.859> the<00:02:43.760> first<00:02:44.030> set<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.269> pictures

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
pictures down the first set of pictures

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.940 
pictures down the first set of pictures
the<00:02:44.900> second<00:02:45.200> set<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.349> pictures

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
the second set of pictures

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.500 
the second set of pictures
the<00:02:46.400> third<00:02:46.640> set<00:02:46.879> there's<00:02:47.090> quite<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:47.329> bit<00:02:47.480> of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
the third set there's quite a bit of

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.550 
the third set there's quite a bit of
similarity<00:02:48.079> so<00:02:48.650> if<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.799> go<00:02:48.980> back<00:02:50.260> sorry<00:02:51.349> go

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
similarity so if I go back sorry go

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.009 
similarity so if I go back sorry go
forward

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
forward

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.949 
forward
this<00:02:54.019> group<00:02:54.409> is<00:02:55.000> identical<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:56.629> group

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
this group is identical to this group

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.309 
this group is identical to this group
only<00:02:57.500> done<00:02:57.680> twenty<00:02:58.069> years<00:02:58.220> apart<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.930> is

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
only done twenty years apart and this is

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.710 
only done twenty years apart and this is
identical<00:03:00.919> to<00:03:01.069> this<00:03:01.280> done<00:03:01.879> only<00:03:02.239> twenty<00:03:02.569> years

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
identical to this done only twenty years

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.199 
identical to this done only twenty years
apart<00:03:02.989> for<00:03:03.500> instance

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
apart for instance

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.349 
apart for instance
so<00:03:05.769> our<00:03:06.769> onus<00:03:07.159> is<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.400> figure<00:03:07.549> out<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.790> pattern

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
so our onus is to figure out the pattern

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.550 
so our onus is to figure out the pattern
or<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.349> trend<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:09.950> will<00:03:10.129> that<00:03:11.120> lies

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
or the trend if you will that lies

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.580 
or the trend if you will that lies
hidden<00:03:12.560> underneath<00:03:12.889> this<00:03:13.280> chaos<00:03:14.349> to<00:03:15.349> see

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
hidden underneath this chaos to see

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.119 
hidden underneath this chaos to see
through<00:03:15.859> Picasso's<00:03:16.430> outer<00:03:16.639> shell<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.799> LA<00:03:18.799> to

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
through Picasso's outer shell to LA to

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.619 
through Picasso's outer shell to LA to
see<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.430> Velazquez<00:03:19.879> that<00:03:20.000> lies<00:03:20.120> beneath<00:03:20.329> so

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
see the Velazquez that lies beneath so

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.210 
see the Velazquez that lies beneath so
if<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.810> rewind<00:03:21.439> and<00:03:21.650> go<00:03:21.709> forward

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
if I rewind and go forward

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.759 
if I rewind and go forward
that's<00:03:22.579> Picasso<00:03:23.120> that's<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.139> last<00:03:24.290> quiz<00:03:24.530> this

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
that's Picasso that's the last quiz this

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.670 
that's Picasso that's the last quiz this
the<00:03:25.010> last<00:03:25.430> mineus<00:03:25.819> that<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.599> picture<00:03:26.900> at<00:03:27.079> the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
the last mineus that the picture at the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.069 
the last mineus that the picture at the
famous<00:03:28.030> painting<00:03:29.030> at<00:03:29.150> Prado<00:03:29.389> in<00:03:29.629> Madrid<00:03:29.959> if

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
famous painting at Prado in Madrid if

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.920 
famous painting at Prado in Madrid if
you've<00:03:30.199> been<00:03:30.349> there<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:32.599> go<00:03:32.750> back<00:03:32.900> a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
you've been there so if I go back a

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.500 
you've been there so if I go back a
couple<00:03:33.169> times<00:03:33.699> so<00:03:34.699> maybe<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.209> want<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:35.389> focus

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
couple times so maybe you want to focus

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.750 
couple times so maybe you want to focus
on<00:03:35.840> say<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.799> girl<00:03:36.979> or<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.310> man<00:03:37.549> in<00:03:37.579> the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
on say the girl or the man in the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.659 
on say the girl or the man in the
doorway<00:03:38.120> or<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.989> little<00:03:39.530> dog<00:03:39.709> there<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.669> there

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
doorway or the little dog there so there

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.750 
doorway or the little dog there so there
is<00:03:43.849> some<00:03:44.239> virtue<00:03:44.569> in<00:03:45.099> at<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.310> point<00:03:46.609> of

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
is some virtue in at the point of

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.330 
is some virtue in at the point of
inflection<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.780> step<00:03:48.049> back<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.620> see<00:03:49.129> is

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
inflection to just step back and see is

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.770 
inflection to just step back and see is
there<00:03:49.519> something<00:03:49.940> fundamental<00:03:50.569> that<00:03:50.690> is

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
there something fundamental that is

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.559 
there something fundamental that is
about<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.139> happen<00:03:51.260> so<00:03:52.190> my<00:03:52.400> my<00:03:52.760> bold<00:03:53.209> conjecture

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
about to happen so my my bold conjecture

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.869 
about to happen so my my bold conjecture
is<00:03:54.019> nothing<00:03:54.709> has<00:03:54.919> changed<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.400> health<00:03:55.609> care<00:03:55.760> in

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
is nothing has changed in health care in

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.599 
is nothing has changed in health care in
the<00:03:55.970> last<00:03:56.150> 2,000<00:03:56.750> years<00:03:56.780> nothing<00:03:57.620> not<00:03:57.859> one<00:03:57.889> bit

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
the last 2,000 years nothing not one bit

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.699 
the last 2,000 years nothing not one bit
yes<00:03:59.209> there's<00:03:59.479> new<00:03:59.690> technology<00:04:00.260> yes<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.560> can

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
yes there's new technology yes you can

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.710 
yes there's new technology yes you can
do<00:04:00.799> some<00:04:01.010> things<00:04:01.220> faster<00:04:01.639> yes<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.359> can<00:04:02.479> save

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
do some things faster yes you can save

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.869 
do some things faster yes you can save
more<00:04:02.959> lives<00:04:02.989> yes<00:04:03.919> there<00:04:04.129> is<00:04:04.220> technologies

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
more lives yes there is technologies

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.909 
more lives yes there is technologies
that<00:04:05.060> can<00:04:05.239> allow<00:04:05.659> a<00:04:05.930> quality<00:04:06.349> delivery<00:04:06.739> as

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
that can allow a quality delivery as
