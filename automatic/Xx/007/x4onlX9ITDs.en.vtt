00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.809
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.500
 Welcome to another video of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 personal channel and today we make a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.220
 here is how you correct the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.640
 error that is giving in the low that the alt does not 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.099
 opens that the client does not live right 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.150
 I made a video and if a while ago 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.970
 on my alternate channel on the channel 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.800
 main that I now dedicate to him 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.490
 only for games 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.970
 This channel here I've done is now going 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.530
 be for tutorials and this is the tutorial 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.100
 What will I do? 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.800
 before I did a tutorial I did not know 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.980
 detail well but now I hope you have 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.190
 better improved sorry and today I would go 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.970
 teach with them and correct this I 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 new format with the pc and I had this 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.750
 problem 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 remembering that only before all else do you 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.619
 should update all the data in your 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.830
 computer 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.560
 all the drives are right then we 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.270
 will you install or not you star wars 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.220
 usually there will come a shortcut here 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.180
 You can come here and click with the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.730
 right click opens file location or 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.840
 so if I 'm another you come 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.260
 properties and open location of the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 file will open this folder here which is 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.290
 the part of the role 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.040
 We'll come here on radios, people. 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.920
 sees in projects will have all these 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.620
 folders here in the tutorials I've seen 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.530
 that explains why you should delete 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.409
 this folder and this too 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.620
 but this will not be necessary at least 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.900
 for me and if it's not necessary I 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:14.250
 Can I play my young man here? 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:17.939
 lauxen there goes is probably going to have 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.450
 two but here's winning this one 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.140
 or it may be another too 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.620
 I have this folder here. You come here. 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:32.330
 here is English and even in this 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.400
 folder here dei deploy blog and will have 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.239
 all these files 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.800
 if you do not have people and lie down 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:48.709
 making this launch folder available on the 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:52.370
 here in the video description 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.650
 will be available this folder 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.230
 with the snack of the game is right for 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.870
 correct this error that is giving there 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.849
 so we will come here and send 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.880
 stop work so it's a shortcut 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.790
 for us there in the work area 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.120
 be done this will be our 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.160
 launch that will be the 么么么么 lancheiro that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.049
 correct the error that was in that 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.880
 another out is right 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.400
 practically we come here 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:30.079
 right-click and run 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:33.079
 As an administrator, wait a while and 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.290
 will run our home get here ok 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:47.690
 Okay, it might take a while. 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:49.910
 because it can be waiting there not 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.450
 here just to repair the files to 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.650
 law and that I may have removed this 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:01.190
 certain but kind here is our full home 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.910
 already with the error that this other to the 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.650
 check is a show that you install is 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.019
 a run of the game is with the error and that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.700
 it's a bad smell that's already in the game 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:19.070
 in case you have this error 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.440
 I understand, I hope so. 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.220
 so after running this one as 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.730
 administrator will open here you leave 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.680
 update and if necessary 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.950
 will probably have to upgrade 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.770
 because this version of this launch without bug 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.020
 that I'm leaving in the description is a 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.100
 little outdated 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.860
 But it will work, I sure hope so. 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.690
 You test with the ones you are seeing. 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.420
 My business ok 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.210
 then we will see who even the region 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.360
 if I do not have today so it will put 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.340
 Portuguese and select South region is pure 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.220
 brazil save 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.760
 there goes from the basic updated as what 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:10.770
 it's working because this will appear 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.080
 I play here I let them update on 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.250
 truth is not only updating 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.350
 checking some files is that 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.080

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.550
 I'm going to use it to not stay too long. 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.490
 I'm boring, I'll be right back and I'll be right back. 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.120
