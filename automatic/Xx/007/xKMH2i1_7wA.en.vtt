with<00:01:08.729> campus<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.580> more<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.970> thing

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
with campus now this is more of a thing

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.359 
with campus now this is more of a thing
where<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> try<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.890> he

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
where I try to think like them so he

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.030 
where I try to think like them so he
obviously<00:01:14.490> got<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> few<00:01:15.030> kills<00:01:15.240> down<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
obviously got a few kills down there and

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.740 
obviously got a few kills down there and
I'd<00:01:17.040> come<00:01:17.340> back<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.759> was<00:01:17.909> him<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> turn<00:01:18.600> my

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
I'd come back if I was him and I turn my

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.640 
I'd come back if I was him and I turn my
flashlight<00:01:18.869> off<00:01:19.229> cause<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.439> want<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
flashlight off cause I don't want to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.990 
flashlight off cause I don't want to
give<00:01:19.799> away<00:01:19.890> my<00:01:20.100> position<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.580> he<00:01:20.610> does<00:01:20.820> come

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
give away my position if he does come

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
give away my position if he does come
back<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.689> think<00:01:21.869> he<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.320> gonna<00:01:22.409> come<00:01:22.650> back

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
back but I think he was gonna come back

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.080 
back but I think he was gonna come back
because<00:01:23.009> he<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.400> gotten<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.700> few<00:01:23.850> kills

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
because he would have gotten a few kills

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.399 
because he would have gotten a few kills
there<00:01:24.270> he<00:01:24.360> got<00:01:24.479> me<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:24.780> team<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.290> probably

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
there he got me in my team and probably

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.310 
there he got me in my team and probably
some<00:01:25.650> others<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:27.150> an<00:01:27.270> idiot<00:01:27.360> he

some others there and like an idiot he

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.780 
some others there and like an idiot he
obviously<00:01:28.710> comes<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> same

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
here we're trying to take the flag I

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.020 
here we're trying to take the flag I
came<00:02:46.380> around<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.680> back<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.910> other

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
came around the back because the other

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.400 
came around the back because the other
our<00:02:48.300> team<00:02:48.510> was<00:02:48.630> pushing<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.080> from<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.319> other

our team was pushing up from the other

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.140 
our team was pushing up from the other
side<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.040> think<00:02:50.100> hey<00:02:50.340> fuck<00:02:50.670> if<00:02:50.880> they'll

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
side and I think hey fuck if they'll

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.640 
side and I think hey fuck if they'll
kill<00:02:51.360> Ben<00:02:51.540> -<00:02:51.720> they're<00:02:52.019> gonna<00:02:52.140> come<00:02:52.319> back<00:02:52.470> down

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
kill Ben - they're gonna come back down

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.610 
kill Ben - they're gonna come back down
again<00:02:53.480> as<00:02:54.480> well<00:02:54.600> catch<00:02:54.780> him<00:02:54.810> earlier<00:02:55.319> again

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
again as well catch him earlier again

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.850 
again as well catch him earlier again
pop<00:02:56.610> some<00:02:56.790> more<00:02:56.910> caps<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.390> ass<00:02:57.650> losers

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
pop some more caps in ass losers

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.550 
pop some more caps in ass losers
that's<00:02:59.370> what<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.670> would<00:02:59.850> call<00:03:00.090> genuine<00:03:01.049> camping

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
that's what I would call genuine camping

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.340 
that's what I would call genuine camping
so<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.519> guess<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.330> should<00:03:03.480> explain<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.080> see

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
so I guess I should explain this I see

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.550 
so I guess I should explain this I see
two<00:03:04.590> types<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.950> camping<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:06.030> guy<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.390> B<00:03:06.690> who<00:03:07.260> in

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
two types of camping the guy on B who in

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.740 
two types of camping the guy on B who in
this<00:03:07.769> situation<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.430> camping<00:03:08.760> there<00:03:08.970> I

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
this situation is camping there I

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.440 
this situation is camping there I
wouldn't<00:03:10.709> call<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:10.950> bad<00:03:11.220> camping<00:03:11.730> I'd<00:03:12.180> say

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
wouldn't call it bad camping I'd say

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.620 
wouldn't call it bad camping I'd say
that<00:03:12.600> he<00:03:12.780> was<00:03:12.870> defending<00:03:13.350> B<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.760> general

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
that he was defending B and in a general

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.360 
that he was defending B and in a general
sense<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.140> isn't<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.470> bad<00:03:16.739> because<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.340> is

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
sense that isn't that bad because it is

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.130 
sense that isn't that bad because it is
an<00:03:17.549> objective<00:03:17.880> based<00:03:18.239> game<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.780> have<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.959> try

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
an objective based game we have to try

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.810 
an objective based game we have to try
get<00:03:19.320> B<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.709> his<00:03:19.799> defending<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.400> which<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.640> fair

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
get B and his defending it which is fair

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.449 
get B and his defending it which is fair
enough<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.720> guy<00:03:21.900> previously<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:23.010> think

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
enough but the guy previously I think

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.740 
enough but the guy previously I think

him<00:04:25.909> so<00:04:26.539> yeah<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.139> t-bag<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:27.650> instead

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:28.129 
him so yeah just t-bag and instead

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.950 
him so yeah just t-bag and instead
thought<00:04:28.550> that's<00:04:28.729> a<00:04:28.819> bit<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.150> humiliation<00:04:29.719> for

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
thought that's a bit of humiliation for

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.589 
thought that's a bit of humiliation for
him<00:04:30.310> then<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.580> basically<00:04:31.789> just<00:04:32.090> sit<00:04:32.449> here<00:04:32.539> on

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
him then I basically just sit here on

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.270 
him then I basically just sit here on
the<00:04:32.750> spawn<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.229> just<00:04:33.469> hoped<00:04:33.680> you'd<00:04:33.860> come<00:04:33.949> back

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
the spawn I just hoped you'd come back

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.879 
the spawn I just hoped you'd come back
and<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:35.300> think<00:04:35.599> he<00:04:35.719> does<00:04:35.870> come<00:04:36.080> back<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.590> think

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
and I think he does come back I think

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.950
