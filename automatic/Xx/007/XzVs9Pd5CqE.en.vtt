the<00:02:02.160> color

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
the color

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.450 
the color
looky<00:02:04.220> there<00:02:04.250> do<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:04.910> on<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.150> chicken<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:07.070> I

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
looky there do it on the chicken so I

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.570 
looky there do it on the chicken so I
think<00:02:08.470> probably<00:02:09.470> maybe<00:02:10.660> four<00:02:11.660> more<00:02:11.960> minutes

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
think probably maybe four more minutes

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.170 
think probably maybe four more minutes
to<00:02:13.580> be<00:02:13.730> all<00:02:13.970> done<00:02:14.320> that's<00:02:15.320> it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
to be all done that's it

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.100 
to be all done that's it
so<00:02:17.180> here<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.530> final<00:02:19.160> product<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.210> just<00:02:20.570> took

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
