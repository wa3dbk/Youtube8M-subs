00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.250
 long as the green what's the matter what 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.299
 also the tunahan escada before what 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.380
 is somehow better the game runs 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.200
 significantly slower a bit 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.390
 stupid I find such a challenge 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.830
 nice game was if that annoys us only 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.450
 that you often toast but even 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.820
 perhaps not triggered 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.270
 correct the figure a little bit 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.470
 or so the gentleman leads the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.970
 Nerve cell case a nice variation 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.340
 from albert together for a year

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:05.640
 Koppers connecting to google play 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.290
 I do not want to do games no I ask 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.729
 We'll get in touch and look like 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.479
 quickly my soul then at the end too 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.470
 was sold 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.470
 so welcome 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.120
 So you fly with his with his 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.380
 propeller worms up and down 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.600
 must always by tapping on the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.370
 screen 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.440
 Change the direction but you have to 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.540
 including the centrifugal forces 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.790
 or in physics 1 15 the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.820
 is in here and that can 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.620
 very nice ass away so yes 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.730
 now 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.670
 I believe my short so far 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.740
 actually 1 some contributions 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:46.800
 actually got 13 what I got 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:49.250
 very much admire how to create 13 here 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.860
 no idea why one now with 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:03:03.870
 contenance and construction 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:06.680
 there is feeling better again brings 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:15.750
 nothing was faster again 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:18.120
 tippl so to find the angle or 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.620
 diesel this advance as it creates 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.600
 the thing is swinging that is somehow 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.600
 I find a bit random or 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:43.080
 believes ok as well as the topic swing copter 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.630
 that was actually the game in it 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.810
 rough a broadly 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.370
 that's the game actually and ok that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.320
 but was just you have seen where 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.030
 The propeller was still miles away 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.180
 and dropped down anyway 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.950
 so much for my part to the place to 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.950
 check what is currently new on the 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.459
 one is for free for umme tried 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.769
 it out 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.090
 since annoyed throws the smartphone 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.650
 then in the corner and see you then 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.390
 at the latest in the month have a place of 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.600
 app store in store checks tenant up 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.600
