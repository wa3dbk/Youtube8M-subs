00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.610
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.260
 the kitchen 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.110
 several subscriber asked me 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.170
 cook something with the presence of peas 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.980
 and so I decided to cook you like 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.309
 pea soup as I do it means 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.620
 for this we need 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.550
 incomplete glass of peas which I already 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.290
 he boiled it already soft and even a little 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.170
 he was slightly crushed 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.290
 fork especially strongly it is not necessary to try and 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.850
 I have here 1 average carrot which 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.500
 I rubbed on a coarse grater here with me 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.199
 a little less than half bell pepper 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.830
 which I am very very 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.799
 fine so here cut further from me 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.340
 about 400 grams here 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:12.010
 ground beef in which I already put 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:17.470
 salt pepper a little parsley also him 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.390
 a little here is onion put here 2 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.090
 tablespoons of breadcrumbs 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.490
 flooded 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.640
 a little milk and now cooked such 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:33.400
 stuffing further here I have already roasted 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.650
 fried a small onion with one 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.570
 large clove of garlic is not necessary 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.000
 bring to golden color just 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.700
 crops and then return the water to the water in 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.100
 which brewed peas I add more 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.800
 to get about 2 liters 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.790
 and now I have this water at the moment 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.270
 standing on the fire is heated and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.320
 first of all i will have to make 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.930
 meat balls and boil them 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.590
 slightly moisten hands then take 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:14.080
 a small amount of minced meat in it him 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:18.300
 hands then roll the ball like this 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.300
 and throw water until our meat balls 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.640
 cooked we add in the mountains you can 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.980
 just take my tomato paste 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.020
 was not but it was ketchup and we 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.060
 which would give in principle 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.570
 extra flavor there already there 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.709
 there are two kinds of spices 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.760
 half tablespoons we need 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.950
 and mix it all up somewhere in minutes 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:51.190
 5-6 after adding the balls in the soup we 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:59.160
 add there is our peas with tomato 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:02.320
 as well as onions with toasted garlic 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.780
 after the meat balls started 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.459
 float to the surface at this stage 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:13.930
 add carrot 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:17.230
 here comes the bell pepper 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.450
 see balls already surfaced soup very 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.709
 it smells delicious here 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.780
 Bulgarian pepper 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.079
 but at this point you can add 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.470
 or dill or parsley or cilantro well, who 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:34.060
 how do i add a little bit 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:38.709
 of course you can add dried parsley 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.840
 fresh soup on my stage 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.100
 half ready and right now I'm 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.690
 add greens 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:50.860
 so she had time to give the beetle all their 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:55.480
 flavors guys what is 40 45 minutes 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.190
 later our soup is ready he is not very 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.570
 fatty although it all depends on 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.790
 amounts of peas but anyway 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.579
 the aroma of tom is just unreal and 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.250
 soup very funny turned out I think 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.000
 that kids will like it because 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.940
 there are such bright colors 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.209
 I think especially in the winter when everything is outside 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.299
 gray and sad come home and eat such 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.420
 Cheerful sushyk of course very strongly 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.170
 cheer up all the pleasant 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.170
 appetite
