00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
and any of that I basically had a day

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.209 
and any of that I basically had a day
and<00:06:06.569> change<00:06:07.050> with<00:06:07.319> the<00:06:07.349> vehicle<00:06:07.800> so<00:06:07.949> we'll<00:06:08.069> get

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
and change with the vehicle so we'll get

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:09.949 
and change with the vehicle so we'll get
our<00:06:08.309> full<00:06:08.579> review<00:06:08.789> and<00:06:09.119> really<00:06:09.360> dig<00:06:09.599> into<00:06:09.779> that

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:09.959 
our full review and really dig into that

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.019 
our full review and really dig into that
later<00:06:10.379> this<00:06:10.649> is<00:06:10.709> really<00:06:11.039> a<00:06:11.069> finished<00:06:11.490> car<00:06:11.729> and

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
later this is really a finished car and

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.969 
later this is really a finished car and
that's<00:06:12.749> kind<00:06:13.110> of<00:06:13.169> the<00:06:13.259> highest<00:06:13.529> compliment

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
that's kind of the highest compliment

that's kind of the highest compliment
you<00:06:14.069> can<00:06:14.189> give<00:06:14.309> a<00:06:14.339> company<00:06:14.639> that<00:06:14.879> wasn't

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:15.209 
you can give a company that wasn't

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.569
