okay<00:00:02.959> pulling<00:00:03.959> back<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.350> piston<00:00:04.799> now<00:00:05.299> this<00:00:06.299> is

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
okay pulling back the piston now this is

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.589 
okay pulling back the piston now this is
number<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:06.990> number<00:00:07.470> two<00:00:07.649> back<00:00:08.460> engine<00:00:08.849> front

engine<00:00:10.820> everything<00:00:11.990> has<00:00:12.990> been<00:00:13.410> prepared<00:00:13.679> as

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
engine everything has been prepared as

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.970 
engine everything has been prepared as
to<00:00:14.309> regard<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.690> piston<00:00:16.199> installation

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
to regard of the piston installation

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.650 
to regard of the piston installation
into<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.550> barrel<00:00:18.470> you<00:00:19.470> need<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.430> respect<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
into the barrel you need to respect the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.439 
into the barrel you need to respect the
arrow<00:00:21.869> inside<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.830> point<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.550> talk<00:00:23.910> towards

arrow inside that point to talk towards
the<00:00:24.570> front<00:00:24.980> blah<00:00:25.980> blah<00:00:26.250> blah<00:00:26.580> oil<00:00:26.849> everywhere

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the front blah blah blah oil everywhere

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.870 
the front blah blah blah oil everywhere
everything<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.080> kind<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> ready<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
everything is kind of ready right now so

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.290 
everything is kind of ready right now so
you<00:00:30.630> get<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.050> rod<00:00:31.439> era<00:00:31.769> trying<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.969> show<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
you get the rod era trying to show you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.830 
you get the rod era trying to show you
moving<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> rod<00:00:34.610> Center<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.390> engine<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
moving the rod Center the engine is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.299 
moving the rod Center the engine is
basically<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> side<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:37.890> now<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.129> it's

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
basically on the side right now so it's

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.330 
basically on the side right now so it's
really<00:00:38.489> easy<00:00:38.610> gravity<00:00:39.390> works<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.899> me<00:00:40.760> almost

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
really easy gravity works for me almost

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.610 
really easy gravity works for me almost
so<00:00:44.340> there's<00:00:45.329> nothing<00:00:45.480> much<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
so there's nothing much to it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
so there's nothing much to it
everything<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> ready<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.030> bottom<00:00:48.480> seal

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
everything is ready the bottom seal

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.319 
everything is ready the bottom seal
everything<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.379> done<00:00:49.559> before<00:00:49.770> okay<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.850> you

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
connecting rod you know so you start

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.630 
connecting rod you know so you start
pushing<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.820> pin<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:10.320> pin<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.040> okay

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
pushing the pin that pin here okay

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
pushing the pin that pin here okay
crying<00:01:12.090> show<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:13.830> easy<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.369> work

now just a second okay I got it like
that<00:01:22.409> should<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.280> okay<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.540> play<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that should be okay so I play with the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.010 
that should be okay so I play with the
piston<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> down<00:01:26.460> push<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.090> pin<00:01:27.330> push<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
piston up and down push the pin push the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.249 
piston up and down push the pin push the
pin<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.509> fully<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.020> yet

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
pin and it's in it's not fully in yet

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.679 
pin and it's in it's not fully in yet
but<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.710> kind<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.189> what<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.509> now

is<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:35.659> take<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.810> hammer<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> piece<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
is just take a hammer with a piece of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.590 
is just take a hammer with a piece of
wood<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:39.259> bang<00:01:40.670> never<00:01:41.670> use<00:01:42.030> metal<00:01:42.450> if

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

wood and just bang never use metal if
possible<00:01:43.280> just<00:01:44.280> bang<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.790> pin<00:01:46.009> fully<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:48.649> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
possible just bang the pin fully in and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.880 
possible just bang the pin fully in and
it's<00:01:50.750> well<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.170> hear<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> noise<00:01:52.530> it's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.950 

okay<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:59.030> engine<00:01:59.390> is<00:01:59.960> back<00:02:01.720> level<00:02:02.720> like<00:02:02.930> that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
okay the engine is back level like that

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.580 
okay the engine is back level like that
okay<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:04.760> next<00:02:05.000> step<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.480> put<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.840> rag<00:02:06.110> ear<00:02:06.410> so

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
okay the next step I put a rag ear so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.920 
okay the next step I put a rag ear so
the<00:02:06.620> pin<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.520> circlip<00:02:07.910> doesn't<00:02:08.360> snap

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
the pin the circlip doesn't snap

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.260 
the pin the circlip doesn't snap
whatever<00:02:09.470> into<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.310> block<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.850> would<00:02:11.060> not

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
whatever into the block that would not

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.460 
whatever into the block that would not
be<00:02:11.450> funny<00:02:11.750> at<00:02:12.200> all<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.510> pin<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.080> fully

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
be funny at all so the pin is in fully

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.800 
be funny at all so the pin is in fully
in<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:16.040> can<00:02:16.220> see<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.610> groove<00:02:16.850> feels<00:02:17.480> good

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
in you can see the groove feels good

everything is nice you got the pin the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.130 
everything is nice you got the pin the
tool<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:22.670> need<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.000> stop<00:02:23.300> stop<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:24.020> at

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140
