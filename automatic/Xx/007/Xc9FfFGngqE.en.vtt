00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.179 

the<00:00:03.560> secondary<00:00:04.160> component<00:00:04.670> of<00:00:04.730> the<00:00:05.450> bunnyhop

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:06.189 
the secondary component of the bunnyhop

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.310 
the secondary component of the bunnyhop
after<00:00:07.189> the<00:00:07.790> compression<00:00:08.660> so<00:00:09.170> you're

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
after the compression so you're

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.590 
after the compression so you're
compressing<00:00:09.590> both<00:00:10.010> both<00:00:11.000> tires<00:00:11.240> on<00:00:11.390> the<00:00:11.450> bike

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
compressing both both tires on the bike

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.850 
compressing both both tires on the bike
think<00:00:11.810> of<00:00:11.870> them<00:00:11.990> as<00:00:12.080> a<00:00:12.170> basketball<00:00:12.740> when

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
think of them as a basketball when

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.720 
think of them as a basketball when
you're<00:00:12.980> dribbling<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:13.460> the<00:00:14.240> up<00:00:14.390> and<00:00:14.690> scoop<00:00:15.080> is

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
you're dribbling and the up and scoop is

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.279 
you're dribbling and the up and scoop is
getting<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.820> back<00:00:16.970> wheel<00:00:17.180> up<00:00:17.390> getting<00:00:18.199> the

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
getting the back wheel up getting the

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.710 
getting the back wheel up getting the
back<00:00:18.439> wheel<00:00:18.710> off<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.010> ground<00:00:19.190> is<00:00:20.000> definitely

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
back wheel off the ground is definitely

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.450 
back wheel off the ground is definitely
one<00:00:21.110> of<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.350> hardest<00:00:21.740> things<00:00:21.980> for<00:00:22.130> most

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
one of the hardest things for most

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.710 
one of the hardest things for most
people<00:00:22.699> to<00:00:22.760> figure<00:00:22.940> out<00:00:23.180> when<00:00:23.330> it<00:00:23.420> comes<00:00:23.510> to

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
people to figure out when it comes to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.390 
people to figure out when it comes to
running<00:00:23.840> a<00:00:23.990> bike<00:00:24.170> because<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.190> you<00:00:25.340> know

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
running a bike because it's you know

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.370 
running a bike because it's you know
it's<00:00:25.580> not<00:00:25.670> a<00:00:25.730> natural<00:00:25.970> maneuver<00:00:26.539> like<00:00:26.690> you

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
it's not a natural maneuver like you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.080 
it's not a natural maneuver like you
yank<00:00:27.680> with<00:00:27.860> your<00:00:27.980> arms<00:00:28.250> all<00:00:28.430> the<00:00:28.580> time<00:00:28.760> to<00:00:28.910> pick

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
yank with your arms all the time to pick

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.520 
yank with your arms all the time to pick
stuff<00:00:29.300> up<00:00:29.480> very<00:00:30.289> rarely<00:00:30.560> do<00:00:30.980> we<00:00:31.010> use<00:00:32.530> momentum

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
stuff up very rarely do we use momentum

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.709 
stuff up very rarely do we use momentum
and<00:00:33.859> subtle<00:00:34.160> weight<00:00:34.309> shifts<00:00:34.729> to<00:00:35.359> lift<00:00:35.600> the

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
and subtle weight shifts to lift the

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.139 
and subtle weight shifts to lift the
back<00:00:35.870> end<00:00:36.079> of<00:00:36.140> our<00:00:36.229> bike<00:00:36.409> off<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.739> ground<00:00:37.149> so

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
back end of our bike off the ground so

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.610 
back end of our bike off the ground so
it's<00:00:38.809> going<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.050> look<00:00:39.109> like<00:00:39.289> I'm<00:00:39.440> cheating

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
it's going to look like I'm cheating

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.279 
it's going to look like I'm cheating
here<00:00:39.920> because<00:00:40.069> I<00:00:40.159> have<00:00:40.309> pedals<00:00:40.550> that<00:00:41.109> clip<00:00:42.109> in

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
here because I have pedals that clip in

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.750 
here because I have pedals that clip in
and<00:00:42.499> that<00:00:42.620> allows<00:00:42.829> me<00:00:42.859> to<00:00:43.129> pretty<00:00:43.399> much<00:00:43.550> just

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
and that allows me to pretty much just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.910 
and that allows me to pretty much just
pick<00:00:43.909> up<00:00:43.999> the<00:00:44.120> bike<00:00:44.300> just<00:00:45.289> by<00:00:45.409> lifting<00:00:45.589> up<00:00:45.800> my

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
pick up the bike just by lifting up my

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.270 
pick up the bike just by lifting up my
feet<00:00:46.179> but<00:00:47.179> a<00:00:47.239> good<00:00:47.479> way<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.690> start<00:00:48.280> practicing

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
feet but a good way to start practicing

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.500 
feet but a good way to start practicing
getting<00:00:49.549> your<00:00:49.670> back<00:00:49.789> wheel<00:00:49.999> off<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.269> ground

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
getting your back wheel off the ground

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.369 
getting your back wheel off the ground
if<00:00:50.719> you<00:00:51.879> haven't<00:00:52.879> had<00:00:53.299> experience<00:00:53.600> with<00:00:53.929> it<00:00:54.079> is

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
if you haven't had experience with it is

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.139 
if you haven't had experience with it is
to<00:00:55.039> use<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.219> little<00:00:55.519> bit<00:00:55.609> of<00:00:55.699> front<00:00:55.850> brake<00:00:56.120> and

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
to use a little bit of front brake and

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.520 
to use a little bit of front brake and
go<00:00:56.420> slow<00:00:56.809> to<00:00:57.199> just<00:00:57.440> do<00:00:57.889> a<00:00:57.920> little<00:00:58.209> you<00:00:59.209> know

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
go slow to just do a little you know

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.449 
go slow to just do a little you know
just<00:01:00.530> pick<00:01:00.739> your<00:01:00.859> back<00:01:01.010> wheel<00:01:01.190> off<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.339> ground

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:01.459 
just pick your back wheel off the ground

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:02.649 
just pick your back wheel off the ground
something<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:02.059> people<00:01:02.299> like<00:01:02.389> to<00:01:02.479> call<00:01:02.600> it

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
something that people like to call it

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.370 
something that people like to call it
call<00:01:03.079> an<00:01:03.199> endo<00:01:03.499> so<00:01:04.840> find<00:01:05.840> some<00:01:05.990> front<00:01:06.170> brake

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
call an endo so find some front brake

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.500 
call an endo so find some front brake
and<00:01:06.710> I'm<00:01:07.370> practicing<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:07.970> weight<00:01:08.180> shift

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
and I'm practicing that weight shift

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.400 
and I'm practicing that weight shift
that<00:01:09.380> you<00:01:09.440> need<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.860> get<00:01:09.980> up<00:01:11.170> get<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.260> wheel

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
that you need to get up get the wheel

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.000 
that you need to get up get the wheel
off<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.680> ground

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
off the ground

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:21.940 
off the ground
so<00:01:15.610> so<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:16.730> I<00:01:16.850> combine<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:18.970> up<00:01:20.320> look<00:01:21.320> forward<00:01:21.740> I

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
so so if I combine the up look forward I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.950 
so so if I combine the up look forward I
have<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.580> bit<00:01:22.760> of<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.880> bunny<00:01:23.090> hop<00:01:23.270> obviously<00:01:23.870> if

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
have a bit of a bunny hop obviously if

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.330 
have a bit of a bunny hop obviously if
I'm<00:01:24.080> going<00:01:24.350> downhill<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:25.040> my<00:01:25.160> brakes

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
I'm going downhill and I have my brakes

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.090 
I'm going downhill and I have my brakes
locked<00:01:25.640> it's<00:01:26.420> not<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.690> smoothest<00:01:26.900> thing<00:01:27.350> but

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
locked it's not the smoothest thing but

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:39.550 
locked it's not the smoothest thing but
up<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.330> then<00:01:29.450> forward<00:01:31.660> so<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:38.050> best<00:01:39.050> way<00:01:39.320> to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
up and then forward so the best way to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.720 
up and then forward so the best way to
really<00:01:40.040> practice<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:42.400> getting<00:01:43.400> that<00:01:43.520> back

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
really practice the getting that back

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.340 
really practice the getting that back
wheel<00:01:43.910> off<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.090> ground<00:01:44.210> thing<00:01:44.600> besides<00:01:44.960> just

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
wheel off the ground thing besides just

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.720 
wheel off the ground thing besides just
using<00:01:45.500> your<00:01:45.680> front<00:01:45.860> brake<00:01:46.040> at<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.280> low<00:01:46.430> speed

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
using your front brake at a low speed

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.510 
using your front brake at a low speed
it's<00:01:47.690> just<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.170> sort<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.620> riding<00:01:48.770> around<00:01:48.920> you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
it's just to sort of riding around you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.480 
it's just to sort of riding around you
know<00:01:49.610> normal<00:01:49.940> tennis<00:01:50.180> shoes<00:01:50.710> with<00:01:51.710> big<00:01:52.040> grippy

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
know normal tennis shoes with big grippy

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.390 
know normal tennis shoes with big grippy
flat<00:01:52.700> pedals<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.270> just<00:01:53.480> practice<00:01:54.400> bouncing

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
flat pedals and just practice bouncing

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.190 
flat pedals and just practice bouncing
the<00:01:55.700> bike<00:01:55.880> against<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.300> ground<00:01:56.510> so<00:01:56.810> as<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.080> go<00:01:57.170> a

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
the bike against the ground so as I go a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.030 
the bike against the ground so as I go a
little<00:01:57.409> bit<00:01:57.590> quicker<00:01:58.180> you'll<00:01:59.180> see<00:01:59.450> a<00:02:00.040> more

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
little bit quicker you'll see a more

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.149 
little bit quicker you'll see a more
natural<00:02:01.460> looking<00:02:01.909> bunnyhop<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.979> helps

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
natural looking bunnyhop so and it helps
