00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.770 

hi<00:00:00.750> there<00:00:01.020> by<00:00:01.979> now<00:00:02.280> your<00:00:02.700> general<00:00:03.240> awareness

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
hi there by now your general awareness

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.690 
hi there by now your general awareness
and<00:00:04.110> knowledge<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.890> major<00:00:05.100> scale<00:00:05.490> in

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
and knowledge of the major scale in

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.579 
and knowledge of the major scale in
different<00:00:06.210> keys<00:00:06.450> should<00:00:07.049> be<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.350> good<00:00:07.529> shape

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
different keys should be in good shape

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.209 
different keys should be in good shape
so<00:00:08.150> in<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.660> session<00:00:09.990> I'd<00:00:10.410> like<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.920> look<00:00:11.070> at

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
so in this session I'd like to look at

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.999 
so in this session I'd like to look at
how<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.429> scale<00:00:11.969> links<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.660> chords<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.650> more

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
how the scale links to chords and more

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.099 
how the scale links to chords and more
importantly<00:00:14.730> how<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.599> use<00:00:15.929> this

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
importantly how we can use this

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.550 
importantly how we can use this
relationship<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.100> construct<00:00:17.609> musical<00:00:18.119> ideas

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
relationship to construct musical ideas

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.010 
relationship to construct musical ideas
so<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.160> begin<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.670> let's<00:00:21.270> take<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.570> look<00:00:21.869> at

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
so to begin with let's take a look at

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.259 
so to begin with let's take a look at
the<00:00:22.109> core<00:00:22.350> tones<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:22.980> C<00:00:23.340> major<00:00:23.369> scale<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the core tones of the C major scale and

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.660 
the core tones of the C major scale and
learn<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> little<00:00:25.289> bit<00:00:25.590> more<00:00:25.650> about<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.369> chord

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
learn a little bit more about the chord

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.310 
learn a little bit more about the chord
that's<00:00:27.330> associated<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.560> scale<00:00:29.630> if<00:00:30.630> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that's associated with this scale if you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.860 
that's associated with this scale if you
remember<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.250> chord<00:00:32.640> tones<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> scale<00:00:33.660> are

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
remember the chord tones of a scale are

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.040 
remember the chord tones of a scale are
the<00:00:33.930> 1st<00:00:34.710> 3rd<00:00:35.670> 5th<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.899> 7th<00:00:37.890> notes<00:00:38.360> now<00:00:39.360> if<00:00:39.600> we

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the 1st 3rd 5th and 7th notes now if we

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.660 
the 1st 3rd 5th and 7th notes now if we
count<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.530> through<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> notes<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.309> our<00:00:41.399> C

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
count up through the notes of our C

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.090 
count up through the notes of our C
major<00:00:41.910> scale<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:42.930> easily<00:00:43.469> work<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:43.860> out

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
major scale we can easily work these out

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.360 
major scale we can easily work these out
we<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.480> C<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> first<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.739> root<00:00:47.070> note

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
we know that C is the first or root note

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.979 
we know that C is the first or root note
is<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.570> 2nd<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.620> 3rd<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:50.219> an<00:00:50.370> E<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
is the 2nd the 3rd is an E this is the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.700 
is the 2nd the 3rd is an E this is the
4th<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.559> 5th<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.850> note<00:00:54.030> G<00:00:54.590> continuing<00:00:55.590> on

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
4th the 5th is the note G continuing on

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.680 
4th the 5th is the note G continuing on
to<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> 6th<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.640> here's<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> 7th<00:00:57.930> note<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.440> me

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
to the 6th and here's the 7th note of me

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.229 
to the 6th and here's the 7th note of me
ok<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.289> from<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.890> we've<00:01:02.190> successfully<00:01:02.640> found

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
ok so from that we've successfully found

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600 
ok so from that we've successfully found
that<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> chord<00:01:03.840> tones<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.589> C<00:01:04.860> major<00:01:05.129> scale

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that the chord tones of a C major scale

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
that the chord tones of a C major scale
are<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.210> notes<00:01:06.630> C<00:01:07.260> E<00:01:07.760> G<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.119> B<00:01:09.619> for<00:01:10.619> this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
are the notes C E G and B for this

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
are the notes C E G and B for this
session<00:01:11.070> though<00:01:11.460> let's<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.420> look<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
session though let's just look at the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.600 
session though let's just look at the
first<00:01:13.140> 3<00:01:13.680> chord<00:01:14.070> tones<00:01:14.400> C<00:01:15.119> E<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:16.409> G<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
first 3 chord tones C E and G and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.630 
first 3 chord tones C E and G and
explore<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.840> deeper<00:01:19.610> we<00:01:20.610> can

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
explore these a little deeper we can

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.020 
explore these a little deeper we can
take<00:01:21.060> any<00:01:21.330> 3<00:01:21.990> chord<00:01:22.290> tones<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.950> any<00:01:23.189> scale<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
take any 3 chord tones of any scale and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.679 
take any 3 chord tones of any scale and
create<00:01:24.750> something<00:01:25.320> called<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.770> triad<00:01:26.479> as<00:01:27.479> we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
create something called a triad as we

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.330 
create something called a triad as we
progress<00:01:27.960> together<00:01:28.439> we'll<00:01:29.009> learn<00:01:29.280> about

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
progress together we'll learn about

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
progress together we'll learn about
different<00:01:29.820> types<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.570> triad<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> how<00:01:31.770> they

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
different types of triad and how they

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
different types of triad and how they
change<00:01:32.400> depending<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> scales<00:01:33.689> we're

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
change depending on the scales we're

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.490 
change depending on the scales we're
using<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.729> triad<00:01:36.329> we've<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.960> discovered

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
using this triad we've just discovered

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.210 
using this triad we've just discovered
is<00:01:37.650> called<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.460> C<00:01:38.970> major<00:01:39.299> triad<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.979> name

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
is called a C major triad and the name

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
is called a C major triad and the name
should<00:01:41.490> come<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.850> no<00:01:42.090> surprise<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.960> it's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
should come as no surprise as it's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.270 
should come as no surprise as it's
contained<00:01:43.799> within<00:01:43.979> our<00:01:44.549> C<00:01:44.909> major<00:01:45.149> scale<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:46.680> we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
contained within our C major scale if we

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.850 
contained within our C major scale if we
play<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.000> 3<00:01:48.360> notes<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.079> C<00:01:49.290> major<00:01:49.530> triad

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
play the 3 notes of a C major triad

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.910 
play the 3 notes of a C major triad
together<00:01:50.579> at<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> same<00:01:51.180> time<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:52.320> create<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
together at the same time we create a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
together at the same time we create a
chord<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.540> chords<00:01:55.049> name<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.530> you've

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
chord and this chords name as you've

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.760 
chord and this chords name as you've
probably<00:01:56.369> already<00:01:56.909> guessed<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.170> chord<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
probably already guessed is the chord of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.020 
probably already guessed is the chord of
C<00:01:58.829> major<00:02:00.890> here<00:02:01.890> how<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.460> outline<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
C major here how we can outline the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209 
C major here how we can outline the
overall<00:02:03.600> sound<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.350> chord<00:02:04.649> by<00:02:04.950> playing

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
overall sound of this chord by playing

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.940 
overall sound of this chord by playing
the<00:02:05.399> individual<00:02:06.119> notes<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the individual notes that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.150 
the individual notes that
make<00:02:07.039> up<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.520> major<00:02:07.729> triad<00:02:08.440> again<00:02:09.440> this

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
make up the major triad again this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.339 
make up the major triad again this
should<00:02:10.429> come<00:02:10.640> as<00:02:10.670> no<00:02:10.819> surprise<00:02:10.970> as<00:02:11.720> its<00:02:11.989> these

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
should come as no surprise as its these

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.009 
should come as no surprise as its these
notes<00:02:12.769> played<00:02:13.129> together<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:14.300> creates<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
notes played together that creates a

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.559 
notes played together that creates a
major<00:02:15.470> chord

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.990 

remember<00:02:19.569> as<00:02:19.989> bass<00:02:20.440> players<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:21.400> want<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.879> be

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
remember as bass players we want to be

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.300 
remember as bass players we want to be
able<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.299> spell<00:02:22.690> out<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.840> sound<00:02:23.379> of<00:02:23.620> any<00:02:23.830> chord

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
able to spell out the sound of any chord

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.990 
able to spell out the sound of any chord
just<00:02:25.000> by<00:02:25.239> using<00:02:25.560> individual<00:02:26.560> notes<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.190> to

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
just by using individual notes and to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.119 
just by using individual notes and to
really<00:02:28.420> get<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:28.750> concept<00:02:29.319> under<00:02:29.739> our<00:02:29.769> bells

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
really get this concept under our bells

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.470 
really get this concept under our bells
we<00:02:30.760> need<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.299> learn<00:02:31.480> about<00:02:31.540> intervals<00:02:33.480> as

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
we need to learn about intervals as

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.080 
we need to learn about intervals as
we've<00:02:34.780> already<00:02:34.989> learned<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.950> term<00:02:36.220> interval

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
we've already learned the term interval

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.539 
we've already learned the term interval
is<00:02:37.299> used<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.900> describe<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.650> distance<00:02:39.280> between

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
is used to describe the distance between

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.740 
is used to describe the distance between
two<00:02:40.030> notes<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.569> music<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.920> firstly<00:02:42.879> let's<00:02:43.510> look

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
two notes in music so firstly let's look

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.780 
two notes in music so firstly let's look
at<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.989> interval<00:02:44.500> between<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:45.160> first<00:02:45.459> two

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
at the interval between the first two

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.440 
at the interval between the first two
notes<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.510> C<00:02:46.720> major<00:02:46.750> triad<00:02:47.760> okay<00:02:48.760> here's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
notes of the C major triad okay here's

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.199 
notes of the C major triad okay here's
our<00:02:49.629> root<00:02:49.930> note<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.170> C<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.489> next<00:02:51.849> note<00:02:52.030> in

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
our root note of C and the next note in

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.410 
our root note of C and the next note in
the<00:02:52.360> Triad<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.959> an<00:02:53.140> E<00:02:53.290> now<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.420> interval

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the Triad is an E now the interval

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.690 
the Triad is an E now the interval
between<00:02:55.720> these<00:02:56.200> two<00:02:56.560> notes<00:02:56.829> in<00:02:57.040> music<00:02:57.250> is

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
between these two notes in music is

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.099 
between these two notes in music is
what's<00:02:58.299> called<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.930> major<00:02:59.560> third<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:01.750> take<00:03:02.079> a

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
what's called a major third just take a

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.470 
what's called a major third just take a
look<00:03:02.470> at<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.739> layout<00:03:03.129> of<00:03:03.160> these<00:03:03.549> two<00:03:03.910> notes<00:03:04.239> on

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
look at the layout of these two notes on

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.869 
look at the layout of these two notes on
the<00:03:04.599> fingerboard<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.370> thanks<00:03:06.370> again<00:03:06.609> to<00:03:06.819> the

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
the fingerboard and thanks again to the

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.330 
the fingerboard and thanks again to the
symmetrical<00:03:07.660> tuning<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.379> bass<00:03:08.590> this

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
symmetrical tuning of the bass this

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.509 
symmetrical tuning of the bass this
shape<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:10.170> always<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.500> interval<00:03:12.069> of<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.310> major

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
shape is always the interval of a major

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.150 
shape is always the interval of a major
third<00:03:12.940> no<00:03:13.750> matter<00:03:14.049> where<00:03:14.349> we<00:03:14.500> choose<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.950> play

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
third no matter where we choose to play

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.559 
third no matter where we choose to play
it<00:03:16.049> but<00:03:17.049> as<00:03:17.349> you're<00:03:18.129> hopefully<00:03:18.640> aware<00:03:18.940> it's

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
it but as you're hopefully aware it's

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.349 
it but as you're hopefully aware it's
the<00:03:19.840> notes<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.379> changes<00:03:21.310> we<00:03:21.489> move<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.060> shape

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
the notes that changes we move the shape

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.180 
the notes that changes we move the shape
around<00:03:23.010> for<00:03:24.010> example<00:03:24.549> we<00:03:25.269> now<00:03:25.540> know<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:26.079> C<00:03:26.620> -<00:03:26.889> an

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
around for example we now know a C - an

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.690 
around for example we now know a C - an
E<00:03:27.579> is<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:28.120> major<00:03:28.480> third<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.250> moving<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> shape

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
E is a major third and moving the shape

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.210 
E is a major third and moving the shape
we<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.660> also<00:03:31.930> see<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.680> here's<00:03:32.950> another

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
we can also see that here's another

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.240 
we can also see that here's another
major<00:03:33.519> third<00:03:33.910> this<00:03:34.750> time<00:03:35.079> between<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:36.010> notes

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
major third this time between the notes

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.589 
major third this time between the notes
of<00:03:36.489> G<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.060> B<00:03:38.130> again<00:03:39.130> there's<00:03:39.760> no<00:03:39.970> surprises

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
of G and B again there's no surprises

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.229 
of G and B again there's no surprises
why<00:03:41.019> it's<00:03:41.200> called<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.500> major<00:03:41.739> third<00:03:42.130> both<00:03:42.880> these

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
why it's called a major third both these

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.050 
why it's called a major third both these
notes<00:03:43.630> are<00:03:43.870> used<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.620> form<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.160> major<00:03:45.519> triad

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
notes are used to form a major triad

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.050 
notes are used to form a major triad
which<00:03:47.049> as<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.650> now<00:03:47.919> know<00:03:47.950> when<00:03:48.790> played

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
which as you now know when played

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.680 
which as you now know when played
together<00:03:49.269> create<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.049> major<00:03:50.470> chord<00:03:50.889> and<00:03:51.389> if<00:03:52.389> we

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
together create a major chord and if we

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.420 
together create a major chord and if we
link<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.109> knowledge<00:03:53.349> back<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.130> scale<00:03:54.400> of

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
link this knowledge back to the scale of

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.259 
link this knowledge back to the scale of
C<00:03:54.849> major<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.870> note<00:03:56.139> of<00:03:56.319> E<00:03:56.470> remember<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.370> also

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
C major the note of E remember is also

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.730 
C major the note of E remember is also
the<00:03:58.630> third<00:03:58.930> note<00:03:59.230> in<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.530> sequence

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.730 

now<00:04:03.780> something<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:04.990> encourage<00:04:05.230> all

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
now something that I encourage all

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.070 
now something that I encourage all
students<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.520> do<00:04:06.790> is<00:04:07.030> learn<00:04:07.420> how<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.750> play

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
students to do is learn how to play

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.400 
students to do is learn how to play
intervals<00:04:08.770> in<00:04:09.010> different<00:04:09.460> ways<00:04:09.870> for<00:04:10.870> example

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
intervals in different ways for example

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.100 
intervals in different ways for example
I've<00:04:11.770> just<00:04:12.520> shown<00:04:12.820> you<00:04:12.850> that<00:04:13.270> the<00:04:13.420> interval<00:04:14.020> of

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
I've just shown you that the interval of

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.710 
I've just shown you that the interval of
a<00:04:14.230> major<00:04:14.500> third<00:04:14.920> can<00:04:15.370> be<00:04:15.400> found<00:04:15.820> of<00:04:16.000> one<00:04:16.270> string

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
a major third can be found of one string

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.040 
a major third can be found of one string
and<00:04:16.989> back<00:04:17.650> one<00:04:18.160> fret<00:04:18.640> from<00:04:18.970> any<00:04:19.270> room<00:04:19.780> note

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.050 
and back one fret from any room note

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.640 
and back one fret from any room note
anywhere<00:04:20.950> across<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.520> entire<00:04:21.940> fingerboard

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
anywhere across the entire fingerboard

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.980 
anywhere across the entire fingerboard
but<00:04:23.650> we<00:04:24.040> can<00:04:24.220> also<00:04:24.490> find<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.150> same<00:04:25.180> interval

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
but we can also find the same interval

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.100 
but we can also find the same interval
of<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.170> major<00:04:26.470> third<00:04:26.920> four<00:04:27.730> frets<00:04:28.090> up<00:04:28.330> on<00:04:28.720> the

of a major third four frets up on the

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.230 
of a major third four frets up on the
same<00:04:29.380> string<00:04:29.800> as<00:04:29.950> our<00:04:30.070> root<00:04:30.310> note<00:04:30.340> like<00:04:30.730> this

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
same string as our root note like this

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.290 
same string as our root note like this
I<00:04:31.710> appreciate<00:04:32.710> it's<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.280> bit<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.640> stretch<00:04:33.910> yes

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
I appreciate it's a bit of a stretch yes

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.590 
I appreciate it's a bit of a stretch yes
but<00:04:34.900> it's<00:04:35.050> still<00:04:35.380> well<00:04:35.710> worth<00:04:35.920> knowing<00:04:36.280> as<00:04:36.640> you

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
but it's still well worth knowing as you

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.360 
but it's still well worth knowing as you
can<00:04:37.780> hopefully<00:04:37.990> see<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.800> shapes<00:04:39.130> are

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
can hopefully see the shapes are

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.610 
can hopefully see the shapes are
different<00:04:39.820> but<00:04:40.330> importantly<00:04:41.020> they<00:04:41.320> use

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
different but importantly they use

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.370 
different but importantly they use
exactly<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:42.430> same<00:04:42.460> notes<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.330> in<00:04:43.930> this<00:04:44.080> case

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
exactly the same notes and in this case

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.120 
exactly the same notes and in this case
it's<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.920> C<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.430> an<00:04:45.970> E
