00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.189
 and we meet again with Marcelo Tapia 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.170
 this Thursday and it sounds weird and that is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 Monday that is Thursday and do as it was 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.730
 Christmas is reaching the family like this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.690
 how good we spent a day ahead 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.690
 how happy is Christmas too 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.600
 thank you very much brought us a little gift 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
 madryn argentinas and made in argentina me 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.720
 it seems that we have to take a little 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.359
 prejudice with the issues 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.669
 Argentine technology and start 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.070
 try things that are manufactured in the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.390
 Argentina because it does not just try to be 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.559
 fast and this is not a thing for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.989
 sell them anything because usually 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 took things the test and the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.320
 you buy where you want 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.200
 the components that have many things 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.140
 of what are manufactured in Argentina 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.239
 they are controlled by the big brands 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 of components for example a processor 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.399
 intel is a processor that people from 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.379
 intel sells it to any brand 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.090
 then we can buy to be 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.810
 rude brand 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.970
 katia technologies if they want but 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.950
 they have an intel processor but I eat 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.470
 such of technologies I have to meet 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.220
 with certain rules that intel asks me 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.320
 then the qualities or the standards 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.900
 of that technology is pretty much 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 similar after we see what is more 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.760
 linda that is better finished that is 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.440
 worse finished that seems to us 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.780
 I like one machine that the other or that is 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.340
 of more confidence is another issue but in 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.280
 the technological issues we live in 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.530
 a globalized world which admits 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.690
 technology from anywhere are 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.570
 you can buy technology from 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.240
 us and they will see that there are things from taiwan 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.009
 that there are things in Japan that there are things about 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.130
 burma that there are things of any 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.170
 place in the world because nothing is assembled 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.729
 only in one place what comes here 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.649
 in Argentina the components say that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.470
 for manufactured here is not impossible 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.140
 manufacture everything that has a device 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.660
 inside in a single country nobody does 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.690
 so that's why we take out the prejudices 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:10.780
 let's try 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:12.400
 with his blackberry mom is not that I 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.290
 I hear a lot of criticism because this 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.840
 blackberry is argentina so that 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.130
 brands also have one thing are the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.080
 components for example is a before a 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.450
 Back cover is not manufactured in a single 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.800
 country but it is manufactured in several 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.740
 countries why because there is a closeness 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.540
 the best to a country other than factory and 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.760
 there is closer to another one 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.860
 manufacturer then all comply with 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.540
 certain standards and maybe there are 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.390
 We will not deny any difference 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.930
 but good to see and if it can be 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.450
 that an Italian blackberry has a 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.530
 finished the best minimum a little better 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.450
 Cited with a neighbor 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.400
 always the beautiful of functions not 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.320
 means but what works for us 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.660
 put dedication marks brands 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.720
 they take care of their standard if it would not be all like 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.860
 as weird with the mare and there are if things 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.550
 that they do nothing more than for some 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.020
 markets 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.940
 there are some phones that are nothing more 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.880
 it's for us there are others who are 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.260
 only for china and they do not arrive here and 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.680
 some that are for the market 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.050
 Argentinian 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.490
 eliminating the prejudice then 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.790
 let's see the product of the tablet 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.220
 7 inches is a box brand tablet 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.620
 are they really left me a great 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.100
 satisfaction operating system android 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.170
 is well finished android like everything from 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.820
 for one side for the camera for the other 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.860
 to the operating system we are going to exist 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.410
 operative all the applications of 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.230
 google has an android ice cream 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.580
 sandwich there is that brands have 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.530
 to update the systems a little more 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.920
 operative android by this one walks very well 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.500
 which has the advantage first price 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.660
 how it works is also an interface 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.060
 that is walking very fast there and I 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.100
 I'm training an application like this 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.920
 that everything is fine as you can 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.220
 see how he speaks is the speed and is 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.930
 good and the back that you have 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.180
 put care because this is like a 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.160
 gummed mexiquense that this difference 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.410
 who have done every detail that they do to 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.450
 a construction a little more pleasant 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.820
 those that are all black and that there 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.780
 If they all look the same, notice that the 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.870
 edges are 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.760
 where two has a processor of 15 the 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.200
 tablet works very well has a good 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.959
 Battery battery autonomy 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.700
 lithium the camera has has camera has 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.460
 dual chamber has a rear chamber 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.770
 2 megapixels this seems to me to be the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.169
 ideal complement and a front camera 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.389
 0.2 t the ideal complement so that 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.340
 the one that has a normal cell phone but 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.710
 has throughout the day control their 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.660
 mails to the best of wifi in the house or going 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.290
 to a bar or anywhere now that 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.700
 there are free wifi zones in the city 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.400
 what they do is with this tablet 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.860
 simple without spending a lot of money can 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.050
 have agreed to control they no longer have 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.660
 Smart cellular can complement 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.700
 somehow the service of both of 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.250
 what is internal time with this that 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.400
 for the price more or less how much I have 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.570
 seen from 1300 to 1500 well is more 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.880
 cheap prices for quality that are 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.070
 putting the warm picture is fine you 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.860
 spoke connectors good the usb 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.340
 so that to load it the output of 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.590
 handset the output to recharge the 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.490
 battery and that we have here 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.410
 what is a hdmi output of those who are 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.890
 buying the new TVs like 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.800
 well says soria has hdmi outputs that 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.900
 is high definition media interface that 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.520
 it means that it 's a high connection 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.310
 definition and also has more speed 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.080
 that you do not have is important you charge a 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.930
 movie almost to the best you want to see 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.290
 on your TV cabled hdl and hdmi and 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.270
 directly, the gravity is in your 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.150
 TV comes with charger and here what 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.340
 we have a true as good usb 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.410
 Packaging and good price and good quality 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.680
 at least for the user who does not 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.660
 is so demanding we will lose the technology 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.280
 it is very clear face an ipad is the place 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.590
 most expensive in the world where they are going to 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.420
 buy that great the vintage and save the 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.690
 playstation 4 everything is worth a mask 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.480
 skill and about 1300 the 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.910
 brand in Argentina and recommended by 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.910
 that essential any white thing 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.360
 perhaps
