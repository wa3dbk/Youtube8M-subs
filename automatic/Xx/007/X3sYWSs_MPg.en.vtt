00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
Memphis I was you know so I was kind of

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.730 
Memphis I was you know so I was kind of
shocked<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.200> see<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.440> but<00:01:45.010> this<00:01:45.130> gate<00:01:45.370> seemed

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
shocked to see it but this gate seemed

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.410 
shocked to see it but this gate seemed
basically<00:01:47.740> non-existent<00:01:47.920> from<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.700> skate<00:01:49.390> park

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
basically non-existent from a skate park

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.910 
basically non-existent from a skate park
view<00:01:49.840> but<00:01:50.050> in<00:01:50.140> terms<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.650> number<00:01:50.890> of

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
view but in terms of the number of

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.120 
view but in terms of the number of
skaters<00:01:51.340> they're<00:01:51.520> still<00:01:51.760> there<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:53.100> where<00:01:54.100> I

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
skaters they're still there so where I

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.540 
skaters they're still there so where I
think<00:01:54.430> skating<00:01:54.790> is

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
think skating is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.540 
think skating is
this<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.910> huge<00:01:56.710> upwelling<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:58.100> underground

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
this is huge upwelling this underground

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.550 
this is huge upwelling this underground
when<00:01:58.940> it's<00:01:59.120> kind<00:01:59.480> of<00:01:59.540> become<00:01:59.810> mainstream<00:02:00.110> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
when it's kind of become mainstream and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.640 
when it's kind of become mainstream and
yet<00:02:00.740> at<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.980> same<00:02:01.040> time<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.200> something

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
yet at the same time this is something

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.930 
yet at the same time this is something
that's<00:02:03.740> really<00:02:03.980> important<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.640> our<00:02:04.730> youth

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.990 
a way that you know it's it becomes a
scalable<00:04:08.989> parking<00:04:09.410> space<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:10.099> I<00:04:10.700> think<00:04:10.910> it

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
scalable parking space and I think it

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.550 
scalable parking space and I think it
along<00:04:11.239> when<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.599> would<00:04:11.750> be<00:04:11.870> an<00:04:12.049> advantage<00:04:12.349> to

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
along when that would be an advantage to

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.410 
along when that would be an advantage to
the<00:04:12.799> stay<00:04:13.010> too<00:04:13.069> because<00:04:13.640> it<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.000> park<00:04:14.239> would

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
the stay too because it the park would

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.670 
the stay too because it the park would
withstand<00:04:14.860> a<00:04:15.860> lot<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.699> use<00:04:17.060> that<00:04:17.359> way<00:04:17.690> from

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
withstand a lot of use that way from

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.440 
withstand a lot of use that way from
skaters<00:04:19.190> inland<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.699> people<00:04:20.239> would<00:04:20.299> have

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
skaters inland and people would have

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.120 
skaters inland and people would have
something<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.410> look<00:04:21.560> at<00:04:21.739> me<00:04:22.010> go

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
something to do to look at me go

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.990 
something to do to look at me go
