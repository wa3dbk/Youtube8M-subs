don't know why the deserts a big place
and<00:00:35.140> it<00:00:35.410> should<00:00:35.620> be<00:00:35.800> confined<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.309> a<00:00:36.399> small

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
and it should be confined to a small

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.090 
and it should be confined to a small
spawning<00:00:37.090> area<00:00:37.540> i<00:00:37.809> hope<00:00:38.140> that<00:00:38.320> gets<00:00:38.440> fixed<00:00:38.860> cuz

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100

spawning area i hope that gets fixed cuz
right<00:00:39.370> now<00:00:39.430> i<00:00:39.579> don't<00:00:39.700> think<00:00:39.879> it's<00:00:40.120> really<00:00:40.360> good

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
right now i don't think it's really good

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
aisle so apparently it's worth catching

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.050 
aisle so apparently it's worth catching

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
then let's see how long it takes me to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.810 
then let's see how long it takes me to
get<00:00:55.000> back<00:00:55.239> there<00:00:55.710> let's<00:00:56.710> see<00:00:56.980> right<00:00:57.310> here

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
get back there let's see right here

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.750 
get back there let's see right here
we've<00:00:58.060> got<00:00:58.140> 2.3<00:00:59.140> k<00:00:59.440> XP<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.160> let's<00:01:00.520> see<00:01:00.640> how

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
we've got 2.3 k XP and let's see how

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:44.310 
we've got 2.3 k XP and let's see how
long<00:01:00.820> it<00:01:01.060> takes<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.300> get<00:01:01.420> back

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.050 

so<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.470> took<00:01:45.590> me<00:01:45.649> around<00:01:45.890> 45<00:01:46.490> seconds<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.970> get

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
so it took me around 45 seconds to get

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.420 
so it took me around 45 seconds to get
back<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.390> my<00:01:47.479> location<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:48.350> wasn't<00:01:49.039> that<00:01:49.159> bad

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
back to my location it wasn't that bad

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.219 
back to my location it wasn't that bad
and<00:01:49.759> honestly<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.180> think<00:01:50.299> it's<00:01:50.630> worth<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:51.020> I'll

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
and honestly I think it's worth it I'll

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.139 
and honestly I think it's worth it I'll
leave<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.500> up<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.890> guys<00:01:51.920> but<00:01:52.549> personally

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
leave it up to you guys but personally

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.789 
leave it up to you guys but personally
it<00:01:53.329> takes<00:01:53.539> around<00:01:53.659> anywhere<00:01:54.229> from<00:01:54.439> a<00:01:54.590> minute

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
it takes around anywhere from a minute

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.469 
it takes around anywhere from a minute
to<00:01:54.920> two<00:01:55.189> minutes<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.580> fill<00:01:55.759> up<00:01:55.850> your<00:01:55.909> inventory

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
to two minutes to fill up your inventory

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.779 
to two minutes to fill up your inventory
and<00:01:56.810> deposit<00:01:57.409> them<00:01:57.470> in<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.679> energy<00:01:57.830> rift<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:58.759> I

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
and deposit them in the energy rift so I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.539 
and deposit them in the energy rift so I
think<00:01:58.970> with<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.929> 45<00:02:00.500> seconds<00:02:00.950> return<00:02:01.250> time

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
think with the 45 seconds return time

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.819 
think with the 45 seconds return time
the<00:02:02.090> 10<00:02:02.299> or<00:02:02.450> 15<00:02:02.780> seconds<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.320> takes<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:03.649> get<00:02:03.770> to

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
the 10 or 15 seconds it takes to get to

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.440 
the 10 or 15 seconds it takes to get to
the<00:02:04.009> altar<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.460> deposit<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.939> Chronicles

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
the altar and deposit the Chronicles

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.330 
the altar and deposit the Chronicles
you're<00:02:05.990> getting<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.289> little<00:02:06.439> bit<00:02:06.619> more<00:02:06.799> XP<00:02:07.159> than

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
you're getting a little bit more XP than

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.580 
you're getting a little bit more XP than
normal<00:02:07.670> because<00:02:07.970> with<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> full<00:02:08.569> inventory<00:02:08.840> you

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
normal because with a full inventory you

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.830 
normal because with a full inventory you
get<00:02:09.739> about<00:02:09.920> 1.8<00:02:10.580> k<00:02:10.729> XP<00:02:11.150> depending<00:02:11.600> on<00:02:11.690> how<00:02:11.780> many

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
get about 1.8 k XP depending on how many

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.809 
get about 1.8 k XP depending on how many
enriched<00:02:12.260> are<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:12.590> your<00:02:12.739> inventory<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.790> I
