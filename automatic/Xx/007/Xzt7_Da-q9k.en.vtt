00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
just darling I use a 12 millimeter pearl

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.250 
just darling I use a 12 millimeter pearl
and<00:00:16.500> these<00:00:17.310> are<00:00:17.580> 5<00:00:18.150> millimeter<00:00:19.640> beads<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.260> 11

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and these are 5 millimeter beads and 11

but poor man's bead spinner okay there

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.740 
but poor man's bead spinner okay there
we've<00:00:51.960> got<00:00:52.230> five<00:00:52.910> then<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> come

we've got five then I'm going to come
around<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.699> make<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> ring<00:00:57.500> leave<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.649> tail<00:00:59.000> so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
around and make a ring leave a tail so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
around and make a ring leave a tail so
that<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.840> tie<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> knot<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that I can tie a knot it this is a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.600 
that I can tie a knot it this is a
little<00:01:05.010> tiny<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.549> we've<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:07.369> drawings<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
little tiny so we've got drawings of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.289 
little tiny so we've got drawings of
this<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.930> our<00:01:10.470> blog<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.010> we'll<00:01:11.430> leave<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> link

this on our blog and we'll leave a link

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
this on our blog and we'll leave a link
down<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.930> bottom<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.799> much<00:01:14.040> easier

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
down at the bottom and it's much easier

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.600 
down at the bottom and it's much easier
to<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.990> with<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.259> drawing<00:01:16.650> okay<00:01:17.220> there's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to see with that drawing okay there's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.429 
to see with that drawing okay there's
our<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:17.970> loop<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.869> tie<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> knot

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
our little loop I'm going to tie a knot

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.520 
our little loop I'm going to tie a knot
and<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:21.080> am<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.619> pull<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> knot<00:01:24.530> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and then I am going to pull that knot to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
and then I am going to pull that knot to
the<00:01:25.680> back<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.520> show<00:01:28.820> okay<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.600> I'll

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the back of it one show okay then I'll

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.620 
the back of it one show okay then I'll
show<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> next<00:01:31.290> step<00:01:31.909> okay<00:01:32.909> after<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.329> ring

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
show you the next step okay after a ring

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.749 
show you the next step okay after a ring
we're<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> little<00:01:34.759> reverse

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
we're going to do a little reverse

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.660 
we're going to do a little reverse
design<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.930> we've<00:01:37.290> got<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> five<00:01:38.369> millimeter

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
design here we've got a five millimeter

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.300 
design here we've got a five millimeter
of<00:01:39.060> gold<00:01:39.439> a<00:01:40.820> crystal<00:01:41.869> then<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.079> pearl<00:01:43.470> crystal

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
of gold a crystal then a pearl crystal

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.029 
of gold a crystal then a pearl crystal
and<00:01:44.700> gold<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:47.790> we'll<00:01:48.030> bring<00:01:48.240> it

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.099 

down<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.850> our<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.689> size<00:01:55.700> ring<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.899> we'll

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
down to our little size ring and we'll

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.550 
down to our little size ring and we'll
go<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.859> next<00:02:00.049> little<00:02:01.049> bead<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:03.380> pull<00:02:04.380> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
go into the next little bead and pull it

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.710 
go into the next little bead and pull it
so<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:04.890> got<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.429> so<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.789> pearl<00:02:06.289> has<00:02:07.289> two

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
so it's got to so that pearl has two

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.759 
so it's got to so that pearl has two
legs<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:12.410> then<00:02:13.410> we're<00:02:13.620> going<00:02:13.739> to

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
legs on it like that then we're going to

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.500 
legs on it like that then we're going to
go<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.250> through<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.840> leg<00:02:16.110> closest<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
go up through the leg closest to the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.220 
go up through the leg closest to the
bead<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.989> we<00:02:19.049> just<00:02:19.590> anchored<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.230> we'll

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
bead that we just anchored it to we'll

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.670 
bead that we just anchored it to we'll
put<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> pearl<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.190> then<00:02:24.180> another<00:02:24.510> leg<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.260> a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
put a pearl and then another leg of a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.640 
put a pearl and then another leg of a
crystal<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:27.540> gold<00:02:28.849> pearl<00:02:30.079> crystal<00:02:31.079> gold

crystal and a gold pearl crystal gold

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.580 
crystal and a gold pearl crystal gold
then<00:02:32.519> we'll<00:02:32.790> go<00:02:32.940> back<00:02:33.209> through<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:35.400> next

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
tight and that makes it stiff and it

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.700 
tight and that makes it stiff and it
holds<00:06:32.130> its<00:06:32.460> shape<00:06:32.580> in<00:06:33.000> this<00:06:33.180> ring<00:06:33.599> that<00:06:34.500> looks

I've added two strands of eleven o beads

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.710 
I've added two strands of eleven o beads
with<00:06:45.300> our<00:06:45.600> necklace<00:06:46.140> attachment<00:06:46.980> and<00:06:47.220> I<00:06:48.210> did

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
with our necklace attachment and I did

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.780 
with our necklace attachment and I did
attach<00:06:49.200> it<00:06:49.440> so<00:06:49.620> there<00:06:49.770> are<00:06:49.920> a<00:06:49.950> few<00:06:50.280> more<00:06:50.520> beads

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
attach it so there are a few more beads

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.680 
attach it so there are a few more beads
on<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.180> lower<00:06:51.390> edge<00:06:51.710> than<00:06:52.710> on<00:06:52.950> the<00:06:53.100> top<00:06:53.400> and<00:06:53.760> it

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
on the lower edge than on the top and it

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.840 
on the lower edge than on the top and it
is<00:06:54.840> attached<00:06:55.260> uniformly<00:06:56.130> around<00:06:56.400> that's

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
is attached uniformly around that's

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.990 
is attached uniformly around that's
important<00:06:57.660> but<00:06:58.350> it<00:06:58.500> helps<00:06:58.980> it<00:06:59.220> just<00:06:59.580> give<00:06:59.790> it<00:06:59.910> a

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
important but it helps it just give it a

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.840 
important but it helps it just give it a
gentle<00:07:00.030> curve<00:07:00.930> which<00:07:01.650> helps<00:07:02.070> the<00:07:02.220> necklace<00:07:02.670> to

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
gentle curve which helps the necklace to

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.530
