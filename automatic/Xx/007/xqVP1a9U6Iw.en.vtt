it up and you can see the symbols on
here<00:00:28.050> all<00:00:28.860> easy<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.489> do<00:00:30.200> same<00:00:31.200> with<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
here all easy to do same with the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.690 
here all easy to do same with the
14<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.710> course<00:00:34.950> when<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.220> engine<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
14 there of course when the engine is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.420 
14 there of course when the engine is
cold<00:00:36.000> oil<00:00:36.540> will<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.380> down<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:37.620> when<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
cold oil will be down here when the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.370 
cold oil will be down here when the
engine<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.790> running<00:00:39.030> hot<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:39.660> day<00:00:39.900> it<00:00:40.140> will<00:00:40.230> be

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
engine is running hot all day it will be

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.290 
engine is running hot all day it will be
up<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.430> there<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.880> much<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.210> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
up to there is there so much of it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.180 
up to there is there so much of it
expands<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.230> lot<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.650> here<00:00:46.650> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.130> see

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
expands a lot and here you can see

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.820 
expands a lot and here you can see
usually<00:00:47.880> through<00:00:48.330> the<00:00:48.360> plastic<00:00:48.720> when<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.680> at

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
usually through the plastic when it's at

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.700 
usually through the plastic when it's at
the<00:00:49.980> fill<00:00:50.190> line<00:00:50.400> which<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.670> right<00:00:50.970> around<00:00:51.120> here

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the fill line which is right around here

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.170 
the fill line which is right around here
but<00:00:52.710> once<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.010> had<00:00:53.160> those<00:00:53.370> things<00:00:53.670> checked<00:00:53.940> out

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
but once I had those things checked out

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.030 
but once I had those things checked out
and<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.629> seem<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.900> be<00:00:55.140> okay<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:55.860> going

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
and they all seem to be okay I'm going

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.700 
and they all seem to be okay I'm going
to<00:00:56.100> check<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.519> steering<00:00:57.059> mechanism<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
to check my steering mechanism this is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.350 
to check my steering mechanism this is
the<00:00:58.890> shaft<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.370> comes<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.910> steering<00:01:00.330> wheel

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
the shaft that comes in a steering wheel

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.930 
the shaft that comes in a steering wheel
and<00:01:00.900> it<00:01:01.590> goes<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> power<00:01:02.489> steering

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and it goes here to the power steering

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.420 
and it goes here to the power steering
pump<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:04.110> reservoir<00:01:04.619> sits<00:01:04.920> right<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.130> top<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
pump the reservoir sits right on top of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.870 
pump the reservoir sits right on top of
the<00:01:05.640> pump<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.720> pump<00:01:06.930> drives<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.770> believe<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the pump the pump drives I believe the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.600 
the pump the pump drives I believe the
revolve<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.509> it<00:01:09.750> meant<00:01:09.960> arm<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
revolve up it meant arm all right and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.590 
revolve up it meant arm all right and
then<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.600> rocker<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.399> can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.090> this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
then the rocker so you can see here this

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.310 
then the rocker so you can see here this
here<00:01:15.920> drives<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.750> drives<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
here drives this here that drives this

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.999 
here drives this here that drives this
tire<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> tie<00:01:21.600> rod<00:01:21.930> which<00:01:22.830> you

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
tire here and then the tie rod which you

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.430 
tire here and then the tie rod which you
see<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:24.149> point<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> back<00:01:25.170> there

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
see up to point out in the back there

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.190 
see up to point out in the back there
the<00:01:25.950> tie<00:01:26.190> rod<00:01:26.520> here<00:01:26.789> ties<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.360> tires<00:01:27.810> up

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the tie rod here ties the two tires up

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.859 
the tie rod here ties the two tires up
front<00:01:28.229> together<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.910> somebody<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
front together so that somebody is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
front together so that somebody is
driving<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.500> vehicle<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.640> turn<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.149> way

driving the vehicle you turn one way

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.749 
driving the vehicle you turn one way
those<00:01:33.810> tie<00:01:34.050> rods<00:01:34.320> take<00:01:34.619> those<00:01:34.860> tires<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.520> same

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
those tie rods take those tires the same

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.070 
those tie rods take those tires the same
direction

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.530 

if<00:01:39.070> all<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.490> looks<00:01:39.730> good<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.210> what<00:01:40.330> looks

if all that looks good and what looks

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.030 
if all that looks good and what looks
good<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.110> there<00:01:41.290> isn't<00:01:41.560> any<00:01:41.680> dripping

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
good is that there isn't any dripping

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.490 
good is that there isn't any dripping
underneath<00:01:42.370> it<00:01:42.580> there<00:01:42.730> is<00:01:42.850> an<00:01:43.060> excessive<00:01:43.690> rust

problem with the hydraulics now i'm
going<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.140> go<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.470> other<00:01:53.650> side<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.010> loss

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.550 

I'm<00:01:57.150> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> check<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> fourth<00:01:58.020> fluid<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
I'm going to check the fourth fluid that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.410 
I'm going to check the fourth fluid that
I<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> check<00:01:59.310> and<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.299> this

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I need to check and that is this

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.560 
I need to check and that is this
indicator<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.799> pony<00:02:02.070> tank<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:03.420> what

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
indicator here on the pony tank for what

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.960 
indicator here on the pony tank for what
is<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.840> radiator<00:02:04.200> fluid<00:02:04.650> if<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:05.670> was<00:02:05.820> no

is the radiator fluid if there was no

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.089 
is the radiator fluid if there was no
fluid<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.470> clear<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
fluid in here this would be clear and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.559 
fluid in here this would be clear and
you'd<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.459> right<00:02:08.640> through<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.239> right<00:02:09.420> now

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you'd see right through it but right now

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.240 
you'd see right through it but right now
because<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.080> hot<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.560> full<00:02:10.830> all<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.069> way

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
because it's hot it's full all the way

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.300 
because it's hot it's full all the way
it's<00:02:12.150> probably<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.900> about<00:02:12.930> half<00:02:13.500> when<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
it's probably to about half when the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.930 
it's probably to about half when the
engine<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.850> not<00:02:15.120> when<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> engine<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.290> cold<00:02:16.940> so

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
engine is not when the engine is cold so

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.540 
engine is not when the engine is cold so
if<00:02:18.330> everything<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.900> working<00:02:18.930> out<00:02:19.350> here<00:02:19.830> what

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
if everything is working out here what

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.090 
if everything is working out here what
will<00:02:20.640> happen<00:02:21.030> now<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.480> I'll<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.470> onto<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.920> bus

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
will happen now is I'll get onto the bus

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.360 
will happen now is I'll get onto the bus
do<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> basic
