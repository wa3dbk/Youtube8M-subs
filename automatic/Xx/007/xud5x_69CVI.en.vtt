"Hi, my name is Cornell Brooks.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:27.770
We're working in the NIH in the clinical center
in the department of laboratory medicine.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.750
Right now we're studying hematological cancer,
so blood leukemia, specifically acute myeloid

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.750
leukemia.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.570
I'm from Woodridge, Virginia.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.340
I live in Woodridge, Virginia, and I've always
sort of been passionate about science since

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.220
I was about in high school, but really I started
really loving science when my dad made me

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.400
read this book about Ben Carson.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.470
Ben Carson is the first neurosurgeon to successfully
separate two siamese twins who were conjoined

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.470
at the head.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.680
That really sort of got me really active and
engaged in science.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.590
Essentially what happens in these leukemias
is that you have stem cells, blood stem cells,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.970
and all these cells grow and develop into
any sort of cell.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.989
They have a target cell.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.229
Somewhere along this development there's a
mistake, essentially, and they stop in development.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.899
These sort of mistake cells end up developing
and over-developing and taking over the blood,

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.619
to the point where all the good cells in your
body, like your immune system cells, your

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.200
platelets, all are, essentially, they no longer
can survive in your blood.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.869
These patients will have, will be immunodeficient.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.789
They'll easily bruise, very vulnerable to
disease, bleed excessively.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.939
These are all problems of leukemia.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:45.140
You have to look under a microscope and see
if the cells that we're working with hold

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.140
HL60 cells.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.740
You have to make sure that the cells aren't
contaminated.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.420
We're working the hood which is a sort of
sanitary place where the cells won't get contaminated.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.799
We try to keep it as sterile as possible.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.090
All these cells, all these three flasks here,
are full of cells.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.180
Basically what I'm doing is, this is called
cell medium, and it basically allows the cells

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.080
to grow healthily without overgrowing.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.300
If we can somehow reverse effects and somehow
maybe use mirror 181C to target leukeimic

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.360
cells and essentially eliminate them from
the blood cells, that would be a huge medical

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360
breakthrough.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.910
When I first came here I didn't really know
that much about hematology in general.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.760
I just had the basic high school biology,
chemistry, and physics, but you know, working

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.340
here, I've been exposed to so much.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.830
I've been exposed to hematology.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.980
Leukemia.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.290
Working with medical research.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.740
You know, it's just an experience that you're
not going to find in a high school setting.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.930
This is something you really have to go out
and try to get yourself.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.540
I also thought it would set me ahead when
I applied to college and eventually to medical

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.540
school.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.600
To get experience of what it's like to actually
work in the medical field.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.900
Everyone in the lab has been extremely helpful
with me to sort of find the best way to be

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.370
efficient and to transfect the cells efficiently
as possible.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.060
We just did cell transfection and it worked
really well.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.430
The results from the PCR were pretty good,
not as good as I hoped, but ...

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.350
So it's been key to collaborate with them,
because they have the best understanding of

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.130
which methods to use, how they can help me
the best.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.440
I'm really passionate about medicine.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.510
I'm really passionate about the fact that
you can help people so much in this industry.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.180
I really think that if you're open and you
really want to work and you really want to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.960
understand everything that you work in, in
the field that you work in, you'll be able

00:03:33.960 --> 00:04:09.140
to learn so much, and you'll be able to excel
as you can go essentially anywhere.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.140
