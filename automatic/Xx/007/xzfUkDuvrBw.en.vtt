00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
okay here we go now I'm going to show

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.140 
okay here we go now I'm going to show
you<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.090> little<00:00:12.269> bit<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.690> cutting<00:00:13.440> glass<00:00:13.559> and

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
you a little bit about cutting glass and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.720 
you a little bit about cutting glass and
I'm<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.360> using<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:16.260> thin<00:00:17.010> glass<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.550> is

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
I'm just using a thin glass this is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.939 
I'm just using a thin glass this is
single<00:00:18.570> strength<00:00:18.840> glass<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.800> you

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
single strength glass the kind that you

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.120 
single strength glass the kind that you
use<00:00:20.119> when<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.240> frame<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> picture<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
use when you frame a picture it's the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.859 
use when you frame a picture it's the
easiest<00:00:23.490> glass<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.480> come<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
easiest glass that you can come on I

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.050 
easiest glass that you can come on I
just<00:00:25.019> want<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> feel<00:00:26.340> for<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.849> now

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
just want you to get a feel for this now

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
just want you to get a feel for this now
there's<00:00:27.240> three<00:00:27.570> kinds<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.140> cuts<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:29.250> we're

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
there's three kinds of cuts but we're

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.880 
there's three kinds of cuts but we're
gonna<00:00:29.460> go<00:00:29.699> over<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.529> regular

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
gonna go over first is just a regular

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.940 
gonna go over first is just a regular
straight<00:00:32.130> cut<00:00:32.570> then<00:00:33.570> we're<00:00:33.690> gonna<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:34.079> what<00:00:34.829> we

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
straight cut then we're gonna do what we

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
straight cut then we're gonna do what we
call<00:00:35.100> an<00:00:35.420> an<00:00:36.420> inside<00:00:37.079> curve<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:38.960> then<00:00:39.960> we're

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
call an an inside curve and then we're

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.760 
call an an inside curve and then we're
going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.649> an<00:00:40.860> S<00:00:41.520> curve<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> these<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
going to do an S curve so these are the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.729 
going to do an S curve so these are the
three<00:00:47.039> cuts<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> we're<00:00:47.550> gonna<00:00:47.670> make<00:00:48.739> now

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
three cuts that we're gonna make now

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.639 
three cuts that we're gonna make now
this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> glass<00:00:50.399> cutter<00:00:51.199> it's<00:00:52.199> different

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
this is a glass cutter it's different

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.689 
this is a glass cutter it's different
than<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
than the kind that you get in the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.619 
than the kind that you get in the
hardware<00:00:54.059> store

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
hardware store

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.470 
hardware store
and<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> reason<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.850> different<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and the reason it's different is that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
and the reason it's different is that
it's<00:00:57.600> got<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> reservoir<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:58.949> fill

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it's got a reservoir that you can fill

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.869 
it's got a reservoir that you can fill
with<00:00:59.190> oil<00:00:59.550> it's<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> very<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:00.930> small

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
with oil it's got a very very small

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.820 
with oil it's got a very very small
carbide<00:01:02.879> wheel<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.519> like<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> take<00:01:05.909> my

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
carbide wheel now I like to take my

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.609 
carbide wheel now I like to take my
glass<00:01:07.830> cutter<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.630> hold<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.170> I'm<00:01:10.350> going

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
glass cutter and hold it as if I'm going

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.700 
glass cutter and hold it as if I'm going
to<00:01:10.740> stab<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> glass<00:01:11.810> some<00:01:12.810> people<00:01:13.170> who<00:01:13.530> have

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
to stab the glass some people who have

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.289 
to stab the glass some people who have
been<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> glass<00:01:14.250> industry<00:01:14.790> actually<00:01:14.970> like

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
been in the glass industry actually like

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.520 
been in the glass industry actually like
to<00:01:15.420> hold<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.610> other<00:01:17.610> people

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
to hold it like this other people

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.450 
to hold it like this other people
hold<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> pencil<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:22.189> important<00:01:23.189> part

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
hold it like a pencil the important part

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460 
hold it like a pencil the important part
is<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:23.670> how<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> hold<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.259> hold

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
is not how you hold it but that you hold

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
is not how you hold it but that you hold
it<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.710> such<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> way<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.580> comfortable

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it in such a way that it's comfortable

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810 
it in such a way that it's comfortable
for<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.750> find<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.979> holding<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.340> stabbing

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
for you I find that holding and stabbing

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.480 
for you I find that holding and stabbing
motion<00:01:30.240> gives<00:01:31.049> me<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> lot<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.740> control<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
motion gives me a lot of control and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.859 
motion gives me a lot of control and
also<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.600> lets<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.369> pressure<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.790> my<00:01:35.880> arm<00:01:36.270> go

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
also it lets the pressure from my arm go

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.490 
also it lets the pressure from my arm go
down<00:01:37.079> through<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.820> through<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:38.850> elbow<00:01:39.479> into<00:01:40.110> my

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
down through my through my elbow into my

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.069 
down through my through my elbow into my
wrist<00:01:40.829> down<00:01:41.579> directly<00:01:42.270> into<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> point<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
wrist down directly into the point of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.719 
wrist down directly into the point of
the<00:01:43.140> cutter<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.619> able<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> nice

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the cutter and I'm able to get a nice

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.319 
the cutter and I'm able to get a nice
firm<00:01:45.570> stroke<00:01:46.250> when<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> hold<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.790> way<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
firm stroke when I hold it this way and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.780 
firm stroke when I hold it this way and
so<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> first<00:01:49.770> thing<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.340> dip<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
so now the first thing we do is dip it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.190 
so now the first thing we do is dip it
in<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.750> light<00:01:52.439> lubricant<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.280> light<00:01:53.939> oil<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
in a light lubricant a light oil that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.410 
in a light lubricant a light oil that
oil<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.930> lubricates<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:59.700> push<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.180> wheel

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
oil then lubricates as we push the wheel

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.370 
oil then lubricates as we push the wheel
along<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.530> glass<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.670> some<00:02:02.909> reason<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
along the glass and for some reason that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.709 
along the glass and for some reason that
little<00:02:05.219> bit<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.490> lubricant<00:02:06.090> gives<00:02:06.329> us<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
little bit of lubricant gives us a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.520 
little bit of lubricant gives us a
better<00:02:06.930> cleaner<00:02:08.509> score<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> first

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
better cleaner score so that's the first

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.670 
better cleaner score so that's the first
thing<00:02:10.590> we're<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.310> score

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
thing we're going to do is score

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.190 
thing we're going to do is score
the<00:02:12.860> glass<00:02:13.099> now<00:02:14.000> listen<00:02:14.390> carefully<00:02:14.599> for<00:02:14.870> this

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
the glass now listen carefully for this

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.020 
the glass now listen carefully for this
Sam<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.760> order<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:20.030> break<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:21.700> put<00:02:22.700> one

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
Sam so in order to break it I put one

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.220 
Sam so in order to break it I put one
hand<00:02:23.330> on<00:02:23.569> each<00:02:23.629> side<00:02:25.330> with<00:02:26.330> my<00:02:26.510> thumbs<00:02:26.900> on

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
hand on each side with my thumbs on

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.250 
hand on each side with my thumbs on
either<00:02:27.560> side<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.400> score<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.690> rock<00:02:29.989> them

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
either side of the score and I rock them

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.589 
either side of the score and I rock them
apart<00:02:30.700> now<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.849> next<00:02:32.180> thing<00:02:32.299> we're<00:02:32.450> going<00:02:32.540> to

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
apart now the next thing we're going to

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.580 
apart now the next thing we're going to
do<00:02:33.129> is<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.190> little<00:02:34.459> more<00:02:34.610> complex<00:02:35.120> because<00:02:35.599> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
do is a little more complex because the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.930 
do is a little more complex because the
glass<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.760> curve<00:02:38.180> there<00:02:38.810> are<00:02:39.849> once<00:02:40.849> again

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
glass in a curve there are once again

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.690 
glass in a curve there are once again
we're<00:02:41.629> aligning<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.200> molecules<00:02:42.739> up<00:02:43.099> but

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
we're aligning the molecules up but

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.839 
we're aligning the molecules up but
because<00:02:44.120> we're<00:02:44.810> going<00:02:44.840> around<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.890> curve<00:02:46.280> there

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
because we're going around a curve there

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.819 
because we're going around a curve there
are<00:02:47.060> lots<00:02:47.329> of<00:02:47.510> different<00:02:47.900> places<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.799> that

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
are lots of different places in that

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.699 
are lots of different places in that
curve<00:02:49.489> where<00:02:50.180> your<00:02:50.450> cutter<00:02:50.930> might<00:02:51.200> have<00:02:51.379> been

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
curve where your cutter might have been

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.470 
curve where your cutter might have been
tipped<00:02:52.040> just<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.700> little<00:02:52.910> bit<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.299> it's<00:02:53.420> a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
tipped just a little bit so it's a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.000 
tipped just a little bit so it's a
little<00:02:53.690> more<00:02:53.780> difficult<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.680> glass

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
little more difficult to get the glass

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.360 
little more difficult to get the glass
to<00:02:55.220> fall<00:02:55.400> apart<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.870> time<00:02:57.140> I'm<00:02:57.890> going<00:02:58.280> to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
to fall apart so this time I'm going to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.490 
to fall apart so this time I'm going to
once<00:02:58.940> again<00:02:59.239> do<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> same<00:02:59.540> thing<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.049> get<00:03:00.319> my

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
once again do the same thing I get my

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:10.569 
once again do the same thing I get my
powder<00:03:08.230> these<00:03:09.230> are<00:03:09.379> called<00:03:09.590> growing<00:03:10.069> pliers<00:03:10.340> I

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
powder these are called growing pliers I

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.729 
powder these are called growing pliers I
use<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.940> flat<00:03:11.180> blade<00:03:11.480> up<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.200> curved<00:03:12.530> blade

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
use the flat blade up the curved blade

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.339 
use the flat blade up the curved blade
is<00:03:13.040> down<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:14.930> put<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.319> pliers<00:03:15.560> right<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.370> to

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
is down and I put the pliers right up to

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.870 
is down and I put the pliers right up to
the<00:03:18.349> place<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.889> scored<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.639> put<00:03:19.849> a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
the place that I scored and I put a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.479 
the place that I scored and I put a
little<00:03:20.180> tiny<00:03:20.419> bit<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.750> pressure<00:03:21.169> now<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:22.010> don't

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
little tiny bit of pressure now I don't

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.289 
little tiny bit of pressure now I don't
know<00:03:22.609> if<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.790> could<00:03:22.910> see<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.359> but<00:03:25.120> there's<00:03:26.120> a

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
know if you could see that but there's a

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.690 
know if you could see that but there's a
shinier<00:03:27.109> place<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.799> can<00:03:28.010> see<00:03:28.310> where<00:03:28.579> the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
shinier place you can see where the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.930 
shinier place you can see where the
glass<00:03:28.879> actually<00:03:29.480> broke<00:03:29.810> all<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.349> way<00:03:30.470> through

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
glass actually broke all the way through

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.270 
glass actually broke all the way through
that's<00:03:31.940> called<00:03:32.359> a<00:03:32.599> run<00:03:33.010> that's<00:03:34.010> what<00:03:34.160> we're

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
that's called a run that's what we're

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.610 
that's called a run that's what we're
trying<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.579> do<00:03:34.760> now<00:03:34.940> we're<00:03:35.359> running<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:36.230> score

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
trying to do now we're running the score

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.369 
trying to do now we're running the score
I'm<00:03:36.980> going<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.030> go<00:03:38.150> up<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.480> other<00:03:38.660> edge<00:03:39.019> and

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
I'm going to go up to the other edge and

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.909 
I'm going to go up to the other edge and
I'm<00:03:40.250> going<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:41.410> put<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> little<00:03:42.650> bit<00:03:42.829> of

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
I'm going to put a little bit of

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.800 
I'm going to put a little bit of
pressure<00:03:43.099> on<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.489> I'm<00:03:43.579> just<00:03:43.760> putting<00:03:44.150> enough

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
pressure on it I'm just putting enough

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.360 
pressure on it I'm just putting enough
on<00:03:44.989> there<00:03:45.199> did<00:03:45.319> you<00:03:45.349> hear<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.959> popped<00:03:48.319> I<00:03:48.739> can

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
on there did you hear it it popped I can

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.369 
on there did you hear it it popped I can
see<00:03:49.579> now<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.819> it's<00:03:50.239> broken<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.959> glass<00:03:51.169> is

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
see now that it's broken the glass is

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.270 
see now that it's broken the glass is
actually<00:03:51.590> broken<00:03:52.389> apart<00:03:53.389> here<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.379> here<00:03:55.129> so

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
actually broken apart here and here so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.759 
actually broken apart here and here so
now<00:03:55.699> it's<00:03:55.879> pretty<00:03:56.090> safe<00:03:56.389> for<00:03:56.419> me<00:03:57.049> and<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.650> if

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
now it's pretty safe for me and and if

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.860 
now it's pretty safe for me and and if
you<00:03:57.799> look<00:03:57.889> at<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.250> edge<00:03:58.400> here<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:59.299> can<00:03:59.510> see

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
you look at the edge here you can see

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.150 
you look at the edge here you can see
the<00:04:01.569> run<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.810> glass<00:04:03.019> is<00:04:03.230> actually<00:04:03.410> run<00:04:03.889> right

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
the run the glass is actually run right

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.150 
the run the glass is actually run right
here<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.639> can<00:04:05.359> just<00:04:05.569> take<00:04:05.780> my<00:04:05.810> glass<00:04:06.769> cutter<00:04:07.069> I

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
here I can just take my glass cutter I

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.809 
here I can just take my glass cutter I
pull<00:04:07.430> down<00:04:07.639> and<00:04:07.940> out<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:09.799> separates<00:04:10.519> and

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
pull down and out and it separates and

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.349 
pull down and out and it separates and
both<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.269> our<00:04:11.480> corners<00:04:11.959> are<00:04:12.139> saved<00:04:13.209> okay<00:04:14.209> now

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
both of our corners are saved okay now

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.539 
both of our corners are saved okay now
the<00:04:14.419> next<00:04:14.510> technique<00:04:15.139> this<00:04:15.799> is<00:04:15.949> a<00:04:15.980> compound

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
the next technique this is a compound

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.520 
the next technique this is a compound
curve<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.570> there's<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.930> whole<00:04:18.139> bunch<00:04:18.410> of

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
curve so there's a whole bunch of

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.469 
curve so there's a whole bunch of
different<00:04:18.650> ways<00:04:19.010> that<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.519> glass<00:04:20.030> could<00:04:20.359> be

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
different ways that the glass could be

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.339 
different ways that the glass could be
holding<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.140> try<00:04:21.680> not<00:04:21.979> to<00:04:22.250> fall<00:04:22.640> apart<00:04:22.849> on

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
holding and try not to fall apart on

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:28.490 
holding and try not to fall apart on
this<00:04:24.349> one<00:04:24.590> I'm<00:04:24.710> going<00:04:24.979> to

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.530 

doom<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.650> curved<00:04:30.220> now<00:04:30.460> that's<00:04:30.669> pretty<00:04:30.940> pretty

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
doom is curved now that's pretty pretty

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.129 
doom is curved now that's pretty pretty
complex<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:33.190> in<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:33.970> time<00:04:34.900> we're

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
complex and so in this this time we're

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.950 
complex and so in this this time we're
going<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.500> use<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.919> nut<00:04:36.190> on<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:37.330> back<00:04:37.509> of<00:04:37.750> the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
going to use the nut on the back of the
