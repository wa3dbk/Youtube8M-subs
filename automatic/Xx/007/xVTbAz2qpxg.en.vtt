00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hey moment we are all back with 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.879
 white girlfriend 3 in this case os 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.799
 I bring something very very important for the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.280
 story zombies and for zombie mode 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 you know that is the most rooted 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.420
 two and the three more said that it could 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.940
 leave in one of the questions answers 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.710
 they did because they attract to speak 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.810
 they responded that the teacher is could 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.430
 it is very likely that he was in this 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.019
 new call of duty in one of the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 images in one of the videos that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.730
 they show on their official page that 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.009
 they teach a little bit because the installation is 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.200
 of what it would be because where it is located 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.090
 the company where they have the offices of 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.399
 star so to speak as it shows 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.770
 different corridors are teaching by 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.629
 zombies that go through there and how 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.149
 they have everything organized more or less and the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.980
 it's really cool and there's a 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.170
 blackboard that just then pass through the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.690
 side spend a few seconds and in those 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.910
 seconds separate the image and good for 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 the image so you can see what 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.420
 it would be this blackboard and that you see it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.350
 perfectly everything you have in this 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.289
 image that you are going to put now you see 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.149
 much better everything to notice that there is a 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.050
 lots of little things there are some things that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.460
 do not 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.260
 very well they can be but 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.210
 there are others that we can do more or 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.550
 less an idea first of all that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.370
 you can see look down to the right that 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.740
 it looks like a kind of shield that 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.890
 shield is the zombie shield and that shield 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.110
 is the one used in one of the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.910
 trailers that we have seen that puts it and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.710
 they stand just in front of the face and 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.049
 they start as a 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 as well as shot forward and kills 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.490
 to all the zombies he has in front 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.869
 as I say then above all that this 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.180
 that's why I wanted to bring you this 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.670
 image we can see that we have here a 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.140
 soul of this weapon we do not know anything is not 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.759
 had said nothing of a new weapon nor 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.350
 nothing like this weapon does not 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.540
 had presented no site is the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.869
 first time we see her and this weapon 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.229
 refers to sea 3 you already know that 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.970
 all this has meaning all the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.940
 things that are teaching stars all 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.679
 what the images that shows or that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.350
 we put a Twitter user who put the videos 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.240
 everything makes sense, everything has 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.970
 a why and here they do it again 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.610
 they teach different things again 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.140
 the hallways and there's a thing that calls 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.610
 very much the attention that would be this 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.950
 soul that are seeing seeing right here 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.120
 we can see it on the blackboard that would be 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.090
 the sea 3 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.070
 it's almost 100% sure it would become 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.410
 this weapon another arms the truth that what 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.870
 I rather doubt it very much like the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.430
 it surely takes root that as I say you arrive 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.190
 the teacher is because if they have put it 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 here is for something is because they want us 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.340
 and to give clues and what 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.900
 we are finding and it happened exactly what 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.909
 same last year I also went up also 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.890
 a video to the channel in which in albany 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.620
 warfare because it looked different images 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.810
 of the facilities of the offices of 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.730
 sledgehammer games and there it looked in one 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.440
 of computers on a screen is 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.390
 I saw very little the screen that would be 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.769
 as happened in zombies like walking and 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.989
 people who seemed like a bit 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.790
 strange I said in his day that he was the zombie 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.950
 and many people did not believe it, other people did 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.569
 and in the end it ended confirming that they were 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.340
 zombies here the same thing happens again 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.500
 they re-teach the facilities and in 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.940
 this case we see the brand 3 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.560
 surely that this flame becomes 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.450
 as I say because the truth that he paints 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.670
 pretty well it looks a lot like the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.769
 Rai won a little less to the sea that brings 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.780
 to the sea 2 apologize but yes that 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.760
 it looks a lot like the line so 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.379
 sure that this would be the new 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.879
 lava that you will have the game the most 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.650
 It surely brings many 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.930
 new weapons but here we have the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.220
 first of all that as I say we have 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.780
 discovered through this blackboard 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.410
 this blackboard that we have shown in 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.239
 a few very short seconds but we can 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.680
 get out enough costs the other things 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.480
 I really do not look very good or 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.730
 can appreciate very well in the image and 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.130
 that is a little bit zoomed and 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.019
 everything and have and it does not show too 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.760
 alright so he does not know very well indeed 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.250
 I only say the only thing that can be 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.530
 To know quite clearly, it would be 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.389
 the shield and the teacher that is supposed to 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.150
 we assume that this can be 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.650
 soul and that surely it is so that nothing 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.030
 I would really appreciate it if the video 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.280
 because the truth that all this kind of 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.780
 things are going pretty long 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.150
 work and found all these 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.079
 things because everything is fine has a 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.880
 point so nothing if you liked 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.410
 I would greatly appreciate about cesc videos 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.340
 East crisis to lose any new 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.340
 that always goodbye
