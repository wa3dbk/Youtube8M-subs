alright see what do you think it's just

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.259 
alright see what do you think it's just
a<00:00:16.619> little<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:17.100> barely<00:00:17.369> make<00:00:17.789> it's<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.119> that

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
a little just barely make it's just that

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:25.550 
a little just barely make it's just that
it's<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.869> job<00:00:23.240> on<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> treadmill<00:00:24.780> okay<00:00:25.500> so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
it's just a job on the treadmill okay so

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.859 
it's just a job on the treadmill okay so
remember<00:00:26.100> as<00:00:26.940> we're<00:00:27.240> doing<00:00:27.360> this<00:00:27.600> job

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
remember as we're doing this job

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.180 
remember as we're doing this job
remember<00:00:28.380> what<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> said<00:00:28.590> about<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.980> heel

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
remember what I said about the heel

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.939 
remember what I said about the heel
strike<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.670> how<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.000> heel<00:00:30.359> strike<00:00:30.949> absorbs

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
strike and how that heel strike absorbs

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.490 
strike and how that heel strike absorbs
the<00:00:32.129> energy<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.730> back<00:00:32.940> heel<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.660> sends<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the energy a back heel and sends that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.009 
the energy a back heel and sends that
wave<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:35.129> energy<00:00:35.550> through<00:00:36.089> the<00:00:36.179> foot<00:00:36.449> which<00:00:36.929> is

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
wave of energy through the foot which is

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.809 
wave of energy through the foot which is
propelling<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.620> forward<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:38.609> like<00:00:38.699> a

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:38.819 
propelling you forward just like a

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:48.720 
propelling you forward just like a
little<00:00:38.999> gentle<00:00:39.960> fingers<00:00:40.170> pushing

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:01:05.580 

you<00:00:49.730> sure<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:50.030> don't<00:00:50.089> feel<00:00:50.180> that<00:00:50.600> microphone

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.690 

don't<00:01:06.590> worry<00:01:06.710> Chad<00:01:07.070> you're<00:01:07.250> gonna<00:01:07.340> have<00:01:07.549> your

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
don't worry Chad you're gonna have your

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.120 
don't worry Chad you're gonna have your
chance<00:01:08.289> learn<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:09.530> technique<00:01:11.860> so<00:01:12.860> look<00:01:13.009> at

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
chance learn the technique so look at

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.480 
chance learn the technique so look at
the<00:01:13.250> shoes<00:01:13.520> remember<00:01:13.909> I<00:01:14.030> said<00:01:14.420> about<00:01:14.720> how<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
the shoes remember I said about how the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.820 
the shoes remember I said about how the
music<00:01:16.490> tech<00:01:16.729> causes<00:01:17.479> 20%<00:01:18.170> less<00:01:18.350> wear<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.590> tear

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
music tech causes 20% less wear and tear

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.469 
music tech causes 20% less wear and tear
on<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:18.979> leg<00:01:19.190> muscles<00:01:19.610> can<00:01:20.060> you<00:01:20.179> feel<00:01:20.360> the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
on the leg muscles can you feel the

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.060 
on the leg muscles can you feel the
difference

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.550 

20%<00:01:28.060> less<00:01:28.210> we're<00:01:28.420> down<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.840> leg<00:01:28.990> muscles<00:01:29.409> and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
20% less we're down the leg muscles and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.110 
20% less we're down the leg muscles and
especially<00:01:29.620> those<00:01:30.159> shins<00:01:30.550> those<00:01:31.450> hamstrings

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
especially those shins those hamstrings

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:55.840 
especially those shins those hamstrings
right<00:01:44.040> how's<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.070> technique

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.050 

use<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.659> power<00:01:56.900> Oh

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.440 

one<00:02:02.630> more<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:02.990> said<00:02:03.260> oh<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:05.570> was<00:02:05.720> nice<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.440> got

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
one more you said oh that was nice I got

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:48.100 
one more you said oh that was nice I got
excellent<00:02:26.860> about<00:02:27.860> 10<00:02:28.100> yards<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:47.959> is

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
excellent about 10 yards so this is

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.670 
excellent about 10 yards so this is
showing<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.500> quickness<00:02:48.739> in<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> speed<00:02:50.680> and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
showing the quickness in the speed and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.290 
showing the quickness in the speed and
how<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.010> shoe<00:02:52.370> using<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.180> nice<00:02:53.840> jog<00:02:58.150> back<00:02:59.150> to

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
how the shoe using that nice jog back to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.390 
how the shoe using that nice jog back to
jump<00:02:59.510> rope<00:02:59.660> are<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.709> bouncing<00:03:01.069> back<00:03:01.220> and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
jump rope are you bouncing back and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.870 
jump rope are you bouncing back and
forth

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
forth

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:21.010 
forth
you<00:03:18.080> take<00:03:19.080> off<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.470> back<00:03:19.680> foot<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.100> always

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
you take off the back foot you always

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.570 
you take off the back foot you always
step<00:03:22.020> forward<00:03:22.350> with<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.650> right<00:03:22.740> know<00:03:23.340> it

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
step forward with the right know it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.570 
step forward with the right know it
lands<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.300> this<00:03:24.870> right<00:03:25.080> here<00:03:25.140> gets<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:26.280> spring

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
lands so this right here gets the spring

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.190 
lands so this right here gets the spring
and<00:03:26.700> talked<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.910> Joey<00:03:27.180> bouncing<00:03:27.780> they<00:03:27.870> wanted
