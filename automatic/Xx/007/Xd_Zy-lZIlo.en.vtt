00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.450

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.099

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:28.859
 Here our preparation went well and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.929
 with every team you play for 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.570
 Do you want to come in the playoffs? 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.309
 this is the team fix 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.410
 In the long run, that must be the goal 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.660
 In the short term, it's about that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:48.329
 we find each other quickly and above all 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:52.140

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.270

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.850
 the fun at the rhine am read my 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.979
 last year has played the rides and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.659

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.840
 neck injury I have from behind 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.880
 get a punch and then I am 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 during the season to reha for eight 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.659
 flew to Canada for weeks 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.720
 that was almost last november 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.009
 a year ago I'm fine now 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.049
 use stature ratings women 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.340
 benefit yes hurt you already have 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.979
 three years in schwenningen the second 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.290
 league games have exactly the same level 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.720
 met now she trains here 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.820
 diligently day after day what do you think is it 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.619
 a big difference 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.880
 yes so I guess so everything says 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.460
 a bit faster and you 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.340
 you can see that you get deep 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.290
 But only times is better in the squad and yes 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.820
 but I think that the last games 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.259
 in the playoffs, too, this is level 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.590
 arrived from the dl on each 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.950
 case 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.800
 and where we would put ten against 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.819
 mannheim play pure skin purely what are 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.819
 your strengths on the ice 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.610
 I play very hard constantly 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.610
 but I can also act defensively 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.450
 philipp we have only strengthen so 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.870
 tell me a bit short leading to your 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.049
 Strengthen where are they exactly in the game 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:03:32.639
 think that I'm good and I'm going too 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:03:34.880
