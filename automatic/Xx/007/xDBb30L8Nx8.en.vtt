those corners considering the ability of
the<00:00:51.420> chassis<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.320> very<00:00:52.559> good<00:00:52.739> thing<00:00:52.920> the

does we'll have to wait until we've

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.179 
does we'll have to wait until we've
driven<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:17.040> UK<00:01:17.549> roads<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.920> very

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
driven it on UK roads so it's very very

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
driven it on UK roads so it's very very
good<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.869> niggle<00:01:22.170> about

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
good but I do have a little niggle about

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.620 
good but I do have a little niggle about
the<00:01:22.530> gearbox<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.130> wonder<00:01:23.520> whether<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:24.000> sixth

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the gearbox and wonder whether a sixth

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.380 
the gearbox and wonder whether a sixth
gear<00:01:24.840> isn't<00:01:25.229> required<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.430> an<00:01:27.000> awful<00:01:27.299> lot

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
gear isn't required I know an awful lot

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.999 
gear isn't required I know an awful lot
of<00:01:27.420> people<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:27.900> only<00:01:28.049> use<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.439> car<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.799> town

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
of people will only use this car in town

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.370 
of people will only use this car in town
and<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.270> adding<00:01:30.600> an<00:01:30.689> extra<00:01:30.990> cog<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and I know that adding an extra cog to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380 
and I know that adding an extra cog to
the<00:01:31.470> gearbox<00:01:31.650> brings<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.700> weight<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the gearbox brings more weight so you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
the gearbox brings more weight so you
might<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> benefit<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
might not get the benefit but but the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.850 
might not get the benefit but but the
times<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> motorway<00:01:37.020> or

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
times that you do go on the motorway or

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.430 
times that you do go on the motorway or
if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> lot<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.610> away<00:01:38.850> miles

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
if you do a lot about away miles

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.220 
if you do a lot about away miles
it<00:01:39.650> would<00:01:39.860> be<00:01:40.010> useful<00:01:40.450> it's<00:01:41.450> not<00:01:41.720> unusual<00:01:41.840> for

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
it would be useful it's not unusual for

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.080 
it would be useful it's not unusual for
a<00:01:42.440> supermini<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:43.280> be<00:01:43.370> working<00:01:43.700> at<00:01:43.790> high<00:01:43.940> engine
