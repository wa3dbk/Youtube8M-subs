00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Tomorrow was not friendly here 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.150
 armed with a knife 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:16.350
 my other a new monitor 28 just 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:19.380
 190 d and samsung is one 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.560
 initial payment with 4 km resp 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.080
 our hd called otherwise only as good 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.099
 like a normal standard which 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.480
 currently 1080p monitor a resolution he 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.160
 and some may also know about that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.320
 So watch TV tv on the amounts 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.820
 recovery electric markets time and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.870
 sell and point to the tv 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.969
 does not make much sense because I still have 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.430
 not so much video footage alone 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.809
 tv market year not or blu ray of 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.520
 jpk or later comes that for 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.910
 gamer is already doing a lot more now 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940
 sense 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.579
 you can play the fight almost all 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.440
 also older and I hope that we 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.390
 by having my quality on youtube 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.409
 i may be able to boost whole people 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.210
 the catholic groups or on 1504 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.710
 there's also or even on the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.030
 Mobile must quality here later 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.840
 will be able to implement that and I am 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.590
 curious how to get yes I wanted him 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.049
 actually buy 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.470
 but this one has had with the google 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.750
 Coop and aside a side allround 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.170
 risk since I am also very technical 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.299
 am interested 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.290
 also has technology pages with this page 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.460
 a reader written on it tags 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.680
 do something like in game and here 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.130
 is equal windspiel he participated 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.710
 plays today a man has to carry 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.259
 of course what do play and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.700
 describe photo kn I have a video 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.369
 did that sent there completely 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.470
 normal smoke could and the ramsau 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.780
 monitor lost lots which of course 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.560
 I think he avoided the book profit 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:05.130
 creates chances relatively well 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.530
 because in the organic market was also selected 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.010
 these engines would have written the pik 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.540
 credit and keep the motto of the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.900
 monitor comes because otherwise even currently 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.690
 540 euro i link energy 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.830
 description and I would say so 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 on with the unboxing 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.209
 u 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.270
 eat 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.030
 July 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.710
 show yourself 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.940
 the chance 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.800
 the 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.800
 think 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.800
 neuss 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.640
 wg 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.240
 I give birth 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.120
 presented 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.770
 Let's take a quick look at the facts and what 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.190
 a 4k monitor with ultra high definition 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.760
 resolution that is 3840 x 2160 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.370
 still he has a wide variety of 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.470
 functionally two hdmi connections 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.290
 displayport connection which one also 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.730
 should use there 60 hertz 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.670
 allows and you therefore obligates the 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.120
 has apps and use it on reading 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.020
 can 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.900
 He also has one in it 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.720
 HDMI connection with 30 times 30 now the 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.520
 reha training and one with 60 years 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.220
 that would go on too but the 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.920
 function picture in picture 2.0 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.930
 that means you can almost a big picture 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.740
 on colors and has a little in addition 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.040
 medium tv picture open so you would find 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.270
 incidentally, while surfing costs 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.860
 furthermore one has also the picture in 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.270
 picture function means you can to 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.250
 example now times a windows open 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.800
 have shared the screen and had 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.620
 on the other side his xbox 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.850
 or playstation or whatever 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.850
 but then the 1 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.380
 that is the contrast and everything becomes 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.330
 fixed down a bit automatically 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.050
 that you have more eyes for a long time 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.180
 Personally, I do not use the pc 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.580
 already five times it goes by monitor because 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.000
 then I spring to the coming too 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.830
 the same 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.030
 and of course I want that again 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.280
 go then there are views abrasion 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.170
 means that the screen is not like that 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.880
 especially the taliban sometimes stains 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.940
 it also receives the with the camera 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.970
 or so monitors have seen that 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.420
 this flickr is also a technology that 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.630
 has and then the course was the 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.730
 interesting technology for us gamer that 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.320
 Picture thus the frequency of 60 hertz becomes 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.880
 adapted to the screen and the 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.520
 graphics card adapt to each other 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.740
 that no pictures are torn 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.090
 and so on and so forth I will 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.920
 Once again everything comes in the 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.850
 whole functions to a sufficient 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.080
 get stuck 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.210
 that should be the small one for now 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.790
 unboxing its now come fittings 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.830
 content of the package and was of course the 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.530
 monitor in it with a stand that is 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.480
 yes, quite clearly that should when buying a car 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.360
 Furthermore, there are loads of instructions 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.190
 warranty cards and algae 240 no jones 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.860
 read through then there is still a send 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.700
 Sticker man look here like look 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.160
 more energy efficient help and can you 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.370
 then stick somewhere on the sturgeon then 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.110
 once again a driver cd with the with 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.030
 the handbook for what the 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.970
 driver cd I do not know exactly 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.970
 I've also installed then there 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:20.060
 there is still a hdmi cable and a 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.160
 displayport cable and of course that 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.240
 power adapter 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.070
 I especially like that the 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.140
 cables are attached so that you look 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.790
 decide what you have to do and 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.530
 do not buy the monitor first and then 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.320
 you realize that you have the cable 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.430
 do not wait until 15 of the days until then 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.410
 Finally 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.470
 the cable shipments arrive and 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.150
 thank you very much for looking i hope 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.710
 you liked the unboxing 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.100
 if so what I like a thumb 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:50.470
 because the test report will follow soon 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.470
 and mean mine and bye
