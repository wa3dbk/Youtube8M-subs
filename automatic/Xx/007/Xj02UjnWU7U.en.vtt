okay now quite some detail

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.800 
okay now quite some detail
I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:31.470> there's<00:01:31.650> everything<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.810> millions

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
I think there's everything that millions

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.890 
I think there's everything that millions
of<00:01:33.990> variants<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.710> also<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> Simpsons<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.000> think

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
of variants as also the Simpsons I think

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.960 
of variants as also the Simpsons I think
a<00:01:37.049> PC<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:38.299> PE<00:01:39.299> set<00:01:40.250> cooperated<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.369> every

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
a PC a PE set cooperated with every

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.069 
a PC a PE set cooperated with every
anybody<00:01:42.509> within<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.869> will

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
anybody within there so I think I will

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.359 
anybody within there so I think I will
fill<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.590> donate<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.220> also<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.790> pencil

fill up to donate and also just pencil

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.560 
fill up to donate and also just pencil
so<00:01:50.369> inter

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so inter

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.639 
so inter
filing<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:53.130> annoying<00:01:53.520> isn't<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
filing it up is really annoying isn't it

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.899 
filing it up is really annoying isn't it
so<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.479> work<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.320> safe<00:01:58.829> later<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.490> gets

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
so all the work is safe later on gets

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.950 
so all the work is safe later on gets
wasted<00:02:00.649> once<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.009> fill<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.399> up
