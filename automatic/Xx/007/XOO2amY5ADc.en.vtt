00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.919
 The condition I choose now is 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.569
 What a big runaway 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:14.669
 The city is high 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.689
 It is fine weather 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.060
 There is no today 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.369
 That means it's underwater 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.589
 Guang Ling Me's sunlight shines in and is bright 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.230
 Well then, when I say what to do now 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.849
 It seems like I am using this skeleton type 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.089
 let's see 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.089
 It is reflected in the body of the specialty 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.130
 Lol 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.270
 vod 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.630
 Gillette blurs 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.670
 Or depending on the angle 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.550
 that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.080
 Land improvement district facility feels that facility name flash ing 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.020
 Yes I appeal 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 It's fair to say that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.070
 The meaning of this kind of skeleton type color is 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.130
 Air is a spring Normal orange and money It is life at 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.510
 It is the same true orange as the meaning of color but 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.650
 US appeal is strong 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.650
 When you hit the same place over and over again 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.130
 From the performance with the tape of the previous year's victory 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.820
 60th 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.660
 Many times toss 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.480
 the same 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.460
 Auriika is responding 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.880
 There is such a feature 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.340
 Well I'm listening to use now 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.220
 I say you aim at the point of Don Moon 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.830
 Aoriika people in learning materials processing I'm throwing myself 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.540
 The following seems to be acting 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.370
 May be able to show 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.050
 Just prioritizing the difficulties 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.720
 Skeleton type 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.730
 8 minutes 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.730
 Deliberation of the body 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.360
 It is bamboo example and is rolled up by village making such as raw leader of this morning 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.240
 It's cloudy, so it's been a breeze and it's in here 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.940
 When the turbidity is strong, I 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.240
 Ordinary age 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.610
 Basically orange 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.340
 We use in priority 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.570
 By the way when you are going 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.409
 It is sometimes 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.819
 And I can not see the following I can see 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.109
 fundamentally 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.499
 At Shakley 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.529
 Yeah 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.359
 I apologize for not being able to see Miki Hirano 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.429
 I will get tired when it comes to 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:28.119
 It is no good to say such a thing 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.609
 While tax 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.679
 I was weak at that time at a fast pace 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.679
 At a fast pace not to let bi 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.459
 Listen to me 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.109
 Already at all 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.009
 I took too much ps 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.379
 In the data, if you tasted that for a long time without voice 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.009
 It is a rotation from gold business at that time already 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.179
 Everyone's orange so through skeleton type 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.319
 It was fresh but I did not react 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.859
 The sardines of the silver battle that the premise is different 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.639
 Chan 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.609
 Especially small Aoriika high 2 years 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.500
 Not too flashy 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.109
 Two days later 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.599
 very well 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.599
 What do you mean 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.079
 Don't feel it 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.459
 Water is attached to the size of the same size as water itself 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.549
 Most 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.549
 Now a bit of natural color 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.699
 But as sardines misunderstand 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.169
 8sk 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.479
 If this lights up 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.479
 If you are passing people 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:05.159
 Because I came to the front 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.159
 It is the first floor 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.660
 A little deep in the water 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.789
 But 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.789
 Still lower 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.809
 It's been a while, I guess 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:36.090
 Mr. Iwashita A little appy 2 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.719
 As it seems to be insufficient 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.129
 Color change again 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.189
 Lol 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.800
 It is true that I want to get it with a ticket 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.669
 We conclude by former job etc 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.169
 Clearly 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.490
 It is eco-friendly 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.740
 It is when you come to see 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.240
 If you are stupid, 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.150
 Color change 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.069
 It is for such a time 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.129
 Because it is various by all means large 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.189
 When you go to a dietician 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.800
 Own 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.800
 This right number increases 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.110
 various 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.110
 I would like you to arrange the shells 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.599
 By the way 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.599
 Daisuke Kondo 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.849
 If you don't like the Agenian snail 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.360
 I don't like it 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.360
 The taste is not so good as it is quint 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.870
 Appeal is strong when the cloudiness is strong 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:59.119
 Add a little excuse like that 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.909
 Miko 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.610
 Less than half the surcharge 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:31.379
 So as not to come to see 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.379
 What 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.169
 I do household use 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.919
 Because the color is Asian 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.930
 Rika also 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.930
 I wonder if it's a leader 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.050
 The horse race is 5-10 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.599
 It is a support site that is easy to see on the site, but from Wednesday 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:15.719
 Fellow is yellow 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:18.719
 It is an orange gold tape 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.039
 here we go 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.300
 Eastern Europe 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.129
 This is a little bit good 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:34.379
 The yellow of the head is using the site master's Ijuin 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:34.960
 It is 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.490
 Terrific 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.749
 Looks angry 

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.889
 It is the best to be a site
