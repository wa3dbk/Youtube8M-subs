00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.709
 what would you do if you buy playstation 4 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.689
 you understand your console you need 

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:10.150
 update it but your console does not 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.250
 update how would you stay in that 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.650
 good time so attentive because there 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.890
 many users in the USA who have already 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.530
 suffered this problem unfortunately his 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.320
 PlayStation 4 came with serious errors 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.449
 mistakes that did not even allow them 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.910
 download the update image of 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.220
 PlayStation 4 is an unusable console 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.850
 so to speak it is a very percentage 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.290
 low but attentive that the truth is that 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.570
 the news has brought tail and has 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.210
 surprised pretty and has spotted a 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.790
 little sony image 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.250
 not everything was going to be good they have appeared 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.129
 the first isolated incidents with 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.320
 some playstation four initials that 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.530
 yes the number of affected systems is 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.180
 lower than 0 04 percent as they are and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.370
 so we would not be talking about 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.980
 a very large number but attentive because 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.559
 the shuhei yoshida himself president of 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.899
 sony worldwide studios has indicated that 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.390
 are and are investigating assumptions 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.190
 playstation 4 problems that seem 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.440
 have happened in some of the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.750
 first units that have fallen into the hands 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.729
 of those American users that 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.520
 They are so lucky to have already 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.710
 playstation 4 in your hands to the lord 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 Yoshida points out that it is about 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.520
 totally isolated incidents with a 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.679
 very small number in relation to the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.929
 distributed units of playstation 4 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.300
 In addition, the company has issued a 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.759
 public statement in which he explains the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.009
 situation and they do it that way they say 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.440
 few people have reported problems 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.240
 with its playstation 4 consoles this 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.590
 falls within our forecasts in 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.720
 around the launch of a new 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.939
 product and most opinions 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 have been very positive is what 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.330
 they indicated from 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.860
 and many of you will say but of what 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.050
 problems we are talking good so 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.810
 Attentive because it seems that it is 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.290
 of errors updating the firewall of 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.360
 the console and in some cases 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.369
 a console that just does not work 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.710
 from the first moment by not extracting 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.289
 image is what we can get to 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.140
 find besides are and says there have been 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.150
 different problems reported what 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.950
 leads us to think that it is not a question of 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.380
 concrete error that can affect a 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.720
 percentage of consoles the number 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.000
 of affected systems is less than 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.980
 0.04 percent of units 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110
 distributed to this day so 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.420
 do not panic because very bad luck 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.720
 you will have to have to find 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.720
 you within that 0 04 percent 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.700
 of distributed playstation 4 units 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.700
 that's what I like this or that has been touched
