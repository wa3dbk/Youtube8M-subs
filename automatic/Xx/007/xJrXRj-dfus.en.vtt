00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 so hello everyone dear friends with you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.720
 again Andrew continues under the game h11 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.660
 and today we will talk about how to create 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.610
 your shed that's such a shack on 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.639
 water 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.029
 also attached to it is homemade 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.430
 door or also how to make such 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.529
 Here is a box which, as far as I understand, does not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.269
 has a maximum capacity that is 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.990
 you can put as many as you want 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.960
 so I want to learn a little bit craft 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.570
 I do very much for two days 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.440
 I was looking for scrap metal and metal sheets 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.660
 I barely found them 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.620
 dropped out from one zombie and pretty pretty 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.899
 do n't even mnu 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.850
 exactly what lucky because now 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.030
 find mid scrap as far as i'm concerned 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.579
 it is known very difficult so the broom can 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 find in the ordinary places together 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.129
 as a broken car or trash can 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.770
 I have met most often there secondly for 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.680
 start we need where is our step here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.439
 that is, a simple step that is, he is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.100
 more in size than mine 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.110
 The thing is my mail shack consists of 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 slightly less less 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.720
 materials and a smaller in size but it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.540
 just the only thing that was enough for me 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.030
 items and so to build us 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.549
 simple barn that's on the water we need 16 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.880
 nails for two metal sheets and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.340
 also we will need 8 wooden boards 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 what to build small 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.250
 shed we need four wooden 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.869
 boards two metal corners and 4 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 nail 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.040
 where are nails made nails are made 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:51.720
 from metal pieces of such here 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:56.450
 pieces and these bars but the pieces 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.670
 made from so-called scrap metal 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.939
 what do we need more for with silently to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.290
 we will need more metal corners 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.719
 Now we find them here they are metal 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.360
 briquette metal braces these corners too 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.550
 made of metal that is looking 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.220
 scrap he 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.020
 basically is the way let's say so 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.030
 more precisely it is the most popular material from 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.720
 he can brighten up almost everything 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.050
 buildings that we have in this game 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.870
 Well, here we have built SmO ears so 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.840
 that's the way and how now do the box 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.930
 we have a box called not just chest 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.780
 chest perviz english called u 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.080
 I'll tell you now how now 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.710
 now now l'art shelter then 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.960
 there is a long such box the only thing in 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.580
 than chip, I think I did slightly 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.540
 other 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.540
 this is a box that's where he was not there before 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.470
 watchman container I did this such 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.550
 small little chest here and it is made of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.680
 four boards 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.770
 he also makes one metal 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.970
 corner and some nails themselves 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.940
 Of course, everything is clear but on the other 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.440
 side look at this chest no 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.880
 no code 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.570
 encode like for example the door to 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.700
 simple basic shilda basic step and no one 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.610
 walks in until you break the door here all 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.950
 much more difficult, that is, you can go there 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.110
 put 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.209
 items in this container but any will 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.250
 have access to this container so 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.440
 make sure that the place where yours is 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.720
 container she is well guarded to 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.430
 no one except well in the people you need or 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.190
 yourself did not go there and did not take 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.230
 how can we protect our 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.630
 the container has a special door 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.760
 called but in door the door is not 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 breaks as far as i know consists 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.700
 she is of two nails of four wooden 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.510
 boards and two metal corners 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.540
 Sorry, I'm a metal corner 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.520
 only one and unfortunately I did not have enough 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:05.300
 slightly things and items to 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.769
 make a metal corner and therefore 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.880
 I did not have enough for the door so how 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.530
 only I can find the door and 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.989
 mandatory limit and then it will be possible 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.760
 it is possible to encode it 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.040
 I will encode later and see 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.990
 I will write about this guide and, accordingly 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.150
 on will hide in that place all that 

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.040
 itâ€™s just that the thing is 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.660
 Here is this our shed 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.900
 the structure it breaks down is 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.900
 white scale we slightly whiten with an ax and 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.250
 notice that the scale is in principle 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.830
 quietly she diminishes the trace quietly 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.810
 Pomelenochku but decreases it already I 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.910
 several times he beat 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.920
 I have no scale at the top even 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.170
 in general, and she is generally kind of unkillable 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.500
 that's how many school day falls and whites 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.560
 over it there is no and therefore it is impossible 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.360
 destroy about the box i don't know if in 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.370
 it tire him a scale or not but as you can see 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.920
 it seems like we too there is no scale 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.790
 strength that is to destroy this item 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.190
 principle, it's impossible, well, that 's all 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.320
 Andrew was with you! Like sign 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.470
