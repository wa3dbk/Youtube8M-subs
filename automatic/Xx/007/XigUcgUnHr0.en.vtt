but<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> game<00:00:40.079> flopped<00:00:40.500> because<00:00:40.860> they

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
but that game flopped because they

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250 
but that game flopped because they
designed<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.000> vehicle<00:00:42.629> based<00:00:42.840> game

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.839 
the first few weeks of after launch they
did<00:03:23.870> patch<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.500> from<00:03:24.799> it's<00:03:24.950> ridiculous<00:03:25.549> state

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
did patch it from it's ridiculous state

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.610 
did patch it from it's ridiculous state
but<00:03:26.090> once<00:03:26.480> people<00:03:26.660> figure<00:03:26.959> out<00:03:27.109> that<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.470> can

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
but once people figure out that you can

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.120 
but once people figure out that you can
adjust<00:03:27.739> ad<00:03:28.359> FMJ<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.630> akimbo<00:03:29.989> it'll<00:03:30.829> be<00:03:30.919> just

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
adjust ad FMJ and akimbo it'll be just

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.949 
adjust ad FMJ and akimbo it'll be just
the<00:03:31.250> same<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:31.819> just<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.569> tactical

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the same so just like the tactical

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.449 
the same so just like the tactical
insertion<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:33.470> suggest<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:33.950> take<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.340> out

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
insertion I suggest you take it out

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.099 
insertion I suggest you take it out
replace<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.269> with<00:03:35.359> something<00:03:35.540> else<00:03:35.780> possibly

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
replace it with something else possibly

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.670 
replace it with something else possibly
the<00:03:36.829> W<00:03:37.160> 1200<00:03:37.609> from<00:03:37.790> Cod<00:03:37.970> for<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:39.230> gun<00:03:39.410> is<00:03:39.530> just

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
the W 1200 from Cod for the gun is just

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.479 
the W 1200 from Cod for the gun is just
too<00:03:39.889> powerful

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
too powerful

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.729 
too powerful
and<00:03:40.700> has<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.419> longer<00:03:41.750> arrange<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.349> have<00:03:42.380> the

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
and has to longer arrange to have the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.129 
and has to longer arrange to have the
akimbo<00:03:43.220> feature<00:03:43.579> available<00:03:44.419> much<00:03:44.720> like<00:03:44.930> all

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
akimbo feature available much like all

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.930 
akimbo feature available much like all
the<00:03:45.260> other<00:03:45.410> guns<00:03:45.650> with<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:45.859> low<00:03:46.099> recoil<00:03:46.370> and

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
the other guns with a low recoil and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.720 
the other guns with a low recoil and
lack<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.510> idle<00:03:48.169> sway<00:03:48.410> this<00:03:49.069> gun<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.579> only

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
lack of idle sway this gun is the only

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.089 
lack of idle sway this gun is the only
one<00:03:49.910> that<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.180> believe<00:03:50.630> is<00:03:50.810> truly<00:03:51.260> overpowered

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
one that I believe is truly overpowered

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.240 
one that I believe is truly overpowered
compared<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.849> the<00:03:52.940> rest<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.329> guns<00:03:53.510> and

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
compared to the rest of the guns and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.970 
compared to the rest of the guns and
last<00:03:55.250> but<00:03:55.489> not<00:03:55.669> least<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.660> commando<00:03:57.410> perky

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
last but not least the commando perky

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.580 
last but not least the commando perky
from<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:58.910> first<00:03:59.150> moment<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.840> heard<00:04:00.049> about<00:04:00.169> it<00:04:00.319> I

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
from the first moment I heard about it I

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.740 
from the first moment I heard about it I
didn't<00:04:00.859> really<00:04:01.010> understand<00:04:01.609> because<00:04:02.510> I<00:04:02.599> had

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
didn't really understand because I had

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.440 
didn't really understand because I had
thought<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.829> knife<00:04:04.370> brain<00:04:04.700> was<00:04:04.910> already<00:04:05.090> too

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
thought the knife brain was already too

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.449 
thought the knife brain was already too
long<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.870> liked<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.230> knife<00:04:06.410> range<00:04:06.650> in<00:04:07.010> world<00:04:07.340> of

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
long I liked the knife range in world of

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.369 
long I liked the knife range in world of
war<00:04:07.609> which<00:04:07.790> most<00:04:08.000> people<00:04:08.120> thought<00:04:08.480> was<00:04:09.140> you

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
war which most people thought was you

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.680 
war which most people thought was you
know<00:04:09.409> just<00:04:09.650> useless

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
know just useless

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.080 
know just useless
but<00:04:10.960> commando<00:04:11.380> adds<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:11.860> too<00:04:12.430> long<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:13.030> a

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
but commando adds just too long of a

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.050 
but commando adds just too long of a
melee<00:04:13.510> range<00:04:14.080> increase<00:04:14.700> especially<00:04:15.700> when<00:04:16.000> you

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
melee range increase especially when you

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.390 
melee range increase especially when you
slap<00:04:16.269> down<00:04:16.480> with<00:04:16.810> marathon<00:04:17.410> lightweight<00:04:18.220> and

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
slap down with marathon lightweight and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.240 
slap down with marathon lightweight and
the<00:04:18.519> ridiculous<00:04:18.970> care<00:04:19.420> package<00:04:19.840> speed<00:04:20.799> boosts

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
the ridiculous care package speed boosts

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.240 
the ridiculous care package speed boosts
you<00:04:22.210> get<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.390> game<00:04:23.110> full<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.500> people<00:04:23.860> doing<00:04:24.040> that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
you get a game full of people doing that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.600 
you get a game full of people doing that
and<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:24.580> pretty<00:04:25.090> much<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.300> game<00:04:25.570> breaking<00:04:26.610> so

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
and it's pretty much a game breaking so

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.610
