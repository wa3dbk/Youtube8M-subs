00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.479
 friends we meet at the ranch the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.490
 risk here to the shores of amecameca and 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.050
 they told me that here they prepare the break 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.910
 the most traditional way 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.919
 so come with me let's investigate 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.919
 a little more about this product 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.720
 friends we met with Caesar who already 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.089
 has everything ready to teach us 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.399
 prepare the breaks and of course we have 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.460
 here the fresh milk that we just 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.689
 milk Caesar because you do not tell us which 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.100
 they are the ingredients that we need 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.449
 to prepare the fope rum 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.449
 mainly first 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.239
 sugar 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.520
 to carry out the ebro rompope 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.030
 and the egg up 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.030
 and that's it 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 the nut 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 and here you have forgiveness if we can make 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.560
 vanilla nut 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.289
 then all the ingredients 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.159
 and well, so we started what is 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.060
 the first step with 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.060
 this milk 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.430
 this is a true liter 60 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.290
 it takes 250 grams per liter 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.110
 removing 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.690
 and a little bit of carbonate 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.530
 a cinnamon stick 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 yes 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.580
 this will happen to serve 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.050
 it is important to be 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.050
 because if you do not hit talking 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.869
 and then direct the fire that's 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.540
 and what we are doing right now is 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.540
 to stabilize it 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.280
 and how long it takes you 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.280
 this part 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.880
 Well, it's a good time, I'm here 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.960
 yes since the least 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.960
 good this oblivion 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.910
 you have to have patience I do not expect 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.010
 that is another ingredient that made us 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.010
 missing and mention yes because yes no 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.040
 and we put it in 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.040
 then good after 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.040
 approximately 10 minutes we leave it 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.930
 after 10 minutes let's cool it 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.930
 here is true water 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.960
 and then we started with the 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.250
 we started to take out the yolks 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.250
 if you want I'm doing that 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.500
 here we have good 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.810
 plus 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.140
 how many are we going to 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.140
 and we are going to add the 3 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.780
 then take note is very important 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.780
 do not go no 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.350
 as it took a lot more color 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.350
 yellowish 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.210
 since we brought it since it boiled 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.770
 the milk will start to change the color 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.009
 true for sugar 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.440
 you have to put it to boil to eat 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.850
 so 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.850
 is ready to serve yes 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.630
 then as soon as it starts to go up 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.630
 here we go down 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:01.380
 if you look and grab 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.380

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.780
 clear, you come, pesito 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.669
 and the color also as much more 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.020
 concentrated and I grab it a little bit 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.020
 coffee for cinnamon 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.580
 right now we're going to 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.139
 cool to add the alcohol very 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.969
 all right 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.639

 in the presence of ships 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.639

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.289

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.289

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:52.229
 like a quarter of a horse a part 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.809
