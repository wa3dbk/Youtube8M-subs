00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:00.269 
and wax that'll help seal them up a

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:02.749 
and wax that'll help seal them up a
little<00:07:00.419> bit<00:07:00.599> better<00:07:01.069> I've<00:07:02.069> done<00:07:02.490> that<00:07:02.610> on<00:07:02.669> a

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
little bit better I've done that on a

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.189 
little bit better I've done that on a
couple<00:07:02.969> I<00:07:03.329> really<00:07:03.539> don't<00:07:03.689> think<00:07:03.749> that<00:07:04.050> makes

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 
couple I really don't think that makes

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.439 
couple I really don't think that makes
that<00:07:04.469> big<00:07:04.619> a<00:07:04.649> difference<00:07:04.800> so<00:07:05.339> I've<00:07:05.669> not<00:07:05.939> done

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
that big a difference so I've not done

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:12.079 
that big a difference so I've not done
it<00:07:06.509> on<00:07:06.779> any<00:07:06.990> since<00:07:07.259> I<00:07:07.379> did<00:07:07.889> the<00:07:07.979> first<00:07:08.129> ones<00:07:11.089> but
