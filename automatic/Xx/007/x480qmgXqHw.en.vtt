00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.530
 Here is what it looks like 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.990
 if they lose saint helen 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.740
 it's all the South Atlantic that can 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.740
 try to get through 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.980
 hard for the nerves and hard also for 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.980
 the body 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.140
 and there is a little laughing karim 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.629
 a first part of the tunnel 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.070
 that's it, what's magic in this 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.329
 moment is when you feel the boat 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.489
 restarts 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:50.179
 that it kills fabulous without voice 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.179
 goes back slowly 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.210
 up to the laughing suzan 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.890
 it's about half-past three 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.880
 I'm on the bar deck and for 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.880
 to catch is laughable 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.550
 we expect g25 sales in five six 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.550
 of them refused 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.960
 that's without a boat hat 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.960
 to straighten up a little 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.670
 they will move you 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.980
 crack a little bit really who gets in 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.980
 voltage 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:02.310
 we start to have an attitude 3 of 8 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.310
 rooms and sees far and and patches 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.009
 the clown fish 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.520
 my heart stopped beating too 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.520
 its ratings 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.050
 no 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.300
 we feel birds leaving 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.420
 the noise are more the same 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.760
 again a wake 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.810
 Oh 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.870
 I wanted it to settle the sails 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.870
 that's it restart 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.940
 one end of the tunnel because there is one 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.480
 other like that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.480
 go smart
