00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.770 
guess just to be out to the top if not
quite<00:02:04.789> because<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.060> don't<00:02:05.240> want<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.450> filling

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
quite because you don't want to filling

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.779 
quite because you don't want to filling
out<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.049> family<00:02:06.409> front<00:02:06.619> all<00:02:07.250> right<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.610> then

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
out the family front all right and then

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.949 
out the family front all right and then
you<00:02:07.939> carefully<00:02:08.780> go<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:10.610> use<00:02:11.030> students<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
you carefully go in and use students and

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.580 
you carefully go in and use students and
stir<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.560> all<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.890> way<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.910> want<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.590> couple

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
stir it all the way you want to couple

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.720 
stir it all the way you want to couple
the<00:02:15.910> sinus<00:02:16.910> all<00:02:17.060> FS<00:02:17.360> gonna<00:02:17.569> get<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.549> you<00:02:19.549> want

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
the sinus all FS gonna get so you want

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.720 
the sinus all FS gonna get so you want
to<00:02:19.790> be<00:02:19.819> sure<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.720> let<00:02:21.319> all<00:02:21.560> brown<00:02:23.410> okay

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
to be sure that you let all brown okay

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.120 
to be sure that you let all brown okay
so<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:25.940> if<00:02:26.209> they're<00:02:26.450> spinning<00:02:26.690> around<00:02:27.130> he

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
so that's if they're spinning around he

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.539 
so that's if they're spinning around he
put<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> top<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:30.549> okay<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:34.130> don't<00:02:34.190> plug

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
put the top on okay and you don't plug

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.059 
put the top on okay and you don't plug
yet<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.269> i<00:02:35.630> tend<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.230> actually<00:02:36.620> bring<00:02:36.799> it<00:02:36.920> down

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
yet so i tend to actually bring it down

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.620 
yet so i tend to actually bring it down
just<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.400> little<00:02:37.549> bit<00:02:37.670> because<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.269> guide<00:02:38.480> on

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
just a little bit because this guide on

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.020 
just a little bit because this guide on
the<00:02:38.750> fit<00:02:38.989> in<00:02:39.200> my<00:02:39.350> refrigerator<00:02:39.650> shelf<00:02:40.310> with<00:02:40.850> it

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
the fit in my refrigerator shelf with it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.000 
the fit in my refrigerator shelf with it
all<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.480> way<00:02:41.600> up<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.170> even<00:02:42.560> if<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.739> have<00:02:42.890> to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
all the way up so even if you have to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.830 
all the way up so even if you have to
predict<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.459> oh<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.760> know<00:02:43.850> halfway<00:02:44.120> down<00:02:44.269> no

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
predict it oh you know halfway down no

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.680 
predict it oh you know halfway down no
big<00:02:44.989> deal<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.680> put<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.549> now<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.329> have

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
big deal so I put it in and now you have

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.949 
big deal so I put it in and now you have
to<00:02:47.840> wait<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.620> usually<00:02:49.549> do<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.970> overnight

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
to wait so I usually do it overnight

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.900 
to wait so I usually do it overnight
just<00:02:51.410> because<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:51.920> works<00:02:52.100> out<00:02:52.250> easier<00:02:52.700> that

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
just because it works out easier that

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.810 
just because it works out easier that
way<00:02:52.940> for<00:02:53.359> me<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:54.109> general<00:02:54.980> recommendation<00:02:55.670> i

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
way for me but general recommendation i

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.819 
way for me but general recommendation i
believe<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.299> about<00:02:56.480> eight<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.840> ten<00:02:57.019> hours<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
believe is about eight to ten hours and

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.940 
believe is about eight to ten hours and
i<00:02:57.950> have<00:02:58.160> even<00:02:58.910> done<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.410> up<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.650> four

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
i have even done it just up to four

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.479 
i have even done it just up to four
hours<00:03:01.310> in<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.579> seemed<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> air<00:03:02.269> k<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.049> this

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
hours in it seemed to the air k so this

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:16.160 
hours in it seemed to the air k so this
is<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.579> hard<00:03:04.760> part<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.180> have<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.630> wait

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.970 

and<00:03:16.430> Freddie<00:03:17.430> finally<00:03:18.390> okay<00:03:18.990> so<00:03:19.440> what<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:19.830> do

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
and Freddie finally okay so what you do

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.380 
and Freddie finally okay so what you do
is<00:03:20.010> when<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.489> take<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:20.880> out<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.239> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
is when you take this out of the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.000 
is when you take this out of the
refrigerator<00:03:21.510> all<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.319> have<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.770> is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
refrigerator all you have to do is

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.059

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
gently and slowly press down the plunger

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.559 
gently and slowly press down the plunger
and<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:28.860> continues<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.550> push<00:03:30.120> all<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.360> the

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
and it just continues to push all of the

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:39.320 
and it just continues to push all of the
grinds<00:03:30.810> down<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.410> bottom

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.430 

okay<00:03:40.130> there<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.160> go<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.700> then<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.990> ready<00:03:43.230> to
