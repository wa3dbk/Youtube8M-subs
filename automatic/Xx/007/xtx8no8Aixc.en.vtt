00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.210
 a call that I made yesterday 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.289
 technical bodies some colleagues there 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.980
 They said what I had and the teacher 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.880
 had called me and we were agreed and so 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.880
 we come to this team 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.390
 this week's figure team is 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.790
 a remote place if we see it from 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.010
 tegucigalpa 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.140
 but with and martínez the scorer of the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.360
 real partnership for ones and the real 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.430
 society for others has done that touched 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.980
 apart from realizing that it is a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.050
 retired and hot place is also a 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.240
 dreaded site for any team that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 get there 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.000
 I do not know, because the teams always 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.700
 fear here is not hot is not 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.160
 because but he always has a fear he cited 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.590
 to come here touched but well 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.620
 provided they do draw here are 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.690
 good matches and all good 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.170
 like this forward there can be many 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.290
 in anonymity but few are given the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.140
 opportunity two three take advantage of this 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.580
 chance that gives soccer and rony martínez 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.090
 it's theirs 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.250
 look for that we set out to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.460
 work hard to commit to the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.230
 team and for that we work to take out 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.750
 champion this team 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.820
 with 10 of the players that anywhere in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.880
 your birthplace olanchito balm 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.790
 yoro a pair of stones anything 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.150
 could be a goal a ball an orange 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.120
 a plastic ball on a street 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.600
 now he forgot all that and I change for 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.790
 hobby stadiums and companies rambo 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.150
 thank you goodbye truth they are giving us 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.110
 things and this opportunity that little god 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.909
 cute has put me and to take advantage 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.880
 to this 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.569
 the debut came as always with nerves 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.929
 anxiety and wishes with great enthusiasm but 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.549
 no goals 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:20.109
 a little nervous for the first time but not 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:23.950
 all quiet group very black to talk 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:26.260
 and all good there I felt calm to 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.800
 the time of the game and I got a good 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.750
 party in that debut 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.000
 the idea of collecting everything that is 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.000
 sowing and the harvest is the goal 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.130
 the annotation is the product of the first 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.410
 need for any equipment but 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.990
 for the goals which has been is more 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.080
 special there were two goals that 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.510
 they liked but image that you are the first 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.330
 because it is historical the first before 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.330
 marathón and there the demos one 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.010
 the conflict is scoring 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.260
 take a name with a last name that 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.959
 stamp on soccer 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.230
 good as here we are all a team 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.819
 here we are all all on one side and 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.829
 there they all give me and as they go I have 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.980
 to solve and everyone there is a single 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.080
 team we speak with only one side 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.090
 real society goes out on the court with the 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.730
 so that their opponents carry their 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.220
 own balloons because the one that carries the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.250
 referee is only for them the directed 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.500
 by jairo with down a tactic of 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.769
 very good job and both of them all 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.390
 that are there in front excellent and very 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.030
 Well why what they are 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.549
 teaching us this is the earth with 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.549
 his people with his family and friends 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.640
 like to change equipment look one 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.730
 work for that age to 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.019
 climb and keep working right now 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.360
 focused here and if you give it a 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.269
 opportunity to another team well for 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.730
 for me at the time it was called kevin 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:18.150
 johnson to vega and arizona to the selection 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.639
 well as I tell you there, apart I do not 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.620
 like to touch it but there they look 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.680
 one only works is focused here on 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.169
 the real line and so I will continue until 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.220
 final and there if an opportunity comes up 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.880
 you can take advantage of them and ronny 25 years 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.639
 was born on October 16 two daughters his 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.949
 first season with the real society 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:45.620
 carries the number your team in second 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.620
 wild union and endless illusion
