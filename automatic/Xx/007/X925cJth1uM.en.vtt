climb<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:01.170> very<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:02.130> much<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:03.000> them<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
climb and I very do much like them I'm a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.950 
climb and I very do much like them I'm a
very<00:02:04.140> big<00:02:04.380> fan<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.950> navy<00:02:05.759> ones<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.390> yeah

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I think they look a lot better in the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.900 
I think they look a lot better in the
white<00:02:08.069> ones<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.610> can't<00:02:08.789> get

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
white ones just because you can't get

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
white ones just because you can't get
the<00:02:09.000> right<00:02:09.119> weight<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.229> logo<00:02:10.590> looks<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the right weight and the logo looks a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.140 
the right weight and the logo looks a
little<00:02:11.039> bit<00:02:11.280> messed<00:02:11.520> up<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> white

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
