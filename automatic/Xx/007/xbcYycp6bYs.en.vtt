00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.060
 polar bears spends most of 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.890
 their time on the ice but when 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.760
 starts to break up it's time for 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.760
 them to move 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.500
 their long latin ursus maritimus means 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.500
 sea bear and it's not a coincidence 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.060
 their wide webbed feet make them 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.130
 excellent swimmers we could observe 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.010
 some sources so browse up 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.640
 160 km but in general they spend their 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.640
 time to bask 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.490
 while the ice recedes the bears 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.050
 polar have one last chance of 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.190
 get off the train with a row because of the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.900
 global warming 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.640
 sea ​​ice but more and more 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.580
 long to form along the coast 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.440
 northern Russian gold there is only on 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.250
 the ice that bears are assured of 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.250
 always find to eat 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.460
 every year hundreds of bears 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.360
 find refuge on wrangel island 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.040
 to wait for his life back on 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.040
 the island is synonymous with famine 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.900
 but bears full of resources 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.760
 find ways to pass the time 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.050
 like a teenager having fun wading 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.970
 in the puddles 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.240
 this young bear does not stand up to this little 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.240
 pond 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.070
 that's when he sees his reflection 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.310
 but something even more 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.310
 interesting draws his attention 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.460
 or 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.340
 here is a show that few people on 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:28.090
 privilege to see a polar bear in 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:31.650
 fishing train and now the bear does 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.650
 do not know how to handle it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.819
 usually bears hunt seals 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.379
 on the ice floe but this one 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:55.349
 let go by his instinct of 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:55.349
 really surprising killer for a bear
