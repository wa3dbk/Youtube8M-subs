00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 a blow to the head about that 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.050
 it was an honor to jump good without warning 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.820
 in the now 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.820

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.380
 recently and very well the scene 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.560
 politico-mediatic an unknown 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.480
 candidate called walter wáyar who does not 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.640
 wants the thing and forcefully there are a couple of 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.530
 bizarre commercials the 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.270
 nice walter is becoming more 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.540
 popular than the choripán with chimichurri 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.760
 Doña tell me if this one is not worthy of 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.250
 participate in a political campaign of 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.800
 first world now an application will 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.110
 mind that you should not know that's why 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.110
 it is no longer 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.230
 known recontra phrases from the world of 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.390
 the Argentine entertainment or the world and 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.790
 goals the dubbing up tweets by 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.550
 minute for example of phrase mine memory 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.830
 of all of the recontra suck and he 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.430
 he did one more dash and dubbing politicians 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 Argentinian 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.159
 and when he says they say I'm bored 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.310
 tell me what you love 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.570
 towards me 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.960
 it's a skin of these spaceships 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.830
 to leave the atmosphere 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.270
 they will go back to the long 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.969
 stratosphere 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.969
 and from there in the place where you want 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:00.240
 I can not believe that I want more 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.689
 tell them that they are going to be respected 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.709
 these coins like dollars made their 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.340
 deposits is from the country that we have the 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.629
 Deposit 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.629
 she seemed lonely 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.920
 even as they wanted you to talk about 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:23.659
 this guy I show him working for 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.659
 a new city walks laburar 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.160
 efe 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.260
 he is triple barbara walters 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.920
 let's not forget how it was always 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.770
 when he was a perfect stranger to 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.470
 the masses causing such a sensation with their 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.330
 contagious to move the skeleton in 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.580
 less than a cock crows was already 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.620
 flying over the tinelli bunker and how 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.020
 we all know he has a special smell 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.670
 to remember painters with characters 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.670
 that decorate their bizarre crimson 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.640
 to walter wáyar 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.650
 if not 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.280
 what absurdity and ridicule we find in the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.360
 row to walter wáyar 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:38.290
 the casting has good wave but good 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.890
 wave is predisposed to be part of 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.890
 of the casting 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:51.790
 I love it does not sing badly as we said to 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.099
 walter and encourage to participate in the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.290
 audition takes two are four and the earth 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.930
 it's round cut the bocha and walter said 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.970
 I encourage me under the main study me 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.990
 I face marcelo iripino mora godoy 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.140
 aníbal pachano and you can think of 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:11.010
 and what you ask from me walter 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:16.070
 candidate those to mayor of jumps 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.070
 capital from the country that we have 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.510
 56 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.690
 56 years and you dare to dancing is 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.180
 that for less doubt and it's something fun 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.190
 if what cheers the spirit and cheers the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.740
 people I think you always have to 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.150
 Buck up 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.400
 is that they will not understand it ramón there 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.490
 to do things wrong let's repeat 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.410
 the things wrong how easy life is 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.760
 so we saw that moving very well 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.640
 very well away you already know how to dance you like 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.570
 I do not tell you that I fell in love precisely 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.020
 but I like it I like it I do not know how to dance but 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.020
 I encourage 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.430
 and if they carry forward they go 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.150
 I know that you are going to see me in this same year 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.150
 who I like 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.090
 would lead to that we have to congratulate the 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.819
 creatives of the walter campaign 5 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.830
 will be showing that when mango and 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.780
 a lot of head can be installed in the 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.409
 public opinion a candidate in very little 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.909
 candidate time when dancing because this 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.169
 it seems to me that the only vote that goes to 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.030
 receive will be the votes of the 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.030
 sentence wants science 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.650
 and he's going to keep flying the wig so 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.650
 It will change me 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:21.590
 when you think he 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.830
 he has not forgotten that he is just 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.830
 turns 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.460
 in a new world 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.030
 single 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.030
 s 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.200
 grandmothers 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.770
 i 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:50.770
 life 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.520
 chronic his production took it away 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.530
 in Youtube 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.160
 I think it was good jumping has 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.160
 some little problems 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:38.159
 I like the beach the first spot 

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:38.159
 continue on that I think it 's one more 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:57.810
 you do not have to vote in jumps I'm 

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:59.310
 saying city saying you in the 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.379
 criticism of politicians can be 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.169
 excellent politician I think that even not 

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:06.500
 is what I say is that it's going to tire 

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:06.500
 a little 

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
 but
