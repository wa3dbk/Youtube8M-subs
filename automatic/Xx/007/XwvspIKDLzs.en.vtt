00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 in the universe like this that threatens a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.280
 new video today is a video suspend 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.040
 uncle because it's a great great great 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.540
 collaborative and the specialty is 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.670
 stimulate assets is that all 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.760
 participants have a characteristic 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.140
 and it's that they have scholarships up so 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.880
 well I'm not going to name all of them because 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.250
 they are very many but below I will leave 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
 the direct link to your videos us 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.119
 We wanted to do this collaborative because 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.310
 we've noticed that a lot of people are trying 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.380
 perhaps to hide their freckles instead of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.329
 look the most of us and it 's 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.730
 I think we all like our 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.890
 you fret the apprehensions I have fondness to the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 hugs and all that each one of them in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 a makeup and that highlights her freckles 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 that the nasa rules that hide do not go 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.829
 to no tips to take care of them only 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.710
 if I do what is right and wrong that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.840
 is that in summer I use a lot that goes to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 sound a lot a lot a lot a lot because I 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 I think it would be used would have much more 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 freckles what he had said maybe 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.379
 It was wrong that winter does not 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.320
 in australia but it's not because I do not want 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.820
 because it 's forgotten but but since 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.650
 I was starting to talk about this collaborative 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.000
 team how to do a week and a half and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.640
 that helped me 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.760
 and encouraged me to a better crescendo like this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.870
 that this week I have been applying 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.180
 sunscreen and an important message 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.100
 is that without pay at school the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.660
 bother about your freckles do not worry 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.060
 Your freckles are beautiful 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.890
 imagine that it is like a blog a robot 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.840
 natural people who do not have freckles 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.210
 I wake up in the morning and it's a paper 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.130
 we loan them with a blog if 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.900
 natural so we give you a point to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.460
 please so now we go with the video and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.440
 if you like to see is reading edited 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.380
 up and subscribe is this one has not 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.149
 done in the morning I always think that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.720
 explanation as youtube and what I look like 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.759
 'Spongebob' when music awards and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.009
 bonanza and plan of near and more 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.320
 close and good appear with makeup 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.940
 I'm going to apply a white test 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.759
 time I did not do it and I'm going to blur it 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.590
 very very well and with a half color ladies 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.950
 I'm going to apply it for all my 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.950
 basin 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.780
 and with a coffee that has a shine 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.330
 draw once on the side to mark a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.399
 a little more deep and with a color 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.500
 purple well here it does not show much that 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.090
 it's purple but I'm going to try to delineate 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.980
 the cne lashes but the most 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.970
 hardness only reaching up to 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.180
 eye center 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.920
 and we will align below thing 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.930
 that looks like a smoked but not so 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.340
 loaded me here apply a medium color 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.810
 grayish with glitters above the purple 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.490
 because I found that it is very dark 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.020
 but if you choose a color 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.360
 purple the pull is not going to need that 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.280
 step and with a white color mark all 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.100
 that sector thing that is like that 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.330
 illuminated and with the little gold it returned to 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.330
 apply it on the mobile eyelid 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.349
 and let's delineate very well can 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.129
 make it thicker thinner with 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.129
 you like it 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.840
 and when our tear it Iluminemos 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.390
 let's go up to where we apply the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.370
 white color in front and now we're going 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.670
 to apply the concealer I always 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.469
 I apply drawing a triangle and 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.040
 important this so that our freckles 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:13.459
 do not look drawn is to blur very 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.459
 all right 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.220
 I always try to concentrate the greatest 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.740
 amount of product in the area to the 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.090
 But the freckles always fade 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.090
 much too much 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.689
 and always apply concealer to 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.370
 eyebrows because I have them quite dark 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.959
 and is had a problem with the tincture 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.519
 because the a tourÃ© but good so 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.799
 it was a routine of eyebrows I can do 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.650
 one and that's how my skin looks after 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.140
 enjoy everything very well and we go to 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.900
 contour 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.950
 you have to blur it very well 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.950
 and the blush 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.470
 now line on the one hand jordan me 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.470
 I really like that it's a purple 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.519
 always after lines plus their lips 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.230
 not just the shore because sometimes the 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.870
 Lip color is much lighter more 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.120
 dark and it shows a scratch all ugly 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.830
 and 20,000 lips with the color of revlon 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.830
 what is called 660 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.799
 we train our tabs we apply 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.799
 mask and we are ready 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.900
