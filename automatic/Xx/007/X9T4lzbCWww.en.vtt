00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.159 
I don't like being that specific with my
agendas<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.150> just<00:04:13.329> like<00:04:13.479> to<00:04:13.629> just<00:04:13.810> jot<00:04:14.139> down

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
agendas I just like to just jot down

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.890 
agendas I just like to just jot down
whatever<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.120> have<00:04:16.419> kind<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.750> big

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
whatever and I have kind of big

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.269 
whatever and I have kind of big
handwriting<00:04:17.469> so<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.620> needed<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.099> bigger

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:18.279 
handwriting so I needed the bigger

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.990 
handwriting so I needed the bigger
spaces<00:04:18.639> so<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.150> would<00:04:19.449> recommend

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
spaces so I would recommend

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.930 
spaces so I would recommend
the<00:04:20.739> Japanese<00:04:21.739> version<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.790> only

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
the Japanese version and the only

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.490 
the Japanese version and the only
difference<00:04:23.120> between<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.630> Japanese<00:04:24.050> version

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
difference between the Japanese version

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.890 
difference between the Japanese version
and<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:25.010> regular<00:04:25.400> version<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:25.910> again<00:04:26.240> no

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
and the regular version is again no

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.520 
and the regular version is again no
lines<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.710> then<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.400> think<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:28.970> dates<00:04:29.440> or<00:04:30.440> it

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
lines and then I think it dates or it

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.600 
lines and then I think it dates or it
marks<00:04:30.830> some<00:04:31.040> of<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.720> holidays<00:04:32.720> for<00:04:33.290> Japan<00:04:34.250> I
