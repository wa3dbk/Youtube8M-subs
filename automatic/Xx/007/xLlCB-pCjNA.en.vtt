00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.900
 hobbit 'or maybe fishing in poland not 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.790
 I know if there is a river in Poland where 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.699
 we can fish fish but nevertheless 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.220
 here I am again and surely I 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.650
 will be asking enough reasons why 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.110
 which I did not upload videos like 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.080

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 I thought when I named him the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.420
 point is that I already destroy my bitch bulls 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.000
 literally wrecked all the usb cable 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.790
 that connects to the computer and with 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.210

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.100
 Well, it 's nothing less than the headset 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.680
 eros on the part of cambias

 nothing absolutely halo 5 disappeared 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.890
 from the map 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.820
 nobody knows absolutely nothing about the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.470
 game however that recently a 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.790
 developer that was between photo and it 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.230
 he left to go to work with oculus the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.720
 new hardware system that are 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.730
 implementing virtual reality the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.430
 which is quite in the jce 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.049
 although to tell the truth they give me a bit of 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.330
 fear the reactions that become the 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.330
 people just look at this 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.019
 and then they wonder that a is scared 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.629
 please that is nothing and yet 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.069
 the guy is dying and well the 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.379
 point is that there is nothing information 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.599
 about halo I do not really know what is 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.700
 going on with three four three maybe 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.569
 are in their days and that's why we do not 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.550
 they want to give information or maybe just 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.580
 maybe frank o'connor 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.270
 that pelón de blazers is being saved 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.090
 everything for the e3 and well he does not lack 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.430
 almost nothing to make it e3 and finally 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.540
 we can know about our 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:26.520
 favorite franchises like gears of war 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:29.700
 4 as well as in the 5 I do not know if 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.520
 mention the crazy would say good as well as 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.910
 I would say advanced warfare well this frog 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.860
 3 and well, good band, we'll see what happens 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.560
 for the moment we will be reporting everything 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.570
 whatever happens and I'll be back with my videos 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.330
 as I usually upload it so I do not know 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.130
 worry and it's also I wanted to ask for something 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.030
 a favor 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.030
 Help me 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.090
 Many will be wondering why 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:59.580
 no, the hallo player 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:05.030
 and the only reason why I have not 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.030
 played that is because I met 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.240
 comfortable theory black ops 2 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.120
 yes i know they will tell me rat kids that maybe 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.420
 I have mental problems that maybe 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.520
 I need therapy and maybe just maybe 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.620
 must join me with yúgar hui cho but if 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.620
 I like call of duty black ops those 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.440
 It's really beautiful, I also really have 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.350
 goes by a friend who is called the devil 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.880
 gamers that by the way I send a greeting 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:42.030
 and well koudri goes I do not like it no no I 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.640
 they like it very much they will know that i am sniper in 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.970
 almost all games and good the sniper 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.249
 As soon as I do not like codes, I play 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.519
 black ops two because I use sniper always 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:57.579
 there will be people who will say that he used the weapon 

00:04:54.519 --> 00:05:00.939
 lightweight cabrona machine gun with mira 

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:03.400
 thermal hyperx and nonsense so do not 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:05.560
 they create the hides measures 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.770
 and well well I like everything yuri 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.449
 some fart I like hello hello is my 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.060
 life hey it is I love it but without 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.550
 However, I also have other tastes. 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.410
 I close to a certain game because they say that 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.810
 it's crap I just give myself the 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.210
 opportunity to play it and I will give my 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.060
 criticism or my opinion if it's crap or 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.530
 not in terms of code and black ops 2 for 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.100
 I do not suck, it's a good game and 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.960
 I like it now I also like to leave 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.000
 last a year and a half playing in the 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.820
 software community I knew a lot 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.639
 people I met enough friends that I 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.680
 I did over there and yet now I 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.180
 I'm getting enough code yuri and I 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.820
 I'm also getting into the community of 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.340
 color and I think I want to think about 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.350
 at any given moment be part of the 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.580
 community of josh howard and right now 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.740

 advice do not close to certain games 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.320
 because they say it's crap 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.169
 just try them and we'll see what 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.800
