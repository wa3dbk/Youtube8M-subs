00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
around you when you open it up you want

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.170 
around you when you open it up you want
to<00:00:55.840> make<00:00:55.989> sure<00:00:56.220> not<00:00:57.220> push<00:00:57.640> on<00:00:57.850> this<00:00:57.970> little

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
to make sure not push on this little

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.979 
to make sure not push on this little
black<00:00:58.450> button<00:00:58.780> that's<00:00:59.290> only<00:00:59.559> for<00:00:59.890> closing<00:01:00.309> it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
black button that's only for closing it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.450 
black button that's only for closing it
now<00:01:01.989> this<00:01:02.170> has<00:01:02.320> got<00:01:02.470> lots<00:01:02.770> and<00:01:02.949> lots<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.250> moving

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
now this has got lots and lots of moving

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.820 
now this has got lots and lots of moving
parts<00:01:04.020> which<00:01:05.020> is<00:01:05.199> what<00:01:05.350> allows<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.800> to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
parts which is what allows it to

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.950 
parts which is what allows it to
collapse<00:01:06.250> into<00:01:06.670> such<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.910> small<00:01:07.119> package<00:01:07.720> and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
collapse into such a small package and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.490 
collapse into such a small package and
so<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:08.800> needs<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.220> be<00:01:09.340> handled<00:01:09.550> with<00:01:10.500> some

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
so it needs to be handled with some

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.690 
so it needs to be handled with some
reasonable<00:01:12.040> TLC<00:01:13.800> but<00:01:14.800> there<00:01:15.009> it<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.130> fully

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
reasonable TLC but there it is fully

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.830 
reasonable TLC but there it is fully
expanded<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.530> 42<00:01:18.160> inch<00:01:18.190> arc<00:01:18.640> 36<00:01:19.540> inches

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
expanded this is a 42 inch arc 36 inches

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.760 
expanded this is a 42 inch arc 36 inches
across<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:21.119> now<00:01:22.119> I'll<00:01:22.720> set<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.350> down<00:01:23.530> and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
across and now I'll set that down and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.900 
across and now I'll set that down and
we'll<00:01:23.950> set<00:01:24.190> up<00:01:24.220> our<00:01:24.460> clamp<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.670> gooseneck

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
we'll set up our clamp the gooseneck

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.190 
we'll set up our clamp the gooseneck
unscrews<00:01:31.780> from<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.200> clamp<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:35.110> are

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
unscrews from the clamp and there are

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.320 
unscrews from the clamp and there are
seven<00:01:35.649> different<00:01:35.800> holes<00:01:36.250> in<00:01:36.550> this<00:01:36.640> clamp<00:01:37.030> so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
seven different holes in this clamp so

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.109 
seven different holes in this clamp so
you<00:01:37.390> can<00:01:37.660> about<00:01:38.410> adapt<00:01:38.860> us<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.310> anything<00:01:39.700> in

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
you can about adapt us to anything in

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
this particular case I'm going to clamp

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.859 
this particular case I'm going to clamp
it<00:01:43.479> on<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:44.200> back<00:01:44.440> here<00:01:45.390> I've<00:01:46.390> got<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.600> nice
