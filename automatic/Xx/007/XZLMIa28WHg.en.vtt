you created and I guess in an in a way
this<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.890> very<00:02:57.190> permanent<00:02:57.610> very<00:02:58.030> visual<00:02:58.510> way

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
this is a very permanent very visual way

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
guess you could probably boil it down to

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.960 
guess you could probably boil it down to
those<00:03:03.820> two<00:03:04.030> people<00:03:05.010> much<00:03:06.010> less<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.730> world
