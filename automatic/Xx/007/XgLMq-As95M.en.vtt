00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.510
 whether the room we are right in the middle of 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.190
 duisburg neuenkamp and here there is 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.750
 something completely new and you have one 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.660
 opened new furniture store 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.130
 but I'm not saying anything ordinary 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.520
 furniture store but one that 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:28.820
 specializes in Turkish furniture 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:30.649
 that's exactly what they find one 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.290
 other furniture stores do not like in 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.700
 Germany we want ours 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.830
 fellow countrymen who live here just once 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.080
 the feeling of turkey brings the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.570
 turkey and we want our type 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.160
 finish the provider and I say now 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.780
 probably not just the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.340
 Turkish people at least 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.250
 in the long term because there is indeed 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.960
 a lot of German meanwhile 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.010
 for many years in turkey also in 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.079
 drive a holiday and maybe 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.850
 interest because I might like 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.890
 said it is something else 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.869
 it shows just price not everywhere 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.689
 performance ratio is the good thing 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.130
 here too that we said the typical 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.780
 with the typical sellers 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.090
 so not only can help 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.249
 German vendor clearly we see exactly 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.020
 German but still the Turkish 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.819
 lands people with potty sales 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.350
 what would we think of her now? 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:26.560
 say what is that special about 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.560
 turkish furniture not the way 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:35.209
 So effective is not just just 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.579
 the functionality but also the eye 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.929
 a bit like that too 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.939
 this oriental touch maybe 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.939
 exactly exactly that was once 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.130
 and maybe a bit too 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.969
 background was just as I have heard 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.259
 the society for 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.529
 Economic promotion here in Duisburg 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.389
 the gfw not quite and authoritative 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:58.310
 involved you in finding this location 

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.290
 yes, they were very helpful 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.060
 they said for us that we have this 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.409
 find a location and helped a lot 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.860
 that we move in here at short notice 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.729
 could 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.890
 that the defense understood very quickly 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.780
 Now it's the furniture industry 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.360
 There is quite a contested industry 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.980
 you like many furniture manufacturers and also 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.930
 provider but I think with the niche 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.340
 which you have selected now yes if 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.450
 you certainly achieve good results 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.459
 we also want to hope strongly 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.590
 of course as I said we want that 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.560
 Exploiting potential as we too 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.290
 many typical customers and our furniture 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.239
 stop selling 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.940
 Of course, as we said, it's good that we are 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.560
 even the turkish sellers ours 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.840
 Of course, the country should also like the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.819
 German help now last we ask 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.380
 are here in the new fighter jet as already 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.980
 and that is exactly on the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.269
 Essenberger street which number and the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.760
 Opening hours from 10 to 19 o'clock and 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.019
 Saturday from 10am to 6pm time for her 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.430
 theme to come by, of course, the 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.870
 understand then thank me right 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.200
 Sincerely for the conversation and want completely 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.200
