Dovie<00:00:09.480> last<00:00:10.290> year<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> managed<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.099> talk<00:00:11.340> about

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
Dovie last year I managed to talk about

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.839 
Dovie last year I managed to talk about
this<00:00:11.790> bar<00:00:12.090> style<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.570> found<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.900> little<00:00:13.110> bit

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
this bar style you found a little bit

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.519 
this bar style you found a little bit
yeah<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.450> was<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> rig<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.139> you'd<00:00:16.260> show<00:00:16.500> me

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
yeah but it was a rig that you'd show me

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.260 
yeah but it was a rig that you'd show me
and<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.070> rig<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.460> served<00:00:17.699> me<00:00:17.820> very<00:00:17.970> well

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
and it's a rig that served me very well

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.990 
and it's a rig that served me very well
but<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:18.960> only<00:00:19.109> right<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.130> put

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
but I think it's only right that you put

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.670 
but I think it's only right that you put
everyone<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.539> rights<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.020> exactly<00:00:22.380> how<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
everyone to rights and exactly how it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.500 
everyone to rights and exactly how it
works<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.100> why<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.369> works<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:23.789> well<00:00:23.880> so

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
works and why it works so well so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.060 
works and why it works so well so
firstly<00:00:24.930> let's<00:00:25.230> talk<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:25.500> how<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.740> tie

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
firstly let's talk about how you tie

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220 
firstly let's talk about how you tie
okay<00:00:26.849> basically<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.599> standard<00:00:27.930> not<00:00:28.050> least

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
okay basically it's a standard not least

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.230 
okay basically it's a standard not least
not<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.890> whipping<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.279> KD<00:00:29.609> star<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.029> whip

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
not but whipping it KD star so you whip

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.849 
not but whipping it KD star so you whip
twice<00:00:30.510> pull<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> hair<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:31.710> whip

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
twice pull the hair back and then whip

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.459 
twice pull the hair back and then whip
up<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> shank<00:00:32.369> without<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> hair<00:00:33.950> okay<00:00:39.469> yeah

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
up the shank without the hair okay yeah

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.560 
up the shank without the hair okay yeah
so<00:00:40.680> you've<00:00:40.800> got<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.129> claw<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.059> effect

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so you've got this claw like effect

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.380 
so you've got this claw like effect
avenues<00:00:42.989> exiting<00:00:43.620> near<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> eye<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:45.120> why

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
avenues exiting near the eye now now why

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.209 
avenues exiting near the eye now now why
is<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.629> Tom<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.289> obviously<00:00:46.440> it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
is that Tom because obviously it's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.920 
is that Tom because obviously it's
called<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> mother<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> reason<00:00:48.780> well

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.369 

right<00:00:54.930> there

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
right there

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.350 
right there
the<00:00:55.949> whole<00:00:56.129> reason<00:00:56.399> behind<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> rig<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.120> that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the whole reason behind the rig is that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.810 
the whole reason behind the rig is that
the<00:00:57.960> hook<00:00:58.199> bait<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.980> critically<00:00:59.430> balanced

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the hook bait is is critically balanced

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
the hook bait is is critically balanced
so<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.180> doesn't<00:01:00.690> weigh<00:01:00.780> anything<00:01:00.809> yeah<00:01:01.530> which

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
so it doesn't weigh anything yeah which

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.250 
so it doesn't weigh anything yeah which
makes<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.460> eye<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> hook<00:01:03.629> light<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.080> well

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
makes the eye of the hook light as well

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
makes the eye of the hook light as well
so<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.460> lays<00:01:05.790> down<00:01:05.850> let's<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
so as it as it lays down let's have a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.920 
so as it as it lays down let's have a
look<00:01:06.869> at<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.610> it's<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> bottom<00:01:09.030> that's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
look at it as it's on the bottom that's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560 
look at it as it's on the bottom that's
gonna<00:01:10.200> sit<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:11.010> isn't<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.570> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
gonna sit up a little bit isn't it it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.640 
gonna sit up a little bit isn't it it
doesn't<00:01:12.930> look<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.290> cork

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
doesn't look right so with that cork

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
doesn't look right so with that cork
that's<00:01:17.130> making<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.909> eye<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.420> hook<00:01:18.600> even

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that's making the eye of the hook even

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.440 
that's making the eye of the hook even
lighter<00:01:19.320> which<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.340> turn<00:01:20.640> makes<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> point

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
lighter which in turn makes the point

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.600 
lighter which in turn makes the point
heavy<00:01:21.689> heavy<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.070> goes<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
heavy heavy so it's as it goes into a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.240 
heavy heavy so it's as it goes into a
fish's<00:01:23.939> mouth<00:01:24.320> that's<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
fish's mouth that's what in about and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
fish's mouth that's what in about and
that<00:01:26.340> hook<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.110> unnaturally<00:01:28.140> causing

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that hook is is unnaturally causing

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.890 
that hook is is unnaturally causing
problems<00:01:29.100> isn't<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.520> right<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.420> why<00:01:30.840> do

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
problems isn't it right and what why do

problems isn't it right and what why do
you<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.500> works<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:31.979> well<00:01:32.130> Tom

way through and then cut the caulk about

way through and then cut the caulk about
the<00:02:19.850> same<00:02:20.030> length<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.390> imported<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:20.870> when<00:02:20.990> you

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
the same length is imported so when you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.770 
the same length is imported so when you
put<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.290> caulk<00:02:21.470> into<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.830> boilie<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:23.540> will<00:02:23.660> go

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
put the caulk into the boilie it will go

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.420 
put the caulk into the boilie it will go
to<00:02:24.320> phase<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.620> wafer<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.040> stick<00:02:25.250> out<00:02:25.370> the

to phase of wafer and stick out the
bottom<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> little<00:02:25.760> bit<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.090> make<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.570> sort<00:02:26.750> of

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
bottom a little bit to make that sort of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.960 
bottom a little bit to make that sort of
the<00:02:26.960> brake<00:02:27.110> light<00:02:27.320> right<00:02:27.980> ok<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.790> and

the brake light right ok and and and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.780 
the brake light right ok and and and
finally<00:02:29.570> Tom<00:02:29.780> why<00:02:30.410> do<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.190> actually<00:02:31.520> fish

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
finally Tom why do you actually fish

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.760 
finally Tom why do you actually fish
quickly<00:02:32.180> balance<00:02:32.360> baits<00:02:32.720> over<00:02:33.110> boilies<00:02:33.530> well

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
quickly balance baits over boilies well

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.199 
quickly balance baits over boilies well
why<00:02:33.950> not<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.220> straight<00:02:34.580> bottom<00:02:34.880> bait<00:02:35.030> when

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
why not a straight bottom bait when

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.180 
why not a straight bottom bait when
you're<00:02:35.330> feeding<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:36.020> lot<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.470> books<00:02:36.620> because

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
you're feeding a lot of books because

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.949 
you're feeding a lot of books because
the<00:02:37.880> only<00:02:38.000> difference<00:02:38.090> between<00:02:38.390> your<00:02:38.720> bait

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
the only difference between your bait

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.210 
the only difference between your bait
and<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.230> boilies<00:02:39.500> out<00:02:39.650> there<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.980> way<00:02:40.100> at

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
and the boilies out there is the way at

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
and the boilies out there is the way at
the<00:02:40.280> hook<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:40.640> soon<00:02:40.790> as<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:40.940> take<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.150> weight

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
the hook so soon as you take the weight

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.280 
the hook so soon as you take the weight
and<00:02:41.360> hook<00:02:41.480> away<00:02:41.600> it's<00:02:41.780> exactly<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.140> same<00:02:42.230> as

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
and hook away it's exactly the same as

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.410 
and hook away it's exactly the same as
over<00:02:42.530> by<00:02:42.800> other<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:43.970> know<00:02:44.090> when<00:02:44.240> they<00:02:44.360> do

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
over by other so you know when they do

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.449 
over by other so you know when they do
take<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.990> in<00:02:45.140> there's<00:02:45.530> nothing<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.980> alarm<00:02:46.220> them

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
take it in there's nothing to alarm them

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.070 
take it in there's nothing to alarm them
that<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.700> could<00:02:46.880> be<00:02:47.060> something<00:02:47.570> dangerous

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
that it could be something dangerous

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.250 
that it could be something dangerous
exactly<00:02:48.800> right<00:02:49.400> brilliant<00:02:49.940> well<00:02:50.150> all<00:02:50.480> how<00:02:50.810> the
