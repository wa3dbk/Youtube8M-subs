hello and welcome to weather-wise the

hello and welcome to weather-wise the
term<00:00:03.360> El<00:00:03.600> Nino<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.170> something<00:00:04.560> we<00:00:04.740> hear<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> lot

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
term El Nino is something we hear a lot

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.160 
term El Nino is something we hear a lot
especially<00:00:06.330> during<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.720> winter<00:00:06.990> time

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
especially during the winter time

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.770 
especially during the winter time
because<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.680> has<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> well<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.730> unique<00:00:09.240> effect<00:00:09.630> on

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
because it has a well a unique effect on

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
what's called a Southern Oscillation

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
what's called a Southern Oscillation
which<00:01:12.150> means<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> high<00:01:13.049> pressure

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
which means that the high pressure

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
which means that the high pressure
center<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> eastern<00:01:14.369> Pacific<00:01:14.850> weakens

and the low pressure center weakens as

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.090 
and the low pressure center weakens as
well<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.780> bottom<00:01:19.140> line<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:19.950> these

well the bottom line is when these

well the bottom line is when these

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the western Pacific to come all the way

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
over into the eastern Pacific you can

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.679 
over into the eastern Pacific you can
almost<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.009> about<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:54.000> water<00:01:54.420> kind

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
almost think about it as as water kind

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.539
