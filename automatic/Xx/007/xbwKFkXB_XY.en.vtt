through<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.560> time<00:01:40.860> sure<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.610> fine

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
through that time sure that's fine

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.880

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
this this is like the base of is also

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.870 
this this is like the base of is also
always<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> same<00:01:53.100> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> ingredients<00:01:53.850> and

minutes cooking doesn't have to be

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.009 
minutes cooking doesn't have to be
difficult<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.269> think<00:04:18.480> that's<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.840> cheese

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
kind of soft consistency at which point

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.140 
kind of soft consistency at which point
we<00:04:26.070> can<00:04:26.220> add<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.520> some<00:04:26.550> great<00:04:26.760> flavor<00:04:27.000> some
