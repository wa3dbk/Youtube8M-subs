pretty<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.380> honeycomb<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.850> faster<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
pretty much honeycomb but faster and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.750 
pretty much honeycomb but faster and
smoother<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:14.070> better<00:01:14.310> user<00:01:14.640> experience

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
smoother and a better user experience

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.109 
smoother and a better user experience

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you see you can swipe applications off

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.120
