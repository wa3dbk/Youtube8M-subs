00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.089
 new video 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.790
 today it should be a very special one 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.940
 go product and indeed is a designer 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.929
 35 mm mirror reflex camera from 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.500
 demography 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.940
 but what's special about this camera 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.289
 that is that you complete the camera 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.109
 assembles itself 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.090
 he gets her such a set of the whole 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.220
 Part of the delivery and we can 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 then even to our own 35 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 mm mirror reflex camera build together 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.669
 here on the backside we still find 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.250
 some information about the camera that is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.190
 a 50 mm lens with a fixed 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.590
 Aperture 10 while the exposure time of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.960
 Camera is one 80 seconds 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.600
 but you can also long-term exposure 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.300
 make as there is also this picture 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.670
 Mode it just synonymous with others 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 there are modern cameras and there are too 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.770
 the possibility of a multiple exposure 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.969
 and the camera even a tripod thread 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.469
 Now we look in the carton again 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.960
 purely to see what I am here anyway 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.250
 in it is open all the way now 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.710
 and here you can now just from the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.920
 whole parts of the camera see that me 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.799
 the mirror box wedge from the housing 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.540
 part of the lens and so on and this 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.540
 We build ours from these parts 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.310
 own camera now we find now 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.600
 just the instructions how we do that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.880
 Assemble all useful 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.860
 which is quite extensive and it is 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.270
 not so easy his own 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 to assemble a camera 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 The whole thing takes just one or two 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.409
 hours and here are also still 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.960
 sticker with us with our camera 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.780
 in the personalized can and thus 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.549
 make it unique 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.439
 in this video it is supposed to be one 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.540
 little son a few first impressions 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.970
 and so on to give this camera 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.520
 and since the assembly of the camera just 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.380
 It could take one to two hours 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.220
 now a bit long when I put this into the video 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.070
 would pack 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.750
 That's why I'm doing this extra and now 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.860
 then each further if the camera 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.930
 assembled 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.149
 I now have the designer camera 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.310
 assembled we can already see 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.799
 here are also the front lens off 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.840
 that is changeable that means it can 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.520
 even more lenses for the camera 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.880
 appear and then it really is like at 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.490
 one 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.670
 real SLR just everything 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.650
 with interchangeable lenses the camera 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.750
 could be something better in the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.420
 hand lie when the trigger button not 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.060
 here but more here would be so 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.040
 it is not bad either 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.480
 yes the camera is of course made of plastic 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.190
 or that does not work now 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.950
 This makes it easier and easier to see 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.570
 we connect the tripod again and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.310
 up here is just the search where we are 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.510
 that's all we can open 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.210
 if even have a delivery 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.890
 to look through 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.110
 yes that was the first time hands on 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.270
 Here from the camera and a few 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.340
 first impressions am now looking forward to 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.800
 to photograph every case with it 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.370
 can and even this yourself too 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.530
 shape 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.060
 the assembly was not really 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.860
 especially difficult but not too 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.510
 especially easy has one and a half hours 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.160
 took but the instructions are synonymous 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.070
 very good which makes it easier 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.620
 then reassemble them 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.210
 Camera is small and light and disturbs 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.860
 not even if you have them with you 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.840
 the camera would then synonymous one 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.130
 I hope to give him a review as well 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.300
 be there again 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.300
 Until next time
