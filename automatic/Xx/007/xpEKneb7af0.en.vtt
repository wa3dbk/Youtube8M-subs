00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
things like that but let's just talk a

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.110 
things like that but let's just talk a
little<00:00:31.779> bit<00:00:31.960> about<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.349> importance<00:00:32.860> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
little bit about the importance of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.000 
little bit about the importance of
knowing<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.239> names<00:00:34.420> of<00:00:34.600> notes<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.260> then<00:00:35.650> also

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
knowing the names of notes and then also

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.910 
knowing the names of notes and then also
the<00:00:36.550> how<00:00:37.540> to<00:00:37.600> sort<00:00:38.110> of<00:00:38.170> figure<00:00:38.350> them<00:00:38.559> all<00:00:38.710> out

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
the how to sort of figure them all out

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.340 
the how to sort of figure them all out
just<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.670> fill<00:00:39.879> in<00:00:40.000> maybe<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.300> few<00:00:40.510> gaps<00:00:40.720> in<00:00:40.989> in

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
just to fill in maybe a few gaps in in

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.140 
just to fill in maybe a few gaps in in
some<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.250> your<00:00:42.370> understanding<00:00:42.850> of<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.000> way

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
some of your understanding of the way

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.500 
some of your understanding of the way
this<00:00:43.840> works<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:45.309> first<00:00:45.550> thing<00:00:45.760> in<00:00:46.030> terms<00:00:46.300> of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
this works the first thing in terms of

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.170 
this works the first thing in terms of
naming<00:00:46.809> notes<00:00:47.229> is<00:00:47.519> understanding<00:00:48.519> how<00:00:48.790> a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
naming notes is understanding how a

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.619 
naming notes is understanding how a
piano<00:00:50.050> keyboard<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.920> set<00:00:51.370> up<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.790> terms<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.390> the

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
piano keyboard is set up in terms of the

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.810 
piano keyboard is set up in terms of the
note<00:00:53.140> names<00:00:53.379> if<00:00:54.070> you've<00:00:54.250> ever<00:00:54.430> looked<00:00:54.580> at<00:00:54.729> a

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
note names if you've ever looked at a

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.899 
note names if you've ever looked at a
piano<00:00:55.059> keyboard<00:00:55.330> you<00:00:55.839> know<00:00:56.019> that<00:00:56.769> there<00:00:57.729> is<00:00:57.879> a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
piano keyboard you know that there is a

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.600 
piano keyboard you know that there is a
black<00:00:58.330> key<00:00:58.659> between<00:00:59.049> some<00:00:59.830> of<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.100> white<00:01:00.309> keys

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
black key between some of the white keys

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.030 
black key between some of the white keys
but<00:01:01.210> not<00:01:01.390> all<00:01:01.659> of<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.080> white<00:01:02.260> keys<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.589> this

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
but not all of the white keys and this

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.920 
but not all of the white keys and this
is<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.309> same<00:01:03.549> concept<00:01:03.909> on<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.449> guitar

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
is the same concept on a guitar

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.219 
is the same concept on a guitar
fretboard<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:06.880> need<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.240> know<00:01:07.420> is<00:01:07.690> that

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
fretboard what you need to know is that

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.560 
fretboard what you need to know is that
there<00:01:08.530> is<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:10.619> space<00:01:11.619> or<00:01:11.920> a<00:01:11.979> or<00:01:12.460> two<00:01:13.030> half-steps

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
there is a space or a or two half-steps

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.460 
there is a space or a or two half-steps
between<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:16.119> letter<00:01:16.360> names<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:17.020> the

and C and E and F let me show you on the
guitar<00:01:33.280> fretboard<00:01:33.640> how<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.299> works<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:36.399> one

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
guitar fretboard how that works and one

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.639 
guitar fretboard how that works and one
other<00:01:37.060> little<00:01:37.359> piece<00:01:37.539> of<00:01:37.689> terminology<00:01:37.899> that<00:01:38.439> I

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
other little piece of terminology that I

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.859 
other little piece of terminology that I
think<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.070> that<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.399> important<00:01:39.880> from<00:01:40.390> here<00:01:40.719> on

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
think is that is important from here on

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.169 
think is that is important from here on
out<00:01:40.899> we're<00:01:41.649> always<00:01:41.890> going<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.460> refer<00:01:42.939> to<00:01:42.969> our

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.720 
from E to F is one of those intervals
that<00:02:48.360> there's<00:02:48.599> not<00:02:49.349> an<00:02:49.590> extra<00:02:49.920> key<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.370> between

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
and C is one space a half step for all

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.219 
and C is one space a half step for all
other<00:04:43.520> intervals<00:04:44.060> between<00:04:44.360> all<00:04:44.780> other<00:04:44.990> letter

names it's two half steps or two frets
we<00:04:50.120> also<00:04:50.300> call<00:04:50.569> that<00:04:50.720> a<00:04:50.750> whole<00:04:50.960> step<00:04:51.169> okay

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
we also call that a whole step okay

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.950 
we also call that a whole step okay
