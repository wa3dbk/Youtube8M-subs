00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.800 
you using the stock for the stem of the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
cauliflower because cauliflower is

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.319 
cauliflower because cauliflower is
expensive<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.799> has<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.370> same<00:03:36.549> flavor<00:03:36.910> as<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
expensive it has the same flavor as the

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.390 
expensive it has the same flavor as the
florets<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.880> recommend<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.900> and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
but it's really nice to have fresh

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.510 
but it's really nice to have fresh
low-carb<00:04:55.979> that's<00:04:56.979> hot

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
low-carb that's hot

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.279 
low-carb that's hot
I<00:05:00.330> think<00:05:01.330> I'm<00:05:01.419> going<00:05:01.599> to<00:05:01.630> have<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.840> wait<00:05:02.050> and

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
I think I'm going to have to wait and

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.540 
I think I'm going to have to wait and
let<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:02.620> cool<00:05:02.860> off<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.160> little<00:05:03.310> bit<00:05:03.550> more

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
let this cool off a little bit more

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.040 
let this cool off a little bit more
there<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.580> let<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.030> cool<00:05:07.210> down<00:05:07.509> a<00:05:07.539> little<00:05:07.810> bit

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
there I let it cool down a little bit

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.529 
there I let it cool down a little bit
because<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.620> was<00:05:08.800> quite<00:05:09.370> warm<00:05:09.789> when<00:05:10.090> I<00:05:10.120> first

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
because it was quite warm when I first

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.499 
because it was quite warm when I first
started<00:05:10.960> doing<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:12.909> just<00:05:13.210> taking

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
started doing this so you just taking

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.010 
started doing this so you just taking
small<00:05:13.840> sections<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:15.240> wringing<00:05:16.240> out<00:05:16.419> the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
small sections and wringing out the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.320 
small sections and wringing out the
cauliflower<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.159> this<00:05:18.669> is<00:05:18.819> how<00:05:18.940> much<00:05:19.090> water

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
cauliflower and this is how much water

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.820 
cauliflower and this is how much water
I've<00:05:19.630> gotten<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:20.229> far<00:05:20.259> out<00:05:20.650> of<00:05:20.680> the

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
I've gotten so far out of the

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.890 
I've gotten so far out of the
cauliflower<00:05:21.280> by<00:05:21.759> doing<00:05:22.090> this<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.750> I<00:05:22.810> don't

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
cauliflower by doing this so I don't

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.930 
cauliflower by doing this so I don't
have<00:05:23.139> a<00:05:23.169> good<00:05:23.289> left<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:23.949> then<00:05:24.580> we're<00:05:24.759> going<00:05:24.849> to

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
have a good left and then we're going to

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.779 
have a good left and then we're going to
get<00:05:25.060> started<00:05:25.330> on<00:05:25.599> making<00:05:26.110> our<00:05:26.320> tortillas<00:05:27.039> so<00:05:27.759> I

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
get started on making our tortillas so I

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.700 
get started on making our tortillas so I
squeeze<00:05:28.180> out<00:05:28.389> as<00:05:28.570> much<00:05:28.900> as<00:05:29.139> water<00:05:29.440> as<00:05:29.650> I

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
squeeze out as much as water as I

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.879 
squeeze out as much as water as I
possibly<00:05:30.250> can<00:05:30.729> from<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.690> cauliflower<00:05:32.409> and

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
possibly can from the cauliflower and

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.640 
possibly can from the cauliflower and
this<00:05:33.250> is<00:05:33.430> actually<00:05:33.940> how<00:05:34.210> much<00:05:34.479> water<00:05:34.870> I<00:05:35.199> ended

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
this is actually how much water I ended

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.529 
this is actually how much water I ended
up<00:05:35.740> getting<00:05:36.039> out<00:05:36.430> of<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.759> and<00:05:36.909> there's<00:05:37.419> still

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
up getting out of it and there's still

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.839 
up getting out of it and there's still
more<00:05:37.690> in<00:05:38.020> there<00:05:38.199> but<00:05:38.380> it<00:05:38.500> was<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.669> was<00:05:39.789> a

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
more in there but it was just it was a

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.180 
more in there but it was just it was a
bit<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.090> work<00:05:40.240> doing<00:05:40.599> it<00:05:40.750> but<00:05:41.380> it's<00:05:41.770> really

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
bit of work doing it but it's really

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.439 
bit of work doing it but it's really
worth<00:05:42.460> it<00:05:42.610> in<00:05:42.759> the<00:05:42.820> long<00:05:42.880> run

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
worth it in the long run

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.420 
worth it in the long run
so<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.990> next<00:05:44.169> thing<00:05:44.320> going<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:44.560> do<00:05:44.770> is<00:05:45.070> I've

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
so the next thing going to do is I've

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.290 
so the next thing going to do is I've
got<00:05:45.539> two<00:05:46.539> eggs<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.349> we're<00:05:47.770> going<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.120> put<00:05:49.120> them

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
got two eggs and we're going to put them

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.180 
got two eggs and we're going to put them
in<00:05:49.539> the<00:05:50.020> mixture<00:05:50.349> I<00:05:50.800> have<00:05:51.520> half<00:05:52.090> a<00:05:52.300> teaspoon<00:05:52.930> of

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
in the mixture I have half a teaspoon of

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.850 
in the mixture I have half a teaspoon of
salt

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
salt

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.629 
salt
so<00:05:56.860> it's<00:05:57.039> stuck<00:05:57.370> there

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
so it's stuck there

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.809 
so it's stuck there
and<00:05:59.639> I'm<00:05:59.999> going<00:06:00.419> to<00:06:00.539> put<00:06:00.779> pepper<00:06:01.050> in<00:06:01.520> to<00:06:02.520> taste

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819 
and I'm going to put pepper in to taste

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.670 
and I'm going to put pepper in to taste
so<00:06:03.180> I'm<00:06:03.270> just<00:06:03.479> going<00:06:03.629> to<00:06:03.659> use<00:06:03.839> my<00:06:03.869> shaker<00:06:04.379> and

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
so I'm just going to use my shaker and

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.489 
so I'm just going to use my shaker and
and<00:06:04.860> shake<00:06:05.759> some<00:06:05.789> in<00:06:06.180> there<00:06:06.389> so<00:06:07.229> we're<00:06:07.379> going

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:07.499 
and shake some in there so we're going

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:16.579 
and shake some in there so we're going
to<00:06:07.559> whisk<00:06:07.800> this<00:06:08.099> up<00:06:14.809> now<00:06:15.809> we've<00:06:16.020> got<00:06:16.199> this<00:06:16.379> all

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:16.589 
to whisk this up now we've got this all

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.499 
to whisk this up now we've got this all
mixed<00:06:16.949> together<00:06:17.069> I've<00:06:17.550> got<00:06:17.729> my<00:06:17.849> cookie<00:06:18.240> sheet

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
mixed together I've got my cookie sheet

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.320 
mixed together I've got my cookie sheet
and<00:06:18.539> I<00:06:18.839> have<00:06:19.110> a<00:06:19.379> piece<00:06:20.009> of<00:06:20.039> parchment<00:06:20.430> paper<00:06:20.819> on

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
and I have a piece of parchment paper on

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:30.040 
and I have a piece of parchment paper on
my<00:06:21.360> cookie<00:06:21.930> sheet<00:06:21.960> so<00:06:22.919> I'm<00:06:23.129> going<00:06:23.399> to<00:06:23.550> put<00:06:23.789> two

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.899 

tortillas<00:06:31.050> on<00:06:33.469> each<00:06:34.469> sheet<00:06:35.009> so<00:06:35.369> then<00:06:35.520> I<00:06:35.669> just

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
tortillas on each sheet so then I just

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.089 
tortillas on each sheet so then I just
take<00:06:36.180> my<00:06:36.209> another<00:06:37.169> piece<00:06:37.439> of<00:06:37.469> parchment<00:06:37.800> paper

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
take my another piece of parchment paper

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:41.239 
take my another piece of parchment paper
and<00:06:38.520> I<00:06:38.610> just<00:06:38.909> kind<00:06:39.180> of<00:06:39.439> press<00:06:40.439> it<00:06:40.680> on<00:06:40.860> top

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
and I just kind of press it on top

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.649 
and I just kind of press it on top
smooth<00:06:41.969> it<00:06:42.119> out<00:06:42.209> a<00:06:42.270> bit

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
smooth it out a bit

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.659 
smooth it out a bit
and<00:06:45.199> it<00:06:46.199> helps<00:06:46.680> spread<00:06:47.039> it<00:06:47.249> out<00:06:47.369> a<00:06:47.430> little

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
and it helps spread it out a little

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.119 
and it helps spread it out a little
nicer<00:06:48.209> also<00:06:48.659> it's<00:06:49.379> almost<00:06:49.589> like<00:06:49.770> I've<00:06:49.919> made

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:50.129 
nicer also it's almost like I've made

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:52.339 
nicer also it's almost like I've made
this<00:06:50.339> too<00:06:50.610> big<00:06:50.879> for<00:06:51.119> the<00:06:51.240> pan<00:06:51.509> to<00:06:51.689> have<00:06:51.839> two<00:06:52.169> of

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
this too big for the pan to have two of

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.019 
this too big for the pan to have two of
them<00:06:52.499> in<00:06:52.770> here<00:06:52.800> but<00:06:53.699> we'll<00:06:53.939> make<00:06:54.360> it<00:06:54.419> work

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
them in here but we'll make it work

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.179 
them in here but we'll make it work
there<00:06:57.029> we<00:06:57.180> go<00:06:57.360> so<00:06:58.110> this<00:06:58.409> is<00:06:58.469> going<00:06:58.800> to<00:06:58.860> go<00:06:58.979> into

00:06:59.179 --> 00:06:59.189 
there we go so this is going to go into

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:03.259 
there we go so this is going to go into
the<00:06:59.309> oven<00:06:59.520> at<00:06:59.849> 375<00:07:00.319> for<00:07:01.610> approximately<00:07:02.610> 25

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:03.269 
the oven at 375 for approximately 25

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:09.429 
the oven at 375 for approximately 25
minutes<00:07:03.839> so<00:07:06.529> here<00:07:07.529> are<00:07:07.709> my<00:07:07.740> low<00:07:08.159> carb

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:09.439 
minutes so here are my low carb

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:12.889 
minutes so here are my low carb
cauliflower<00:07:10.439> tortillas<00:07:11.370> I<00:07:11.699> ended<00:07:12.509> up<00:07:12.569> getting

cauliflower tortillas I ended up getting
four<00:07:13.199> out<00:07:13.439> of<00:07:13.620> them<00:07:13.740> and<00:07:13.979> they're<00:07:14.879> very<00:07:15.800> sturdy

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
four out of them and they're very sturdy
