round<00:00:29.740> candy<00:00:31.259> sugar<00:00:32.259> candy<00:00:32.770> and<00:00:33.100> of<00:00:33.970> course<00:00:34.180> it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
round candy sugar candy and of course it

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.590

says Smarties they're called candy rolls
so<00:00:37.600> we<00:00:37.930> thought<00:00:38.110> let's<00:00:38.320> bring<00:00:38.560> in<00:00:38.739> some<00:00:38.920> other

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
so we thought let's bring in some other

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.049 
so we thought let's bring in some other
Smarties<00:00:39.699> now<00:00:40.090> I<00:00:40.329> believe<00:00:40.840> there's<00:00:41.020> even<00:00:41.109> more

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
Smarties now I believe there's even more

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.450 
Smarties now I believe there's even more
versions<00:00:43.059> of<00:00:43.180> Smarties<00:00:43.570> if<00:00:44.469> I'm<00:00:44.710> not<00:00:44.920> I<00:00:45.250> would

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
versions of Smarties if I'm not I would

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.979 
versions of Smarties if I'm not I would
think<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.789> maybe<00:00:45.910> Canada<00:00:46.329> had<00:00:46.719> its<00:00:46.870> own

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
think and maybe Canada had its own

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.720 
think and maybe Canada had its own
version<00:00:47.050> or<00:00:47.890> um<00:00:50.250> Australia<00:00:51.250> I'm<00:00:51.370> not<00:00:51.519> sure

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
version or um Australia I'm not sure

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.369 
version or um Australia I'm not sure

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.030 
back there and then let me just see if
these<00:02:26.780> are<00:02:26.840> any<00:02:27.080> different<00:02:27.650> cuz<00:02:27.799> if<00:02:27.920> they're

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
these are any different cuz if they're

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.430 
these are any different cuz if they're
the<00:02:28.129> same<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.670> don't<00:02:28.849> really<00:02:29.000> need<00:02:29.180> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
the same that I don't really need to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.789 
the same that I don't really need to
pour<00:02:30.440> them<00:02:30.620> out<00:02:31.930> sighs<00:02:32.930> some<00:02:33.230> size<00:02:33.560> and

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
pour them out sighs some size and

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.990 
pour them out sighs some size and
everything<00:02:34.129> is<00:02:34.250> what<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.430> mean

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.550 

these<00:02:38.000> are<00:02:38.180> pretty<00:02:38.629> much<00:02:38.840> exactly<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.500> same

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
these are pretty much exactly the same

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.020 
these are pretty much exactly the same
I'll<00:02:39.890> just<00:02:40.040> dump<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.310> few<00:02:40.489> out<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.760> we<00:02:40.880> can

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
I'll just dump a few out so we can

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.110 
I'll just dump a few out so we can
verify<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:41.630> yes<00:02:41.870> exactly<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.620> same

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
verify that yes exactly the same

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.470 
verify that yes exactly the same
coloring<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.599> close<00:02:45.280> yep<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.849> we<00:02:46.940> go<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.329> we

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
coloring is close yep there we go so we

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.729 
coloring is close yep there we go so we
don't<00:02:47.510> need<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.810> do<00:02:47.930> those<00:02:48.079> but<00:02:48.260> let's<00:02:48.440> look<00:02:48.590> at

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
don't need to do those but let's look at

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.220 
don't need to do those but let's look at
the<00:02:48.890> minis<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.549> see<00:02:50.360> how<00:02:50.480> many<00:02:50.720> they<00:02:50.900> really

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
the minis and see how many they really

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.759 
the minis and see how many they really
are<00:02:52.360> now<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.019> actually<00:02:54.470> rip<00:02:55.370> open

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
are now this I have to actually rip open

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.800 
are now this I have to actually rip open
whoo<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:58.209> chocolate<00:02:59.209> who<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.599> might<00:02:59.780> be

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
whoo so it's chocolate who that might be

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.430 
whoo so it's chocolate who that might be
neat<00:03:00.110> for<00:03:00.140> me<00:03:00.349> to<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.049> one<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.290> then

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
neat for me to just do that one of then

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.280 
neat for me to just do that one of then
there's<00:03:03.680> minis<00:03:04.010> packed<00:03:04.310> inside<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.299> guess<00:03:05.569> hmm

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
there's minis packed inside I guess hmm

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.280 
there's minis packed inside I guess hmm
I<00:03:06.489> might<00:03:07.489> have<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.879> dissect<00:03:08.120> him<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.079> let's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
I might have to dissect him so let's

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.720 
I might have to dissect him so let's
leave<00:03:09.500> him<00:03:09.680> off<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.129> side<00:03:10.340> we'll<00:03:10.549> come

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
leave him off to the side we'll come

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.319 
leave him off to the side we'll come
back<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.090> him<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:12.260> then<00:03:12.970> as<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.120> can<00:03:14.269> see

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
back to him and then as you can see

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.849 
back to him and then as you can see
there's<00:03:14.870> already<00:03:15.019> some<00:03:15.319> here<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.560> don't<00:03:15.769> even

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
there's already some here I don't even

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.069 
there's already some here I don't even
have<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.160> cut<00:03:16.310> him<00:03:16.400> open<00:03:16.489> look<00:03:16.819> they<00:03:17.780> get<00:03:17.959> it

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
have to cut him open look they get it

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.440 
have to cut him open look they get it
for<00:03:18.319> me<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.799> look<00:03:19.010> at<00:03:19.100> that<00:03:19.280> is<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.269> one

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
for me and look at that is that the one

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.660 
for me and look at that is that the one
did<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.720> match<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.109> no<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.290> don't<00:03:21.530> think<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.739> so
