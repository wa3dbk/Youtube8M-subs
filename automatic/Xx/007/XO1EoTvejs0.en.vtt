considerable amount of power and each of

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.450 
considerable amount of power and each of

these banks of power supply units that

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.300 
these banks of power supply units that
you<00:01:06.610> can<00:01:06.760> see<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.930> operating<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.500> specific<00:01:09.040> part

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
you can see is operating a specific part

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.330 
you can see is operating a specific part
of<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.640> cyclotron<00:01:10.030> in<00:01:10.690> addition<00:01:11.590> it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
of the cyclotron in addition it

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.190 
of the cyclotron in addition it
generates<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.910> lot<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.270> heat<00:01:13.390> as<00:01:13.780> its

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
generates a lot of heat as its

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.950 
generates a lot of heat as its
irradiating<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.130> targets<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.540> it's<00:01:16.690> very

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
irradiating the targets and so it's very

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.510 
irradiating the targets and so it's very
important<00:01:17.410> that<00:01:17.470> we<00:01:17.680> have<00:01:17.920> appropriate

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
important that we have appropriate

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.640 
important that we have appropriate
cooling<00:01:19.000> system<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.600> one<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.230> functions

of<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.920> control<00:01:21.220> room<00:01:21.400> is<00:01:21.610> obviously<00:01:22.330> to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
of the control room is obviously to

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.330 
of the control room is obviously to
monitor<00:01:22.960> each<00:01:23.170> of<00:01:23.350> these<00:01:23.530> power<00:01:23.770> units<00:01:24.160> to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
monitor each of these power units to

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.980 
monitor each of these power units to
make<00:01:24.490> sure<00:01:24.730> that<00:01:25.480> there<00:01:25.750> is<00:01:25.930> safe<00:01:26.650> supply<00:01:27.190> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
make sure that there is safe supply and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.750 
make sure that there is safe supply and
consistent<00:01:28.990> supply<00:01:29.550> There<00:01:30.550> is<00:01:30.580> obviously

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
consistent supply There is obviously

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.230

ensure that the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.080 
ensure that the
charged<00:02:14.230> particles<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.280> cyclotron<00:02:15.670> is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
charged particles that the cyclotron is

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.380 
charged particles that the cyclotron is
accelerating<00:02:17.280> remain<00:02:18.280> within<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.530 
accelerating remain within the
appropriate<00:02:19.750> circle<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:21.790> either<00:02:22.000> side<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.360> the

appropriate circle on either side of the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.350 
appropriate circle on either side of the
cyclotron<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.380> see<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.830> there<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.040> a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
cyclotron you can see that there is a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.180 
cyclotron you can see that there is a
it's<00:02:25.360> called<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.690> beam<00:02:25.900> line<00:02:26.200> as<00:02:26.470> we're

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
it's called a beam line as we're

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.680 
it's called a beam line as we're
operating<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> cyclotron<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.450> charged

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
operating the cyclotron the charged

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.360 
operating the cyclotron the charged
particles<00:02:29.170> are<00:02:29.290> moved<00:02:29.470> into<00:02:29.710> this<00:02:29.950> beam<00:02:30.130> line

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
particles are moved into this beam line

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.520 
particles are moved into this beam line
and<00:02:30.610> then<00:02:31.210> they<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:31.540> move<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.750> one<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.320> two

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and then they can move to one of the two

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.230 
and then they can move to one of the two
target<00:02:32.980> stations<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.050> at<00:02:35.260> either<00:02:35.470> end

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
target stations that is at either end

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.340 
target stations that is at either end
these<00:02:37.240> two<00:02:37.480> target<00:02:37.870> stations<00:02:38.970> enable<00:02:39.970> us<00:02:40.060> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
these two target stations enable us to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.520 
these two target stations enable us to
create<00:02:41.350> quite<00:02:42.010> different<00:02:42.490> medical<00:02:42.760> isotopes

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
create quite different medical isotopes

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.090 
create quite different medical isotopes
this<00:02:44.530> large<00:02:45.220> target<00:02:45.910> station<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.710> called<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
this large target station is called a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.760 
this large target station is called a
solid<00:02:48.310> target<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.840> what<00:02:50.050> we<00:02:50.170> use<00:02:50.470> to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
solid target and this is what we use to

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.610 
solid target and this is what we use to
make<00:02:50.920> technetium<00:02:51.550> 99m<00:02:52.120> which<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> medical

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
make technetium 99m which is the medical

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.130 
make technetium 99m which is the medical
isotope<00:02:54.070> that<00:02:54.220> we<00:02:54.400> have<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.790> replace<00:02:55.180> from<00:02:55.960> the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
isotope that we have to replace from the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.010 
isotope that we have to replace from the
reactor<00:02:56.620> supply<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:58.030> when<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.570> target<00:02:58.930> has

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
reactor supply so when the target has

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.010 
reactor supply so when the target has
been<00:02:59.050> irradiated<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.010> we've<00:03:00.250> created<00:03:00.520> the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
been irradiated and we've created the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.020 
been irradiated and we've created the
technetium-99m<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.950> remains<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.610> solid

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
technetium-99m it remains in a solid

form on the back of the target so the
first<00:03:07.090> task<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:08.200> move<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.830> target<00:03:09.070> from

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
first task is to move the target from
