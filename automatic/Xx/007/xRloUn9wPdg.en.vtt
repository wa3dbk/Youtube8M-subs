00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.360 

the<00:00:06.390> discovery<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:07.379> made<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.830> related

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
the discovery we made is related

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.669 
the discovery we made is related
actually<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> phenomenon<00:00:09.900> which<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.410> called

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
actually to a phenomenon which is called

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.490 
actually to a phenomenon which is called
gravitational<00:00:11.250> lensing<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.480> mass<00:00:13.200> is

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
gravitational lensing a mass is

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.460 
gravitational lensing a mass is
deflecting<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.240> lights<00:00:15.529> traveling<00:00:16.529> near<00:00:17.490> its

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
deflecting the lights traveling near its

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.370 
deflecting the lights traveling near its
environment<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> fact<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.230> we

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
environment and the fact here is that we

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
environment and the fact here is that we
discovered<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.100> first<00:00:23.220> time<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.090> quasar

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
discovered for the first time a quasar

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.009 
discovered for the first time a quasar
lensing<00:00:26.010> another<00:00:26.340> galaxy<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.420> far<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.990> have

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
lensing another galaxy so far we have

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.820 
lensing another galaxy so far we have
something<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:28.849> 100<00:00:29.990> galaxies<00:00:30.990> lensing

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
something like 100 galaxies lensing

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.120 
something like 100 galaxies lensing
quasars<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.360> two<00:00:33.630> very<00:00:33.899> bright<00:00:34.320> images

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
quasars you have two very bright images

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.330 
quasars you have two very bright images
of<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> quasar<00:00:36.030> instead<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.340> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
of the quasar instead of one and you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.780 
of the quasar instead of one and you
have<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:39.030> faint<00:00:39.480> galaxies<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.200> between

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
have the very faint galaxies in between

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.729 
have the very faint galaxies in between
here<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.450> discovery<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
here with this discovery we have the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.510 
here with this discovery we have the
opposite<00:00:44.250> phenomenon<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.140> quasar<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
opposite phenomenon we have a quasar the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.630 
opposite phenomenon we have a quasar the
very<00:00:47.760> bright<00:00:48.180> image<00:00:49.100> surrounded<00:00:50.100> by<00:00:50.250> two<00:00:50.309> very

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
very bright image surrounded by two very

very bright image surrounded by two very
faint<00:00:51.329> images<00:00:52.050> related<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> distant

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
faint images related to the distant

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.439 
faint images related to the distant
galaxy<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.680> quasar<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> very<00:00:56.370> strange<00:00:56.820> object

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
galaxy a quasar is a very strange object

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.700 
galaxy a quasar is a very strange object
it<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.870> actually<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.829> supermassive<00:00:59.789> black<00:00:59.820> hole

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
it is actually a supermassive black hole

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.670 
it is actually a supermassive black hole
which<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.010> swallowing<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.420> mass<00:01:03.680> surrounding

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
which is swallowing the mass surrounding

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.570 
which is swallowing the mass surrounding
this<00:01:05.159> black<00:01:05.760> hole<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:07.170> quasar<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> actually

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
this black hole and a quasar is actually

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.810 
this black hole and a quasar is actually
the<00:01:08.729> contraction<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.439> quasi<00:01:10.439> stellar<00:01:11.070> object

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the contraction of quasi stellar object

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.200 
the contraction of quasi stellar object
they<00:01:11.939> were<00:01:12.060> discovered<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.470> 60s<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.520> they

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
they were discovered in the 60s and they

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.510 
they were discovered in the 60s and they
were<00:01:15.270> actually<00:01:15.840> extremely<00:01:16.619> useful<00:01:17.100> because

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
were actually extremely useful because

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.719 
were actually extremely useful because
they<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:17.970> very<00:01:18.180> distant<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:20.159> bright

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
they are very distant but very bright

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.600 
they are very distant but very bright
and<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.229> very<00:01:22.229> small<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.580> very

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and very very small so they are very

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.140 
and very very small so they are very
easy<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.390> observe<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.830> some

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
easy to observe because they have some

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.510 
easy to observe because they have some
characteristic<00:01:27.150> spectral<00:01:27.920> signature<00:01:28.920> which

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
characteristic spectral signature which

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
characteristic spectral signature which
are<00:01:29.729> immediately<00:01:30.210> proving<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.380> are

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
are immediately proving that they are

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.249 
are immediately proving that they are
quasars<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.840> observation<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.960> very

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
quasars this observation is very

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.380 
quasars this observation is very
important<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> field<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.640> astrophysics

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
important for the field of astrophysics

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050 
important for the field of astrophysics
because<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> gives<00:01:37.500> us<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> first<00:01:38.670> time

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
because it gives us for the first time

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.219 
because it gives us for the first time
an<00:01:39.900> opportunity<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.159> wait<00:01:41.430> directly<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.540> quasar

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
an opportunity to wait directly a quasar

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.639 
an opportunity to wait directly a quasar
and<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.009> lensing<00:01:44.490> galaxy<00:01:45.149> containing<00:01:46.020> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and the lensing galaxy containing this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.670 
and the lensing galaxy containing this
quasar<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:48.000> has<00:01:48.180> never<00:01:48.390> been<00:01:48.479> done<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.079> far<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
quasar it has never been done so far and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.130 
quasar it has never been done so far and
we<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.640> look<00:01:50.850> forward<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.450> maybe

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
we really look forward to maybe

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.010 
we really look forward to maybe
confirming<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.000> other<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.420> which

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
confirming or not the other way which

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
confirming or not the other way which
have<00:01:55.200> been<00:01:55.320> used<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.860> far<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.460> order<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.969> wait

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
have been used so far in order to wait

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.459 
have been used so far in order to wait
these<00:01:58.140> galaxies<00:01:58.890> these<00:01:59.310> quasars<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.469> in

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
these galaxies these quasars and in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.800 
these galaxies these quasars and in
order<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:02.070> improve<00:02:02.340> our<00:02:02.790> data<00:02:03.119> actually<00:02:03.630> we

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
order to improve our data actually we

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.380 
order to improve our data actually we
have<00:02:03.990> submitted<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.799> few<00:02:05.310> months<00:02:05.610> ago<00:02:05.759> an

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
have submitted a few months ago an

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.839 
have submitted a few months ago an
observing<00:02:07.020> proposal<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.250> Hubble<00:02:08.610> Space

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
has been accepted and we have actually

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.830 
has been accepted and we have actually
now<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:13.990> opportunity<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.460> wait<00:02:15.730> for<00:02:16.510> these

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
now the opportunity to wait for these

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.470 
now the opportunity to wait for these
images<00:02:17.530> with<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.070> hubble<00:02:18.640> space<00:02:18.760> telescope

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
images with the hubble space telescope
images<00:02:20.200> which<00:02:20.410> will<00:02:20.650> certainly<00:02:21.810> allow<00:02:22.810> us<00:02:23.080> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
images which will certainly allow us to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.470 
images which will certainly allow us to
study<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.700> object<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.480> much<00:02:25.720> more<00:02:25.990> details
