00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.019
 to all the boys and welcome to this 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.660
 fifth Sunday blog like you 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.150
 you all know the christmas let's say it is 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 almost no doors left 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.090
 days 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.289
 to be honest I'm not the type 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:30.240
 who loves Christmas a lot if not 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:37.500
 hurt the dogs we wish you a merry 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.210
 christmas wishes master ok basta co co 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.710
 the chef seems to be the proof of the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.710
 cook you broke the balls 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.160
 then it can be honest it is just like that but 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.860
 no more talk today we'll talk about one 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.930
 very important thing or the end of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.199
 pokemon hicks and nothing with this arab 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.480
 in this end of the game we say that 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.049
 close with type the last parts that 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.890
 should be the cases of bellocchio 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.270
 as surely sorry for 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.189
 the canal will be redone 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.560
 at the fourth some episode of 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.420
 bellocchio or otherwise this is not 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.869
 important so I think that after these 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.869
 episodes the guide will end 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.710
 after saying this very sad thing 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.670
 let's move on to the newness of life is the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.000
 open type two type survey 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:44.990
 weeks ago with quotations vi 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.620
 I had announced in block 4 and they were 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.160
 with silver of the 160 liquids works 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.550
 password 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.520
 rayman origins these four days 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.840
 have been selected by me to do 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.670
 yes that at least one goes out in my channel e 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:12.230
 let's say regenerate the guides on mine 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 channel so you fans have been 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.180
 I decided 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.730
 indeed it was decided they want soul silver 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.930
 with 101 votes 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.200
 and crazy has been selected late 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.470
 deaths but many people also services 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.730
 of those, however, they do not have 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.590
 the Milan sponsored because 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.590
 in friendship if not months 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:44.380
 instead the other other guides are 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:49.990
 go out with the spain with 45 votes 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:54.220
 the legend of zelda sonic with 14 points and 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.030
 11 rehn remember or at least I wear 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.030
 pirates 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.379
 so what the rest to tell you is that 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.000
 after the end of dark knicks you will see of 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.269
 new on my continuous channel 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.450
 pokÃ©mon soulsilver with times and what then 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.849
 however I thought that a guide in mine 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 channel is little do not believe you too 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.819
 therefore decided to insert the same 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.560
 even though it was not voted by 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:36.400
 you home immediately after the end of pokemon 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.400
 hicks after a lapse of time I do not know 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.430
 precisely how much I will insert 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.750
 sonic last words because it seems like a 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.099
 enough game anyway 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.340
 adventure pass levels etcetera 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:55.390
 etc. however quite enough 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.900
 engaging so many closed for 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.900
 this 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.090
 Well what about this blog I have you 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.530

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.040
 there was to know 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.720
 let's say the next ones the next so that 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.680
 I will have to do 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:20.450
 therefore I greet you and get caught in 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.250

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.010
 spoiler had been late so I hope 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.920

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.480
