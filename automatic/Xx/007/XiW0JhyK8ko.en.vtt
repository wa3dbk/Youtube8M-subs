00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello youtube friends how to extract 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.500
 new video well since they are these games 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.290
 good unboxing the first one is by three 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.260
 dead seconds 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.760
 two 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.760
 the deadly room kombat 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.910
 and then the truth that I am going to tell you 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.650
 these games are totally new and 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.780
 Well, I'm really going to tell you why 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.770
 It is that it has the slip was 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.310
 making the video and then there was 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.680
 error in the video because I failed and that 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.950
 later I could not leave and I'm going to remove 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.200
 the paper to everyone and everything is a mistake 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.330
 look what 's so new this totally 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.809
 our new new dark hair because 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.510
 this new and good we start with the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.060
 video 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.450
 let's see how we're doing with this 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.450
 Soon golden play with the war 3 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.470
 and then that mortal kombat is a game 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.470
 Well, I recommend it 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.909
 I recommend you in everything to me is it in 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.090
 all my interest I think the game should 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.329
 to buy is worth it in terms of 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.329
 characters 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.610
 but it's also good that the code does not 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.610
 I'm going to show it by wright 3 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.170
 or the truth and the videos seem like a 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 good game 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.380
 it's worth it then it has its 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:53.100
 suspense and it's an egg 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.979
 Well the good truth cost me a pressure 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.789
 I do not want to say because good and good 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.789
 look what k 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.159
 to see this game that what brings its 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.940
 game that is first person and that 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.580
 It is very good because it has 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.560
 suspense behind a good plot is a 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.470
 very long game 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.570
 and so 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.230
 a game that really calls me a lot 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.140
 attention and that I say every time I did not lose the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.220
 money making this purchase then what 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.220
 I recommend also 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.560
 the second most tracks 2 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.490
 what this video is not going to ruin 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.420
 also because I would have to do it more 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.770
 it's a good game because the truth counts 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.770
 the story of vito scaletta 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.370
 and well he did not play the 1 but 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.390
 you can keep playing at the same time 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:04.600
 what I tell you this game is like a great 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.430
 andreas but at the time of 1900 something 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.610
 it's a game that the truth calls me 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.770
 a lot of attention that is a game for 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.050
 play it when you're bored no no you 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.240
 will disappoint because who is going to 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.240
 disappoint stealing cars and other things 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.560
 It's free 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.349
 What I do not like is a passion 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.670
 I do not know if you can see it well 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.210
 then we're supposed to give it only 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.210
 a come 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.480
 then in me I eat it how do we double 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.480
 this 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:57.819
 and we put it in so they did not 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.840
 and the last one to finish unboxing is the 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.420
 red dead redemption is a game of 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.200
 rockstar is almost the same as the mafia 2 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.150
 but in times more than cowboys and more 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.440
 old I would say 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.810
 and is that the truth 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.150
 this map if you did not show it why wow 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.130
 is very large was bigger than the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.220
 mafia and well the truth I have not shown 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.750
 I continued with stickers 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.750
 to give him more food 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.560
 and well I hope you do well 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:41.520
 I think so 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.850
 ander name where zombies come from and 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.000
 well that was all for being me I hope that 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.520
