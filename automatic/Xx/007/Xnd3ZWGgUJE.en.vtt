what I recommend people do is just keep
an<00:01:06.689> eye<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.549> make<00:01:08.549> sure<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.760> they're

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
an eye on them make sure that they're

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.289

not<00:01:09.210> getting<00:01:09.630> any<00:01:10.380> larger<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.130> too<00:01:11.310> large<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
not getting any larger or too large and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.080 
not getting any larger or too large and
what<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> mean<00:01:13.110> by<00:01:13.170> too<00:01:13.320> large<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.920> more<00:01:14.250> than<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
what I mean by too large is more than a

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.670 
what I mean by too large is more than a
you<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:16.100> 6<00:01:17.100> 8<00:01:17.280> 10<00:01:17.520> inches<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.259> a
