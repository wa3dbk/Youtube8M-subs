00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
lava and water structure so it looks the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.740 
lava and water structure so it looks the
best<00:00:18.720> from<00:00:19.109> above<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.920> know<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:21.180> look<00:00:21.359> is

pretty nice I would say okay so if you

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.570 
pretty nice I would say okay so if you
go<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.420> from<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.439> ground<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.369> won't

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
go like this from the ground you won't

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.690 
go like this from the ground you won't
see<00:00:29.880> anything<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.420> all<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.700> do

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
see anything at all so you need to do

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.049 
see anything at all so you need to do
this<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.530> lower<00:00:34.739> lower<00:00:35.309> levels<00:00:35.790> like

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
this on the lower lower levels like

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.959 
this on the lower lower levels like
maybe<00:00:36.440> between<00:00:37.440> two<00:00:37.950> mountains<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.410> so

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
maybe between two mountains you know so

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.200 
maybe between two mountains you know so
that's<00:00:41.989> how<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.170> looks<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.649> mostly<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that's how it looks is mostly and it's

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.229 
that's how it looks is mostly and it's
only<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.309> coloration<00:00:47.309> purposes<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.180> would

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
say so I constructed one with stone love

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.610 
say so I constructed one with stone love
and<00:00:53.190> water<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.559> looks<00:00:55.559> like

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
like that just put some blocks and you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.580 
like that just put some blocks and you
mean<00:01:21.659> make<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> square<00:01:23.810> like<00:01:24.810> seven<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.560> seven

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

mean make a square like seven on seven
or<00:01:26.220> nine<00:01:26.990> on<00:01:27.990> nine<00:01:28.290> blocks<00:01:28.710> let's<00:01:29.460> say<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.060> will

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
or nine on nine blocks let's say I will

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.940 
or nine on nine blocks let's say I will
make<00:01:31.189> seven<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.460> Kay<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.990> three<00:01:34.500> four

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
make seven on so Kay so two three four

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
make seven on so Kay so two three four
five<00:01:35.310> six<00:01:35.640> seven<00:01:36.650> ok<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.490> build<00:01:39.360> something

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
five six seven ok so build something

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.249 
five six seven ok so build something
like<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.790> then<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.130> make<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
like this then here you have to make a

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.130 
like this then here you have to make a
higher<00:01:46.259> level<00:01:47.689> okay<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:51.110> okay<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
higher level okay like this okay and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
higher level okay like this okay and
like<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.970> put

it's<00:02:04.860> pretty<00:02:05.130> easy<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.640> build<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
it's pretty easy to build and if you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's pretty easy to build and if you
don't<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.710> idea<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.149> use<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:10.470> if
