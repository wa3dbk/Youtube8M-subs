day to bring you one on the chaotic go

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
day to bring you one on the chaotic go
over<00:00:54.330> some<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> finer<00:00:54.840> points<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.470> it

over some of the finer points about it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
over some of the finer points about it
and<00:00:55.770> work<00:00:55.950> you<00:00:56.220> know<00:00:56.309> where<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> development

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and work you know where the development

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.720 
and work you know where the development
come<00:00:57.420> from<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.680> decided<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.220> do<00:00:59.489> with

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
come from and what we decided to do with

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.830 
come from and what we decided to do with
it<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> why<00:01:00.330> is<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> you'd

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it and why is what it is so so you'd

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.299 
it and why is what it is so so you'd
understand<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.440> little<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:04.680> about<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
understand a little more about it and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.640 
understand a little more about it and
maybe<00:01:05.520> you'd<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:06.570> more<00:01:06.600> interested<00:01:07.050> in<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
maybe you'd be more interested in it

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.609 
maybe you'd be more interested in it
maybe<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.729> would<00:01:09.020> understand<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> fits

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
maybe you would understand if it fits

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.820 
maybe you would understand if it fits
your<00:01:10.800> application<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.619> did

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
your application or not so what we did

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.520 
your application or not so what we did
with<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.100> chaotic<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.810> started<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
with the chaotic was it started out as a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.370 
with the chaotic was it started out as a
true<00:01:16.800> niche<00:01:17.100> market<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.509> started<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.140> as

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
true niche market can it started out as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.719 
true niche market can it started out as
an<00:01:19.590> aluminum<00:01:20.220> core<00:01:20.780> 6<00:01:21.780> inch<00:01:21.990> by<00:01:22.140> 2<00:01:22.320> inch

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
an aluminum core 6 inch by 2 inch

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.389 
an aluminum core 6 inch by 2 inch
titanium<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.880> ultra<00:01:24.570> lightweight<00:01:25.399> blackout

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
titanium to ultra lightweight blackout

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.320 
titanium to ultra lightweight blackout
subsonic<00:01:26.910> only<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:28.759> probably<00:01:29.759> ran<00:01:29.940> into<00:01:30.210> do

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
subsonic only can probably ran into do

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.780 
subsonic only can probably ran into do
that<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.320> there's<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.310> market

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that is that there's not much market

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
that is that there's not much market
because<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> lot<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.360> guys<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:33.990> run<00:01:34.110> super

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
because a lot of guys want to run super

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.830 
because a lot of guys want to run super
sunny<00:01:34.649> now<00:01:36.530> what<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.680> wanted<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.310> was

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
sunny now what we wanted to do was

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.920 
sunny now what we wanted to do was
basically<00:01:39.840> reach<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.500> broader<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.930> broader

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
basically reach a broader a broader

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.800 
basically reach a broader a broader
market<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.090> we've<00:01:45.240> done<00:01:45.270> was<00:01:45.659> we

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
market and so what we've done was we

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.899 
market and so what we've done was we
decided<00:01:46.350> okay<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.280> needs<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> build<00:01:47.760> will

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
decided okay it needs to build will

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.719 
decided okay it needs to build will
handle<00:01:48.119> supersonic<00:01:48.720> too<00:01:49.280> well<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.490> went

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
handle supersonic too well we went

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
handle supersonic too well we went
through<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.150> whole<00:01:51.869> brainstorming<00:01:52.530> session

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
through the whole brainstorming session

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.410 
through the whole brainstorming session
of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.190> best<00:01:53.400> way<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> make<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:53.940> work<00:01:54.240> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
of the best way to make it work in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.750 
of the best way to make it work in
handle<00:01:54.630> supersonic<00:01:55.229> ammo<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.549> we

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
handle supersonic ammo and you know we

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.520 
handle supersonic ammo and you know we
decided<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.690> needed<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.960> stronger

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
decided it needed a you know a stronger

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.179 
decided it needed a you know a stronger
alloy<00:02:01.920> blast<00:02:02.850> bipolar<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.560> started

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
alloy blast bipolar then we started

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.940 
alloy blast bipolar then we started
looking<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.970> what<00:02:06.780> about<00:02:07.049> secondary

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
looking at you know what about secondary

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.039 
looking at you know what about secondary
bipolar<00:02:08.519> motion<00:02:08.880> passed<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.840> this

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
bipolar motion passed it and all this

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.360 
bipolar motion passed it and all this
sort<00:02:10.260> of<00:02:10.380> thing<00:02:10.880> then<00:02:11.880> we<00:02:12.120> decided<00:02:12.510> okay<00:02:12.989> well

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
sort of thing then we decided okay well

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.530 
sort of thing then we decided okay well
people<00:02:14.370> are<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.820> want<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.180> for<00:02:15.390> their<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
people are going to want it for their a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.770 
people are going to want it for their a
ours<00:02:15.900> as<00:02:16.200> well<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:17.010> know<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.340> fife<00:02:17.580> Isis<00:02:18.000> so

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
ours as well you know in fife Isis so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.780 
ours as well you know in fife Isis so
what<00:02:19.739> are<00:02:19.769> we<00:02:19.890> going<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.310> do<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.670> be

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
what are we going to have to do to be

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.060 
what are we going to have to do to be
able<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.060> shoot<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.019> well<00:02:22.890> what

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
able to shoot it on that and well what

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.860 
able to shoot it on that and well what
it<00:02:23.220> boiled<00:02:23.489> down<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.640> was<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.299> we<00:02:24.480> scrap<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
it boiled down to was as we scrap the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.680 
it boiled down to was as we scrap the
aluminum<00:02:25.590> core<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:26.160> went<00:02:26.880> with<00:02:27.090> stainless

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
aluminum core and went with stainless

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.550 
aluminum core and went with stainless
steel<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:29.480> by<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.930> stainless<00:02:31.320> steel

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
steel and by going with stainless steel

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.130 
steel and by going with stainless steel
we<00:02:32.310> were<00:02:32.430> able<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.880> make<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.269> basically<00:02:33.959> but

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
we were able to make it basically but

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.569 
we were able to make it basically but
where<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.470> could<00:02:34.620> handle<00:02:35.010> five<00:02:35.910> six<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.870> six<00:02:37.079> a

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
where it could handle five six and six a

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.000 
where it could handle five six and six a
300<00:02:38.579> blackout<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.800> whole

and<00:02:44.700> even<00:02:45.240> 308<00:02:45.810> it'll<00:02:46.290> handle<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:47.070> know

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
and even 308 it'll handle you know

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.580 
and even 308 it'll handle you know
basically<00:02:48.000> anything<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.960> put<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.440> now

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
basically anything you can put to it now

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.430 
basically anything you can put to it now
it's<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.860> same<00:02:50.100> construction<00:02:51.110> technique<00:02:52.110> as

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
it's the same construction technique as

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.920 
it's the same construction technique as
far<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.520> freedom<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.120> made<00:02:54.360> it's<00:02:54.690> just

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
far as a freedom is made it's just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.580 
far as a freedom is made it's just
shorter<00:02:55.350> fatter<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:57.540> gave<00:02:57.840> us<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.470> know

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
shorter fatter so that gave us you know

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.850 
shorter fatter so that gave us you know
a<00:02:58.800> larger<00:02:59.640> reach<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.020> de<00:03:01.260> same<00:03:01.470> design

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
a larger reach with the de same design

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.800 
a larger reach with the de same design
and<00:03:03.860> we've<00:03:04.860> mainly<00:03:05.160> focused<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:05.970> making<00:03:06.210> its

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
and we've mainly focused on making its

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.710 
and we've mainly focused on making its
quietest<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.800> blackout<00:03:08.220> guns<00:03:08.570> but<00:03:09.570> it

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
quietest on the blackout guns but it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.370 
quietest on the blackout guns but it
still<00:03:09.960> is<00:03:10.200> respectable<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:11.450> 556<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.630> 308<00:03:12.900> and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
still is respectable on 556 and 308 and

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.250 
still is respectable on 556 and 308 and
things<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:13.710> that<00:03:14.030> well<00:03:15.030> we've<00:03:15.660> measured<00:03:15.930> it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
things like that well we've measured it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.000 
things like that well we've measured it
on<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.680> 308<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.550> right<00:03:18.060> at<00:03:18.420> 142<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.590> 1-meter

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
on the 308 it's right at 142 the 1-meter

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.980 
on the 308 it's right at 142 the 1-meter
position<00:03:20.580> but<00:03:21.060> now<00:03:21.210> to<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.480> shooters<00:03:21.810> here

it's<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> mid<00:03:22.560> 130<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.490> you<00:03:24.090> know<00:03:24.180> if

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
it's in the mid 130 so you know if

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.600 
it's in the mid 130 so you know if
you're<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.660> person<00:03:24.810> shooting<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:25.890> its

you're the person shooting the can its

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.670 
you're the person shooting the can its
pleasant<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.570> ER<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:28.260> actually

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
pleasant to the ER it's actually

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.310 
pleasant to the ER it's actually
surprisingly<00:03:29.460> nice<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:30.480> has<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> nice<00:03:30.990> deep

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
surprisingly nice it has a nice deep

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.920 
surprisingly nice it has a nice deep
tone<00:03:31.620> because<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.280> fat<00:03:32.610> design<00:03:33.030> but

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
tone because it's that fat design but

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.880 
tone because it's that fat design but
it's<00:03:34.440> not<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:35.270> mil<00:03:36.270> spec<00:03:36.630> here<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.350> safe<00:03:37.590> you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
it's not the mil spec here and safe you

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.280 
it's not the mil spec here and safe you
could<00:03:38.100> say<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> one<00:03:39.360> meter<00:03:39.600> position<00:03:40.140> it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
could say to the one meter position it

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.960 
could say to the one meter position it
hovers<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:41.430> 140<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:44.340> know<00:03:44.490> don't<00:03:44.820> be

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970

now high 56 comes in in the mid 130 you

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.350 
now high 56 comes in in the mid 130 you
know<00:03:55.470> it's<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.860> there's<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.340> lot<00:03:56.370> less<00:03:56.790> powdering

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
know it's a there's a lot less powdering

know it's a there's a lot less powdering
that<00:03:57.600> gas<00:03:57.810> collar<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.320> handles<00:03:58.770> it<00:03:58.920> much

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
that gas collar so that handles it much

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.890 
that gas collar so that handles it much
better<00:03:59.520> and<00:04:00.680> this<00:04:01.680> far<00:04:02.040> as<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.340> 556<00:04:03.000> goes<00:04:03.210> it's

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
better and this far as the 556 goes it's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.500 
better and this far as the 556 goes it's
it's<00:04:04.650> really<00:04:04.860> respectable<00:04:05.460> now<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:05.970> that

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
it's really respectable now that that

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.270 
it's really respectable now that that
cartridge<00:04:06.840> does<00:04:07.140> heat<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.680> up<00:04:07.890> rapidly

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
cartridge does heat the can up rapidly

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.030 
cartridge does heat the can up rapidly
just<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.300> any<00:04:09.510> other<00:04:09.630> 556<00:04:10.470> suppressor<00:04:10.920> it

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
just like any other 556 suppressor it

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.200 
just like any other 556 suppressor it
gets<00:04:11.250> hot<00:04:11.460> in<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.790> hurry<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:13.460> we<00:04:14.460> didn't<00:04:14.760> test<00:04:15.000> it

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
gets hot in a hurry so we didn't test it

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.780 
gets hot in a hurry so we didn't test it
on<00:04:15.270> a<00:04:15.420> very<00:04:15.750> very<00:04:16.049> very<00:04:16.170> short<00:04:16.680> 5<00:04:16.920> by<00:04:17.100> 6<00:04:17.160> gun<00:04:17.580> we

on a very very very short 5 by 6 gun we

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.110 
on a very very very short 5 by 6 gun we
used<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.830> zero<00:04:19.830> 10<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> quarter<00:04:20.430> or<00:04:20.730> 10<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.060> a

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
might-have-been 10.5 inch but we also

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.880 
might-have-been 10.5 inch but we also
have<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.600> use<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.750> thread<00:04:28.080> adapter<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.710> that

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
have to use a thread adapter so that

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.200 
have to use a thread adapter so that
gave<00:04:29.070> us<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.280> little<00:04:29.430> bit<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.730> room<00:04:29.910> right<00:04:30.180> there

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
gave us a little bit of room right there

gave us a little bit of room right there
you<00:04:30.570> know<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.930> length<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.980> threaded

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
you know the length of the threaded

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.510 
you know the length of the threaded
after<00:04:32.670> stacked<00:04:33.420> on<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.780> end<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.980> know<00:04:35.040> gave

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
after stacked on the end you know gave

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.370 
after stacked on the end you know gave
us<00:04:35.670> a<00:04:35.760> little<00:04:35.910> more<00:04:36.000> fun<00:04:36.270> time<00:04:36.570> too<00:04:36.840> I'm<00:04:37.140> sure

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
us a little more fun time too I'm sure

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.710 
us a little more fun time too I'm sure
that<00:04:37.560> changed<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.400> smidge<00:04:38.850> but<00:04:39.270> it's

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
that changed it to a smidge but it's

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.120 
that changed it to a smidge but it's
threaded<00:04:40.140> five-eighths<00:04:40.590> 24<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:43.010> since<00:04:44.010> you

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
threaded five-eighths 24 and since you
