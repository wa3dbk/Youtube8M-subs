00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
hope not which it's not so sprint ids

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.649 
hope not which it's not so sprint ids
not<00:06:05.159> in<00:06:05.310> here<00:06:05.520> but<00:06:05.729> you<00:06:05.819> can<00:06:05.849> go<00:06:06.060> into<00:06:06.180> settings

not in here but you can go into settings
and<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:07.379> believe<00:06:07.710> going<00:06:08.099> to<00:06:08.159> applications<00:06:08.729> I

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
and I believe going to applications I

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.249 
and I believe going to applications I
don't<00:06:08.969> know<00:06:09.029> if<00:06:09.120> he<00:06:09.180> left<00:06:09.449> it<00:06:09.599> in<00:06:09.719> here<00:06:09.870> or<00:06:09.930> not

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
don't know if he left it in here or not

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.480 
don't know if he left it in here or not
and<00:06:10.620> then<00:06:10.740> go<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:10.889> all<00:06:11.099> then<00:06:11.789> find<00:06:12.120> TW<00:06:12.690> launcher

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
and then go to all then find TW launcher

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.579 
and then go to all then find TW launcher
so<00:06:14.490> let's<00:06:14.699> go<00:06:14.879> ahead<00:06:14.909> and<00:06:15.060> see<00:06:15.210> if<00:06:15.539> where<00:06:16.319> it<00:06:16.469> is

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:16.589 
so let's go ahead and see if where it is

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.860 
so let's go ahead and see if where it is
so<00:06:16.889> it<00:06:17.009> should<00:06:17.190> say<00:06:17.370> TW<00:06:18.000> on<00:06:18.240> tree<00:06:18.419> right<00:06:18.599> there

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
so it should say TW on tree right there

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.420 
so it should say TW on tree right there
and<00:06:19.289> then<00:06:19.379> go<00:06:19.500> ahead<00:06:19.560> and<00:06:19.710> get<00:06:19.770> clear<00:06:20.069> defaults

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
and then go ahead and get clear defaults

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.540 
and then go ahead and get clear defaults
and<00:06:21.319> once<00:06:22.319> you<00:06:22.440> hit<00:06:22.589> clear<00:06:22.800> defaults<00:06:23.069> go<00:06:23.310> home

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
and once you hit clear defaults go home

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.219 
and once you hit clear defaults go home
press<00:06:23.819> the<00:06:23.969> home<00:06:24.150> button<00:06:24.180> and<00:06:24.839> it<00:06:24.930> looks<00:06:25.139> like
