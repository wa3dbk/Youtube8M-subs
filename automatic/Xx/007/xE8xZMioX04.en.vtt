here is that this - boot CD tells the
ghost<00:02:53.380> program<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.070> as<00:02:54.250> you're<00:02:54.490> backing<00:02:54.670> up

you<00:02:55.180> want<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.390> create<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.750> bootable<00:02:55.960> CD<00:02:56.830> so

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
you want to create a bootable CD so

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.560 
you want to create a bootable CD so
later<00:02:57.730> when<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.030> want<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.240> restore<00:02:58.510> your

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
system you can do that from the boot CD

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.140 
system you can do that from the boot CD
which<00:03:02.440> will<00:03:02.590> be<00:03:02.680> part<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.100> set<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.940> is

computer you can use these to do so and
then<00:03:14.440> ghost<00:03:14.770> on<00:03:15.010> CD<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:16.510> makes<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.960> bootable

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
then ghost on CD it makes it a bootable

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.760

going<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.630> bother<00:04:28.810> putting<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:29.500> any<00:04:29.650> file<00:04:29.920> name

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
going to bother putting in any file name

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.620 
going to bother putting in any file name
I'm<00:04:30.280> going<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.430> use<00:04:30.640> whatever<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.180> wants<00:04:31.510> to

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
I'm going to use whatever it wants to

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.250 
I'm going to use whatever it wants to
use<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.880> then<00:04:33.880> at<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:34.540> point<00:04:34.870> I'll<00:04:35.080> go<00:04:35.200> ahead

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
use and then at this point I'll go ahead

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.930 
use and then at this point I'll go ahead
and<00:04:35.500> click<00:04:35.680> Save

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940

so<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.900> process<00:04:38.440> begins<00:04:38.980> here<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.810> now<00:04:40.810> it

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
so the process begins here and now it

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.650 
so the process begins here and now it
says<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.560> about<00:04:41.980> nine<00:04:42.370> CDs<00:04:42.850> or<00:04:43.060> two<00:04:43.180> DVDs

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.800 
says that about nine CDs or two DVDs
will<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:43.960> needed<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.800> run<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:45.100> process<00:04:45.810> so

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
will be needed to run this process so

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.190 
will be needed to run this process so
I'll<00:04:47.170> go<00:04:47.380> ahead<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:49.380> click<00:04:50.380> yes<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:52.690> I'm<00:04:52.810> in

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
error writing to your disk then just

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.640 
error writing to your disk then just
have<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:34.000> start<00:05:34.210> over<00:05:34.390> again<00:05:34.510> possibly<00:05:35.470> with

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
have to start over again possibly with

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.020 
have to start over again possibly with
maybe<00:05:36.130> a<00:05:36.220> different<00:05:36.550> brand<00:05:36.790> of<00:05:36.940> media<00:05:38.160> so<00:05:39.160> I'm

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
maybe a different brand of media so I'm

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.310 
maybe a different brand of media so I'm
gonna<00:05:40.150> go<00:05:40.300> ahead<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:40.450> pause<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.900> camera<00:05:41.080> at

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
gonna go ahead and pause the camera at

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.440 
gonna go ahead and pause the camera at
this<00:05:41.470> point<00:05:41.710> because<00:05:42.010> as<00:05:42.160> I<00:05:42.190> say<00:05:42.580> this<00:05:42.880> process

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
this point because as I say this process

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.940 
this point because as I say this process
is<00:05:43.630> very<00:05:44.410> time<00:05:44.710> consuming<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:46.590> when<00:05:47.590> we<00:05:47.770> get

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
is very time consuming and when we get

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.920 
is very time consuming and when we get
to<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.160> next<00:05:48.310> step<00:05:48.610> I'll<00:05:49.270> turn<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:49.810> video

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
to the next step I'll turn the video

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.200 
to the next step I'll turn the video
back<00:05:50.080> on<00:05:53.520> Norton<00:05:54.520> Ghost<00:05:54.640> will<00:05:54.910> give<00:05:55.030> you<00:05:55.120> an

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
back on Norton Ghost will give you an

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.370 
back on Norton Ghost will give you an
idea<00:05:55.300> of<00:05:55.930> how<00:05:56.200> much<00:05:56.440> time<00:05:56.770> is<00:05:57.300> remaining<00:05:58.380> and

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
idea of how much time is remaining and

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.260 
idea of how much time is remaining and
it's<00:05:59.590> pretty<00:06:00.010> accurate<00:06:00.190> you<00:06:00.790> notice<00:06:01.120> it's

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
it's pretty accurate you notice it's

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.270 
it's pretty accurate you notice it's
climbing<00:06:01.600> though<00:06:01.960> initially<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.830> said<00:06:03.070> it<00:06:03.160> was

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
climbing though initially it said it was

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.970 
climbing though initially it said it was
going<00:06:03.370> to<00:06:03.430> take<00:06:03.610> about<00:06:03.820> 17<00:06:04.330> minutes<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:04.980> now

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
going to take about 17 minutes and now

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.570 
going to take about 17 minutes and now
we're<00:06:06.160> up<00:06:06.190> to<00:06:06.400> 29<00:06:06.910> minutes<00:06:07.360> 30<00:06:07.720> minutes<00:06:08.130> so<00:06:09.130> I

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
we're up to 29 minutes 30 minutes so I

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.250 
we're up to 29 minutes 30 minutes so I
anticipate<00:06:10.030> that<00:06:10.540> that's<00:06:10.720> going<00:06:10.960> to<00:06:11.020> just

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
anticipate that that's going to just

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.510 
anticipate that that's going to just
keep<00:06:11.470> going<00:06:11.680> up<00:06:12.210> but<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:13.300> also<00:06:13.419> gives<00:06:13.750> us<00:06:13.990> the

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
keep going up but it also gives us the

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.560 
keep going up but it also gives us the
speed<00:06:15.520> that<00:06:16.000> we're<00:06:16.150> operating<00:06:16.240> at<00:06:16.750> about<00:06:17.430> 210

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
speed that we're operating at about 210

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.230 
speed that we're operating at about 210
megabytes<00:06:19.570> per<00:06:19.900> minute<00:06:20.590> and<00:06:21.040> it<00:06:21.120> shows<00:06:22.120> you

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
megabytes per minute and it shows you

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.760 
megabytes per minute and it shows you
how<00:06:22.360> many<00:06:22.419> megabytes<00:06:22.870> have<00:06:23.080> been<00:06:23.200> copied<00:06:23.620> and

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
how many megabytes have been copied and

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.290 
how many megabytes have been copied and
how<00:06:23.830> many<00:06:24.040> megabytes<00:06:24.280> remaining<00:06:25.000> so<00:06:25.180> this

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
how many megabytes remaining so this

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.060 
how many megabytes remaining so this
backup<00:06:25.540> is<00:06:25.810> going<00:06:25.930> to<00:06:25.990> be<00:06:26.080> about<00:06:26.260> 7.3

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
backup is going to be about 7.3

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.100 
backup is going to be about 7.3
