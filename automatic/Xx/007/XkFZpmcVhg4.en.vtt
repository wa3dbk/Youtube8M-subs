00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
like these there's a certain application

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.100 
like these there's a certain application
for<00:00:07.890> them<00:00:08.069> now<00:00:08.580> personally<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.540> don't<00:00:09.870> think

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
for them now personally I don't think

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.430 
for them now personally I don't think
they're<00:00:10.410> as<00:00:10.530> stable<00:00:10.830> as<00:00:11.130> shooting<00:00:11.820> off<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> bag

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
they're as stable as shooting off a bag

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.220 
they're as stable as shooting off a bag
but<00:00:13.440> there<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> field<00:00:15.049> application<00:00:16.049> for

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
but there is a field application for

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.050 
but there is a field application for
these<00:00:16.350> things<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.279> opinion<00:00:17.490> faster

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
these things that is my opinion faster

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.779 
these things that is my opinion faster
than<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> bag<00:00:18.510> now<00:00:19.460> you'll<00:00:20.460> notice<00:00:20.670> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
than the bag now you'll notice that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.849 
than the bag now you'll notice that
there<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.300> button<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.750> my<00:00:21.810> side<00:00:22.289> which

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
there is a button on my side which

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.800 
there is a button on my side which
allows<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.460> thing<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.880> hinge<00:00:24.210> down<00:00:24.510> like

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
allows this thing to hinge down like

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
allows this thing to hinge down like
that<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:25.740> locks<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> 90<00:00:26.760> degree

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that it it actually locks in a 90 degree

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.419 
that it it actually locks in a 90 degree
position<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.859> press<00:00:29.189> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
position and you can actually press this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.690 
position and you can actually press this
button<00:00:29.670> here<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.170> want<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.500> make<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
button here which if you want to make a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.740 
button here which if you want to make a
solid<00:00:32.700> hard<00:00:32.910> point<00:00:35.300> get<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> getting<00:00:36.660> your

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
solid hard point get you getting your

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.569 
solid hard point get you getting your
muzzle<00:00:36.960> attitude<00:00:37.590> into<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> gun<00:00:38.070> pretty

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
muzzle attitude into the gun pretty

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.670 
muzzle attitude into the gun pretty
precisely<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.960> fine-tune<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
precisely and then you can fine-tune it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
precisely and then you can fine-tune it
by<00:00:40.829> turning<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.050> Third

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
by turning it so now you get that Third

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.450 
by turning it so now you get that Third
Point<00:00:43.500> bearing<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.070> gun<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.340> can

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
Point bearing of the gun you can

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
Point bearing of the gun you can
actually<00:00:44.610> fine-tune<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.660> that's<00:00:46.079> kind<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
actually fine-tune it that's kind of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
actually fine-tune it that's kind of
time-consuming<00:00:46.530> that's<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.399> how<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> actually

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
time-consuming that's not how I actually

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.020 
time-consuming that's not how I actually
use<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.870> keep<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> thing<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.820> lock

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
use it I keep the thing out of the lock

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.500 
use it I keep the thing out of the lock
position<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> I'll<00:00:52.770> actually<00:00:53.010> grip<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> with

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
position and I'll actually grip it with

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.840 
position and I'll actually grip it with
my<00:00:54.660> support<00:00:54.989> hand<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> gun<00:00:56.219> now

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
my support hand so when I'm on a gun now

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.290 
my support hand so when I'm on a gun now
I'm<00:00:57.570> using<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.379> its<00:00:58.530> hinge<00:00:58.800> mode<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.820> change

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I'm using it in its hinge mode to change

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.290 
I'm using it in its hinge mode to change
my<00:01:00.600> attitude<00:01:01.160> my<00:01:02.160> elevation<00:01:02.520> attitude<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
my attitude my elevation attitude on the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.840 
my attitude my elevation attitude on the
rifle<00:01:03.449> fine<00:01:04.320> tuning<00:01:04.769> myself<00:01:05.129> into<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> target

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
rifle fine tuning myself into the target

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.750 
rifle fine tuning myself into the target
and<00:01:06.030> then<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.320> contact<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.100> through<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and then my the contact is through the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.840 
and then my the contact is through the
monopod<00:01:09.240> into<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.020> hand<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.280> ground<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
monopod into my hand into the ground and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.350 
monopod into my hand into the ground and
so<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> will<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.650> doing<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.640> so

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so I will actually be doing this and so

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.090 
so I will actually be doing this and so
this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.689> very<00:01:15.869> fast<00:01:16.170> thing<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.619> pan<00:01:16.860> with

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
this is a very fast thing I can pan with

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800 
this is a very fast thing I can pan with
the<00:01:17.130> gun<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> could<00:01:17.610> change<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.060> elevation<00:01:18.540> on

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the gun I could change my elevation on

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.410 
the gun I could change my elevation on
the<00:01:18.840> gun<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.950> gives<00:01:20.220> me<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.400> very<00:01:20.909> stable

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the gun and this gives me a very stable

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020 
the gun and this gives me a very stable
shooting<00:01:22.200> platform<00:01:22.350> between<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> bipod<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
shooting platform between the bipod and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.260 
shooting platform between the bipod and
this<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.259> quick<00:01:25.619> deploy<00:01:25.920> monopod<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this this quick deploy monopod on the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.590 
this this quick deploy monopod on the
back<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.530> notice<00:01:29.310> I've<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.090> modified

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
back so you notice I've got it modified

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.670 
back so you notice I've got it modified
here<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:32.060> Magpul<00:01:33.320> UBR<00:01:34.320> stock<00:01:35.329> actually

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
here on the Magpul UBR stock actually

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
here on the Magpul UBR stock actually
Atlas<00:01:37.680> actually<00:01:38.040> makes<00:01:38.310> an<00:01:38.729> adapter<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:39.750> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
Atlas actually makes an adapter now that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.450 
Atlas actually makes an adapter now that
to<00:01:40.170> attach<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.680> I've<00:01:40.860> actually<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> rail

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
to attach this I've actually got a rail

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.560 
to attach this I've actually got a rail
piece<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.939> screwed<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.299> drilled<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
piece of a screwed and drilled and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.639 
piece of a screwed and drilled and
tapped<00:01:42.630> down<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> stock<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.560> they

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
tapped down to the stock but they

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.740 
tapped down to the stock but they
actually<00:01:43.890> make<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> new<00:01:44.280> adapter<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
actually make a new adapter that is a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.980 
actually make a new adapter that is a
drop-in<00:01:46.229> part<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.100> fit<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.090> active

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
drop-in part that you can fit the active
