antenna switch in the car without taking
the<00:00:06.680> dashboard<00:00:07.160> apart<00:00:07.460> this<00:00:08.120> will<00:00:08.329> also<00:00:08.509> work

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
the dashboard apart this will also work

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.859 
the dashboard apart this will also work
on<00:00:09.079> the<00:00:09.200> console<00:00:09.769> and<00:00:10.509> over<00:00:11.509> on<00:00:11.659> the<00:00:11.839> other

vent<00:00:12.320> this<00:00:12.799> is<00:00:12.980> a<00:00:13.009> switch<00:00:13.429> from<00:00:13.639> a<00:00:13.730> junkyard

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
vent this is a switch from a junkyard

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.380 
vent this is a switch from a junkyard
that<00:00:14.419> is<00:00:15.400> inexplicably<00:00:16.400> much<00:00:16.759> much<00:00:16.970> nicer

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
that is inexplicably much much nicer

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.150 
that is inexplicably much much nicer
than<00:00:17.509> the<00:00:17.660> one<00:00:17.779> in<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:17.990> car<00:00:18.259> I<00:00:18.500> think<00:00:18.710> it<00:00:18.980> just

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
than the one in the car I think it just

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.450 
than the one in the car I think it just
got<00:00:19.310> cleaned<00:00:19.669> too<00:00:20.000> much<00:00:21.070> here<00:00:22.070> are<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.250> tools

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
got cleaned too much here are the tools

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.359 
got cleaned too much here are the tools
right<00:00:22.699> here<00:00:23.050> they're<00:00:24.050> made<00:00:24.259> out<00:00:24.289> of<00:00:24.589> 50

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
right here they're made out of 50

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.249 
right here they're made out of 50
thousandths<00:00:25.970> music<00:00:26.419> wire<00:00:26.599> that's<00:00:26.929> just<00:00:27.169> a

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
thousandths music wire that's just a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.550 
thousandths music wire that's just a
little<00:00:27.439> over<00:00:27.710> 1<00:00:27.859> millimeter<00:00:29.109> music<00:00:30.109> wire<00:00:30.320> is

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
little over 1 millimeter music wire is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.709 
little over 1 millimeter music wire is
very<00:00:30.769> very<00:00:30.980> important<00:00:31.579> to<00:00:31.759> use<00:00:32.119> it's<00:00:32.449> very

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
very very important to use it's very

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.979 
very very important to use it's very
very<00:00:32.960> hard<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:33.649> will<00:00:33.920> not<00:00:34.070> flex<00:00:34.629> so<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.750> first

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
very hard and will not flex so the first

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.430 
very hard and will not flex so the first
thing<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.350> do<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.829> I<00:00:37.899> push<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.050> rocker<00:00:39.260> this<00:00:39.559> way

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
thing I do is I push the rocker this way

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.220 
thing I do is I push the rocker this way
push<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.620> rocker<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:43.129> way<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:44.180> put<00:00:45.109> the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
push the rocker this way and put the

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.950 
push the rocker this way and put the
switch<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:45.920> then<00:00:46.550> I<00:00:46.850> push<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:47.750> rocker

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
switch in and then I push the rocker

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.910 
switch in and then I push the rocker
this<00:00:48.710> way<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:51.170> put<00:00:51.469> this<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:53.320> little<00:00:54.320> peg<00:00:54.710> in

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
this way and put this the little peg in

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.869 
this way and put this the little peg in
the<00:00:54.949> switch<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.989> then<00:00:57.890> sometimes<00:00:58.609> you<00:00:58.730> can

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
the switch and then sometimes you can

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.990 
the switch and then sometimes you can
pull<00:00:59.059> straight<00:00:59.329> out<00:00:59.359> but<00:01:00.019> for<00:01:00.230> this<00:01:00.850> will<00:01:01.850> make

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
pull straight out but for this will make

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.940 
pull straight out but for this will make
a<00:01:02.030> little<00:01:02.239> handle<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.910> just<00:01:05.180> pull<00:01:05.360> on<00:01:05.390> it

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.280 

straight<00:01:09.950> out<00:01:13.270> quickly<00:01:14.270> change<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.720> switch

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.460 

the<00:01:18.290> fiber-optic<00:01:18.920> leads<00:01:20.350> sometimes<00:01:21.350> they

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
the fiber-optic leads sometimes they

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.640 
the fiber-optic leads sometimes they
come<00:01:21.650> out<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:21.890> easy<00:01:22.130> sometimes<00:01:22.460> they<00:01:22.730> don't

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
come out that easy sometimes they don't

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.790 
come out that easy sometimes they don't
you<00:01:24.650> plug<00:01:24.950> them<00:01:25.100> right<00:01:25.310> back<00:01:25.430> into<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.880> hole<00:01:26.120> I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
you plug them right back into the hole I

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.320 
you plug them right back into the hole I
use<00:01:27.800> my<00:01:27.950> fingernail

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.770 

I'll<00:01:32.330> just<00:01:32.630> switch<00:01:32.840> back<00:01:33.050> in<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:35.450> then<00:01:35.570> push

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
I'll just switch back in and then push

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.610 
I'll just switch back in and then push
it<00:01:35.810> straight<00:01:36.050> back<00:01:36.410> in<00:01:37.450> like<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.630> just<00:01:39.500> like

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
it straight back in like that just like

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.430 
it straight back in like that just like
that<00:01:40.360> I'll<00:01:41.360> show<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.600> how<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.840> make<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.170> tools

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
that I'll show you how to make the tools

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.050 
that I'll show you how to make the tools
now<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:45.250> take<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.280> pair<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.610> needle<00:01:46.670> nose<00:01:47.030> pliers

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
now I take a pair of needle nose pliers

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.330 
now I take a pair of needle nose pliers
in<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.780> music<00:01:48.080> wire<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:50.480> I<00:01:51.440> wrap<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:51.800> in<00:01:52.130> a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
in the music wire and I wrap it in a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.810 
in the music wire and I wrap it in a
loop<00:01:52.580> just<00:01:53.860> about<00:01:54.860> like<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:55.250> doesn't<00:01:55.700> need

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
loop just about like that doesn't need

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.649 
loop just about like that doesn't need
to<00:01:55.910> be<00:01:56.030> complicated

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.260 

now<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.310> far<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:02.880> cut

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
now I go about this far and I just cut

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.899 
now I go about this far and I just cut
it<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.600> very<00:02:03.840> hard<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.200> cut<00:02:04.430> music<00:02:05.430> wire<00:02:05.789> is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
it it's very hard to cut music wire is

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.640 
it it's very hard to cut music wire is
very<00:02:05.939> hard<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.360> cut<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:11.959> I'm<00:02:12.959> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.319> bend

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
very hard to cut then I'm going to bend

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.240 
very hard to cut then I'm going to bend
it<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.920> match<00:02:14.099> my<00:02:15.440> other<00:02:16.440> tool<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:16.980> they're<00:02:17.130> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it to match my other tool so they're the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:29.180 
it to match my other tool so they're the
same<00:02:17.400> length<00:02:19.519> here<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:25.580> there<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
same length here in here there and I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:40.670 
same length here in here there and I
bend<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.670> at<00:02:31.550> 90<00:02:32.550> degrees<00:02:36.650> then<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:39.349> cut<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.500> just

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
bend it at 90 degrees then I cut it just

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.839 
bend it at 90 degrees then I cut it just
as<00:02:41.280> close<00:02:41.580> as<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:43.489> will<00:02:44.489> leave<00:02:44.670> a

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
as close as I can and that will leave a

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.839 
as close as I can and that will leave a
little<00:02:45.120> hook<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.220> there<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.640> it

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
little hook and there you have it

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.990 
little hook and there you have it
there's<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.239> tool<00:02:48.510> right<00:02:48.720> there<00:02:49.849> here's<00:02:50.849> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
there's the tool right there here's the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.059 
there's the tool right there here's the
matching<00:02:51.420> tool<00:02:51.599> of<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.900> same<00:02:52.110> length<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:55.069> if

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
matching tool of the same length and if

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.870 
matching tool of the same length and if
you<00:02:56.190> notice<00:02:56.579> if<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.060> come<00:02:57.329> look<00:02:57.510> over<00:02:57.660> here

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
you notice if you come look over here

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.069 
you notice if you come look over here
they<00:02:59.880> can<00:03:00.090> also<00:03:00.569> be<00:03:01.200> used<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:03.480> pull<00:03:03.690> out<00:03:03.840> this
