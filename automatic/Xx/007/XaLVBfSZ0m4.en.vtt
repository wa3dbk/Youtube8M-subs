00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.190
 We often refer to Flemish painting as the school of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.499
 flamenco primitives beating understand that it can be an art that did not reach 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.730
 the fullness that hinders and that is naive the truth is that that term emerged 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.910
 which was taken as reference what is the art of the Renaissance 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.780
 whereby 'the art of comedy' 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.869
 it was like the art of darkness 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.740
 first of all, further away from reality because it is an art this is a school 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.239
 wonderful was going to say that besides painting the netherlands had a 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.750
 long schools sometimes and there we have no precedents in the magistral is 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.800
 we start in large format 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.360
 but of course yes there were abundant very specialized in what 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.399
 is the first left-handed addition these key moments pete best the painting 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.870
 flamenco that is going to do the Romanesque and the international Gothic 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.930
 we committed was very important in the Netherlands in the guelaguetza and this 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.920
 is going to move to making criticism that vágner love flamenco painting l 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.420
 something that you think you are going to host many basile things are said in different colors 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.930
 very bright as if it were in the circuits that used the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.920
 miniaturists 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.130
 there is also something that is going to take out the flamenco painting that is collected 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.400
 of the miniature 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.490
 is this the detail that his interest as peak 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820
 this recital some of the details 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.920
 which make up which make up the composition 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.020
 we will also call you to meet a medical appointment 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.039
 yes no flanders a part is only from the netherlands with which it would be 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.990
 more just that relativize them this art as the api own of the countries 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.870
 the truth is that the secret has always been said 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.280
 you have two flamencos invented the oil 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.890
 to what we know today is not true since it was already used after deciding 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.350
 14 the system that he used systematically which took away that 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.930
 will develop to be pronounced will make this technique especially if the 15 and 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.910
 16 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.359
 significantly hunger and violence 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.520
 it is true that the white house tango not the table 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.260
 it's not that we already know who benefits at this moment 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.240
 the live is being used 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.680
 in all the advances 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.690
 of flamenco painting the craft altet and rib did not have this 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.969
 channel 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.830
 intellectuals of all 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.980
 that was already happening in Italy at the same time 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:19.080
 the truth is that we will be that the entrance to goal about Chavez 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.819
 the mother says a lot 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.719
 a laser the religious issue as we can found the fate and those of the pp and 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.420
 another day is more has the portrait the typical flamenco rapporteur to spend a 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.329
 example, changing security is an acting challenge that runs a little less than 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.120
 half body 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.049
 apart they want 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.980
 and apart always leave bottom inside 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.450
 this makes him decide that the character gets involved in the space 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.950
 and do not need to create an artifice 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.950
 with furniture or with a background architect indicated 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:53.129
 is particular those of our clients now know

 another passage appears either as in this case seen through a window 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 it may be because the scene unfolds outdoors 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:10.609
 besides the new stereotyped passage because you will never be able to nature 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.580
 Finally we want to say that those of the most famous painters 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.799
 to be attentive to school 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.539
