to be showing you all about dolars I
know<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.730> sounds<00:00:20.940> stupid<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:22.140> all<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
know it sounds stupid but it's all a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.340 
know it sounds stupid but it's all a
possibility<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.400> make<00:00:23.610> so<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:25.110> is<00:00:25.199> just

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
possibility you can make so this is just

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.490 
possibility you can make so this is just
a<00:00:25.470> very<00:00:25.680> basic<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.130> right<00:00:26.340> here<00:00:27.380> it's<00:00:28.380> just

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
a very basic one right here it's just

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.240 
a very basic one right here it's just
you<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:28.920> under<00:00:30.380> just<00:00:31.380> go<00:00:31.470> under<00:00:31.650> downtown<00:00:32.039> it's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
you go under just go under downtown it's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.610 
you go under just go under downtown it's
a<00:00:32.430> floating<00:00:32.879> bench<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:34.289> put<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.530> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
a floating bench you know just put it in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.329 
a floating bench you know just put it in
write<00:00:34.769> that<00:00:34.949> right<00:00:35.699> there<00:00:35.909> and<00:00:36.390> then<00:00:37.339> then

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
write that right there and then then

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.200 
write that right there and then then
this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:41.309> tip<00:00:41.699> of<00:00:41.819> this<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> looks

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
this is just that tip of this it looks

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.579 
this is just that tip of this it looks
like<00:00:42.329> there's<00:00:42.539> like<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> room<00:00:42.929> number<00:00:43.109> I<00:00:43.289> guess

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
like there's like a room number I guess

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.009 
like there's like a room number I guess
you<00:00:43.800> could<00:00:43.949> say<00:00:43.979> and<00:00:44.429> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.809> gonna

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
you could say and this is a like a gonna

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.599 
you could say and this is a like a gonna
handle<00:00:46.379> better<00:00:46.620> than<00:00:46.859> just<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.129> rail<00:00:47.339> because

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
handle better than just a rail because

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.279 
handle better than just a rail because
it<00:00:47.760> looks<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:47.999> there's<00:00:48.479> some<00:00:48.629> collar<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it looks like there's some collar on it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.469 
it looks like there's some collar on it
and<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.589> looks<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.219> bit<00:00:50.399> nicer

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
and it just looks a little bit nicer

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.939 
and it just looks a little bit nicer
such<00:00:51.479> as<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.749> basic<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.229> this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> double

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
such as your basic one this is a double

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.349 
such as your basic one this is a double
door<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.339> basically<00:00:53.549> the<00:00:53.760> same<00:00:53.909> thing<00:00:53.969> just

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
door it's basically the same thing just

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.949 
door it's basically the same thing just
flipped

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:54.959 
flipped

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:57.529 
flipped
but<00:00:55.499> these<00:00:55.709> rails<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.159> side<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:57.239> add

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
but these rails on the side just add

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
but these rails on the side just add
some<00:00:57.959> depth<00:00:58.229> and<00:00:58.499> it<00:00:58.889> just<00:00:59.159> makes<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
some depth and it just makes it look a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.199 
some depth and it just makes it look a
little<00:01:00.209> bit<00:01:00.420> nicer<00:01:00.569> and<00:01:01.459> this<00:01:02.459> is<00:01:02.670> basically

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:03.209 
little bit nicer and this is basically

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.359 
little bit nicer and this is basically
the<00:01:03.420> same<00:01:03.569> one<00:01:03.780> isn't<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.470> except

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the same one isn't that one except

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.890 
the same one isn't that one except
there's<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:05.909> hinges<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.720> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
there's just some hinges on it which is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
there's just some hinges on it which is
a<00:01:06.930> stands<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.970> this<00:01:08.970> about<00:01:09.870> this<00:01:10.140> light<00:01:10.610> which

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a stands of this about this light which

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.720 
a stands of this about this light which
is<00:01:11.820> pretty<00:01:12.090> simple<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
is pretty simple then this one is the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.970 
is pretty simple then this one is the
bus<00:01:14.940> shelter<00:01:15.420> or<00:01:15.740> whatever<00:01:16.740> uh<00:01:18.530> yep<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.800> bus

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
bus shelter or whatever uh yep the bus

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.670 
bus shelter or whatever uh yep the bus
shelter<00:01:20.370> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> ad<00:01:21.360> board<00:01:21.660> and<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
shelter on the ad board and it's the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.080 
shelter on the ad board and it's the
same<00:01:22.860> thing<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.520> different<00:01:23.940> door

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
same thing it's just a different door

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.420 
same thing it's just a different door
now<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.510> is<00:01:24.690> one<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> doesn't<00:01:25.740> require<00:01:26.070> any

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
now this is one that doesn't require any

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.820 
now this is one that doesn't require any
collision<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.990> you'll<00:01:28.440> just<00:01:28.590> fill<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
collision so like you'll just fill this

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.740 
collision so like you'll just fill this
one<00:01:28.980> separately<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.760> you<00:01:29.790> can't<00:01:30.120> fit<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.480> in<00:01:30.510> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
one separately if you can't fit it in a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.050 
one separately if you can't fit it in a
certain<00:01:31.020> place<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.460> put<00:01:32.760> it<00:01:32.910> in

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
certain place and then just put it in

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
certain place and then just put it in
because<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.720> doesn't<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.440> any<00:01:34.620> like

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
because it doesn't have any like

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
because it doesn't have any like
collision<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.820> basically<00:01:36.120> can<00:01:36.300> fit<00:01:36.540> anywhere

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
collision so basically can fit anywhere

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.630 
collision so basically can fit anywhere
where<00:01:37.260> there's<00:01:37.440> not<00:01:37.620> any<00:01:37.800> ledges<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.370> rails

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
where there's not any ledges or rails

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.060 
where there's not any ledges or rails
it's<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.050> same<00:01:40.290> thing<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.830> a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it's just the same thing just a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.170 
it's just the same thing just a
different<00:01:41.430> color

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
different color

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.960 
different color
now<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.870> is<00:01:43.080> just<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.580> door<00:01:44.580> where<00:01:44.760> you<00:01:44.790> can

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
now this is just a door where you can

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.720 
now this is just a door where you can
just<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.300> with<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.570> three<00:01:45.930> pads<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:47.400> I'll

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
just use with just three pads and I'll

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.899 
just use with just three pads and I'll
just<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:48.030> equal<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.690> pad<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
just be equal one pad like like this and

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.399 
just be equal one pad like like this and
this<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.300> normal<00:01:54.480> one<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> easily

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this is just a normal one you can easily

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.080 
this is just a normal one you can easily
just<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.550> use<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.850> one

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
just you can just use this one

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.780 
just you can just use this one
any<00:01:57.330> time<00:01:57.600> doesn't<00:01:58.170> no<00:01:58.320> matter<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.580> is
