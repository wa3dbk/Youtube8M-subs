00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.490 
one of the tricks that I learned really
help<00:03:40.000> people<00:03:40.180> who<00:03:40.480> are<00:03:40.540> heavy<00:03:40.810> sleepers<00:03:41.290> is

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
help people who are heavy sleepers is

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.490 
help people who are heavy sleepers is
instead<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.760> just<00:03:43.420> leaving<00:03:43.660> your<00:03:43.959> phone<00:03:44.170> there

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
instead of just leaving your phone there

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.229 
instead of just leaving your phone there
and<00:03:44.709> hoping<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.489> wake<00:03:45.730> up<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.120> your

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
and hoping that you wake up to your

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.740 
and hoping that you wake up to your
alarm<00:03:46.480> then<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.020> can<00:03:47.110> only<00:03:47.290> go

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
alarm then you can only go

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.540 
alarm then you can only go
so<00:03:47.810> loud<00:03:48.050> all<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.470> have<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:48.890> do<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.190> put<00:03:49.400> your

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
so loud all I have to do is put your

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.970 
so loud all I have to do is put your
phone<00:03:49.880> at<00:03:50.270> cup<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.960> then<00:03:51.410> once<00:03:51.680> your<00:03:51.830> amount

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
phone at cup and then once your amount

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.830 
phone at cup and then once your amount
goes<00:03:52.220> off<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.640> will<00:03:52.820> enhance<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.270> sound<00:03:53.480> by

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
goes off it will enhance the sound by

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.040 
goes off it will enhance the sound by
two<00:03:53.900> times<00:03:54.740> and<00:03:55.100> matrix<00:03:56.030> sound<00:03:56.300> so<00:03:56.870> much

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
two times and matrix sound so much

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:26.590 
two times and matrix sound so much
louder<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:57.770> are<00:03:58.010> short<00:04:24.430> good<00:04:25.430> night<00:04:25.610> so

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
louder and you are short good night so

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.900 
louder and you are short good night so
we<00:04:26.720> all<00:04:26.840> know<00:04:27.020> at<00:04:27.169> least<00:04:27.260> one<00:04:27.650> person<00:04:28.190> who<00:04:28.550> is

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
pencils so one thing that I know really

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.040 
pencils so one thing that I know really
how<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.620> solve<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.310> problem<00:04:37.370> of<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.570> stolen
