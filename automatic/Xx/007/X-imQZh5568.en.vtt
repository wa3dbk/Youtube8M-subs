in<00:00:00.120> this<00:00:00.510> video<00:00:00.810> I'll<00:00:01.199> show<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.589> changes<00:00:01.949> for

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
in this video I'll show the changes for

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.579 
in this video I'll show the changes for
overgrowth<00:00:02.490> alpha<00:00:02.970> 161<00:00:03.750> which<00:00:04.110> you<00:00:04.290> can<00:00:04.440> try

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
got the basic effect working first but

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.300 
got the basic effect working first but
it<00:00:18.869> mostly<00:00:19.109> give<00:00:19.320> credit<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.920> live<00:00:20.100> update

this<00:00:47.789> could<00:00:48.000> make<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> useful<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.600> level

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
this could make it useful for level

Maps<00:00:52.710> however<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.090> cascaded<00:00:54.750> shadows

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
Maps however like the cascaded shadows

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.260 
Maps however like the cascaded shadows
this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:56.129> expensive<00:00:56.430> effect<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
this is a very expensive effect that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.760 
this is a very expensive effect that
could<00:00:57.360> cause<00:00:57.570> compatibility<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.559> framerate

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
could cause compatibility and framerate

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010 
could cause compatibility and framerate
problems<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> actual<00:01:00.629> game<00:01:00.840> will

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
problems so the actual game will

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.479 
problems so the actual game will
probably<00:01:01.140> used<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> baked<00:01:02.010> ambient

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
probably used the baked ambient

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
probably used the baked ambient

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
patrolling they just look around

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.810

randomly<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> pretty<00:01:26.250> simple<00:01:26.520> feature

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
randomly this is a pretty simple feature

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
randomly this is a pretty simple feature
but<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.450> think<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.750> makes<00:01:27.900> them<00:01:28.140> look<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.439> lot

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
but I think it makes them look a lot

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.319 
but I think it makes them look a lot
more<00:01:28.740> alive<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.369> aware<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> what's<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.119> on

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
more alive and aware of what's going on

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.480 
more alive and aware of what's going on
I<00:01:30.600> also<00:01:31.079> hooked<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> sound<00:01:31.979> priority

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
I also hooked up the sound priority

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
I also hooked up the sound priority
system<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> scripts<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.170> specify<00:01:34.350> which

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
system so that scripts can specify which
