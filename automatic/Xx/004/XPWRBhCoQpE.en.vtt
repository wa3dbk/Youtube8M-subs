that's<00:01:03.720> just<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.020> Oklahoma<00:01:04.410> here

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.590 

we<00:01:08.930> run<00:01:09.230> a<00:01:09.260> standard<00:01:10.220> seat<00:01:10.430> with<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.150> hump<00:01:11.390> as

we run a standard seat with the hump as
you<00:01:11.840> can<00:01:11.960> notice<00:01:12.020> now<00:01:12.440> I<00:01:12.910> think<00:01:13.910> he's<00:01:14.390> got<00:01:14.540> a

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
you can notice now I think he's got a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.150 
you can notice now I think he's got a
lot<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.750> power<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.200> torque<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.860> keeps<00:01:15.980> him

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
lot of power and torque so it keeps him

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.180 
lot of power and torque so it keeps him
from<00:01:16.220> sliding<00:01:16.430> all<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:16.760> way<00:01:16.850> off<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.120> back

from sliding all the way off the back

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.450 
from sliding all the way off the back
that's<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.510> overall<00:01:20.510> them<00:01:21.070> most<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:23.320> guess

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
that's a overall them most I guess

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.370 
that's a overall them most I guess
cosmetically<00:01:26.290> specific
