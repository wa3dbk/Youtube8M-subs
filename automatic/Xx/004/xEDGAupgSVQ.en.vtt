encounters and test them most recently
I've<00:01:20.310> been<00:01:20.400> working<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:20.729> beta<00:01:21.000> players<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I've been working with beta players a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.260 
I've been working with beta players a
ton<00:01:22.400> following<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.520> through<00:01:23.549> raids<00:01:23.880> getting

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
ton following them through raids getting

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
ton following them through raids getting
their<00:01:24.420> feedback<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.500> improving

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
their feedback and then improving

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
their feedback and then improving
content<00:01:26.759> much<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.090> can

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
content much as we can

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.420 
content much as we can
I<00:01:29.210> think<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.440> biggest<00:01:30.740> thing<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.920> be<00:01:31.070> excited

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
I think the biggest thing to be excited

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.860 
I think the biggest thing to be excited
about<00:01:31.490> with<00:01:31.790> our<00:01:31.850> raids<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.480> that<00:01:32.960> they<00:01:33.920> are

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
about with our raids is that they are

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.290 
about with our raids is that they are
the<00:01:35.870> best<00:01:36.140> blend<00:01:36.530> I've<00:01:36.800> seen<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.310> being<00:01:38.090> both

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
the best blend I've seen of being both

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.890 
the best blend I've seen of being both
challenging<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:39.080> fun<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:40.540> lot<00:01:41.540> of<00:01:41.690> fights

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
challenging and fun a lot of fights

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.840 
challenging and fun a lot of fights
sometimes<00:01:42.200> are<00:01:42.680> only<00:01:43.100> one<00:01:43.430> or<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.670> other

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
sometimes are only one or the other

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.580 
sometimes are only one or the other
they're<00:01:44.450> fun<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.110> they're<00:01:45.230> not<00:01:45.350> challenging

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
they're fun but they're not challenging

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.840 
they're fun but they're not challenging
at<00:01:45.920> all<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.250> then<00:01:46.340> they're<00:01:46.460> just<00:01:46.610> boring

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
at all and then they're just boring

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.820 
at all and then they're just boring
right-click<00:01:47.420> receive<00:01:47.750> loot<00:01:47.960> or<00:01:48.200> they're

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
right-click receive loot or they're

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.460 
right-click receive loot or they're
super<00:01:49.130> challenging<00:01:49.640> but<00:01:49.940> fun<00:01:50.150> at<00:01:50.930> all<00:01:51.080> and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
super challenging but fun at all and

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.350 
super challenging but fun at all and
then<00:01:51.620> it's<00:01:51.740> just<00:01:51.950> miserable<00:01:52.400> beating<00:01:53.240> your

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
then it's just miserable beating your

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.270 
then it's just miserable beating your
head<00:01:53.450> against<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.810> wall<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.260> really<00:01:54.920> think<00:01:55.160> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
head against the wall I really think the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.560 
head against the wall I really think the
strongest<00:01:55.640> part<00:01:55.790> about<00:01:55.910> our<00:01:55.970> raids<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.420> that

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
strongest part about our raids is that

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.720 
strongest part about our raids is that
we've<00:01:56.720> we've<00:01:57.350> managed<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.980> really<00:01:58.370> kind<00:01:58.640> of

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
we've we've managed to really kind of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.180 
we've we've managed to really kind of
pair<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.120> two<00:01:59.300> so<00:01:59.720> they're<00:02:00.020> they're<00:02:00.710> really

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
pair the two so they're they're really

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.800 
pair the two so they're they're really
challenging<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:01.910> they<00:02:02.000> push<00:02:02.240> players<00:02:02.510> as<00:02:02.780> far

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
challenging and they push players as far

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.690 
challenging and they push players as far
as<00:02:03.080> they<00:02:03.229> can<00:02:03.290> go<00:02:03.410> but<00:02:04.100> at<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.250> same<00:02:04.460> time

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
as they can go but at the same time

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.430 
as they can go but at the same time
they're<00:02:05.000> fun<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.360> they're<00:02:05.630> exciting<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
they're fun and they're exciting and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.550 
they're fun and they're exciting and
there's<00:02:07.130> huge<00:02:07.690> moments<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:08.810> every<00:02:08.929> fight<00:02:09.290> and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
there's huge moments in every fight and

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.120 
there's huge moments in every fight and
stuff<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:11.380> after<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.470> graduated<00:02:12.860> I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
idea that literally starts is like a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.500 
idea that literally starts is like a
line<00:02:51.380> or<00:02:51.530> two<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.770> an<00:02:51.860> email<00:02:52.190> or<00:02:52.460> a<00:02:52.850> couple<00:02:53.330> of

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
badly drawn squares on a whiteboard go

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.900 
badly drawn squares on a whiteboard go
from<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.900> boring<00:02:57.560> core<00:02:57.860> concept<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.610> go<00:02:58.670> all

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
from that boring core concept and go all

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.640

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
the way through art and design and then

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.350
