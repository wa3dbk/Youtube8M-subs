00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.720 

all<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> network<00:00:53.550> now

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
all right so we're in the network now

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.240 
all right so we're in the network now
over<00:00:54.540> on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> right<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.890> all

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
over on the right here we can see all

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.210 
over on the right here we can see all
the<00:00:56.309> players<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.329> tunngle<00:00:58.220> if

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
the players that are in tunngle if

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.639 
the players that are in tunngle if
you're<00:00:59.489> seeing<00:00:59.699> red<00:01:00.030> axes<00:01:00.480> next<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> most<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
you're seeing red axes next to most of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.259 
you're seeing red axes next to most of
these<00:01:01.739> players<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.280> probably<00:01:02.670> need<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> port

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
these players you probably need a port

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.359 
these players you probably need a port
forward<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.840> open<00:01:03.989> your<00:01:04.259> tunngle<00:01:04.589> port<00:01:04.800> by

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
forward and open your tunngle port by

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.240 
forward and open your tunngle port by
default<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> tunngle<00:01:06.360> port<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.780> UDP<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:08.009> one

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
default the tunngle port is UDP one one

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.120 
default the tunngle port is UDP one one
one<00:01:08.550> five<00:01:08.970> five<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> you'll<00:01:10.590> probably<00:01:10.800> have<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
one five five so you'll probably have to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.620 
one five five so you'll probably have to
port<00:01:11.340> forward<00:01:11.550> that<00:01:11.759> on<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.000> router<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
port forward that on your router if you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.380 
port forward that on your router if you
plan<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:12.899> hosting<00:01:13.610> all<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.970> once<00:01:15.270> you're

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
plan on hosting all right so once you're

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.430 
plan on hosting all right so once you're
in<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> network<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:15.990> what<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> do
