so<00:00:05.120> I<00:00:05.149> was<00:00:05.330> looking<00:00:05.450> around<00:00:05.689> my<00:00:06.109> garage<00:00:06.439> and<00:00:06.769> I

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
so I was looking around my garage and I

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.779 
so I was looking around my garage and I
found<00:00:08.420> this<00:00:08.539> guy<00:00:08.740> this<00:00:09.740> is<00:00:10.039> one<00:00:10.309> of<00:00:10.430> my<00:00:10.549> first

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:10.789 
found this guy this is one of my first

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.330 
found this guy this is one of my first
RC<00:00:11.299> projects<00:00:11.809> that<00:00:11.990> I<00:00:12.020> did<00:00:12.260> a<00:00:12.289> while<00:00:12.469> back<00:00:12.709> for

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
RC projects that I did a while back for

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.480 
RC projects that I did a while back for
my<00:00:13.430> dad<00:00:14.230> he<00:00:15.230> sent<00:00:15.469> two<00:00:15.590> airboats<00:00:16.010> or<00:00:16.189> whatever

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
my dad he sent two airboats or whatever

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.870 
my dad he sent two airboats or whatever
and<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:18.619> ones<00:00:18.800> that<00:00:18.890> you<00:00:18.980> find<00:00:19.070> on<00:00:19.519> the<00:00:19.609> stores

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
and the ones that you find on the stores

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.840 
and the ones that you find on the stores
they're<00:00:20.240> like<00:00:20.480> really<00:00:20.990> tiny<00:00:21.230> like<00:00:21.850> 1218

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
they're like really tiny like 1218

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.020 
they're like really tiny like 1218
inches<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:23.560> figured<00:00:24.560> I<00:00:24.650> wasn't<00:00:24.860> big<00:00:25.100> enough<00:00:25.130> so

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
inches I figured I wasn't big enough so

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.170 
inches I figured I wasn't big enough so
I<00:00:26.060> went<00:00:26.420> ahead<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:26.750> built<00:00:26.869> him<00:00:27.110> a<00:00:27.140> airboat<00:00:28.180> out

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
I went ahead and built him a airboat out

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.750 
I went ahead and built him a airboat out
of<00:00:29.420> a<00:00:29.510> boogie<00:00:29.810> board<00:00:31.390> stands<00:00:32.390> huge<00:00:33.489> yes<00:00:34.489> ice

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
of a boogie board stands huge yes ice

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.869 
of a boogie board stands huge yes ice
embarrassin<00:00:35.629> as<00:00:35.690> my<00:00:36.170> hand<00:00:37.749> so<00:00:39.429> it's<00:00:40.429> a<00:00:40.550> pretty

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
embarrassin as my hand so it's a pretty

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.389 
embarrassin as my hand so it's a pretty
big<00:00:41.139> now<00:00:42.139> of<00:00:42.260> course<00:00:42.499> it's<00:00:42.710> not<00:00:42.859> as<00:00:43.069> intricate

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
big now of course it's not as intricate

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.040 
big now of course it's not as intricate
as<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.999> know<00:00:44.149> some<00:00:44.329> other<00:00:44.510> stuff<00:00:44.539> you'll<00:00:44.870> see

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
as you know some other stuff you'll see

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.680 
as you know some other stuff you'll see
out<00:00:45.199> there<00:00:45.469> it's<00:00:45.649> just<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:46.210> little<00:00:47.210> fun<00:00:47.449> toy

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
out there it's just a little fun toy

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.489 
out there it's just a little fun toy
that<00:00:47.929> I<00:00:48.019> built<00:00:48.289> for<00:00:48.469> him<00:00:48.559> to<00:00:48.710> have<00:00:48.859> fun<00:00:49.069> with

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
that I built for him to have fun with

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.379 
that I built for him to have fun with
you<00:00:51.499> can<00:00:51.679> see<00:00:51.859> we<00:00:52.010> had<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:52.249> run<00:00:52.579> some<00:00:52.609> lines<00:00:53.030> on

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:53.389 
you can see we had to run some lines on

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:56.289 
you can see we had to run some lines on
the<00:00:53.929> bottom<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.379> it<00:00:54.940> those<00:00:55.940> are<00:00:56.120> little

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
the bottom of it those are little

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.340 
the bottom of it those are little
grooves<00:00:57.969> they<00:00:58.969> had<00:00:59.179> to<00:00:59.359> be<00:00:59.479> cut<00:00:59.749> into<00:00:59.989> the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
grooves they had to be cut into the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.889 
grooves they had to be cut into the
board<00:01:00.589> to<00:01:01.489> give<00:01:01.670> us<00:01:01.819> some<00:01:01.969> stability<00:01:02.179> when<00:01:02.749> it

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
board to give us some stability when it

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.320 
board to give us some stability when it
was<00:01:03.019> actually<00:01:03.469> riding<00:01:03.949> on<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.400> surface<00:01:05.239> of

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
was actually riding on the surface of

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.510 
was actually riding on the surface of
the<00:01:05.420> water

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
the water

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.190 
the water
because<00:01:07.520> without<00:01:07.729> though<00:01:08.090> those<00:01:08.840> little

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
because without though those little

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.430 
because without though those little
ridges<00:01:09.440> some<00:01:10.300> grooves<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.870> we<00:01:11.990> just<00:01:12.170> go<00:01:12.290> all

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
ridges some grooves and we just go all

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.400 
ridges some grooves and we just go all
over<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.740> place<00:01:13.630> as<00:01:14.630> for<00:01:15.140> motor<00:01:17.320> when<00:01:18.320> I'm

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
over the place as for motor when I'm

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:29.170 
over the place as for motor when I'm
using<00:01:21.130> it's<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.610> 50<00:01:23.330> 55<00:01:25.120> 400<00:01:26.120> kV<00:01:26.810> motor<00:01:28.180> with

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
using it's that 50 55 400 kV motor with

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.470 
using it's that 50 55 400 kV motor with
a<00:01:29.330> three-blade<00:01:29.900> propeller

a three-blade propeller
airplane<00:01:32.480> motor<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.810> course<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:35.530> not

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
airplane motor of course it's not

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.860 
airplane motor of course it's not
supposed<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.920> be<00:01:37.070> run<00:01:37.370> on<00:01:37.640> water<00:01:38.090> but<00:01:38.540> because

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
supposed to be run on water but because

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.740 
supposed to be run on water but because
it's<00:01:39.080> such<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:39.260> big<00:01:39.560> airboat<00:01:40.340> I've<00:01:41.120> never<00:01:41.540> had

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
it's such a big airboat I've never had

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.160 
it's such a big airboat I've never had
any<00:01:41.930> issues<00:01:42.320> on<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:44.450> know<00:01:44.510> flipping<00:01:44.780> over

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
any issues on it you know flipping over

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.710 
any issues on it you know flipping over
or<00:01:45.290> anything<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:46.610> never<00:01:46.970> really<00:01:47.300> got<00:01:47.540> any

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
or anything so I never really got any

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.710 
or anything so I never really got any
concern<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:49.010> making<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.909> waterproof<00:01:50.510> or

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
concern is to making this waterproof or

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.100 
concern is to making this waterproof or
whatever

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
whatever

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.140 
whatever
now<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.830> electronics<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:52.490> do<00:01:52.550> keep<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:53.030> this

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
now the electronics I do keep in this

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.530 
now the electronics I do keep in this
little<00:01:53.510> box<00:01:54.430> it's<00:01:55.430> all<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.850> there<00:01:56.530> because<00:01:57.530> I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
little box it's all in there because I

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
little box it's all in there because I
figure<00:01:59.540> what<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.750> heck<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.200> got<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.470> keep

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
figure what the heck you got to keep

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.459 
figure what the heck you got to keep
those<00:02:00.740> clean<00:02:01.960> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
those clean and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.459 
those clean and
as<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.460> these<00:02:06.149> paddles<00:02:06.719> here<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.200> course

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
as for these paddles here of course

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.609 
as for these paddles here of course
that's<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:07.859> I<00:02:07.890> use<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.099> steering<00:02:09.379> this<00:02:10.379> was

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
that's what I use for steering this was

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.949 
that's what I use for steering this was
a<00:02:10.649> very<00:02:10.950> cheap<00:02:11.489> project<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.780> this

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
a very cheap project as you can see this

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.570 
a very cheap project as you can see this
is<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.140> some<00:02:14.480> plastic<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.959> cut<00:02:16.260> off<00:02:16.580> from

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
is just some plastic that I cut off from

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.880 
is just some plastic that I cut off from
some<00:02:17.879> signs<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.599> found<00:02:18.930> out<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.349> garbage

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
some signs that I found out the garbage

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.699 
some signs that I found out the garbage
and<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:21.239> course<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.660> made<00:02:21.840> some<00:02:22.019> linkages<00:02:22.500> for

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
and of course I made some linkages for

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.970 
and of course I made some linkages for
it<00:02:22.890> with<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> servo<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.879> there<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:25.080> pretty<00:02:25.830> much

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it with a servo in there and pretty much

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.059 
it with a servo in there and pretty much
that's<00:02:26.310> what<00:02:26.430> gives<00:02:26.700> me<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.879> steering<00:02:27.299> on<00:02:28.069> the

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
that's what gives me the steering on the

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.089 
that's what gives me the steering on the
airboat<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.640> actually<00:02:33.500> quite<00:02:34.500> responsive

there is piece right here that's just a

there is piece right here that's just a
metal<00:04:03.450> piece<00:04:03.599> that<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.840> had<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.019> put<00:04:04.200> on<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
metal piece that I had to put on the

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.670 
metal piece that I had to put on the
front<00:04:04.560> because<00:04:04.919> I'm<00:04:05.269> even<00:04:06.269> though<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.680> motor

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
front because I'm even though the motor

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.379 
front because I'm even though the motor
pushes<00:04:07.919> hair<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.370> way<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:09.150> know<00:04:09.239> it

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
pushes hair that way and you know it

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.140 
pushes hair that way and you know it
should<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.230> theory<00:04:10.500> push<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.250> motor<00:04:11.459> down<00:04:11.639> the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
should in theory push the motor down the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.180 
should in theory push the motor down the
bolt<00:04:12.359> down<00:04:12.479> this<00:04:12.720> way<00:04:12.870> he<00:04:13.680> really<00:04:13.949> doesn't

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
bolt down this way he really doesn't

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.360 
bolt down this way he really doesn't
have<00:04:14.400> enough<00:04:14.639> power<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.720> do<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.440> it's<00:04:17.220> got

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
have enough power to do that it's got

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.170 
have enough power to do that it's got
more<00:04:17.549> lift

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
more lift

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.999 
more lift
our<00:04:18.269> ratio<00:04:18.539> so<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.109> front<00:04:19.410> end<00:04:19.560> wants<00:04:19.859> to

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
our ratio so this front end wants to

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.850 
our ratio so this front end wants to
come<00:04:20.759> on<00:04:20.940> up<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.329> waves<00:04:21.539> so<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.350> had<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.680> put

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
come on up on the waves so I had to put

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.200 
come on up on the waves so I had to put
some<00:04:23.009> weight<00:04:23.190> up<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.580> front<00:04:23.759> to<00:04:23.940> keep<00:04:24.060> it

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
some weight up in the front to keep it

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.620 
some weight up in the front to keep it
all<00:04:24.330> stable<00:04:24.889> anyways<00:04:26.000> enough<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.150> I'll

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
all stable anyways enough of that I'll

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.070 
all stable anyways enough of that I'll
try<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:27.930> make<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.080> running<00:04:28.410> video<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:30.300> don't

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
try to make a running video and I don't

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.850 
try to make a running video and I don't
