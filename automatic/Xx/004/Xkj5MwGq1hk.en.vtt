techline channel and today we are going
to<00:00:06.629> do<00:00:06.839> opening<00:00:07.350> up<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.589> speed<00:00:07.799> comparison

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
to do opening up a speed comparison

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.690 
to do opening up a speed comparison
between<00:00:08.580> HTC<00:00:09.210> One<00:00:09.389> m8<00:00:09.660> at<00:00:09.960> LG<00:00:10.349> g3<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:11.340> see<00:00:11.519> which

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
between HTC One m8 at LG g3 to see which

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.430 
between HTC One m8 at LG g3 to see which
one<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.030> faster<00:00:12.389> device<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.929> terms<00:00:13.139> of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
one is the faster device in terms of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.650 
one is the faster device in terms of
opening<00:00:13.950> apps<00:00:14.190> faster<00:00:14.670> Annette<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.150> which

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
opening apps faster Annette and which

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.930 
opening apps faster Annette and which
one<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.990> better<00:00:16.170> when<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.279> trying<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.640> open

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
one is better when we are trying to open

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.700 
one is better when we are trying to open
up<00:00:18.090> multiple<00:00:18.270> apps<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.990> these<00:00:19.170> devices

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
up multiple apps on these devices

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.400 
up multiple apps on these devices
so<00:00:20.400> where's<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.760> lg<00:00:21.060> g3<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.720> about<00:00:21.900> 2.5

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
so where's on lg g3 we have about 2.5

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
so where's on lg g3 we have about 2.5

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
well let's see which one is going to win

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.360 
well let's see which one is going to win
a<00:00:38.040> race<00:00:38.250> from<00:00:39.120> each<00:00:39.270> other<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.690> opening<00:00:40.079> apps

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
a race from each other in opening apps

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.790 
a race from each other in opening apps
one<00:00:41.370> by<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> let's<00:00:45.989> before<00:00:46.260> starting<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
one by one so let's before starting this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
one by one so let's before starting this
comparison<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.640> want<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> point<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.329> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
comparison I just want to point out that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.209 
comparison I just want to point out that
these<00:00:49.020> devices<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.590> connected<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
these devices are connected with the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.520 
these devices are connected with the
same<00:00:50.430> Wi-Fi<00:00:50.629> because<00:00:51.629> some<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.469> we

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
same Wi-Fi because some of them that we

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.260 
same Wi-Fi because some of them that we
use<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.949> daily<00:00:53.129> basis<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.670> Facebook<00:00:54.149> Twitter

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
use on daily basis like Facebook Twitter

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.389 
use on daily basis like Facebook Twitter
and<00:00:54.629> many<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:54.989> connected<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> Wi-Fi<00:00:55.890> and

and many more connected to Wi-Fi and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
and many more connected to Wi-Fi and
it's<00:00:57.000> Weibull<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> connect<00:00:57.750> these<00:00:57.899> devices

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it's Weibull to connect these devices

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.819 
it's Weibull to connect these devices
from<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> same<00:00:59.010> Wi-Fi<00:00:59.539> for<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.750> quick<00:01:01.410> results

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
from the same Wi-Fi for a quick results

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.709 
from the same Wi-Fi for a quick results
so<00:01:02.399> first<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:02.879> make<00:01:03.059> sure<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.480> are

not running any apps at the background

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.070 
not running any apps at the background
of<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.619> Amith<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.280> well<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.299> first<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.840> we

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
of the Amith as well so first of all we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380 
of the Amith as well so first of all we
are<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.530> open<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.369> phone<00:01:14.880> keypad<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
are going to open up a phone keypad on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.730 
are going to open up a phone keypad on
these<00:01:15.570> devices<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:18.200> nice<00:01:19.200> quicker

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
these devices there we go nice quicker

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.190 
these devices there we go nice quicker
on<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> m8<00:01:23.600> now<00:01:24.600> let's<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.259> contact<00:01:25.710> app

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
on the m8 now let's go for contact app

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
on the m8 now let's go for contact app
launch<00:01:28.200> quicker<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.430> meet<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.030> far<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
launch quicker on a meet so far the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.190 
launch quicker on a meet so far the
things<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:33.930> looking<00:01:34.200> good<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.420> m8<00:01:36.450> now

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
things are looking good on the m8 now

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.969 
things are looking good on the m8 now
let's<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.770> message<00:01:38.130> app<00:01:39.320> lost<00:01:40.320> clicker<00:01:40.619> on

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
let's go for message app lost clicker on

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.910 
let's go for message app lost clicker on
a<00:01:41.400> meet<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.320> taking<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
a meet so I think if we is taking a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.010 
a meet so I think if we is taking a
little<00:01:44.460> bit<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.000> time<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.390> comparison<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
little bit of more time in comparison to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.990 
little bit of more time in comparison to
the<00:01:46.320> m8<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.979> opening<00:01:47.280> apps<00:01:47.460> even<00:01:47.759> though<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the m8 in opening apps even though it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.300 
the m8 in opening apps even though it
has<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.329> three<00:01:48.570> gigabytes<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.110> RAM<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> more

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
has got three gigabytes of RAM and more

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.469 
has got three gigabytes of RAM and more
powerful<00:01:50.790> GPU<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.390> compared<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> omit<00:01:53.479> and

opened<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.110> far<00:02:27.350> on<00:02:27.500> these<00:02:27.680> devices<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:28.340> are

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
opened so far on these devices there are

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.630 
opened so far on these devices there are
four<00:02:28.700> apps

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
four apps

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.110 
four apps
now<00:02:31.640> let's<00:02:32.000> launch<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:33.610> camera<00:02:34.610> app<00:02:34.760> on<00:02:34.940> these

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
now let's launch a camera app on these

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.930 
now let's launch a camera app on these
devices<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:38.830> this<00:02:39.830> has<00:02:40.040> large<00:02:40.310> quicker<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
devices so this has large quicker on the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.180 
devices so this has large quicker on the
g3<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:42.140> as<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.470> see<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:42.770> mean<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.100> is
