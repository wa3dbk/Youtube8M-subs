00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.009
 spark workers form hoop 4 what they rest and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.280
 that they just let go 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 nicely stuck in the champions league won 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.560
 unexpected step is not to change anything too early 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.280
 3 it will put you forward that it is not so i am a little room 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.720

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.199
 kind of annoying 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.989
 yes as a guide when you see he shoots the sum the room is full of tons 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.419
 put outside your house 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.799
 de and then he will shoot at the offer coming close yes that is 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.829
 so the censorship turrets totally beautiful 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.209
 ing that we have a portal please 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.680
 a very nice animations where you sit when you drop if you can join it 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 to be able to set up a report you can win 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.819
 put the second of your house and if you need a partner the package 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.989
 if you don't need it 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.989
 being able to show off sat you way on 2 September 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.739
 they do away 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.449
 said yes 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:47.530
 we watch 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.280
 we also have a he wants vs a lot of suffering and I understand pretty cool forest sale 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.059
 get your cards per shot as you see here 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.189
 beh 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.539
 After the city itself all on the street were very very simple 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.469
 and you also have an animal do an accident on this 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.549
 if you put them on and I'll go here 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.219
 and then we go out of my room in front of the keeper 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.199
 to 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.429
 it has been going on since March 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.569
 baghdad smit too 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.159
 yes I am 5 full I jump down and I do not have German 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.040
 so it is useful anyway even though you know nothing about portal ad there is just 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.040
 trade under this name to make boots but there is no gadget 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.799
 well then i'll just go a little one 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.099
 doing the course with my doing 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.909
 I imagine Virenque Burgernet was very fast transporting the world 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.029
 with his completed place must be like this 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.049
 one there one here 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.379
 I'm through it 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.109
 the ad kop took place last of course i put a loser of one 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:53.959
 them here 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.919
 and I'm upstairs 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.439
 supporters away 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.449
 fun is funny and there sit worry gravity put a time 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.949
 down this year 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.429
 if i have the sp 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.149
 then I get full by that 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:10.090
 already saw the rate rise I can jump here so how high you do that 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.849
 to get more voest you get 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.169
 and 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.849
 I can also show you afterwards 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.849
 and then there's a clock on top 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.710
 and apparently no reason to stick and I did not expect that 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.010
 and after i naturally also postage that you and 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.000
 the Dongense say the infinite portal 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.699
 plasterk 4 instead of four and then you would on both cases 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.809
 They see happening or not really if you are the front runner 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.259
 that's how you get a little bit 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.330
 but it doesn't really happen and then socks demonstrate as handed over 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.830
 had to take these blocks a little higher with a few 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.699
 that's how it works 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.330
 6 one more 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.699
 find here 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:53.570
 the adam 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.039
 after a while he worked nothing when you see the castle 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 and also if you do one more bit for pride 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.860
 dams until your details also go a pass from commentator 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.219
 that is the porto de mots as promising there are 8 many more flakes too many and many 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:10.099
 more flakes 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.080
 only that is all going to discuss 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.729
 the far in the truth 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.639
 some lokin not really super much value to the mood 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.520

 I already got use to make cool maps 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:26.610
 the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.990
 look

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.560
