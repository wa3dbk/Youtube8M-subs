00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.270 
up and down play pause skip forward I'm
pretty<00:01:33.210> sure<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.630> might<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.259> apt<00:01:34.530> drawer<00:01:34.979> on

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
pretty sure this might be apt drawer on

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.390 
pretty sure this might be apt drawer on
Go<00:01:36.270> Launcher<00:01:36.450> yealt<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:37.829> send<00:01:38.040> me<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
Go Launcher yealt that would send me to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.190 
Go Launcher yealt that would send me to
the<00:01:38.610> home<00:01:38.970> screen<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.659> once<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the home screen and then once I got to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.280 
the home screen and then once I got to
the<00:01:40.290> home<00:01:40.470> screen<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.700> didn't<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.540> anything

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the home screen it didn't do anything

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.999 
the home screen it didn't do anything
so<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.979> guessing<00:01:44.340> maybe<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:46.009> Samsung

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
so I'm guessing maybe on the Samsung

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.780 
so I'm guessing maybe on the Samsung
TouchWiz<00:01:47.990> UX<00:01:49.310> home<00:01:50.310> screen<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.509> may<00:01:52.700> open<00:01:53.700> up

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
TouchWiz UX home screen this may open up

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.480 
TouchWiz UX home screen this may open up
a<00:01:54.030> pro<00:01:54.299> I'm<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:54.600> completely<00:01:54.899> sure<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
a pro I'm not completely sure and the

we just have a regular QWERTY keyboard
and<00:02:25.170> that's<00:02:26.170> basically<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.190> number<00:02:27.520> keys

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and that's basically it the number keys

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.940 
and that's basically it the number keys
are<00:02:27.940> all<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.240> same<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.900> little<00:02:29.380> bit<00:02:29.620> smaller

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
are all the same a little bit smaller

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.590 
are all the same a little bit smaller
than<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.280> keyboard<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:31.060> lot<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.300> people<00:02:31.540> are

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
than a keyboard a lot of people are

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.450 
than a keyboard a lot of people are
probably<00:02:31.900> used<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.840> yes<00:02:35.680> that's<00:02:35.860> about<00:02:36.220> it

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
probably used to and yes that's about it

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.390 
probably used to and yes that's about it
moving<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.110> bottom<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.980> keyboard

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
moving on to the bottom of the keyboard

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.780 
moving on to the bottom of the keyboard
I<00:02:39.520> guess<00:02:39.730> you'd<00:02:39.910> probably<00:02:40.240> call<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.370> yes<00:02:42.370> this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790
