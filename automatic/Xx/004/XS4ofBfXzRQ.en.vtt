00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.799
 Good day, dear 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.189
 subscribers and guests of my channel today 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.190
 we are with you 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.650
 we understand how it is right after all 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.680
 change thermostat this video is dedicated 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.770
 those who are around for example acquired 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.170
 gazelle and they have some damage 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.670
 happen 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.170
 start with the fact that unscrew the first 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.219
 bolts and they are bolts or under the stars 3 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.410
 take a brush and unscrew it all 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:38.719
 deal then remove all the connections that is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.870
 which disturb you 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.789
 disconnect all contacts in order to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.170
 it's okay to take off if you are in winter 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.950
 do it and preferably it's all 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.210
 heat off a hairdryer 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.550
 raise yes we have not taken off 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.120
 thermostat from thermostat stay there 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.780
 inside 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.719
 though further here these places and good 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.950
 we clean that is to multiply and 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.440
 quietly to the sword and it would 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.860
 77 don't torture anything important here 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.920
 gasket remove all remove gasket 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.290
 we clean it all beautiful 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.400
 so here is the thermostat case itself we 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.409
 we open it natural 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.570
 clean the whole thing 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.189
 beautiful see yes here is the gasket 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.310
 old way left tell you what 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.909
 we beat the gasket because new 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.080
 initially set the dilute did 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.149
 put a new gasket on mine 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.659
 now you need to change well, so we do not have 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.390
 gasket just gonna cover everything 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.070
 do it on the sealant and the bricks I 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.040
 I think you're not scary 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.520
 we don't have much pressure there 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 to squeeze it all 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.540
 when it stretches very scary roll 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.720
 parse remove the grid which bolts 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.720
 the body is disconnecting it is alcohol itself 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.320
 thermostat 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:17.240
 so then we definitely need again 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:22.600
 clean up everything glittered like a cat 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:26.000
 no eggs for zorin they were not 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.920
 wash thermostat too soon to 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.200
 jambs there were no these here 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.130
 shavings or even these are the places we are well 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.670
 we clean all remove the pumping we clean 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.830
 so everything is beautiful so on when we already 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.810
 all cleaned all washed 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.530
 put a thermostat place we take this 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.209
 gasket and a thin layer 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:58.709
 we put sealant under the car from 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:02.549
 in the usual way we are all 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.590
 sealing everything sticks 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:13.110
 will look like a monolith then 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.110
 we connect bolts to the body and 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:22.239
 in principle , we are all set 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.750
 thermostat we changed spun all 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:32.319
 hermetically left on 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.519
 just put it all in place inside 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.530
 brush tightened 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:44.440
 inside we take a thin layer too 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:49.170
 impose sealant works for places 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.170
 pads so i would say very well 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:58.660
 but preferably laying here and here 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:00.819
 here we just already see r that all u 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:06.150
 We are not old 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.150
 left we put the thermostat in place 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.890
 not everything is left in its place here 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.020
 we see here 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:28.010
 bottom part bottom bottom part 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.830
 we insert the most important lower branch pipe 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:36.840
 delay it all I think further 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.280
 fail here see us 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.290
 building everything to her hands and 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:46.650
 froze and so calm here 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:50.330
 could be inserted into any rubber 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.330
 the fact that rubber dubeet in the cold 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.940
 we tighten the bolts 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:01.590
 corps become very interesting from 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.180
 damn manufacturer question why are they so 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.300
 did see we helped with you 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:13.410
 calmly take and unscrew this bolt and 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.260
 the one that is there the one that is 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.230
 right here under the hull why are they so 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.050
 so we all did not understand in order 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.600
 to us remove the thermostat change before it 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.370
 very often we change in summer for summer and for 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.200
 winter 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.880
 to quickly open a big circle here 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.650
 you can't get this bolt 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.260
 so accounted for lateral faith 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:42.450
 full body shoot this is not very 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.060
 convenient to say so here you see so bolt 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.230
 there is one we can unscrew the other 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.150
 this is not the main minus 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.890
 so today it's all subscribe 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.110
 put likes on my channel with you 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.110
 good luck to you all bye bye
