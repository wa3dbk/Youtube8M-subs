00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.930
 with this victory he presents them with free professional training 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.230
 more responsibilities at www sprint com with this victory asked them what's 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.659
 village sponsorship 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.809
 welcome saun authority where are we going to explain how we can create a 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.219
 Photoshop texture for locals talk about different applicable energy 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.210
 Transparency values ​​on the same texture 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 let's start working in photoshop 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.670
 let's create a new document file the new 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.340
 we were going to color 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.340
 of color for example has been the same 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.800
 we will go to channels and we will create 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.930
 a new channel that is going to call it alpha 1 we are going to invest with control and to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.609
 to invest 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.810
 that instead of being black they talk 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.060
 inside the alpha with us we have a lan value with allows us to see what is 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.470
 found located in that texture 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.160
 whereas if we work with a black value 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.430
 will create absolute transparency 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.280
 we can work with different values ​​of January 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.870
 working on the gray scale to apply different values ​​of 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.680
 transparency 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 for example I'm going to make a selection 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.890
 and I'm going to create a selection here 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 I'm going to work with a gray 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.170
 more or less clear 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.680
 to be here 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.160
 and I'm going to paint with the paint pot 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 made a new selection 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 fill with a disc 50 percent or so 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.299
 in this way it is as if we were applying in this area a transparency 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.170
 50% 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 whereas if I work with an absolute error 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.810
 it's like I'm applying a transparency of steel 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.300
 completely transparent 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.510
 activate all channels by clicking on each axis urban spills or 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.710
 document file save 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.469
 in tiff format 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.549
 from here we are going to approach it for example in the desk without title to 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.260
 one I already have one created save 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.619
 as he writes 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.309
 revealed that there is and I already have my document created 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.279
 fly and talk 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.909
 I have a document created by default I'm going to delete the right button cube 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.559
 suppress thanks to the court 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.849
 space at month and I add comply 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.299
 with the sv key they make it a bit bigger 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.480
 beyond the material we will go to the sainz button 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.699
 and nobody new friend 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:41.659
 from here 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.069
 we will activate the roofing function so that you can receive 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.780
 shadow transfers with transparencies in this case 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.249
 one is that we have activated traditional or we are going to space atm in siena we gave a 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.469
 plan a new 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
 we are going to place a little higher with jul jewelry 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.559
 no one will 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.449
 a material 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.179
 in texture and we are going to sell a new texture we will go something like textures 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.699
 from here we will work with and malia 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.839
 and we are going to load an image a texture that we have some computers in this 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:19.089
 case that we created from photoshop is on the desktop and it was called without 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:21.349
 Title 1 point tif 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.449
 of them the equivalent 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.049
 if I activate the preview function the alfaro could see how 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.219
 It is effectively applying different values ​​of transparency to me 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.459
 as I have indicated in the fas 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.249
 inside photoshop 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.569
 so that later these can be previewed that do not surprise 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.339
 we must return to the materials button 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.759
 and apply different values 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.799
 more active z trance function 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.440
 in the value of alpha that is in one by default we will lower the costs 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:55.879
 if we go to more you will activate the boost function 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.659
 if we now try it is 12 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.280
 we can see how it is effectively applying different values ​​of 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.970
 transparency where the black looks completely transparent 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.999
 the edge that was white 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:13.659
 completely opaque while in two or more we can preview 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.379
 the different values ​​of transparency based on the gray scale that 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.209
 we pay to apply 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.880
 so far this tutorial I hope it will be useful to you 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.580
 Thanks for the attention and until next time
