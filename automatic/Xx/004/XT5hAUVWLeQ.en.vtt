00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.850
 Legendary line was born when I me 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.070
 was approached by Holland Heineken House 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.080
 or maybe I have a track to writer 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.880
 for that moment the 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.790
 the athlete and the supporters together 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.690
 and that is such a moment of ordinary 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.829
 icarly celebration is that it was and 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.450
 then I said well I want it too 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.780
 to attempt 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.510
 see if he buys something and and the heads 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.870
 and that the tire clearly pay attention 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.870
 million 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.960
 to connect 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.530
 school 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.320
 yes that a bit longer from that of the wheel 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.150
 one that is 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.320
 I knew what more is coming home I would 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.180
 see online 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.350
 everything and always and 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.870
 apparently there is a dutch 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.180
 are you what a debut single had and that 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.550
 I went there I went lise 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.100
 well then everything is going to write you them already 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.200
 those platforms and at spotify it is wrong 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.910
 gone because at spotify both sides 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.380
 is the same as the new single 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.960
 all layout in the name of that band 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.850
 but among them was not theirs 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.260
 song but suddenly is legendary 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.550
 lane below 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.140
 but because it is one of the alternative 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.000
 agree with you and a journalist that song 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.500
 wanted to hear from them 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.210
 and came back as soloists very quickly 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.970
 he recognized their voice 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.100
 where does my voice remain very recognizable and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.710
 and so it went deep astra to 3fm 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.780
 to michiel party grounds dome in 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.360
 so my phone rang that evening yes me 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.550
 I am also 30 times from all sorts 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.350
 but I was so fed up with oh shit 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.910
 and everyone was so because I was completely 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.530
 not the intention the intention was that 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.360
 if the play would start then this would 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.600
 for the first time in the holland heineken 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.370
 be played at home and there you must 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.050
 but make a virtue of necessity 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.140
 two days later we are in groups 3 and 4 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.140
 in itunes and is already sort of this 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.790
 yes yes you had if you had this if you would 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.310
 can come up with drills so are you 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.930
 anyway a leaf and 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.300
 and so people barked that we too 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.050
 have made up driving 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.050
