going to click again on the artboard I'm
going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> create<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.430> 30<00:01:08.640> by<00:01:08.909> 30<00:01:09.260> I'm

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
going to create one that's 30 by 30 I'm

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.789 
going to create one that's 30 by 30 I'm
going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> make<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.770> yellow<00:01:12.530> then<00:01:13.530> I'm<00:01:13.650> going

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
going to make this yellow then I'm going

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.160 
going to make this yellow then I'm going
to<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:13.950> bring<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> snaps

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to just bring that up and so it snaps

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.140 
to just bring that up and so it snaps
alongside<00:01:18.229> then<00:01:19.229> we're<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> view

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
alongside then we're going up to view

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.310 
alongside then we're going up to view
make<00:01:21.150> sure<00:01:21.180> we've<00:01:21.390> got<00:01:21.420> our<00:01:21.540> rulers<00:01:21.869> turned<00:01:22.140> on

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
make sure we've got our rulers turned on

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.749 
make sure we've got our rulers turned on
so<00:01:22.590> they'll<00:01:22.770> appear<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> left<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
so they'll appear down the left and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.560 
so they'll appear down the left and
across<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> top<00:01:25.970> what<00:01:26.970> we're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
across the top what we're going to do is

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.469 
across the top what we're going to do is
we<00:01:27.689> got<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> left<00:01:28.020> click<00:01:28.110> inside<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.860> ruler<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
we got a left click inside the ruler and

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.999 
we got a left click inside the ruler and
drag<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:31.350> create<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.680> guide

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
drag out and this will create a guide

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.109 
drag out and this will create a guide
for<00:01:32.280> us<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:34.350> our<00:01:34.439> first<00:01:34.770> guide<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.759> going<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
for us and our first guide is going to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.469 
for us and our first guide is going to
be<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.900> left<00:01:37.079> hand<00:01:37.350> edge<00:01:38.479> we're

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
be on the very left hand edge we're

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.080 
be on the very left hand edge we're
going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> same<00:01:40.020> again<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.970> we're

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
going to do the same again and we're

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.330 
going to do the same again and we're
going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> stop<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.860> Red<00:01:44.100> Square

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
going to stop right where the Red Square

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.580 
going to stop right where the Red Square
meets<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> yellow<00:01:45.000> square<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
meets the yellow square and then the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.560 
meets the yellow square and then the
third<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.070> final<00:01:47.399> guide<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> be

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
third and final guide is going to be

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.020 
third and final guide is going to be
along<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.649> edge<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.460> yellow<00:01:50.729> square

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
along the right edge the yellow square

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
along the right edge the yellow square
like<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> should<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.710> your

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
like that so now you should have your

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.310 
like that so now you should have your
three<00:01:53.159> guides

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320
