00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.870
 welcome to my channel good the video of 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.520
 today is to tell you about a 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:32.450
 indispensable for me in my good so much 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.920
 in my kitchen like on my shelf 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.520
 beauty care 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.180
 So nothing 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.690
 it's olive oil 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.140
 and good some bottles to the kitchen the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.120
 another one I have here 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.120
 because I use it too much 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.680
 good 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.110
 as for the olive oil it has 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:02.380
 vitamins and antioxidants and endless 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.960
 good with so good the nutrients their 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.740
 Consumption helps reduce cholesterol 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.229
 by helping the absorption of calcium 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.070
 It also smells really good and tastes very 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.720
 rich 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:22.200
 so it's a very good option for the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.719
 good healthy cooking I use it 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.970
 for several things so for me it's 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.070
 indispensable to see 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.940
 Now that I'm with several problems in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.220
 the face 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.690
 I'm using it to remove makeup 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.690
 most of the face 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.540
 the eyes were too much for him 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.540
 mans away but d 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.200
 then he applied another layer of 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.710
 olive oil on the whole face 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.880
 I'm having several problems that 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.770
 several granites are appearing 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.010
 so I'm kind of boring 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.880
 and I want 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.000
 to fix that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.640
 so I liked that for putting on makeup 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.060
 the other 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.850
 to exfoliate my hands I also use 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.980
 my lips that I already have the exfoliating 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.209
 equal lips 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.970
 a light olive oil and sugar 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.120
 ready 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.650
 step in my hands and my hands are 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.650
 completely renovated 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.300
 also for the hair for the ends of the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.290
 hair 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.790
 too good the olive oil 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.879
 apart from being economical 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.580
 a bottle of 250 ml will cost 3 thousand 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.280
 pesos 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.280
 in comparison to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.400
 this oil that is 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.000
 when cheering and others 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.710
 that comes 10 ml and costs 3 thousand pesos 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 that is, not important 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.380
 good 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.510
 I also use it to wash brushes 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.100
 how much like the pump and brushes in a 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.320
 plate 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.320
 I put the valuable 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.310
 and olive oil 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.500
 and I'm passing the brushes through there 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.520
 mixture 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.810
 then I pass them by the hand until 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.230
 take out all the dirt and left it 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.270
 soaking in a glass and I'm doing what 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.270
 same with the others and as well as 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.500
 and the brushes are kept very 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.110
 I do not have this as well as the great 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.580
 quality 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.830
 the truth is that the buds are pretty 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.030
 economic 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.850
 but 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.850
 and keeping it like this have lasted me a lot 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.870
 so 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.530
 so I use it more 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.790
 but to put on makeup to explain 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.690
 well I think it is 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.480
 and good indeed are quite a few things 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.570
 so I can not stop having a 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.960
 olive oil in my house 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.120
 I love I also love candles for 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.720
 the salads I'm a fan of the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.480
 salad 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.900
 so if you olive with me always 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.910
 and good though what you liked 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.640

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.000
 months and you also love oil 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.450
