 not printed out 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:04.260
 two disks approximately from the instruction on 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:11.990
 operation and also all sorts of instructions on 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:16.020
 Let's start first of all connected 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.619

 electronics stores so let's 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.329
 let's turn 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:57.210

 so he finished the food keys then 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:42.439

 also what table by 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:19.160
 antipas instruction clear let's 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:22.760
 try something first install 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.760
