00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
similarities now and they've got a very

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.870 
similarities now and they've got a very
similar<00:01:54.360> pace<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.259> believe<00:01:55.619> sure<00:01:56.280> well

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
similar pace that I believe sure well

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.910 
similar pace that I believe sure well
i'm<00:01:57.509> pretty<00:01:57.719> sure<00:01:57.960> Kane<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.560> actually<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
i'm pretty sure Kane is actually a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.679 
i'm pretty sure Kane is actually a
little<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.280> faster<00:01:59.460> than<00:01:59.850> Shearer<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.329> believe

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
little bit faster than Shearer I believe

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.590 
little bit faster than Shearer I believe
here's<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.290> uh<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.759> two<00:02:03.060> points<00:02:03.479> ahead

here's to uh you know two points ahead

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
here's to uh you know two points ahead
of<00:02:03.780> Shira<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.770> terms<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.100> pace<00:02:05.310> which<00:02:05.520> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
of Shira in terms of pace which is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.249 
of Shira in terms of pace which is
obviously<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.329> thing<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.869> similar

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
obviously a good thing but very similar
