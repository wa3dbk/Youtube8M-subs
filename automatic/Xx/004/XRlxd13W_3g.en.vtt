00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
fact let me show you a little trick that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.840 
fact let me show you a little trick that
you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.229> use<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.619> any<00:01:43.829> camera<00:01:43.950> right<00:01:44.729> off

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you can use with any camera right off

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
you can use with any camera right off
the<00:01:44.970> bat<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> little<00:01:45.990> thing<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.530> says

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the bat see the little thing that says

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.069 
the bat see the little thing that says
shutter<00:01:47.610> speed<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.270> raise<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:49.020> number

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
shutter speed if you raise that number

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.170 
shutter speed if you raise that number
to<00:01:49.439> make<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.770> longer<00:01:49.920> whenever<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.909> take<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to make it longer whenever you take a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.569 
to make it longer whenever you take a
picture<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.780> your<00:01:52.170> camera<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:52.979> for

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
picture now your camera will be on for

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.940 
picture now your camera will be on for
several<00:01:53.610> seconds<00:01:54.540> taking<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.409> picture<00:01:55.470> for

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
several seconds taking a picture for

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
several seconds taking a picture for
that<00:01:56.280> amount<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.810> really

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that amount of time now this is really

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.690 
that amount of time now this is really
cool<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.430> take<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
cool because what you can do is take a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.399 
cool because what you can do is take a
light<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.659> move<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> around<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.350> frame

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
light and then move it around the frame

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.920 
light and then move it around the frame
and<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.369> actually<00:02:02.490> record<00:02:02.759> light<00:02:03.600> trails

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and you can actually record light trails

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.319 
and you can actually record light trails
with<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.350> people<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:05.579> you've<00:02:06.000> heard<00:02:06.270> of

with that and people if you've heard of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.609 
with that and people if you've heard of
this<00:02:06.479> technique<00:02:06.840> before<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.259> called<00:02:07.409> light

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
this technique before it's called light

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
this technique before it's called light
painting<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.190> most<00:02:08.399> people<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.179> oh<00:02:09.479> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599

just<00:02:09.810> I'm<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.099> wave<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> flashlight

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
just I'm just I just wave a flashlight

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.740 
just I'm just I just wave a flashlight
around<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
around and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.540 
around and
it's<00:02:12.930> done<00:02:13.230> well<00:02:13.530> actually<00:02:13.770> it's<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.310> whole<00:02:14.340> art

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
form in and of itself because there are

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.520 
form in and of itself because there are
dozens<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.850> different<00:02:17.970> types<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:19.050> lights<00:02:19.350> that
