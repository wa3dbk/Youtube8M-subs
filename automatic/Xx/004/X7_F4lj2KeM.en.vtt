00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
with a bit of a leg thing I just maybe

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.550 
with a bit of a leg thing I just maybe
this<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.660> more<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.929> multiplayer<00:02:10.349> thing

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
this is more of a multiplayer thing

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.170 
this is more of a multiplayer thing
maybe<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.920> more<00:02:11.009> fun<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.520> Jeff<00:02:11.849> kind<00:02:12.120> of

would<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:51.120> it's<00:02:51.450> not<00:02:52.260> exactly<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
would get it but it's it's not exactly a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.160 
would get it but it's it's not exactly a
mob<00:02:52.830> needs<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.430> spotlighted<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:55.110> again

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
mob needs to be spotlighted but again

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.810 
mob needs to be spotlighted but again
maybe<00:02:55.769> I'm<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.100> missing<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.459> point<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.760> this

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
maybe I'm just missing the point of this

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.479 
maybe I'm just missing the point of this
one<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.060> mean<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.480> again<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.800> actual

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
one I mean I again the the actual

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.460 
one I mean I again the the actual
helicopter<00:02:59.910> thing<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.570> doesn't<00:03:00.959> work<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.410> a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
helicopter thing is doesn't work like a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.170 
helicopter thing is doesn't work like a
helicopter<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:02.130> not<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:02.459> when<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.940> flip

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
helicopter it's not like when you flip

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.699 
helicopter it's not like when you flip
the<00:03:03.269> thing<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.540> flies<00:03:03.750> downwards<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.470> just

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
the thing it flies downwards it is just

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.100 
the thing it flies downwards it is just
rising<00:03:04.980> because<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.269> just<00:03:06.780> made<00:03:06.989> to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
rising because it can it's just made to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.560 
rising because it can it's just made to
look<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.500> helicopter<00:03:07.800> um<00:03:08.700> yeah<00:03:09.090> okay<00:03:09.420> i

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
guess i could see the appeal of this in

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.380 
guess i could see the appeal of this in
multiplayer<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.700> know<00:03:11.820> you're<00:03:12.150> grabbing

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
I could totally see the appeal of that

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.860 
I could totally see the appeal of that
but<00:03:20.310> people<00:03:20.850> are<00:03:20.940> asking<00:03:21.150> me<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.329> do<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.540> single

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
the appeal of this but again it is it is

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.470 
the appeal of this but again it is it is
a<00:03:28.019> well-put-together<00:03:28.500> mod<00:03:28.890> maybe<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.519> never

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
a well-put-together mod maybe I never

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.360 
a well-put-together mod maybe I never
like<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.750> tweak<00:03:31.110> mod<00:03:31.470> settings<00:03:32.010> because<00:03:32.160> I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
like to tweak mod settings because I

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.009 
like to tweak mod settings because I
like<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.640> play<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.880> mod<00:03:33.030> exactly<00:03:33.750> as<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.959> was

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
like to play the mod exactly as it was

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.870 
like to play the mod exactly as it was
intended<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.530> your<00:03:34.709> warts<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.100> all<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.670> for

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
intended in your warts and all but for

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.310 
intended in your warts and all but for
the<00:03:35.940> sake<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.209> argument<00:03:36.480> let's<00:03:36.660> say<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:37.079> mmmm

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
the sake of argument let's say it's mmmm

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.720 
the sake of argument let's say it's mmmm
a<00:03:37.410> threshold<00:03:37.799> lower<00:03:38.250> don't<00:03:38.489> know<00:03:38.549> what<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
a threshold lower don't know what the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.100 
a threshold lower don't know what the
default<00:03:39.030> is<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.269> might<00:03:39.420> very<00:03:39.450> much<00:03:39.780> ripped

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
default is this might very much ripped

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.930 
default is this might very much ripped
off<00:03:40.260> my<00:03:40.290> arms<00:03:40.739> because<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.280> low<00:03:41.459> but

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
off my arms because it's so low but

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.970 
off my arms because it's so low but
let's<00:03:42.090> let's<00:03:42.360> give<00:03:42.540> this<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.750> go<00:03:42.870> uh<00:03:43.019> I'm<00:03:43.829> gonna

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
let's let's give this a go uh I'm gonna

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.080 
let's let's give this a go uh I'm gonna
go<00:03:44.070> ahead<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.430> assume<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.700> amendment

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
go ahead and assume that amendment

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.940 
go ahead and assume that amendment
threshold<00:03:45.480> default<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.230> hundred<00:03:46.769> because

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
threshold default is a hundred because

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.830 
threshold default is a hundred because
that<00:03:47.040> seems<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.340> nice<00:03:47.549> number<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.269> let's

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
that seems like a nice number so let's

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.630 
that seems like a nice number so let's
sell<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> hundred<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.829> hope<00:03:50.190> that's<00:03:50.489> the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
sell it to a hundred and hope that's the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.670 
sell it to a hundred and hope that's the
default<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.299> default<00:03:51.900> dismemberment

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
default this is default dismemberment

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.030 
default this is default dismemberment
threshold<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.400> okay<00:03:54.000> my<00:03:54.209> arms<00:03:54.239> up<00:03:54.480> oh<00:03:54.980> ok<00:03:55.980> so

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
threshold and okay my arms up oh ok so

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.770 
threshold and okay my arms up oh ok so
that's<00:03:57.079> that's<00:03:59.150> that's<00:04:00.150> why<00:04:00.360> this<00:04:00.420> member

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
that's that's that's why this member

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.229 
that's that's that's why this member
threshold<00:04:01.200> isn't<00:04:01.470> dumb<00:04:01.650> isn't<00:04:02.640> standard

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
threshold isn't dumb isn't standard

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.990 
threshold isn't dumb isn't standard

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.469 
the education uh here we go okay so this
is<00:04:23.010> probably<00:04:23.190> one<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.880> closest<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.390> the

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
is probably one of the closest to the

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.150 
is probably one of the closest to the
lowest<00:04:24.630> i'm<00:04:24.840> gonna<00:04:24.990> get<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.620> should<00:04:26.010> in

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
lowest i'm gonna get so this should in

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.980 
lowest i'm gonna get so this should in
theory

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
theory

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.230 
theory
work<00:04:27.590> okay<00:04:27.979> there's<00:04:28.610> no<00:04:28.729> reason<00:04:29.060> why<00:04:29.180> this

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
work okay there's no reason why this

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.650 
work okay there's no reason why this
shouldn't<00:04:29.810> uh<00:04:30.380> well<00:04:31.340> okay<00:04:31.639> I<00:04:31.849> guess<00:04:31.940> theories

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
shouldn't uh well okay I guess theories

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.240 
shouldn't uh well okay I guess theories
are<00:04:32.750> made<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.960> be<00:04:33.050> broken<00:04:33.080> how's<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.620> rules<00:04:33.979> I

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
are made to be broken how's that rules I

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.520 
are made to be broken how's that rules I
don't<00:04:34.370> know<00:04:34.430> um<00:04:34.669> I'll<00:04:35.419> try<00:04:35.599> my<00:04:35.720> knees<00:04:35.930> maybe<00:04:36.229> a

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
don't know um I'll try my knees maybe a

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.909 
don't know um I'll try my knees maybe a
ship<00:04:37.130> ship<00:04:37.340> ship<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.759> extend<00:04:38.599> there<00:04:39.560> we<00:04:39.710> go

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
ship ship ship and extend there we go

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.430 
ship ship ship and extend there we go
alright<00:04:40.789> that<00:04:41.150> now<00:04:41.360> here<00:04:41.630> we<00:04:41.720> go<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.110> more

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
alright that now here we go this is more

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.710 
alright that now here we go this is more
like<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.650> this<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.819> a<00:04:43.849> bit<00:04:44.030> more<00:04:44.180> like<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.569> of

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
like it this is a bit more like and of

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.240 
like it this is a bit more like and of
course<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.199> replay<00:04:45.530> doesn't<00:04:45.860> work<00:04:46.009> because

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
course the replay doesn't work because

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.689

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.120 
some very cool looking replays maybe I'm
missing<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.380> point<00:05:18.500> of<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:18.830> maybe<00:05:18.979> I'll

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
missing the point of it so maybe I'll

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.740 
missing the point of it so maybe I'll
get<00:05:19.280> loads<00:05:19.669> and<00:05:19.849> loads<00:05:19.909> and<00:05:20.120> loads<00:05:20.210> of<00:05:20.419> replays
