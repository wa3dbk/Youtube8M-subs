00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
chemistry and so I've only taught for

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.900 
chemistry and so I've only taught for
four<00:00:31.320> years<00:00:31.470> actually<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.220> those<00:00:32.430> four<00:00:32.699> years

four years actually in those four years

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.509 
four years actually in those four years
I've<00:00:33.120> taught<00:00:33.360> chemistry<00:00:34.019> do<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.949> do<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.129> lot<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
I've taught chemistry do you do a lot of

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.180 
I've taught chemistry do you do a lot of
labs<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.420> experiments<00:00:37.229> in<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.500> classes<00:00:37.739> and

can you give me some examples yes we do
a<00:00:41.280> lot<00:00:41.549> of<00:00:41.580> labs<00:00:41.850> that's<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> fun<00:00:42.570> part<00:00:42.600> about

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
a lot of labs that's the fun part about

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.680 
a lot of labs that's the fun part about
honors<00:00:43.860> chemistry<00:00:44.330> because<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:45.510> can

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
honors chemistry because you can

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.829 
honors chemistry because you can
actually<00:00:45.720> it's<00:00:46.470> great<00:00:46.979> to<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.190> hands-on

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
actually it's great to get hands-on

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.729 
actually it's great to get hands-on
practice<00:00:48.839> with<00:00:49.019> some<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> theory<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
practice with some of the theory that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.039 
practice with some of the theory that
we've<00:00:50.070> learned<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:50.790> to<00:00:51.360> see<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.540> chemistry

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
we've learned and to see that chemistry

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.130 
we've learned and to see that chemistry
in<00:00:52.500> real<00:00:52.769> life<00:00:52.979> I<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:54.269> in<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> International

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
in real life I be in the International

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
in real life I be in the International
Baccalaureate<00:00:55.670> classes<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.119> all<00:00:57.330> about

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
Baccalaureate classes it's all about

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.420 
Baccalaureate classes it's all about
applying<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.710> knowledge<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.129> we've

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
applying the knowledge that we've

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.369 
applying the knowledge that we've
learned<00:00:59.610> in<00:00:59.820> our<00:00:59.879> classroom<00:01:00.479> or<00:01:00.689> in<00:01:00.720> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
learned in our classroom or in the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.250 
learned in our classroom or in the
formal<00:01:01.830> classroom<00:01:02.040> setting<00:01:02.610> in<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:02.850> lab<00:01:03.260> we

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
formal classroom setting in the lab we

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.219 
formal classroom setting in the lab we
do<00:01:05.420> empirical<00:01:06.420> formula<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.049> learn<00:01:07.200> about

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
do empirical formula we learn about

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.980 
do empirical formula we learn about
purple<00:01:07.770> formulas<00:01:08.159> through<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> lab<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:09.359> do<00:01:09.659> we

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
purple formulas through a lab we do we

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.160 
purple formulas through a lab we do we
make<00:01:10.170> voltaic<00:01:10.890> cells<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.390> lab<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.899> we<00:01:12.990> can

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
make voltaic cells in the lab so we can

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.349 
make voltaic cells in the lab so we can
actually<00:01:13.439> see<00:01:13.619> how<00:01:13.859> batteries<00:01:14.399> work<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:15.240> do

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
actually see how batteries work we do

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.830 
actually see how batteries work we do
titrations<00:01:16.109> and<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.130> calorimetry

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
titrations and we do calorimetry

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.639 
titrations and we do calorimetry
experiments<00:01:18.840> where<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.109> can<00:01:19.259> actually<00:01:19.289> see

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
experiments where we can actually see

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.529 
experiments where we can actually see
how<00:01:19.799> different<00:01:20.030> solutions<00:01:21.030> give<00:01:21.240> different

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
how different solutions give different

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.389 
how different solutions give different
forms<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.929> energy<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.649> we<00:01:22.770> actually<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.219> lot

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
forms of energy so we actually do a lot

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.959 
forms of energy so we actually do a lot
of<00:01:23.429> fun<00:01:23.700> laps<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.630> our<00:01:24.780> class<00:01:25.520> what<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
of fun laps in in our class what is the

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.300 
of fun laps in in our class what is the
funniest<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.719> Beth<00:01:28.079> experience<00:01:28.859> that<00:01:29.100> you

very<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:59.170> just<00:01:59.410> it's<00:01:59.620> hard<00:01:59.680> sometimes<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.310> see

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
very it just it's hard sometimes to see

very it just it's hard sometimes to see
how<00:02:00.760> how<00:02:01.120> some<00:02:01.330> folks<00:02:01.450> are<00:02:01.660> really<00:02:01.720> trying<00:02:02.140> and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
how how some folks are really trying and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.630 
how how some folks are really trying and
sometimes<00:02:02.710> maybe<00:02:02.980> it's<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.220> little<00:02:03.400> bit<00:02:03.490> more

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
sometimes maybe it's a little bit more

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.220 
sometimes maybe it's a little bit more
difficult<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:04.300> that's<00:02:04.750> probably<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.110> most

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
difficult and that's probably the most

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.570 
difficult and that's probably the most
difficult<00:02:05.380> thing<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:05.980> when<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.190> see<00:02:06.400> people

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
difficult thing is when you see people

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.550 
difficult thing is when you see people
struggling<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.300> you<00:02:07.390> want<00:02:07.690> them<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.200> get<00:02:08.350> you

our lab and how you actually can

our lab and how you actually can
understand<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.720> abstract<00:02:53.260> concept<00:02:53.860> so

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
understand that the abstract concept so

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.160 
understand that the abstract concept so
we<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.550> basically<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:55.000> progression<00:02:55.420> from

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
we it's basically a progression from

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.570 
we it's basically a progression from
going<00:02:56.440> from<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.710> general<00:02:57.100> knowledge<00:02:57.280> of

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
situations where you haven't seen that

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.420 
situations where you haven't seen that
exact<00:03:04.330> problem<00:03:04.750> before<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.800> an<00:03:05.980> IB<00:03:06.250> it's

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
exact problem before so an IB it's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.770 
exact problem before so an IB it's
really<00:03:06.640> about<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.120> see<00:03:07.360> something<00:03:07.600> that

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
really about can you see something that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.510 
really about can you see something that
you've<00:03:07.870> never<00:03:07.900> seen<00:03:08.260> before<00:03:08.410> based<00:03:09.280> on<00:03:09.459> your

the<00:04:03.120> individuals<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.840> we're<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.500> creators

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
the individuals that we're the creators

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.220 
the individuals that we're the creators
of<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.370> innovation<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.209> they<00:04:06.930> have<00:04:07.109> to

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
of that innovation and they have to

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.660 
of that innovation and they have to
present<00:04:07.409> a<00:04:07.829> five<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.340> seven<00:04:08.640> minutes

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
present a five to seven minutes

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.809 
present a five to seven minutes
predation<00:04:09.450> on<00:04:09.599> that<00:04:10.109> particular<00:04:10.889> concept<00:04:11.670> or

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
predation on that particular concept or

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.289 
predation on that particular concept or
application<00:04:12.450> it's<00:04:13.109> about<00:04:13.290> collaboration

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
application it's about collaboration

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.999 
application it's about collaboration
it's<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.719> a<00:04:15.989> cross-functional<00:04:16.530> team

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
it's a it's a cross-functional team

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.979 
it's a it's a cross-functional team
between<00:04:17.400> physics<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.030> chemistry<00:04:18.479> and

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
between physics and chemistry and

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.289 
between physics and chemistry and
biology<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.609> really<00:04:20.759> about<00:04:20.910> working

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
biology so it's really about working

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.600 
biology so it's really about working
well<00:04:21.570> with<00:04:21.600> other<00:04:21.870> students<00:04:22.610> getting

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
well with other students getting

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.640 
well with other students getting
uncomfortable<00:04:24.600> with<00:04:24.930> something<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.410> you

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650

may<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.430> know<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.090> may<00:04:27.180> not<00:04:27.330> be<00:04:27.449> too

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
may you know that you may not be too

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.210 
may you know that you may not be too

talking to professor's or doctors that

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.200 
talking to professor's or doctors that
you<00:04:31.169> don't<00:04:31.380> know<00:04:31.620> initially<00:04:31.979> but<00:04:32.759> you'll<00:04:32.910> find

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
you don't know initially but you'll find

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
that's a minute as a group for science

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.939 
that's a minute as a group for science
if<00:04:42.419> you<00:04:42.570> take<00:04:42.750> group<00:04:42.990> for<00:04:43.199> science<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.770> be

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
if you take group for science I be

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.620 
if you take group for science I be
that's<00:04:44.550> something<00:04:44.849> you<00:04:44.940> will<00:04:45.060> have<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.419> take

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
that's something you will have to take

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.939 
that's something you will have to take
and<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.199> a<00:04:46.259> matter<00:04:46.410> of<00:04:46.500> just<00:04:46.560> learning

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
and it's just a matter of just learning

one year student that you think students
could<00:05:37.520> learn<00:05:37.550> from<00:05:37.760> today<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:38.810> think<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.890> one

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
could learn from today I think the one

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.250 
could learn from today I think the one
thing<00:05:40.130> is<00:05:40.640> when<00:05:40.850> I<00:05:40.880> was<00:05:41.150> in<00:05:41.390> I<00:05:41.810> was<00:05:41.930> a<00:05:42.080> ninth

college and finish my degree in

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.970 
college and finish my degree in
chemistry<00:06:14.510> got<00:06:14.990> a<00:06:15.020> mat<00:06:15.230> got<00:06:15.470> a<00:06:15.500> graduate

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
chemistry got a mat got a graduate

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.170 
chemistry got a mat got a graduate
degree<00:06:16.010> in<00:06:16.280> material<00:06:16.850> science<00:06:16.880> and

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
what tips you have that could help

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.590 
what tips you have that could help
students<00:06:30.710> better<00:06:30.860> prepare<00:06:31.520> themselves<00:06:32.180> for

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
students better prepare themselves for

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.090 
students better prepare themselves for
your<00:06:32.930> class<00:06:33.170> good<00:06:33.980> question<00:06:34.520> math<00:06:35.270> so<00:06:36.140> if<00:06:36.530> you

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
your class good question math so if you

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.550 
your class good question math so if you
if<00:06:37.730> you<00:06:37.880> may<00:06:38.210> not<00:06:38.330> realize<00:06:38.720> it<00:06:38.870> but<00:06:38.900> chemistry

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
if you may not realize it but chemistry

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.740 
if you may not realize it but chemistry
has<00:06:39.860> a<00:06:39.890> lot<00:06:40.190> of<00:06:40.220> math<00:06:40.490> so<00:06:41.120> if<00:06:41.240> you<00:06:41.330> come<00:06:41.570> into

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
has a lot of math so if you come into

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.720 
has a lot of math so if you come into
chemistry<00:06:42.250> thinking<00:06:43.250> that<00:06:43.430> you're<00:06:43.550> going<00:06:43.670> to

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
chemistry thinking that you're going to

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.730 
chemistry thinking that you're going to
run<00:06:43.940> or<00:06:44.240> get<00:06:44.390> away<00:06:44.600> from<00:06:44.840> Matt<00:06:45.050> that's<00:06:45.350> not<00:06:45.560> the

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
run or get away from Matt that's not the

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.560 
run or get away from Matt that's not the
case<00:06:45.920> physics<00:06:46.460> and<00:06:46.670> chemistry<00:06:47.000> especially

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
case physics and chemistry especially

physics<00:06:48.170> more<00:06:48.380> than<00:06:48.530> chemistry<00:06:48.860> uses<00:06:49.640> a<00:06:49.670> lot

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
physics more than chemistry uses a lot

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.090 
physics more than chemistry uses a lot
