00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.390
 hello everyone again thanks for watching 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.090
 in the fission channel in favor and is the 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.760
 first video and in these weeks we are going to 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.380
 see some stretches that are very 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.480
 good for all those who passed 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.700
 a lot of time sitting in this first 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.210
 video let's see the stretch of the 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.210
 pyramidal muscle 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.900
 in this exercise in this stretch 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.920
 of pyramidal let's first stretch the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.060
 right leg 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.060
 face up 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.720
 we put our right leg crossed 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.360
 in the left leg and we push the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.370
 knee out 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.520
 there does not stretch us 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.719
 let's take our leg and we're going to 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.719
 carry to the chest 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.820
 we have to notice tension but not pain 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.520
 and the stretch will stop when the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.460
 tightness that we do not have in this area 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.130
 decrease 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.740
 it can be 40 seconds per minute 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.560
 depends on the person 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.290
 we go down 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.170
 and we stretch the other leg crossed very 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.770
 fast 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.580
 and we push and we reach the chest 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.580
 we take air 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.140
 and knee in that direction 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.650
