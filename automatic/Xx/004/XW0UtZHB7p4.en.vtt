the bosses are the toughest the bosses
are<00:04:17.660> interesting<00:04:18.230> mythical<00:04:18.650> creatures<00:04:19.040> and

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
are interesting mythical creatures and

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.890 
are interesting mythical creatures and
they're<00:04:19.340> nice<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.730> look<00:04:19.910> at<00:04:20.090> but<00:04:20.150> they're<00:04:20.720> not

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
they're nice to look at but they're not

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.050 
they're nice to look at but they're not
that<00:04:21.110> interesting<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.860> fight<00:04:22.100> pretty<00:04:22.880> much

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
that interesting to fight pretty much

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.120 
that interesting to fight pretty much
their<00:04:23.270> battle<00:04:23.600> pattern<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.140> always<00:04:24.530> keep<00:04:24.950> on

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130

attacking<00:04:25.520> keep<00:04:25.880> on<00:04:26.030> attacking<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.690> it's

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
attacking keep on attacking so it's

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.630 
attacking keep on attacking so it's
really<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.110> rush<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.680> just<00:04:27.860> hit<00:04:28.070> them<00:04:28.220> as<00:04:28.460> many

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
really a rush to just hit them as many

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.110 
really a rush to just hit them as many
times<00:04:28.730> as<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.180> before<00:04:29.720> they<00:04:29.870> can<00:04:30.050> hit<00:04:30.200> you

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.190 

but<00:04:35.120> at<00:04:35.240> least<00:04:35.360> they're<00:04:35.630> graphically

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
but at least they're graphically

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.690 
but at least they're graphically
impressive<00:04:36.770> for<00:04:36.950> an<00:04:37.040> early<00:04:37.280> Super<00:04:37.550> Nintendo

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
impressive for an early Super Nintendo

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.090 
impressive for an early Super Nintendo
game<00:04:38.270> in<00:04:38.780> fact<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.350> graphics<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:39.890> this<00:04:39.920> game

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
game in fact the graphics in this game

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.760 
game in fact the graphics in this game
are<00:04:40.250> quite<00:04:40.640> good<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.630> animation<00:04:42.200> is<00:04:42.350> fluid

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770

the<00:04:42.890> backgrounds<00:04:43.430> look<00:04:43.580> nice<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.120> there's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
the backgrounds look nice and there's

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.690 
the backgrounds look nice and there's
some<00:04:45.080> really<00:04:45.320> ambitious<00:04:45.860> scenes<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.520> use

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
some really ambitious scenes that use

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:56.910 
some really ambitious scenes that use

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.010 

it's<00:04:57.920> pretty<00:04:58.280> visually<00:04:58.790> impressive<00:04:59.090> but<00:04:59.810> also

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
it's pretty visually impressive but also

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:30.260 
it's pretty visually impressive but also
the<00:05:00.410> music's<00:05:00.800> really<00:05:00.860> cool

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
atmosphere and that just adds to the

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.240

great controls and gameplay but don't be

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.529 
great controls and gameplay but don't be
fooled<00:05:36.280> into<00:05:36.699> thinking<00:05:36.850> it's<00:05:37.330> just
