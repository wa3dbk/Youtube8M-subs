 Translator: Shahd Mohammed Ahmed Yousif Reviewer: Ayman Mahmoud 

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:55.379
 (Hammer) 

00:00:58.444 --> 00:01:02.478
 (Laughter) 

00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:25.260
 (Microwave sound) (Laughter) 

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.981
 You may all agree with me 

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:35.756
 That's a good way 

00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:37.915
 Made of asphalt 

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:41.149
 The asphalt is easy to drive over 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.283
 But not always, especially not on days like this one 

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:47.134
 When the sky is raining with such intensity 

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:50.082
 The water is scattered over the asphalt 

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:52.376
 Especially if you are driving a bike 

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:56.321
 And those cars pass by you which is not nice 

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:59.431
 The asphalt can also produce a lot of noise 

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.045
 It is a lot of noise 

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.489
 And if we build roads as in the Netherlands 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.621
 Very close to the cities, then we would like silent ways 

00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:10.890
 The solution is the industry of ways 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.067
 Asphalt porous 

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:15.058
 Porous asphalt is a substance currently used 

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:18.017
 In most highways in the Netherlands 

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:21.461
 It contains pores that can rain through the rain 

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:24.362
 All rainwater will flow to the parties 

00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:26.451
 Giving us an easy way to drive 

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.381
 And thus get rid of the scattered water 

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.543
 All the fuss will disappear in these pores 

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:34.566
 Because it is completely hollow, all the fuss will disappear 

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:37.154
 If the methods are very silent 

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:40.699
 And of course there are drawbacks 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.861
 The disadvantage of this route is the possibility of volatilities 

00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:47.786
 What is Volatility? We can observe in this way 

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:50.407
 Disintegration of stones on the surface 

00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:55.685
 Starting with one stone followed by more stones 

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.427
 More, more, more and more 

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.994
 And then ... Well, I will not (laughter) 

00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:03.908
 But it can be broken and exposed to wind erosion 

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:05.698
 Something we will not be happy with 

00:03:05.698 --> 00:03:09.688
 Finally, this volatility will lead to more and more damage 

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.304
 Sometimes drilling can be made because of it 

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:16.365
 Here, it's ready 

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:19.550
 Digging, certainly this can become a problem 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.093
 But we have the solution 

00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:24.351
 Here we can see how damage appears in the material fact 

00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:26.351
 It is porous asphalt, as I said, and therefore will only exist 

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.123
 A small amount of cement between the stones 

00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:32.442
 Because of weathering, due to ultraviolet radiation, due to oxidation 

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:35.170
 This cement, this bitumen 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.843
 Gum-connecting aggregates will shrink 

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.788
 If shrinkage will occur microscopic incisions 

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:41.510
 The aggregates will be thin 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.070
 And then when driving on the road will destroy the totals 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.066
 This is what we have seen here 

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:50.880
 To solve this problem we thought of self-processing material 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.541
 If we can make it self-processing 

00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:56.734
 Only then can we get a solution 

00:03:56.734 --> 00:04:01.328
 So what we can do is to use the dishwashing wire 

00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:04.813
 And cut this wire into small pieces 

00:04:04.813 --> 00:04:08.717
 And mixing these small pieces with tar 

00:04:08.717 --> 00:04:10.462
 Then we get asphalt 

00:04:10.462 --> 00:04:13.529
 Contains small pieces of laundry wire inside 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.320
 Then we'll need a machine, like the ones you see here 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.459
 We can use for cooking - induction machine 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.508
 Incitement raises the heat of materials, especially steel, it is excellent 

00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:26.190
 So what we will do is raise the temperature of the steel 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.681
 We will melt bitumen 

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:30.247
 The liquid bitumen will flow into the microscopic incisions 

00:04:30.247 --> 00:04:33.454
 The stones are fixed again and to the surface 

00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:37.416
 Today I used the microwave because I can not bring 

00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:39.653
 Massive induction tool here on stage 

00:04:39.653 --> 00:04:42.533
 If the microwave is similar to the system 

00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:46.178
 So I put the sample in it, and now I'll get it out 

00:04:46.178 --> 00:04:49.430
 To see what happened 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.923
 Here is the sample 

00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:56.316
 And I said that we have such a machine in the lab 

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.588
 To heat the sample 

00:04:58.588 --> 00:05:00.678
 We have tested many samples there 

00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:03.853
 When the government saw our results 

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:07.803
 "Well, that's interesting, we have to try it," she said. 

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:10.119
 So they gave us part of the highway 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:13.606
 400 meters in road A58, where we had to carry out 

00:05:13.606 --> 00:05:16.116
 Test path for this article 

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:19.648
 And that's what we did here. You can see us when you test the road 

00:05:19.648 --> 00:05:24.146
 And certainly this road will remain for several years 

00:05:24.146 --> 00:05:27.434
 Without harm, that is what we have learned from practice 

00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:30.213
 We took a bunch of samples from this road 

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:32.482
 And we put them for testing in the lab 

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:35.399
 We consumed these samples 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.011
 We subjected them to high loads, we treated them using the induction machine 

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:41.837
 We treated it and tested it again 

00:05:41.837 --> 00:05:43.741
 We have tested several times 

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:45.966
 The result of this research was as follows 

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:49.284
 If we come back this way every 4 years 

00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:52.164
 With the induction machine - this is a big copy 

00:05:52.164 --> 00:05:54.069
 We made it to use on a real road - 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.939
 If we come back this way every 4 years 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.689
 We can multiply the lifetime of this road 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:01.866
 Which will certainly save a lot of money. 

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:04.043
 Well, to sum up I can say 

00:06:04.043 --> 00:06:06.799
 We made material 

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:10.579
 Using steel fabric, increase steel fabric 

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.088
 And using the energy of induction 

00:06:13.088 --> 00:06:15.755
 To increase the life of the road surface 

00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:17.505
 So multiply it 

00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:21.169
 And thus save a lot of money with simple tricks 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.642
 Inevitably now you are wondering if it really works 

00:06:24.642 --> 00:06:27.745
 Well, we still have the sample here, it's a bit warm 

00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:30.324
 In fact, you should cool down first 

00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:32.664
 Before reviewing the therapeutic results 

00:06:32.664 --> 00:06:35.532
 But I will try 

00:06:35.532 --> 00:06:38.291
 To see. Yes, it works 

00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:39.641
 Thanks 

00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:45.057
