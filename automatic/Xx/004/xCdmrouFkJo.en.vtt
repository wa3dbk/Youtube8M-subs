our storage type
so<00:02:17.379> in<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.650> case<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.099> have<00:02:18.340> disk<00:02:18.640> folder<00:02:19.060> one

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so in this case I have disk folder one

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.440 
so in this case I have disk folder one
and<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.849> get<00:02:22.120> some<00:02:22.239> information<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and I can get some information on the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.899 
and I can get some information on the
tier<00:02:25.450> 1<00:02:25.510> storage<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.409> tier<00:02:26.680> 3<00:02:26.709> storage<00:02:27.430> how

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
tier 1 storage in the tier 3 storage how

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.599 
tier 1 storage in the tier 3 storage how
full<00:02:28.329> is<00:02:28.569> it<00:02:28.599> what<00:02:29.019> am<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.230> going<00:02:29.469> to<00:02:29.650> run<00:02:29.859> out<00:02:30.069> so

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
full is it what am I going to run out so

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.369 
full is it what am I going to run out so
that<00:02:30.760> we<00:02:30.849> can<00:02:31.060> use<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.390> as<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.629> little<00:02:32.170> bit<00:02:32.230> of

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
that we can use this as a little bit of

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.649 
that we can use this as a little bit of
a<00:02:32.469> planning<00:02:32.920> tool<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:33.879> that<00:02:33.909> we<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.420> take<00:02:34.629> a

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
a planning tool so that we can take a

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.990 
a planning tool so that we can take a
look<00:02:34.840> at<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> environment<00:02:35.680> say<00:02:35.859> hey<00:02:36.129> we're

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
look at the environment say hey we're

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.300 
look at the environment say hey we're
going<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.420> run<00:02:37.599> out<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.780> tier<00:02:38.200> 1<00:02:38.379> storage<00:02:38.890> next

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
going to run out of tier 1 storage next

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.890 
going to run out of tier 1 storage next
quarter<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:39.790> should<00:02:40.000> probably<00:02:40.299> look<00:02:40.750> at

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
quarter we should probably look at

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.830 
quarter we should probably look at
purchasing<00:02:41.470> some<00:02:41.709> additional<00:02:42.129> discs<00:02:42.840> well

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
purchasing some additional discs well

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.129 
purchasing some additional discs well
come<00:02:43.989> over<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.379> i/o<00:02:44.620> usage<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.930> similar<00:02:46.930> to

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
come over to i/o usage and similar to

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.039 
come over to i/o usage and similar to
the<00:02:47.859> ecological<00:02:48.159> saying<00:02:48.730> HQ<00:02:49.150> software<00:02:49.659> I<00:02:49.689> use

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
the ecological saying HQ software I use

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.890 
the ecological saying HQ software I use
this<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.290> lot<00:02:50.439> to<00:02:51.370> troubleshoot<00:02:52.030> performance

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
this a lot to troubleshoot performance

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.559 
this a lot to troubleshoot performance
issues<00:02:53.319> in<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:54.040> environment<00:02:54.609> so<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.209> can<00:02:55.359> take

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
issues in the environment so we can take

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.069 
issues in the environment so we can take
a<00:02:55.599> look<00:02:55.870> at<00:02:56.079> an<00:02:56.829> individual<00:02:57.549> volume<00:02:58.150> folder<00:02:58.599> we

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
a look at an individual volume folder we

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.960 
a look at an individual volume folder we
can<00:02:59.200> take<00:02:59.439> a<00:02:59.470> look<00:02:59.650> at<00:02:59.829> an<00:02:59.950> individual<00:03:00.519> volume

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
can take a look at an individual volume

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.319 
can take a look at an individual volume
we<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.510> take<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.900> look<00:03:02.169> at<00:03:02.500> servers<00:03:03.220> as<00:03:03.430> well<00:03:03.700> so

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
we can take a look at servers as well so

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.259 
we can take a look at servers as well so
that<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:04.599> can<00:03:05.019> get<00:03:05.470> an<00:03:05.590> understanding<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:06.430> is

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
that we can get an understanding of is

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.710 
that we can get an understanding of is
it<00:03:07.689> just<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:08.260> single<00:03:08.889> volume<00:03:09.310> or<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:10.359> it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
it just a single volume or is it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.360 
it just a single volume or is it
multiple<00:03:11.709> volumes<00:03:12.419> and<00:03:13.419> we<00:03:13.629> can<00:03:13.810> even<00:03:14.370> dig

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
multiple volumes and we can even dig

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.149 
multiple volumes and we can even dig
down<00:03:15.609> into<00:03:16.269> disks<00:03:17.049> so<00:03:17.349> do<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.769> have<00:03:17.829> more

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
down into disks so do I have more

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.089 
down into disks so do I have more
activity<00:03:18.639> on<00:03:18.669> my<00:03:18.849> 15k<00:03:19.510> disks<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.169> my<00:03:20.859> real

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
activity on my 15k disks is my real

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.490 
activity on my 15k disks is my real

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
7200 rpm discs things like that and the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.449 
7200 rpm discs things like that and the
last<00:03:28.299> tab<00:03:28.599> your<00:03:28.810> charting<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.500> very<00:03:30.040> similar

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
last tab your charting is very similar

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.460 
last tab your charting is very similar
to<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.760> EqualLogic<00:03:31.290> chq<00:03:33.180> live<00:03:34.180> view<00:03:34.659> in<00:03:34.900> that

to the EqualLogic chq live view in that

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.890 
to the EqualLogic chq live view in that
we<00:03:35.769> can<00:03:36.099> take<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.579> look<00:03:36.819> at<00:03:37.000> what<00:03:37.239> is<00:03:37.329> actively

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
we can take a look at what is actively

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.689 
we can take a look at what is actively
happening<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.949> environment<00:03:39.069> right<00:03:39.639> now

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
happening in the environment right now

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.330 
happening in the environment right now
we<00:03:39.909> can<00:03:40.299> show<00:03:40.479> the<00:03:40.599> last<00:03:40.780> five<00:03:41.739> minutes<00:03:41.919> and<00:03:42.190> go

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
we can show the last five minutes and go

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.149 
we can show the last five minutes and go
all<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.609> way<00:03:42.819> up<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.209> one<00:03:43.629> hour<00:03:43.870> if<00:03:44.260> we<00:03:44.319> like

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
all the way up to one hour if we like

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.640 
all the way up to one hour if we like
and<00:03:45.780> again<00:03:46.780> that's<00:03:46.959> going<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.290> show<00:03:47.500> us

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and again that's going to show us

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.189 
and again that's going to show us
exactly<00:03:48.069> what<00:03:48.459> we're<00:03:48.609> doing<00:03:48.849> right<00:03:49.030> now<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.629> I

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
exactly what we're doing right now and I

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.839 
exactly what we're doing right now and I
don't<00:03:50.409> know<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:50.769> have<00:03:51.159> had<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.400> chance<00:03:51.699> to

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
don't know if you have had a chance to

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.670 
don't know if you have had a chance to
notice<00:03:52.299> but<00:03:52.479> we<00:03:52.599> have<00:03:52.870> all<00:03:53.139> these<00:03:53.290> checkboxes

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
notice but we have all these checkboxes

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.520 
notice but we have all these checkboxes
down<00:03:54.340> here<00:03:54.609> at<00:03:54.699> the<00:03:54.819> bottom<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.720> can<00:03:55.989> be<00:03:56.500> a

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
down here at the bottom so I can be a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.500 
down here at the bottom so I can be a
little<00:03:56.889> more<00:03:56.979> granular<00:03:57.310> as<00:03:57.909> to<00:03:58.239> the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
little more granular as to the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.210 
little more granular as to the
information<00:03:59.079> that<00:03:59.109> I'm<00:03:59.319> taking<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.799> look<00:04:00.040> at

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
information that I'm taking a look at

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.460 
information that I'm taking a look at
because<00:04:00.729> maybe<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.209> only<00:04:01.629> want<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.169> look<00:04:02.260> at<00:04:02.439> I

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
because maybe I only want to look at I

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.530 
because maybe I only want to look at I
and<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:03.010> don't<00:04:03.069> necessarily<00:04:03.489> want<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.299> take<00:04:04.510> a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
and I don't necessarily want to take a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.960 
and I don't necessarily want to take a
look<00:04:04.750> at<00:04:04.870> throughput<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.530> can<00:04:06.040> uncheck<00:04:06.459> all<00:04:06.729> the

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
look at throughput I can uncheck all the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.030 
look at throughput I can uncheck all the
throughput<00:04:07.530> boxes<00:04:09.120> lastly<00:04:10.120> we<00:04:10.659> do<00:04:10.870> have<00:04:11.169> a<00:04:11.439> ton

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
throughput boxes lastly we do have a ton

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.249 
throughput boxes lastly we do have a ton
