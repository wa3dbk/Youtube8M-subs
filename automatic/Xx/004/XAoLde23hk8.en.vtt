organic<00:01:35.610> tofu<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.479> keeping<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> Chipotle

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
tradition all of the meats are

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.370 
tradition all of the meats are
sustainably<00:01:39.360> raised<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.049> don't<00:01:40.229> have

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
sustainably raised and they don't have

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
sustainably raised and they don't have
any<00:01:40.650> additives<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.310> antibiotics<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.090> hormones

any additives of antibiotics or hormones

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.050

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
your meal is complete so I chose the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
chilled rise noodles top of the chicken

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
chilled rise noodles top of the chicken
satay<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.250> eggplant<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.790> Thai<00:01:53.970> basil

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
satay with the eggplant and Thai basil

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.569 
satay with the eggplant and Thai basil
with<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> green<00:01:55.110> curry<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.950> papayas<00:01:56.310> law

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
with a green curry with the papayas law

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.789 
with a green curry with the papayas law
and<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.299> crushed<00:01:57.540> peanuts<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.020> top<00:01:58.049> okay

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and with the crushed peanuts on top okay

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
and with the crushed peanuts on top okay
so<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:59.219> off<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.030> awesome<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so first off I think it is awesome that

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.880 
so first off I think it is awesome that
they<00:02:00.869> are<00:02:00.960> taking<00:02:01.290> Thai<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.829> Vietnamese

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
they are taking Thai and Vietnamese

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.709 
they are taking Thai and Vietnamese
cuisine<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:02.969> are<00:02:03.090> turning<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> into<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
cuisine and they are turning it into a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.749 
cuisine and they are turning it into a
fast<00:02:04.020> casual<00:02:04.469> restaurant<00:02:05.009> Thai<00:02:05.399> food<00:02:05.610> has

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
fast casual restaurant Thai food has

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.330 
fast casual restaurant Thai food has
always<00:02:05.790> been<00:02:06.299> one<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.570> favorites

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
always been one of my favorites

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.889 
always been one of my favorites
all<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.579> time<00:02:07.969> so<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.209> think<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.599> really

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
all the time so I think this is a really

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.669 
all the time so I think this is a really
great<00:02:09.050> step<00:02:09.349> in<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.530> right<00:02:09.649> direction

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
great step in the right direction

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.430 
great step in the right direction
however<00:02:10.459> I<00:02:10.759> think<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.330> shophouse<00:02:12.019> still<00:02:12.290> has

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
however I think that shophouse still has

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.660 
however I think that shophouse still has
a<00:02:12.470> few<00:02:12.739> little<00:02:12.980> kinks<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.400> they<00:02:13.459> need<00:02:13.610> to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
a few little kinks that they need to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.059 
a few little kinks that they need to
work<00:02:13.819> out<00:02:14.000> my<00:02:14.480> biggest<00:02:14.900> problem<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.800> had

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
work out my biggest problem that I had

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.610 
work out my biggest problem that I had
was<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.970> ratio<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.420> my<00:02:17.870> chicken<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.500> my

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
was the ratio of my chicken to my

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.920 
was the ratio of my chicken to my
veggies<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.280> think<00:02:19.670> was<00:02:19.849> way<00:02:20.060> off<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.480> got<00:02:20.720> like

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
veggies I think was way off I got like

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.930 
veggies I think was way off I got like
one<00:02:20.959> tiny<00:02:21.680> little<00:02:21.800> scooping<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.489> my<00:02:22.640> chicken

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
one tiny little scooping of my chicken

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.850 
one tiny little scooping of my chicken
meanwhile<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:23.660> had<00:02:23.840> like<00:02:23.959> two<00:02:24.200> big<00:02:24.440> scoops<00:02:24.680> of

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
meanwhile I had like two big scoops of

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.920 
meanwhile I had like two big scoops of
vegetables<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:25.879> think<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.599> when<00:02:26.780> you're

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
vegetables so I think just when you're

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.050 
vegetables so I think just when you're
hungry<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.709> you're<00:02:27.920> paying<00:02:28.129> like<00:02:28.340> almost<00:02:28.549> $10

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
hungry and you're paying like almost $10

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.339 
hungry and you're paying like almost $10
for<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.269> meal<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.870> want<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.080> have<00:02:30.200> something

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
for a meal you want to have something

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.900 
for a meal you want to have something
that's<00:02:30.440> really<00:02:30.739> gonna<00:02:30.830> fill<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.160> up<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.640> I

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
that's really gonna fill you up and I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.490 
that's really gonna fill you up and I
personally<00:02:32.360> felt<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.810> most<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.349> dish

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
personally felt that most of the dish

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.500 
personally felt that most of the dish
was<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.769> rice<00:02:34.129> noodles<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:35.090> vegetables

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
was just rice noodles and the vegetables

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.089 
was just rice noodles and the vegetables
I<00:02:35.780> also<00:02:36.019> think<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.410> while<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.590> dish<00:02:36.920> was

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
I also think that while the dish was

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.800 
I also think that while the dish was
good<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.730> was<00:02:37.790> flavorful<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.599> didn't

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
good and it was flavorful it didn't

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.809 
good and it was flavorful it didn't
really<00:02:38.989> knock<00:02:39.140> my<00:02:39.319> socks<00:02:39.349> off<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:40.099> think<00:02:40.670> that

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
really knock my socks off I think that

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.250 
really knock my socks off I think that
maybe<00:02:41.120> they<00:02:41.299> have<00:02:41.420> too<00:02:41.720> many<00:02:41.900> different

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
maybe they have too many different

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.720 
maybe they have too many different
options<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.890> menu<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.310> if<00:02:43.370> they<00:02:43.489> kind<00:02:43.700> of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
options on the menu and if they kind of

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.370 
options on the menu and if they kind of
wound<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.180> down<00:02:44.329> a<00:02:44.360> little<00:02:44.480> bit<00:02:44.720> they<00:02:45.079> might<00:02:45.260> be

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
wound it down a little bit they might be

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.660 
wound it down a little bit they might be
more<00:02:45.530> successful<00:02:45.739> in<00:02:46.220> making<00:02:46.340> each

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
more successful in making each

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.759 
more successful in making each
individual<00:02:47.360> dish<00:02:47.569> taste<00:02:48.140> as<00:02:48.319> best<00:02:48.500> as<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.650> can

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
individual dish taste as best as it can

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.860 
individual dish taste as best as it can
now<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:49.459> not<00:02:49.640> authentic<00:02:49.910> Thai<00:02:50.450> which<00:02:50.720> is

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
now it's not authentic Thai which is

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.690 
now it's not authentic Thai which is
completely<00:02:51.380> fine<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.769> it's<00:02:52.160> really<00:02:52.430> hard<00:02:52.610> to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
completely fine and it's really hard to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.220 
completely fine and it's really hard to
do<00:02:52.819> that<00:02:52.940> with<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> fast<00:02:53.390> casual<00:02:53.720> restaurant

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
do that with a fast casual restaurant

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.990 
do that with a fast casual restaurant
but<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.739> just<00:02:55.010> felt<00:02:55.220> for<00:02:55.400> like<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.519> ten<00:02:55.819> dollar

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
but I just felt for like a ten dollar

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.150 
but I just felt for like a ten dollar
meal<00:02:56.390> with<00:02:56.810> drink<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.349> everything<00:02:57.470> included

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
meal with drink and everything included

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.650 
meal with drink and everything included
that<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.549> was<00:02:58.700> going<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.910> be<00:02:59.030> getting<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.239> little

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
that I was going to be getting a little

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.140 
that I was going to be getting a little
bit<00:02:59.780> something<00:02:59.959> more<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.459> sum<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.700> up<00:03:01.879> I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
bit something more so to sum it up I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.539 
bit something more so to sum it up I
think<00:03:02.360> it's<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.750> cool<00:03:03.079> concept<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:04.040> that

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
think it's a cool concept I think that

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.130 
think it's a cool concept I think that
it<00:03:04.879> could<00:03:05.000> do<00:03:05.209> really<00:03:05.420> really<00:03:05.629> well<00:03:05.780> if<00:03:06.049> they

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
it could do really really well if they

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.539 
it could do really really well if they
just<00:03:06.290> worked<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.620> few<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.890> kinks<00:03:07.069> out<00:03:07.280> I

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
just worked a few of the kinks out I

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.920 
just worked a few of the kinks out I
don't<00:03:07.819> think<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.209> hundred<00:03:08.480> percent<00:03:08.569> there

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
don't think it's a hundred percent there

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.289 
don't think it's a hundred percent there
yet<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.739> being<00:03:09.950> said<00:03:10.040> I'm<00:03:10.610> happy<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.209> went
