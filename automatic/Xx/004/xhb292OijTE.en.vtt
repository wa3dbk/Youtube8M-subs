00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.340
 versatile market for between floors and 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.259
 covered in large projects one 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.480
 comprehensive solution tailored to 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.210
 each project providing the benefits 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.430
 architectural and structural giojista 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.619
 it is a secondary structural villeta of 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.559
 Open core in composite laminated steel 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.620
 basically two parts laces and 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.660
 lattice twist is designed as a

 simply supported element for 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.610
 support direct loads of mezzanines 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.620
 working in composite section or for 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.489
 roof loads working as 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.489
 simple section 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.500
 with joyce you get these advantages 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.800
 as an added value to the system 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.899
 traditional economy can cover 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.000
 large lights with a minimum load 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.370
 dead avoiding the construction of more 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.940
 columns inside the building reducing 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.790
 quantum and foundation sections 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.530

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.510
 specialized designs optimized according to 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.380
 the project requirements 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.840
 security joyce complies with the standard of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.460
 seismic resistance nsr 10 when driving 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.310
 high quality standards in their 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.500
 materials manufacturing processes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.030
 Finishes and assembly joystick meets 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.310
 the parameters established by the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.340
 joyce institute style ensuring the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.840
 structural integrity of the product 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.120
 installation of joyce in buildings 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.430
 perform the conventional foundation with 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.100
 footings beams and subfloor plates in 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.240
 concrete after the foundation 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.840
 continue with the construction of the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.270
 columns 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.700
 In particular, the reinforcements of 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.620
 The main aerial beams and mounts 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.810
 the lateral fin shape for its melting 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.490
 the concrete beams are fused with the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.920
 negative of the joystick for the 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.810
 cast in two stages the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.100
 fin form and line up and install the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.870
 joystick according to the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.060
 specifications supplied by 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.910
 almansa entering 10 centimeters in each 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.410
 beam used as support is installed the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.930
 collaborative sheet in sense 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.640
 perpendicular to the yogis we proceed to 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.590
 weld the shear connectors to 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.620
 top cord of the joystick through 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.080
 of the tec in its valleys 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.940
 the electrowelded mesh is installed and 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.640
 finally the process of 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.650
 pouring concrete 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.630
 The construction of the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.810
 columns in particular towards the next 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.819
 At the level , the reinforcements of the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.590
 aerial beams and assemble to form 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.600
 side to the height level 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.750
 bottom of the slab leaving the boxes 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.670
 for the entrance of the joyce to the beam it 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.800
 they line up and install the joysticks of 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.240
 according to the specifications 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.490
 supplied by almansa entering 10 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.770
 centimeters on each beam used as 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.350
 support the collaborative sheet is installed 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.880
 perpendicularly to yoris is 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.040
 proceeds to solder the connectors 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.410
 cutting to the top cord of the joystick 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.240
 through the tec in its valleys it 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.370
 install the electrowelded mesh 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.820
 and finally the process of 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.770
 concrete dump up here we have 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.720
 seen how the joystick is installed for 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.060
 Mezzanines working in section 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.710
 composed with concrete columns now 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.020
 we will see the installation with columns 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.060
 metal in this way continues 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.340
 anchoring a few platinas with bolts 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.980
 concrete which receive the columns 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.950
 the assembly of the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.450
 Main porticos in metallic beams 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.420
 are installed in the load beams the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.070
 brackets for the joysticks are aligned and 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.900
 the joysticks are installed according to 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.300
 the specifications supplied by 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.120
 almazán installs the collaborative sheet 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.710
 in a sense perpendicular to the joyce is 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.780
 proceeds to solder the connectors 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.970
 cutting to the top cord of the joystick 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.950
 through the tec in its valleys it 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.630
 install the electrowelded mesh and 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.550
 finally the process of 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.920
 concrete pouring 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.660
 in the particular case of wineries and table 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.300
 nines the feeding is done 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.640
 conventional with footings beams and plates 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.740
 of concrete subfloor then it 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.750
 executes the hoisting of the porticos on 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.520
 the dice of the shoes and they are installed 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.680
 the structural elements of 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.410
 bracing and closing of the 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.150
 main structure is proceeded to 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.890
 mounting the deck joysticks 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.810
 on some plates installed in the 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.430
 joystick to expand the support area 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.190
 of the joyce on the trusses 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.230
 The main installation is carried out 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.940
 the joyce lining up according to 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.940
 the assembly plans established 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.149
 for the table construction nimes 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:39.459
 performs the lifting of the structure 

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:40.959
 main and the joyce are installed on 

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:42.740
 the supports welded to the beams 

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:45.410
 main 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.210
 it proceeds to install the soldered d 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.160
 the shear connectors to the cord 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.500
 top of the joystick is installed the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.050
 electrowelded mesh and finally it 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.539
 melts the concrete of these slabs to them 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.979
 the construction of the winery ends with 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.490
 the assembly of the lateral enclosures 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.970
 and the tile 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.229
 both in mezzanines and on roofs 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.020
