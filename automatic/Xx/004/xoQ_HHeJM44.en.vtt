stitches<00:00:42.989> before<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> might<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
stitches before and you might have to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
stitches before and you might have to
manipulate<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.450> stitches<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.140> markers

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
manipulate the stitches so the markers

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.010

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
depending how you look at it so now I've

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
depending how you look at it so now I've
completed<00:01:43.320> around<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> double<00:01:44.640> pointed

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
completed around on the double pointed

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 
completed around on the double pointed
needle<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> shaping

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
needle and you can see that the shaping

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.289 
needle and you can see that the shaping
is<00:01:47.579> coming<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> same<00:01:49.020> diagonal

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
is coming up at the same diagonal

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.490 
is coming up at the same diagonal
because<00:01:51.299> we've<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.899> been<00:01:52.020> moving<00:01:52.229> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
because we've just been moving that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.700 
because we've just been moving that
marker<00:01:53.060> right<00:01:54.060> there<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> way

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
marker right there and all the way

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.289 
marker right there and all the way
around<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.070> Hat<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.820> makes<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.119> nice

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
around the Hat so it just makes a nice
