okay first test footage with these two

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.810 
okay first test footage with these two
cameras<00:00:08.900> at<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.929> moment<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> GoPro<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
cameras at the moment a GoPro is on the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.199 
cameras at the moment a GoPro is on the
right-hand<00:00:12.030> side<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.129> Jay<00:00:14.129> s<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.789> SJ

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
right-hand side and the Jay s and the SJ

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.790 
right-hand side and the Jay s and the SJ
whatever<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.809> can't<00:00:16.139> remember<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:16.650> it's

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
whatever I can't remember what it's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.689 
whatever I can't remember what it's
called<00:00:16.880> something<00:00:17.880> less<00:00:17.970> bad<00:00:18.210> side<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:20.609> I've

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
called something less bad side so I've

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.040 
called something less bad side so I've
made<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> bit<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.179> frame<00:00:21.449> up<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.929> these

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
made a bit of a frame up for these

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.529 
made a bit of a frame up for these
cameras<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.590> sit<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.160> we'll<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> quick

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
cameras to sit on and we'll have a quick

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.939 
cameras to sit on and we'll have a quick
look<00:00:24.720> at<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.259> results<00:00:25.710> are<00:00:26.390> as<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.630> feel

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
look at what the results are as we feel

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.919 
look at what the results are as we feel
so<00:00:28.949> I'm<00:00:29.009> going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> stop<00:00:29.460> these<00:00:29.669> in<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> minute

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
so I'm going to stop these in a minute

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.410 
so I'm going to stop these in a minute
and<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.169> I'm<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> put<00:00:31.769> them<00:00:32.420> placing

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and then I'm going to put them placing

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810 
and then I'm going to put them placing
away<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.900> me<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.190> dark<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.670> light

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
away from me do some dark and light

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.869 
away from me do some dark and light
comparisons<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.289> what<00:00:37.500> happens<00:00:40.579> okay<00:00:41.579> so

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
comparisons and see what happens okay so

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.630 
comparisons and see what happens okay so
now<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> GoPro<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.100> left-hand<00:00:44.550> side

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
now the GoPro is on the left-hand side

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.689 
now the GoPro is on the left-hand side
and<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:46.670> SJ<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> right-hand<00:00:49.050> side<00:00:49.699> so

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
and the SJ is on the right-hand side so

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.610 
and the SJ is on the right-hand side so
my<00:00:50.910> mouth<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.449> equal<00:00:54.199> distance<00:00:55.199> from<00:00:55.320> both

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
my mouth is equal distance from both

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.069 
my mouth is equal distance from both
cameras<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.820> we'll<00:00:57.059> swap<00:00:57.329> between<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.780> audio

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
cameras so we'll swap between the audio

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
cameras so we'll swap between the audio
so<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.769> what<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> differences<00:00:59.579> are

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
so we can see what the differences are

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.590 
so we can see what the differences are
as<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.050> from<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> picture<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.600> frame

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
as you can see from the picture in frame

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
as you can see from the picture in frame
now<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.920> how<00:01:05.070> I've<00:01:05.190> got<00:01:05.370> it<00:01:05.489> set<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.880> on

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now and see how I've got it set up on

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.679 
now and see how I've got it set up on
the<00:01:06.540> pod<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:08.400> made<00:01:08.700> myself<00:01:08.939> which<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.450> show

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the pod that I made myself which I show

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.480 
the pod that I made myself which I show
you<00:01:09.720> how<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> make<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.280> pretty

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you how to make that is pretty

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
you how to make that is pretty
straightforward<00:01:12.950> just<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.159> would<00:01:14.250> be

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
straightforward just what would be

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
straightforward just what would be
easier<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.759> put<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.720> both<00:01:15.990> next<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> each

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
easier to put them on both next to each

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.380 
easier to put them on both next to each
other<00:01:16.650> rather<00:01:16.860> than<00:01:17.040> trying<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.759> line<00:01:17.970> both<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
other rather than trying to line both of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.730 
other rather than trying to line both of
the<00:01:18.479> videos<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.140> what<00:01:22.140> these<00:01:22.259> cameras

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the videos up so what these cameras

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.230 
the videos up so what these cameras
running<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.159> jeaious<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.880> running<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.540> 1080p

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
running on jeaious is running on 1080p

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
running on jeaious is running on 1080p
30<00:01:27.240> frames<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.810> second<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> GoPros<00:01:28.829> 1080p

whatever<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:35.970> called<00:01:36.180> I'm<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
whatever it's called I'm just going to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.840 
whatever it's called I'm just going to
call<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> 4000<00:01:38.640> from<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:40.740> 4000<00:01:41.610> is

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
call it the 4000 from now on the 4000 is

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.880 
call it the 4000 from now on the 4000 is
running<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.680> said<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.040> 1080p<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.329> 30<00:01:45.890> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
running like I said on 1080p at 30 that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
running like I said on 1080p at 30 that
seems<00:01:47.219> to<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> only<00:01:48.240> setting<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.840> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
seems to be the only setting on that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.039 
seems to be the only setting on that
camera<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:49.799> 1080p<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> GoPro<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
camera with 1080p so with the GoPro you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.959 
camera with 1080p so with the GoPro you
have<00:01:52.350> different<00:01:52.740> settings<00:01:53.159> within<00:01:53.340> 1080p<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
have different settings within 1080p a

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:03.399 
have different settings within 1080p a
30<00:01:54.740> 30<00:01:55.740> M<00:01:56.100> 40<00:01:56.790> frames<00:01:57.509> per<00:01:57.780> second<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.270> the

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.480 

4000<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.649> has<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
4000 just has the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.740 
4000 just has the
one<00:02:07.240> setting<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:08.020> 30<00:02:08.740> frames<00:02:09.039> per<00:02:09.160> second<00:02:09.750> so

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
one setting of 30 frames per second so

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.150 
one setting of 30 frames per second so
what<00:02:10.899> I'm<00:02:10.959> going<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.110> try<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.470> do<00:02:11.560> here<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:11.980> do

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
what I'm going to try and do here is do

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.380 
what I'm going to try and do here is do
a<00:02:12.190> comparison<00:02:12.940> between<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:14.230> dark<00:02:15.390> now

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
a comparison between the dark now

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.940 
a comparison between the dark now
sometimes<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.110> can<00:02:17.260> tell<00:02:17.530> if<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.740> put<00:02:17.890> it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
sometimes you can tell if you put it

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.309 
sometimes you can tell if you put it
into<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.130> dark<00:02:18.400> place<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.390> into<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.720> light<00:02:19.959> place

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
into a dark place and into a light place

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.630 
into a dark place and into a light place
I<00:02:20.819> wonder<00:02:21.819> how<00:02:21.880> those<00:02:22.060> lenses<00:02:22.420> cope<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:24.430> go

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
I wonder how those lenses cope we go

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.150 
I wonder how those lenses cope we go
from<00:02:24.880> dark<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.450> light<00:02:28.470> how<00:02:29.470> forgetting<00:02:30.100> this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
from dark to light how forgetting this

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.410 
from dark to light how forgetting this
bush<00:02:30.400> here<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:32.260> quite<00:02:32.530> dark<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:33.040> there<00:02:33.420> quite

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
bush here it's quite dark in there quite

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.920 
bush here it's quite dark in there quite
bright<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> sky<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.290> moon<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.660> that's<00:02:37.810> just

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
bright in the sky at moon so that's just

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.229 
bright in the sky at moon so that's just
one<00:02:38.170> little<00:02:38.350> test<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.890> wanted<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.160> see<00:02:39.970> what

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
one little test I wanted to see what

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.270 
one little test I wanted to see what
happens<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.300> think<00:02:43.420> well<00:02:43.860> I'm<00:02:44.860> walking

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
happens so I think well I'm walking

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.940 
happens so I think well I'm walking
along<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:46.239> cameras<00:02:46.660> are<00:02:46.810> set<00:02:46.959> up<00:02:47.110> pretty<00:02:47.800> well

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
along the cameras are set up pretty well

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.040 
along the cameras are set up pretty well
level<00:02:48.519> as<00:02:48.640> levels<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.060> could<00:02:49.239> get<00:02:49.420> them<00:02:52.050> just

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
level as levels I could get them just

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.310 
level as levels I could get them just
this<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.860> comparison<00:02:54.190> test<00:02:54.730> really

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
this is just a comparison test really

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.150 
this is just a comparison test really
there's<00:02:56.320> nothing<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.680> want<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.920> film

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
there's nothing I want to film

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.580 
there's nothing I want to film
particularly<00:02:57.580> I'm<00:02:58.420> just<00:02:59.080> walking<00:02:59.230> down

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
particularly I'm just walking down

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.690 
particularly I'm just walking down
between<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.070> houses<00:03:00.630> where<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.690> live<00:03:02.700> let's

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
between the houses where I live let's

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.729 
between the houses where I live let's
just<00:03:03.910> do<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.150> quick<00:03:04.390> pan<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.410> see<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
just do a quick pan to see the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.130 
just do a quick pan to see the
difference
