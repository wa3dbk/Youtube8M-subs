little bit more paint so that you can
see<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.049> effects<00:00:18.590> I've<00:00:19.590> roll<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.310> side<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
see the effects I've roll the side of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.740 
see the effects I've roll the side of
the<00:00:20.850> bus<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.119> I've<00:00:21.590> rolled<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> paint

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
the bus that I've rolled in the paint

the bus that I've rolled in the paint
but<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> secret<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.500> knowing<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.699> put<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
but the secret is knowing it to put a

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.919 
but the secret is knowing it to put a
lot<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.269> pain<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.680> glaze<00:00:29.720> which<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
lot of pain on the glaze which is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.720 
lot of pain on the glaze which is
already<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.460> canvas<00:00:34.309> tends<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.610> affect

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
already on the canvas tends to affect

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.160 
already on the canvas tends to affect
the<00:00:36.210> paint<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.140> roll<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.420> way<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> roll

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the paint as I roll it on the way I roll

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.310 
the paint as I roll it on the way I roll
it<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.980> how<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.760> trying<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.719> create<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it on is how I'm trying to create the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.459 
it on is how I'm trying to create the
illusion<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:44.190> individual<00:00:45.030> hairs<00:00:45.510> without

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
illusion of individual hairs without

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.060 
illusion of individual hairs without
painting<00:00:47.129> individual<00:00:48.030> hairs<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.770> like<00:00:49.770> type

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
painting individual hairs I like type

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.510 
painting individual hairs I like type
detail<00:00:50.579> work<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.480> lot<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> hair<00:00:52.520> now

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
detail work but that's a lot of hair now

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240 
detail work but that's a lot of hair now
i'm<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.120> select<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.590> portion

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
i'm going to select a little portion

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.170 
i'm going to select a little portion
right<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.879> show<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> little

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
right here so we can show a little

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.650 
right here so we can show a little
stronger<00:01:01.020> light<00:01:01.760> if<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.359> lighter

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
stronger light if it's a little lighter

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.800 
stronger light if it's a little lighter
up<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.589> area<00:01:04.979> where<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> fur<00:01:06.030> changes<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
up in this area where the fur changes a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
up in this area where the fur changes a
bit<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:09.320> we're<00:01:10.320> creating<00:01:13.250> more<00:01:14.250> light<00:01:14.580> here

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
bit so we're creating more light here

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.870 
bit so we're creating more light here
I'm<00:01:15.479> also<00:01:15.720> creating<00:01:16.500> dimension<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.340> for

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
I'm also creating dimension in the for

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.630 
I'm also creating dimension in the for
not<00:01:18.750> only<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> way<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.920> changes<00:01:20.610> in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
not only the way the for changes in

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.630 
not only the way the for changes in
color<00:01:21.000> from<00:01:21.150> area<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> area<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.710> texture<00:01:23.400> from

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
color from area to area or texture from

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510 
color from area to area or texture from
area<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.090> area<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.560> want<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.979> show<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
area to area and we want to show the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.630 
area to area and we want to show the
dimension<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.540> always<00:01:27.780> keeping<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.500> mind

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
dimension so I'm always keeping in mind

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.200 
dimension so I'm always keeping in mind
my<00:01:29.640> basic<00:01:30.320> theory<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.700> light<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.939> shadow

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
my basic theory of light to shadow

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.880 
my basic theory of light to shadow
shadow<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.960> light

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.460 

studying<00:01:39.890> me<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.400> we'll<00:01:40.720> really<00:01:41.720> helped<00:01:44.470> that

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
studying me and we'll really helped that

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.390 
studying me and we'll really helped that

the leopard as you can see the pole that
I<00:02:11.300> use<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.020> tap<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.930> pull<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:19.070> tap

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
I use is a tap and pull so it's a tap

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.090 
I use is a tap and pull so it's a tap
and<00:02:20.450> pull<00:02:21.460> tab<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:22.850> pull<00:02:23.260> tap<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.530> pull<00:02:24.830> and

and pull tab and pull tap and pull and
if<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.880> remember<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.360> way<00:02:26.480> we<00:02:26.660> used<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.960> make

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
if you remember the way we used to make

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.190 
if you remember the way we used to make
the<00:02:27.350> pencil<00:02:28.280> swivel<00:02:28.700> that's<00:02:29.330> about<00:02:29.600> as<00:02:29.750> light

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
the pencil swivel that's about as light

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.960 
the pencil swivel that's about as light
as<00:02:30.470> I'm<00:02:30.740> holding<00:02:30.980> my<00:02:31.280> brush<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:33.350> it's<00:02:33.620> tap<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
as I'm holding my brush so it's tap and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.880 
as I'm holding my brush so it's tap and
pull<00:02:35.300> tab<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.170> pull<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:37.340> pull<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:39.710> will

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
pull tab and pull and pull and this will

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.479 
pull tab and pull and pull and this will
create<00:02:42.310> your<00:02:43.360> texture<00:02:44.360> now<00:02:45.200> depending<00:02:46.010> on<00:02:46.220> how

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
create your texture now depending on how

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.520 
create your texture now depending on how
much<00:02:46.850> you've<00:02:47.180> put<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.450> if<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.900> put<00:02:48.140> too<00:02:48.170> much

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530
