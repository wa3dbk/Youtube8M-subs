phone<00:00:29.519> into<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.060> case<00:00:31.369> we've<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> part

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
phone into the case we've got the part

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.950 
phone into the case we've got the part
number<00:00:33.210> CM<00:00:33.600> 0<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> 7<00:00:34.800> 168<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.300> let's<00:00:36.480> open<00:00:36.600> up

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
number CM 0 to 7 168 so let's open up

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
number CM 0 to 7 168 so let's open up
the<00:00:37.440> packaging<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.190> take<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> look<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the packaging and take a look at the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.080 
the packaging and take a look at the
case<00:00:39.390> itself<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> calf<00:00:40.950> tough<00:00:41.430> case<00:00:41.670> sort

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
case itself so the calf tough case sort

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.119 
case itself so the calf tough case sort
of<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.600> an<00:00:42.690> evolution<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.739> barely<00:00:44.100> there

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
of is an evolution of the barely there

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.990 
of is an evolution of the barely there
case<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> made<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.899> two<00:00:46.649> parts<00:00:47.000> we've

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
case and is made up of two parts we've

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.680 
case and is made up of two parts we've
got<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:49.190> silicone<00:00:50.190> case<00:00:50.610> which<00:00:51.149> acts<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.570> an

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
got this silicone case which acts as an

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.840 
got this silicone case which acts as an
inner<00:00:51.989> lining<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.399> hard<00:00:53.670> outer

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
inner lining to this the hard outer

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.850 
inner lining to this the hard outer
shell<00:00:54.300> which<00:00:54.750> we'll<00:00:54.930> come<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
shell which we'll come back to in a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.360 
shell which we'll come back to in a
moment<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.070> silicone<00:00:59.070> case

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
moment so you can see the silicone case

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
moment so you can see the silicone case
has<00:00:59.609> been<00:00:59.789> custom-made<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> HTC<00:01:01.140> One

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
has been custom-made to the HTC One

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
has been custom-made to the HTC One
we've<00:01:01.800> got<00:01:01.949> cut<00:01:02.219> outs<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:03.000> round<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
we've got cut outs all round and it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.380 
we've got cut outs all round and it
protects<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> sides<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.180> whole

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
protects that all of the sides the whole

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
protects that all of the sides the whole
of<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.900> enclosed<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:07.979> exception<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
of it is enclosed with the exception of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.450 
of it is enclosed with the exception of
these<00:01:08.850> cutouts<00:01:09.330> where<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.049> necessary<00:01:10.650> so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
these cutouts where is necessary so

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.730 
these cutouts where is necessary so
let's<00:01:11.640> bring<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.119> HTC<00:01:12.840> One<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.350> pop<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
let's bring in an HTC One and we pop it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.999 
let's bring in an HTC One and we pop it
into<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:15.799> silicon<00:01:16.799> shell<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:19.740> fairly

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
into the silicon shell so it's fairly

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.340 
into the silicon shell so it's fairly
loose<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:21.210> around<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> device<00:01:22.110> it's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
loose actually around the device it's

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
loose actually around the device it's
easy<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.770> pop<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> it's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
easy to pop in and out like so and it's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
easy to pop in and out like so and it's
not<00:01:25.020> particularly<00:01:25.530> attractive<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.549> can

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
not particularly attractive but we can

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.539 
not particularly attractive but we can
see<00:01:27.030> we've<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.659> cut<00:01:28.020> outs<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.430> can

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
see we've got cut outs here so we can

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.310 
see we've got cut outs here so we can
understand<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> case

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
understand how we can use it in the case

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.469 
understand how we can use it in the case
now<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.280> comparison<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.939> barely<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.450> case

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
now in comparison to barely there case

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
now in comparison to barely there case
on<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> volume<00:01:34.409> controls<00:01:34.799> we've<00:01:34.979> actually

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
on the volume controls we've actually

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.569 
on the volume controls we've actually
got<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.759> raised<00:01:36.360> piece<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:37.140> silicone<00:01:37.920> rather

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
got a raised piece of silicone rather

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
got a raised piece of silicone rather
than<00:01:38.880> access<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> buttons<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> power

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
than access to the buttons but the power

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.859 
than access to the buttons but the power
button<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> headphone<00:01:41.939> jack<00:01:41.970> remain

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
button and the headphone jack remain

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.560 
button and the headphone jack remain
exposed<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> second

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
exposed then what we have is the second

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.760 
exposed then what we have is the second
layer<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.780> protection<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.350> tough<00:01:46.590> outer

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
layer of protection the tough outer

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.609 
layer of protection the tough outer
shell<00:01:47.070> made<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> ABS<00:01:48.000> plastic<00:01:48.409> it's<00:01:49.409> quite

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
shell made of ABS plastic it's quite

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.530 
shell made of ABS plastic it's quite
hard<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.189> flex<00:01:50.670> its<00:01:50.909> got<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.470> raised<00:01:53.540> texture

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
hard to flex its got this raised texture

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
hard to flex its got this raised texture
to<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.780> which<00:01:55.110> makes<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.890> grippy<00:01:56.610> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to it which makes it really grippy and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.719 
to it which makes it really grippy and
easier<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.600> hold<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.680> hand<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:59.610> the
