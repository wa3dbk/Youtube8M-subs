00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.710
 ah 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.080
 how about friends of photo wizards the day 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.960
 today we have a review and we are going to 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.460
 do the review of this goal that is 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.609
 a cannon 105 mm macro 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.240
 is a very good lens the problem is that 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.240
 is canon 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.170
 it's a cup is a cup and the review that 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.130
 let's do today is of types of 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.630
 measurement types of measurement in the camera 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.460
 have heard the types of measurement there 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.350
 three different types of measurement and it's 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.239
 a big difference what a guy does 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.800
 of measuring the next though some 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.200
 people believe that the types of measurement 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.770
 we are not going to significantly influence 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.059
 the in quality not in quality but 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.580
 in what we are going to take in our 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.440
 true photography then we submerge 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.980
 directly to the presentation that 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 I have here 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.670
 and the types of measurement practically 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.650
 they are three I do not know if they have seen these icons 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.290
 weighted matrix to the center and punctual 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.200
 and they are very important especially 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.150
 when we are taking it in manual mode in 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.460
 priority mode for opening and in mode 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.790
 priority the speed are especially 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.010
 important in those modules because 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.650
 our camera is measuring the light that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.900
 there is and is not translating it through 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.000
 of the meter then for example 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.970
 we came to this scene and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.830
 we want to take a picture we come to 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.110
 this place and we say good I'm going to take 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.240
 the picture of this place is beautiful 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.810
 the place and I'm going to take this picture 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.730
 I put my camera and fix first 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.750
 some things for example my efe because 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.940
 I want a shallow depth of field 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.000
 pretty broad then I'm going to put a 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.190
 f high for example I did a made low 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.710
 one did 200 because I do not want there to be 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.810
 much digital noise and is pending 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.910
 about time out there then I can 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.040
 start moving this wheel from here 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.530
 until I arrive or even bring my 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.530
 meter to the center that means 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.510
 that my photo will be correctly 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.430
 exposed 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.090
 with the type of measurement you use but it's going 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 to be correctly exposed then 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.500
 for example if I do not have my foundling in 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.870
 the center is not possible trova will remain in 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.549
 minus 1 and more 1 and more 2 and that wants 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.040
 say that my time is still not right 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.980
 chosen truth I have to move until 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.959
 the exposure meter is at zero as 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.040
 we see there then 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.859
 suppose it is 1 out of 500 we take the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.810
 photograph and we see this and we say no that 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.000
 it's not what I'm seeing then 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.519
 why it does not come out or what happens is 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.409
 that I'm using my measurement mode 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.750
 matrix and what does he tell me the 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.280
 matrix measurement matrix measurement 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.640
 what it does is that it's going to divide our 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.530
 scene in four parts for example so 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.350
 and what will happen is that the first 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.850
 part is going to say my camera good this 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.240
 very dark part is perhaps 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.370
 overexposed 5 steps this part is 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.190
 overexposed but a couple of steps nothing 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.650
 more here a couple of steps are very dark 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.890
 and here it's pretty dark pretty much 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.040
 5 steps on exposed then makes a 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.120
 weighting everything was going to give 0 that 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.959
 it means that it is correctly 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.390
 exposed everything all on average so 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.150
 say it sometimes when there are very parts 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.489
 about exposed for example how is the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.570
 camera can give less weight to 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.519
 this to this part that to the other 3 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.250
 obviously so that in relation that very 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.860
 well exposed the rest truth then 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.380
 we take the picture with speed 1 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.690
 500 made 200 f 11 with matrix metering 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.070
 and we see that is not right is not what 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.200
 what we want then we change to a 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.260
 punctual measurement and we have worse 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.560
 our photography is too dark 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.880
 because because the spot measurement 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.850
 will only measure approximately one 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.590
 5% of the matrix measurement scene 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.260
 measure here 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.269
 and he will not care about this part 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.610
 which you are out here that not even 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.430
 go in the camera just watching this 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.769
 part of here and he's going to tell me look 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.750
 correctly exposed this part of 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.360
 here obviously forced us to climb the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.340
 true speed then now with the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.020
 weighted the center for example the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.820
 weighted the center will always be 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.419
 in the center of our camera and 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.400
 approximately it is 35% of the scene and 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.320
 let's measure this part and the camera goes 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.050
 to see that there are more dark areas that 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.150
 clear areas then again we will 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.310
 to force our speed down by 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.530
 example about 100 keeping these 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.389
 true values but if for example 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.880
 we want the clouds 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.470
 they would also come out well then we 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.530
 we can see our camera and instead of 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.320
 measure the soil we raise our camera and 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.600
 we measure in the clouds then it will happen 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.820
 this will force us to climb again 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.060
 our speed because obviously it 's 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.970
 clearer this part of here 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.610
 let's measure most of this here 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.530
 always with these other two values ​​and 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.900
 a weighted measurement with our 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.580
 husband metro to the center but how to do 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.220
 a picture like that where everything is fine 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.060
 exposed because there are practically several 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.690
 forms but one is to take this photo if 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.639
 take this picture and then put together the two 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.669
 photographs in a program 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.220
 postproduction then friends if they have 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.840
 some comment some doubt and we 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.450
 They want to send some picture so that 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.700
 we remove him we now have a 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.310
 new a new space in our 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.139
 program that is called rock magic and in 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.450
 magic then we are going to edit 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.550
 photographs that you send us to 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.910
 see how much a red file can 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.530
 do in comparison to a jpg file 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.229
 then friends that's all remember from 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.330
 subscribe and send your comments 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.330
 thank you very much friends until next time
