00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
only lasts like two seconds so it's not

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.500 
only lasts like two seconds so it's not
super<00:04:07.500> ropey<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:10.790> oh<00:04:11.790> yeah<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.090> get<00:04:12.329> more

back obviously because that's

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.200 
back obviously because that's
significantly<00:04:17.280> harder<00:04:22.220> and
