00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.750
 And then, it's okay that the speaker is the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.719
 jordan and then bringing another video of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.730
 GTA5 and this time the staff will have 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.719
 warning at the beginning this video has 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.670
 spoiler 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.730
 So who does not want to see what's going on? 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.740
 occur in the game please do not watch then 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.439
 I have the map open 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.920
 I'll zoom in so you can see. 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.500
 then the site of the first cat 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 what the gaucho fan is the camaro of the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.890
 game is then on the last mission of gta 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.100
 It's you, you have to find the location. 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.860
 of the three gauchos let's and I confess that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.710
 It took me a long time to find them because 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.780
 receive a tip on the cell phone 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.640
 and then have to face is very fuck fuck will 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.550
 step to assure you that it is very 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.620
 Fuck, then, if you have already arrived at this stage 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.199
 has difficulty finding the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.530
 three gauchos let's here is my tip 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.600
 I have already shown the first and second 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.090
 time exactly where we found the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 bugatti veyron is in the same place 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 So it's a new map on the screen. 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.460
 can see that the place is exactly the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 same 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.549
 so this one will make it a lot easier 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.909
 who arrived at the end of the game so I already 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.710
 I already finished the gta so I 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.229
 I'm just finishing some missions 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.070
 Secondary few things I left 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.920
 back on purpose as the missions 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.530
 submarine like that plane that crashed 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.630
 in the lake I have not gone after this 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.130
 So I went now, so this is the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.500
 our second blow and how to cut and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 put the third blow on the edition 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.490
 This was the strongest of the expensive hotel I 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.360
 I dreamed to find this hook 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.850

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.240
