 in a competition of this level 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.220
 and being in the final he has 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.470
 that can be a great success 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.240
 with them my son live 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.030
 I suggest suzuki 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.150
 and again he was mentor Lee kwan vesta and 8 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.400
 to complete this final 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.840
 street number 9 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.280
 fifteen 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.660
 falls 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.020
 clinton 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.010
 we remember once again that in the next games the number is not reduced 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.110
 of streets 29 sa 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.450
 6 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.080
 precisely a defense 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870
 remarkably 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.300
 the difficulty makes 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.270
 this is a boat 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.370
 among the specialties other sports where you can live 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.020
 the three to 3 Argentine sportsmen efe 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.110
 that is to say the same 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.330
 It is a boat by 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
 currently tape enormously 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.010
 all that selection process being sometimes it's really very cruel 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.430
 the cristian turkish 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.440
 with 13 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.210
 a man I ask has been had 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.550
 it seems to 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.550
 have been another one last July 12 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.200
 well the Turks are good games 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.509
 in quote buyers because it is happening to the tenth 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.880
 continually 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.430
 the pivot above all 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.430
 not monetize inmates and never tolerated weightlifting world 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.669
 during the conference 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.929
 establishes when it comes to achieving success 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.929
 they are already interested 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.889
 its past june 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.300
 the senate approved Thursday to be fourth 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
 fourth position to leave 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.820
 but he is Turkish omar of a world 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.409
 the Belgian and the Slovak have been there 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.229
 ahead of Spanish 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.229
 very good race to go out 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.229
 we trust him 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:05.689
 so 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.259
 the three tests 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.509
 the elections are the same 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:14.129
 I counter some with maximum aspirations you can not always get 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.109
 the results 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.949
 carlos gs 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.039
 the examples 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.039
 for all the same countries the Olympic champion 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.099
 Belarus with a very powerful team 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.239
 you can not get into the final 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.629
 and who 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.649
 to be doomed to see 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.649
 upon receiving it, not leaving 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.479
 a circumstance that could affect the jaber 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.469
 criticized this Thursday that you have to compete beyond that you have not 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.549
 got 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.979
 The priority objective for any boat 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:53.879
 with aspirations and that's late 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.069
 up in the world and above all we ensure our country 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.329
 rocco and this morning there has been a circumstance 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.399
 the paddler besides the tsunami and that yesterday broke the shovel and I can not lose 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.919
 today he left the in the 200 c1 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.159
 but it was third is a 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.439
 in his series 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.989
 and it has not happened
