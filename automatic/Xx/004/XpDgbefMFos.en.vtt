it<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.140> my<00:01:22.259> god<00:01:22.439> broke<00:01:22.770> faster<00:01:23.100> than<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> should

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it so my god broke faster than it should

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.039 
it so my god broke faster than it should
have<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.210> jumping<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.689> air<00:01:24.720> as

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
have because I was jumping in the air as

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.330 
have because I was jumping in the air as
you<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.890> jump<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> air

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you all know when you jump in the air

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
you all know when you jump in the air
your<00:01:26.520> God<00:01:26.729> breaks<00:01:26.970> faster<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.960> he<00:01:28.170> managed<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
your God breaks faster so he managed to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.200 
your God breaks faster so he managed to
break<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> guard<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> got<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> grab<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.610> me<00:01:29.759> now

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
break the guard and got a grab on me now

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
break the guard and got a grab on me now
since<00:01:30.689> he<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.170> my<00:01:31.200> face<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.799> had

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
since he was right in my face I just had

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.649 
since he was right in my face I just had
to<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> counter<00:01:32.670> since<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.090> knew<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.479> guy

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to do a counter since I knew this guy

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.660 
to do a counter since I knew this guy
was<00:01:33.810> reckless<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.380> because<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.040> had<00:01:35.159> zero<00:01:35.189> subs

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
was reckless and because I had zero subs

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.499 
was reckless and because I had zero subs
and<00:01:35.820> he<00:01:35.880> had<00:01:36.030> four

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and he had four

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.969 
and he had four
I<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.170> made<00:01:37.350> him<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> was

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
I think this made him think that I was

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.469 
I think this made him think that I was
gonna<00:01:38.100> run<00:01:38.220> away<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.820> only<00:01:38.970> stood<00:01:39.210> there

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
gonna run away but I only stood there

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
gonna run away but I only stood there
use<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:40.020> supports<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.560> hide<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> grab<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
use my supports to hide the grab and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
use my supports to hide the grab and
grab<00:01:41.909> him<00:01:42.090> okay<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> tiny<00:01:43.229> bit<00:01:43.409> lucky

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
grab him okay I got a tiny bit lucky

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
grab him okay I got a tiny bit lucky
here<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.979> was<00:01:44.159> floating<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> air<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.180> gave

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
here I was floating in the air it gave

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.819 
here I was floating in the air it gave
me<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> chance<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.899> my<00:01:46.020> Kakashi<00:01:46.320> support<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
me a chance for my Kakashi support to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.520 
me a chance for my Kakashi support to
connect<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.270> he<00:01:48.420> has<00:01:48.689> almost<00:01:49.049> no

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
connect and now that he has almost no

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.780 
connect and now that he has almost no
chakra<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.009> don't<00:01:50.189> wanna<00:01:50.340> give<00:01:50.430> him<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.579> chance

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
chakra I don't wanna give him a chance

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.149 
chakra I don't wanna give him a chance
to<00:01:50.909> power<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.170> tried<00:01:52.470> very<00:01:52.710> hard<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.950> get

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
to power up so I tried very hard to get

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.950 
to power up so I tried very hard to get
that<00:01:53.310> ultimate<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.329> keep<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> pressure<00:01:54.780> on

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that ultimate in to keep the pressure on

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
that ultimate in to keep the pressure on
but<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.290> failed<00:01:55.649> now<00:01:56.130> he's<00:01:56.340> using<00:01:56.520> his<00:01:56.759> data<00:01:56.939> or

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
but I failed now he's using his data or

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.730 
but I failed now he's using his data or
support<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.420> buy<00:01:57.540> time<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> power<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.140> even

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
support to buy time to power up even

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.840 
support to buy time to power up even
though<00:01:58.799> he<00:01:58.920> was<00:01:59.040> far<00:01:59.250> enough<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.520> power<00:01:59.700> up

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
though he was far enough to power up

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
though he was far enough to power up
without<00:02:00.030> even<00:02:00.299> having<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.719> use<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.259> support

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
without even having to use that support

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
without even having to use that support
so<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:01.979> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.280> waste<00:02:02.460> again<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.420> made

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
so it was kind of a waste again I made

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.450 
so it was kind of a waste again I made
myself<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.110> decoy<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:04.680> support<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.159> connect

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
myself a decoy so my support can connect

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.069 
myself a decoy so my support can connect
it's<00:02:05.880> all<00:02:06.030> about<00:02:06.180> timing<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.689> supports

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
it's all about timing for supports

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's all about timing for supports
normally<00:02:07.979> when<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> lot<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.429> players<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.970> on

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
normally when a lot of players are on

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.449 
normally when a lot of players are on
the<00:02:09.479> brink<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.989> death<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:10.530> tend<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> chakra<00:02:11.310> -

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the brink of death they tend to chakra -

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.980 
the brink of death they tend to chakra -
and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.510 
and
humble<00:02:12.200> canceled<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.560> lot<00:02:12.770> as<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.130> can<00:02:13.250> see<00:02:13.490> I

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
humble canceled a lot as you can see I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.590

to<00:02:16.730> power<00:02:16.850> up<00:02:16.970> again<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.300> he<00:02:17.390> can<00:02:17.510> start<00:02:17.750> that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
to power up again so he can start that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.660 
to power up again so he can start that
combo<00:02:18.230> council<00:02:18.530> again<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.190> end<00:02:19.370> up<00:02:19.490> for
