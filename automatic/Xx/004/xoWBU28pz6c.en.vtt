00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
quadrocopter business and I bought it

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.810 
quadrocopter business and I bought it
because<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.740> impressed<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.430> some<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
because I was so impressed with some of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.400 
because I was so impressed with some of
the<00:00:20.880> video<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.390> was<00:00:21.510> taken<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:24.260> from<00:00:25.260> this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
helicopter from this quadrocopter and so

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.139 
helicopter from this quadrocopter and so
I<00:00:29.279> thought<00:00:29.640> I'd<00:00:30.740> search<00:00:31.740> around<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:33.059> know

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.610 
I thought I'd search around and you know
it<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.480> built<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> different<00:00:34.410> type<00:00:34.590> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
better sharpness to the video that is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380 
better sharpness to the video that is
given<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:07.950> over<00:01:08.400> some<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> other<00:01:08.820> cameras

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
given out over some of the other cameras

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.890 
given out over some of the other cameras
that<00:01:09.540> I've<00:01:09.659> seen<00:01:10.640> well<00:01:11.640> I've<00:01:12.000> gone<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:12.659> there

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that I've seen well I've gone out there

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.109 
that I've seen well I've gone out there
and<00:01:12.960> tried<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.740> figure<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> actually

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and tried to figure out how to actually

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.719 
and tried to figure out how to actually
mount<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.840> onto<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> quadrocopter<00:01:17.220> here

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
mount this onto the quadrocopter here

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.490 
mount this onto the quadrocopter here
there's<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> can

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
there's not much out there that I can

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.740 
there's not much out there that I can
find<00:01:19.770> anyway<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.640> sure<00:01:20.790> more<00:01:21.150> videos<00:01:21.540> will

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
find anyway I'm sure more videos will

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.490 
find anyway I'm sure more videos will
pop<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:21.990> after<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> put<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:24.290> had<00:01:25.290> one

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
pop up after I put this on I had one

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
pop up after I put this on I had one
person<00:01:25.740> say<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.520> somehow<00:01:26.820> mounted<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
person say that they somehow mounted the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
person say that they somehow mounted the
camera<00:01:28.229> upside<00:01:29.070> down<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:31.049> don't<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.189> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
camera upside down and I don't like that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.380 
camera upside down and I don't like that
idea<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:33.000> all

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
idea at all

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.740 
idea at all
in<00:01:33.780> fact<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.259> housing<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.159> comes<00:01:35.400> with

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
in fact this housing that it comes with

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
in fact this housing that it comes with
really<00:01:36.750> gives<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.079> lot<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.409> protection<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
really gives a lot of protection and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.090 
really gives a lot of protection and
it's<00:01:38.820> waterproof<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.570> everything<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.920> it's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it's waterproof and everything but it's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.850 
it's waterproof and everything but it's
very<00:01:41.310> heavy<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.750> fact<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.229> weighs<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.649> much<00:01:43.680> as

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
very heavy in fact it weighs as much as

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.910 
very heavy in fact it weighs as much as
the<00:01:44.100> camera<00:01:44.520> itself<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:47.100> rid<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the camera itself and so I get rid of it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.480 
the camera itself and so I get rid of it
now<00:01:49.920> you'll<00:01:50.909> notice

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
now you'll notice

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.370 
now you'll notice
good<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.640> zoom<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.940> on<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.210> Michelle<00:01:55.730> that<00:01:56.730> I

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
good and zoom in on this Michelle that I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.700 
good and zoom in on this Michelle that I
put<00:01:58.380> tape<00:01:58.620> back<00:01:59.190> here<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> back<00:02:00.710> I've

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
put tape back here on the back I've

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.790 
put tape back here on the back I've
discovered<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.780> back<00:02:03.960> portion<00:02:04.290> slides

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
discovered that the back portion slides

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.320 
discovered that the back portion slides
off<00:02:05.100> very<00:02:05.430> easily<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.830> if<00:02:07.830> if<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.119> put

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
off very easily and if if you don't put

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.680 
off very easily and if if you don't put
something<00:02:09.869> back<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:11.220> hold<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.970> edge

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
something back here to hold it that edge

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.690 
something back here to hold it that edge
you're<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.170> leaning<00:02:13.350> around<00:02:13.710> it'll<00:02:14.430> slip

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you're just leaning around it'll slip

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.480 
you're just leaning around it'll slip
off<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.540> it'll<00:02:15.810> it'll<00:02:16.290> destroy<00:02:16.770> your<00:02:16.920> video

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.130 

so<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.670> question<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.390> how<00:02:21.630> do<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:21.840> mount

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
so the question is is how do we mount

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.010 
so the question is is how do we mount
this<00:02:22.440> onto<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.640> quadrocopter<00:02:26.750> first<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.900> all

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
this onto the quadrocopter first of all

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.260 
this onto the quadrocopter first of all
we<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.410> our<00:02:28.440> mounting<00:02:28.890> bracket<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:29.730> that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
we have our mounting bracket here that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:39.949 
we have our mounting bracket here that
is<00:02:30.420> for<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.690> GoPro<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:33.350> like<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:38.959> just

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.290 

I<00:03:10.170> use<00:03:10.830> one<00:03:11.160> rubber<00:03:11.460> band<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.910> bring<00:03:15.180> it

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.720 
I use one rubber band and I bring it
through<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.010> underneath<00:03:17.720> like<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.730> place

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
through and underneath like this I place

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.990 
through and underneath like this I place
the<00:03:20.940> camera<00:03:21.360> on<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.460> then<00:03:23.460> I<00:03:23.490> wrap<00:03:23.820> it

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the camera on it and then I wrap it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.230 
the camera on it and then I wrap it
around

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.250 

over<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.390> top<00:03:34.030> now<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.210> camera<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:35.810> dirty

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
over the top now that camera is dirty

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.860 
over the top now that camera is dirty
there<00:03:36.590> it's<00:03:37.280> strong<00:03:37.640> it's<00:03:38.300> not<00:03:38.540> going

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
there it's strong it's not going

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.190 
there it's strong it's not going
anywhere<00:03:40.120> but<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.240> question<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.810> do<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.080> want

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
anywhere but the question is do I want

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.710 
anywhere but the question is do I want
to<00:03:42.620> risk<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.790> hundred<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.270> thirty<00:03:44.450> dollar

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
to risk a hundred and thirty dollar

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.230 
to risk a hundred and thirty dollar
camera<00:03:45.380> on<00:03:46.070> one<00:03:47.290> measly<00:03:48.290> rubberband<00:03:49.240> the

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
camera on one measly rubberband the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.750 
camera on one measly rubberband the
answer<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.900> no<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:52.430> take<00:03:52.730> two

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
answer that is no and so I take two

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.690 
answer that is no and so I take two
rubber<00:03:53.120> bands<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.870> mount<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.920> first<00:03:55.220> one<00:03:55.460> this

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
rubber bands I mount the first one this

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.680 
rubber bands I mount the first one this
way<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.650> then<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.770> second<00:03:58.160> one<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.520> just<00:03:59.210> want

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
way and then the second one I just want

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.020 
way and then the second one I just want
a<00:03:59.780> little<00:03:59.960> bits<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.350> security<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:01.430> so<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:01.730> wrap

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
a little bits of security and so I wrap

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:10.300 
a little bits of security and so I wrap
it<00:04:02.060> around<00:04:08.350> just<00:04:09.350> for<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.710> little<00:04:09.920> bit<00:04:10.100> more

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
it around just for a little bit more

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:22.230 
it around just for a little bit more
security

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.969 

I<00:04:22.770> then<00:04:23.770> place<00:04:23.979> it<00:04:24.310> on<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.610> camera<00:04:25.030> or<00:04:25.210> on<00:04:25.539> the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
I then place it on the camera or on the

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:34.350 
I then place it on the camera or on the
quadrocopter<00:04:32.400> now<00:04:33.400> I've<00:04:33.460> noticed<00:04:33.849> I<00:04:34.000> had<00:04:34.210> to

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
quadrocopter now I've noticed I had to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.920 
quadrocopter now I've noticed I had to
use<00:04:34.539> get<00:04:34.960> an<00:04:35.139> extra<00:04:35.500> washer<00:04:36.240> because<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.539> cannot

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
use get an extra washer because I cannot

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.860 
use get an extra washer because I cannot
make<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.380> nut<00:04:38.590> tighten<00:04:39.069> down<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.509> camera

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
make the nut tighten down so the camera

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.150 
make the nut tighten down so the camera
will<00:04:41.020> not<00:04:41.259> turn<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:43.240> with<00:04:43.449> an<00:04:43.569> extra<00:04:43.720> washer

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
will not turn but with an extra washer

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.529 
will not turn but with an extra washer
and<00:04:45.160> I<00:04:45.220> probably<00:04:45.550> could<00:04:45.970> have<00:04:46.000> got<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> thin

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
and I probably could have got a thin

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.350 
and I probably could have got a thin
washer<00:04:47.020> which<00:04:47.889> I<00:04:48.009> didn't<00:04:48.340> have<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.910> at<00:04:49.210> the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
washer which I didn't have it at the

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.439 
washer which I didn't have it at the
time<00:04:51.449> so<00:04:52.449> I<00:04:52.479> could<00:04:52.750> tighten<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.169> down<00:04:54.270> at<00:04:55.270> this

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
time so I could tighten it down at this

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.260 
time so I could tighten it down at this
point<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:56.199> camera<00:04:56.560> doesn't<00:04:56.770> move

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
point the camera doesn't move

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.999 
point the camera doesn't move
however<00:04:58.270> it's<00:04:58.509> it's<00:04:59.110> loose<00:04:59.349> enough<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.800> can

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
however it's it's loose enough I can

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.820 
however it's it's loose enough I can
manually<00:05:00.460> turn<00:05:00.849> it<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:02.229> can<00:05:02.410> put<00:05:02.590> it<00:05:02.710> in

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
manually turn it and I can put it in

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.700 
manually turn it and I can put it in
position<00:05:03.039> and<00:05:04.979> run<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.099> camera<00:05:07.349> that<00:05:08.349> is<00:05:08.410> how

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
position and run the camera that is how
