covers all of the sides this can take a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.540 
covers all of the sides this can take a
little<00:01:49.570> while<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:50.290> had<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.830> keep<00:01:50.980> going<00:01:51.040> around

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
little while I had to keep going around

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.650 
little while I had to keep going around
and<00:01:51.910> around<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.420> around<00:01:54.300> until<00:01:55.300> mine<00:01:55.480> was

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
and around and around until mine was

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.800 
and around and around until mine was
fully<00:01:55.840> covered<00:02:00.090> once<00:02:01.090> your<00:02:01.270> glass<00:02:01.450> container

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
fully covered once your glass container

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.420 
fully covered once your glass container
is<00:02:02.020> completely<00:02:02.560> covered<00:02:02.920> you're<00:02:03.070> just<00:02:03.250> going

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
is completely covered you're just going

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.160 
is completely covered you're just going
to<00:02:03.520> go<00:02:03.580> ahead<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.970> tip<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.330> upside<00:02:04.479> down<00:02:04.690> to

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
to go ahead and tip it upside down to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.170 
to go ahead and tip it upside down to
let<00:02:05.320> any<00:02:05.470> excess<00:02:05.950> paint<00:02:06.220> drain<00:02:06.520> out<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.729> think<00:02:06.940> I

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
let any excess paint drain out I think I

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.060

this dry for quite awhile I actually let

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.350 
this dry for quite awhile I actually let
mine<00:02:23.080> dry<00:02:23.350> overnight

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
mine dry overnight
