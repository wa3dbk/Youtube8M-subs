00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.470
 hello guys and welcome to another one 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.240
 video as they saw in the title trick 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.360
 to shoot in the garage in large 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.070
 font online in version 1.15 ok what 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.960
 first we need to be in a 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.239
 public session or by invitation that does not 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.890
 matter I recommend using public to 

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.509
 that they treat a lot of people and people 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.849
 it's staying because this more than anything 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.499
 it's a troll trick more than anything 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.199
 then once it was already shown what 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.089
 making a public session what 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.279
 we will have to do they will retain 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.200
 two friends ok here what we will have 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.290
 to do will be to have a friend near the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.090
 house which we will invite you to our 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.130
 department and our other friend who 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.530
 It is near the house will have to play 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.870
 the bell ok once this is done 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.850
 they simply wait for their friend to 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.830
 first enter the department and then 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.810
 the other touch the first once done 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.240
 that simply what we will have to 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.390
 to do will be to knock on the door 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.310
 all to the garage and that will produce a 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.410
 kind of book which to us 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.850
 the vehicles will disappear but not the 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.100
 we will lose ok you do not worry 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.740
 we will lose them only that the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.390
 vehicles are going to be like invisible or 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.759
 ok here as you see the vehicles I already know 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.890
 they made invisible so now it's yes 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.689
 they can start the massacre imitating people 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.950
 to your garage I think this trick is 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.689
 something that is pretty good because the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.310
 can it really be a pretty troll trick 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.960
 and I think it's one of the best 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.700
 tricks not for trolling people and 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.470
 for other things it is one of the best 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.479
 tricks then as you see it here 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.340
 I can simply have my weapons and 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.780
 here it would only be something that they are inviting 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.610
 to people what their garage is doing 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.080
 so that they arrive and the trolleys what there is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.549
 You can also start to investigate if 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.289
 someone has some doubt about the garage 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.450
 anything and in fact there are many 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.640
 things that respond to bullets like 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.159
 be as the TV does not respond but 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.690
 around here there are some red fumes that yes 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.580
 they respond and it is not true because they are 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.319
 there but the truth is that they are quite 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.299
 well and apart from what I think are the 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.920
 aerosols to paint cars I do not know 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.319
 to be it but as you can see they are 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.390
 some red myths which cast their 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.759
 great red smoke not and here as they can 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.140
 appreciate in what took me a little bit of 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.179
 wave is that these are myths what 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.890
 they have is that they are recharging or are 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.140
 you shoot them once you have to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.880
 wait for you like a few seconds 10 seconds 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.709
 so that it comes out again is a red myth 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.690
 not ok then for those who liked the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.430
