00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:06.365
Alright, when I was a kid, I can remember
getting into a lot of neighbourhood arguments

00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:08.606
Somebody always had a problem about something

00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:12.618
You'd argue about
who was gonna be Oddjob in GoldenEye 64

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:17.489
You'd fight over who's gonna get the wiffle ball
out of the neighbourhood sex offender's backyard

00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:21.298
And if you got a pack of Starburst, well,
hell you'd fight over who's gonna get the red ones

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:25.972
Because I'd be damned if I was gonna get
those yellow Pinosol-tasting pieces of shit!

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:30.053
And there was nobody I argued with more,
than my next-door neighbour Michael

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.464
Because Michael was an asshole!

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.417
And a liar!

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:35.346
Now, I'm gonna give you an example of an argument

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:37.577
And I'm gonna break it down into three phases:

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:41.151
The first phase is
Michael saying something completely untrue

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.033
Totally fabricated and borderline retarded

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.287
"One time my dad was on
an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger"

00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:48.998
"Shut the fuck up, Michael, no he wasn't!"

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.509
"Yeah-huh! He was a bad guy
and he got to roundhouse Chuck Norris!"

00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:55.556
"Oh my God, Michael, you are a fucktard, Jesus!"

00:00:55.614 --> 00:00:57.400
"Don't call me fucktard Jesus!"

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.251
"I didn't call you fucktard Jesus!"

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.628
"I know you are, but what am I?"

00:01:00.676 --> 00:01:01.739
[Phase two]

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:05.455
Michael repeats the phrase:
"I know you are, but what am I?"

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.562
Over and over again,
until he's fucking blue in the face

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:09.857
"I know you are but what am I?"

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:11.065
"I know you are but what am I?
I know you are but what am I?"

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.063
"I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I?!"

00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:18.087
"Michael, shut the fuck up, before I crack you
in the face with this fuckin' Vortex football"

00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:20.148
Which was a bluff, I wouldn't hit him

00:01:20.173 --> 00:01:22.660
Because if you did hit Michael, he'd fucking cry

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.864
And he'd run in his house, go get his mom

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:26.346
And she'd come outside and yell at ya

00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:27.166
*Cocks the gun*

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:29.858
But you know what, sometimes it was worth it!"

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.127
*Whoosh, slap!*

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:36.307
[Child crying]

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:37.280
"Oh, shit!"

00:01:37.335 --> 00:01:40.367
"Here, Michael, hit me back!
Hit me back, quick! Make it even, hit me back!"

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.151
*slap*

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:44.355
[Child crying]

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.795
"Hey, he hit me back! We're even!"

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.988
But if you managed to not pummel Michael's face in

00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:55.589
And give him a Lindsay Lohan makeover,
you'd advance to phase three

00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:58.661
"Yeah, well, my dad could beat up your dad!"

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:01.514
"My dad could beat up your dad.."
That's right.

00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.583
Before we were battling Pokemon,
we were battling each other's dads!

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.361
"Your dad could beat up my dad, Michael?!
That's funny!"

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:11.345
"Because, uhm.. number one, no, the fuck he can't!"

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.207
"And number two, your dad works at Home Depot"

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:19.020
"Yeah-huh, my dad would.. uh.. bite off
all your fingers, like they were.. fish sticks!"

00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:22.913
"Shut the fuck up, Michael, what are you talking about?
What is your dad, a goddamn Rottweiler?"

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:25.786
*Growls and barks*

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.854
Like that was really what we were fighting about

00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.044
I could see myself just walking up to my dad:

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:32.602
"Hey Dad, can you go outside
and fight Michael's dad?"

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.945
"What the hell are you talking about?!"

00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.575
"I'm saying get out there and go whoop some ass!"

00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:40.764
"Because I'll be damned, if I'm gonna have
some little itty-bitty bitch Daddy!"

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:43.392
[Bell rings]

00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:49.062
"Aaaand in this corner.. he's been stealing
his neighbour's cable for six years.."

00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:51.509
"TYYYYYYYYLLLLEEEEERRRRRR'S DAD!"

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:53.186
[Crowd cheering]

00:02:53.254 --> 00:02:55.381
"Aaaand in the opposite corner.."

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:58.969
"He once drank five beers in three minutesss.."

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:03.128
"And he was a bad guy
in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger"

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:05.450
[Tyler from the crowd]
"NO, HE FUCKIN' WASN'T!"

00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:08.515
"MICHAEEEEELLLLSSSS POP-POP!"

00:03:08.653 --> 00:03:10.518
[Crowd booing]

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:12.158
[Bell rings]

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:15.865
But, you know what, that never happened

00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:18.851
I wish it did, it would've made
a better story, but it didn't

00:03:18.943 --> 00:03:22.236
And you know why? Because it was
fucking stupid as hell, that's why!

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:26.116
That, and because my dad would've put
Michael's dad in a fucking hospital!

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:32.984
