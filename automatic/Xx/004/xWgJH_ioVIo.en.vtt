160 gig 5400 rpm hard drive that's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.549 
160 gig 5400 rpm hard drive that's
actually<00:00:44.100> pretty<00:00:44.280> quiet<00:00:45.230> but<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
actually pretty quiet but one of the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.069 
actually pretty quiet but one of the
problems<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.489> does<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> lot<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> energy

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
problems is it does use a lot of energy

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.080 
problems is it does use a lot of energy
and<00:00:49.289> does<00:00:50.039> make<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.430> bit<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.700> noise<00:00:50.820> it's

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and does make a little bit of noise it's

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.420 
and does make a little bit of noise it's
relatively<00:00:51.539> quiet<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.680> I'm<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> show

you want to put in a new spinning hard
drive<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.430> take<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.910> these<00:02:54.660> four

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
drive you can take this these four

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.840 
drive you can take this these four
screws<00:02:55.350> out<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.709> put<00:02:56.070> your<00:02:56.220> new<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:56.430> into

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
screws out and put your new one into

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.620 
screws out and put your new one into
this<00:02:57.060> bracket<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.810> put<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.350> back<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:59.420> with<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
this bracket and put it back in with the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.020 
this bracket and put it back in with the
some<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.200> newer<00:03:01.470> SSDs<00:03:02.310> they<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:02.880> they

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
some of the newer SSDs they have they

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.290 
some of the newer SSDs they have they
have<00:03:03.180> more<00:03:03.390> thickness<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.640> screw<00:03:06.000> size

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
have more thickness and the screw size

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.330 
have more thickness and the screw size
is<00:03:06.660> different<00:03:07.170> sometimes<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.070> doesn't

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
is different sometimes and so it doesn't

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.780 
is different sometimes and so it doesn't
allow<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.850> change<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.930> out<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.890> little

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
allow you to change that out so little

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.220 
allow you to change that out so little
we're<00:03:12.209> going<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.980> put<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.160> can<00:03:14.370> be<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.670> drive

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
we're going to put that can be the drive

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.870 
we're going to put that can be the drive
back<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.850> snap<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.060> back<00:03:18.209> in<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.370> that's<00:03:20.370> it

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
back in snap it back in and that's it

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.690 
back in snap it back in and that's it
there<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.300> absolutely<00:03:21.480> no<00:03:21.989> wiggle<00:03:22.459> it's<00:03:23.459> not

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
there is absolutely no wiggle it's not

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.210 
there is absolutely no wiggle it's not

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.710 

or<00:03:44.770> basically<00:03:45.310> bolting<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.030> compete<00:03:46.480> board

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
or basically bolting the compete board

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:56.010 
or basically bolting the compete board
back<00:03:46.930> down

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020

the<00:03:57.020> battery<00:03:57.440> back<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:57.650> got<00:03:58.130> everything

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
the battery back in got everything

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.370 
the battery back in got everything
closed<00:03:58.880> up<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.620> we<00:04:00.620> should<00:04:00.980> be<00:04:02.140> good<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.350> go

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
closed up and we should be good to go

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:12.860 
closed up and we should be good to go
here

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.479 

booting<00:04:13.739> up<00:04:15.380> sorry<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.590> picture<00:04:16.889> is<00:04:17.040> upside

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489

having<00:04:25.740> actually<00:04:26.069> tested<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.580> I'm<00:04:26.759> not

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
having actually tested this I'm not

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.249 
having actually tested this I'm not
timing<00:04:27.210> this<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:27.630> guess<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.990> would<00:04:28.080> have<00:04:28.110> been

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
timing this I guess that would have been

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:40.230 
timing this I guess that would have been
a<00:04:28.319> good<00:04:28.470> thing<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:28.830> do
