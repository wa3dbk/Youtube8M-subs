00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.620
 to the regulations of the future 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.090
 welcome to 2013 date when it is 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.369
 mandatory to apply the regulations of 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.860
 Self-control for the hotel industry of the union 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.310
 European I can say that everything is 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.590
 working perfectly but as 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.669
 we have come here we are going to 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.669
 go back in time 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:42.699
 go excuse not so much now if in 2005 the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.370
 European Union approved a new regulation 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.320
 that allowed the criteria to be relaxed 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.920
 of self-control in sectors such as 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.170
 hospitality hello I am the european union and 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 I want you to listen to me a lot of people 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.210
 he thought that was a mess 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.010
 - a small group of people within a 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.100
 small department inside a 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.390
 small country that made up for being small 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.390
 with something very valuable 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.270
 so in 2009 they started making a 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.060
 first test with 40 bars and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.060
 restaurants with a goal to adapt the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.090
 normative to reality hello I'm long 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.280
 lito and I'm a girl simplifying the and 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.430
 making it rational so that life 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.990
 it was easier for everyone but it is 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.630
 enough if not man not these never 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.840
 they get tired and they kept thinking and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.740
 thinking and asking questions and more 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.490
 questions although we have simplified it 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.090
 they will apply it that they will need to 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.500
 do it well because the bathroom is always 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.729
 at the bottom on the right that's why in 2010 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.310
 They decided to go back to the kitchen to 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.290
 continue to make improvements such as adapting 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.960
 control sheet to the size of a 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.690
 commander or laminate a mini manual or 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.149
 record demonstrative videos and although the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.000
 norm supposed many advantages as 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.970
 avoid risks and reduce costs and form 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.240
 to professionals not everyone 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.930
 okay and that's why they started a 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.510
 third phase how to communicate it and how it was 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.270
 the third phase made encounters not 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.550
 that kind of encounters encounters with 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.010
 inspectors who toured all 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.460
 territory informing and distributing the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.910
 help kit solving doubts and only at 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.190
 final if it was necessary sanctioning after 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.980
 which even those who said no 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.260
 they began to say that that if it was a 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.910
 good application of the regulations and that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.090
 you could do things in a way 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.080
 different 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.010
 how can we keep improving 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.050
 and if we did it in other areas that 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.080
 I have today in the fridge 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.290
 and thanks to that work we have reached 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.330
 end of 2012 with 65 percent of 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.900
 the establishments applying the plan 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.270
 generic self-management in hospitality 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.160
 because more and more people know that the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:22.280
 future is not tomorrow but starts today 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.360
 and that's the only way we'll reach 2013 with 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.410
 everything working perfectly very well 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.080
 but this who is because he does not pay vai to 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.990
 travel in time also has its 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.940
 inconveniences if you excuse me I have to 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:43.870
 Fix a small span 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.870
 space-time now yes thank you
