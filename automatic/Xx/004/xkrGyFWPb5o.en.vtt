00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.840
 the arduino modified electric guitar 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:24.900
 a project for studying at the university 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:27.779
 Intermediates design owns guitar 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.539
 two motion sensors a bluetooth 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.539
 Module and an aluminum built 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.500
 There are two toggle switches for the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:47.460
 electronics two rotary control for the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 pickup and his touchpad that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.800
 touchpad can serve dx and y direction 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:59.190
 be and control so any two 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.640
 sound parameter at the first switch 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.650
 activates the alu and the sensors of the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.650
 second any of the bluetooth module 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.810
 knob 1 controls the volume of the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.810
 second the sound 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.189
 on the back is located 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.920
 mainly the circuit for the 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.770
 pickup for the guitar signal 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.560
 and the battery provides power to the battery 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.200
 arduino and sensor boards here 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.240
 I activate the abo ino board first 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.340
 the two sensors with electricity 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.560
 supplied after that follows 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.600
 Bluetooth module for the wireless 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.649
 Transmission of the controller change 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.299
 media data the activity is to the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:58.840
 blind light-emitting diodes visible at 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.240
 Movement of the guitar xy direction supplies 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.259
 they deliver the sensors with the values 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.780
 on the scale from 0 to 100 29 right in the 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.420
 picture the constantly changing values 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.519
 to see live 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.200
 every axis of a sensor provides values 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.200
 the same applies to the touchpad 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.890
 Yes
