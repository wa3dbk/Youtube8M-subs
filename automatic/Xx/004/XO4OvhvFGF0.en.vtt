00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:16.049
 to life without love without worries without 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 problem 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.040
 yes the beach we are alone we are free and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.040
 others she 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560
 at 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.420
 hi everyone so today 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.920
 I decided to make a makeup of 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.780
 evening on the cn which is one of my 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.980
 best friends with mixed skin 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.530
 the green eyes that I find it's 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.360
 an excellent model to change mine 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.400
 so I started using a 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.489
 shovel eyeshadow which is the sinne 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.650
 of urban decay which is a very basic 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.970
 iridescent that will bring out the lighthouses 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.980
 and make them last longer 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.750
 then I use it a little stone 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.610
 booty call of the year kiptoo I 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.059
 put on the first third of the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.670
 eyelid of cn so inside it's 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.100
 a lighthouse that has series and is quite clear 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.659
 and then I will use new 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.430
 reinforcements of the enemy who coughs and the and 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.620
 craig cases I do not know how 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.020
 it's pronounced and it's a kind of 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.030
 pink champagne which is very very pretty 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.560
 Iridescent new features I'll 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.540
 put this time more in the middle of 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.760
 the eyelid for them to make a touch 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.229
 even more important light without 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.630
 makeup like that of seeing who has 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.150
 tried very bright iridescent to illuminate 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.580
 his look then I will apply a 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.190
 purple that the b steam again from 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.900
 the year that can and I put it in the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 outer corner with a little bit more 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.470
 fluffy to redefine new sound 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.720
 look and 110 p to degrade and who is going 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.650
 to be the cid optical if you want or 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.260
 Conversely 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.680
 where is the purple c1 going and I 'm using 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.600
 eyeshadow that are in shades 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.880
 pink and purple knowing she has the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.270
 green eyes it's really colors 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.350
 who brought out the clear eyes 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 then I will apply the new 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.640
 so steed and this rape is quite dark 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.849
 stranded lower lashes on the corner 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.160
 external to frame his eye really 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.200
 so I do not get on top of it and never 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.150
 underneath so with a small brush 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.799
 much more accurate 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.049
 I will replicate this eyeshadow and 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.569
 then I will take the y again 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.560
 cases I do not really really know 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.450
 not how is it pronounced 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.470
 and you see that color at his 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.750
 champagnes and that's enough read that I 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.250
 will put it back in the middle but 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.250
 this time below his eyes 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.319
 always with this little brush this 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.019
 once I'm going to use a blush to 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.730
 black eyelids so here I took the most 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.829
 dark of maple was born ghetto but you 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.780
 know once again the lighthouse that I 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.790
 wanted and I will apply it will he 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.450
 superior so as an eyeliner I 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.329
 think it's a very good 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.870
 alternative to thicken docile salim 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:07.459
 and without making a very too marked it is 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.459
 a bit more schumer aspect 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.890
 ocean did not want the film in 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.760
 have put mascara but it's 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.400
 still done 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.960
 the friend william william never benefit this 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.940
 quarter is that I really like that I have 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.000
 bought only two to three months ago 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.710
 and that is already coming to an end so I'm a 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.040
 little disappointed but it's a mascara that 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.040
 I really like 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.070
 then I'll apply a jumbo 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.440
 who comes from revlon is the 0.05 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.210
 and that I find very pretty still in 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.530
 the plum tones but I find that it's 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.580
 a color that suits him extremely well 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.590
 so it's a makeup in all that I 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.080
 can also be found in 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.210
 day but hossein putting on makeup when 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.470
 not even a lot of ordinary it suits him 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.170
 very good for evening makeup 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.370
 and I was pretty proud of me tell me 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.850
 what do you think about them in 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.500
