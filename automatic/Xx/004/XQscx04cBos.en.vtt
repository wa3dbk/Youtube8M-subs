more about it came back and presented it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.510 
more about it came back and presented it
to<00:01:13.920> some<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> us<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.409> management<00:01:17.009> we

to some of us and in in management we
looked<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> initially<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> say

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
looked at it and initially I have to say

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.730 
looked at it and initially I have to say
quite<00:01:20.220> honestly<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.570> represented<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.320> three

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
quite honestly it represented a three

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
quite honestly it represented a three
full<00:01:22.979> day<00:01:23.159> commitment<00:01:23.729> over<00:01:23.880> over<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> course

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
full day commitment over over the course

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.940 
full day commitment over over the course
of<00:01:24.960> three<00:01:25.170> months<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.880> when<00:01:26.880> you're<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> young

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
of three months and when you're a young

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.340 
of three months and when you're a young
growing<00:01:28.950> business<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> finding<00:01:30.479> three<00:01:31.170> days

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
growing business you finding three days

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.130 
growing business you finding three days
three<00:01:31.740> full<00:01:32.009> days<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.640> near<00:01:33.150> impossible<00:01:33.270> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
three full days is near impossible to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.260 
three full days is near impossible to
devote<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> anything<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:35.970> our<00:01:36.119> first

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
devote to anything and so our first

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.969 
devote to anything and so our first
reaction<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.840> well<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.290> sounds<00:01:37.799> very

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
reaction was well this sounds very

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.620 
reaction was well this sounds very
interesting<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:39.150> we're<00:01:39.240> gonna<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
interesting I think we're gonna have to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
interesting I think we're gonna have to
take<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> pass<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.560> Nancy<00:01:41.100> stuck<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
take a pass and then Nancy stuck to it

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.840 
take a pass and then Nancy stuck to it
and<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.990> she<00:01:43.710> came<00:01:43.890> back<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.399> found<00:01:44.430> out
