00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.599
 with everything will remain the same and from here 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.930
 in the tenth world the player as you can 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.990
 see and good has been funded talks 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.560
 teach in all three chapters to do the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.210
 windows 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.400
 in fact the roof 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.770
 of left the balance and so on 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.119
 and also the entry then done a 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.560
 little bit of extension to the entrance of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.510
 finishing of 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.290
 the house for example that the outside by 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.980
 outside as you can see 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.280
 is limited and made windows by all 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280
 the sides 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.690
 but in light and this part as 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.000
 you can see done this and the garage 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.559
 the entrance is also finished what 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.890
 I've changed is that I've put more 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.890
 columns 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.180
 and covered with roofs 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.900
 and the garage door is by the 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.900
 open post 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:19.580
 and as you can see here is the typical 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.580
 kitchen of cars 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.530
 and so I'm trying to recreate a little 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.530
 of oil with the field 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.340
 as you can see what is missing 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.110
 interior I will finish it inside and what 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.640
 I'm a video with the inside this 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.100
 it would be the fourth chapter of the broken 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.300
 mansion but the flame of different 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.580
 I'll call him at the mansion 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.000
 they have been something like that already you will see 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.650
 and I had to announce a little thing what 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.810
 I had to announce is that I'm from 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.909
 get part of a partner band 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.039
 wgn 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.690
 I think it's a very good company 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.480
 partner company 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.360
 and I hope it helps me improve as 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.950
 content creator 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.950
 that I am sporting and that opportunely 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.700
 that helps me improve the quality of 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.700
 videos and all that 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.570
 and leave the link to your mansion 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.560
 is to continue doing it as I am 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.209
 with you and follow the steps 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.599
 I was not trying to do a tutorial either 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.599
 because it is a no 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.480
 I can not be 40 episodes intensities 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.510
 sealing 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.510
 and good as you can see he 's pretty handsome 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.700
 and what without yourself 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.400
 he named it as another decent part 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.980
 and because it's going to be many things could 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.980
 have to divide everything there 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.750
 usually 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.609
 does not mean that it is a stream and 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.609
 architecture but almost basically 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.530
 d 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.060
 then yes to place them liked a lot 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.920
 remember it will remain the same and where there 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:44.600
