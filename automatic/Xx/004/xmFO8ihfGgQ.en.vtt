more full-on you can look at pulling

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.450 
more full-on you can look at pulling
through<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.930> front<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.200> your<00:01:29.290> heel<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:30.009> so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
through the front of your heel here so

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.800 
through the front of your heel here so
we're<00:01:30.610> pushing<00:01:30.790> through<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.180> glue<00:01:31.360> pulling

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
we're pushing through the glue pulling

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.359 
we're pushing through the glue pulling
through<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.020> heel<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.380> getting<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.860> nice<00:01:33.040> pull

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
through the heel and getting a nice pull

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.880 
through the heel and getting a nice pull
there<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.850> then<00:01:34.329> throw<00:01:34.659> one<00:01:34.960> up<00:01:35.200> up<00:01:35.409> over<00:01:35.740> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
there and then throw one up up over the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.649 
there and then throw one up up over the
top<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:36.670> extend<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.180> stretch<00:01:37.420> down

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
top so you extend the stretch down

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.539 
top so you extend the stretch down
outside<00:01:37.899> so<00:01:38.409> we<00:01:38.590> want<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.829> make<00:01:38.950> sure<00:01:39.130> we<00:01:39.310> pull

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
outside so we want to make sure we pull

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.520 
outside so we want to make sure we pull
back<00:01:39.579> through<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.329> heel<00:01:40.570> here<00:01:40.990> using<00:01:41.439> your

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
back through the heel here using your

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.950 
back through the heel here using your
hamstring<00:01:42.009> muscle<00:01:42.399> so<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.000> pulls<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.750> hip

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
hamstring muscle so it pulls on the hip

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.749 
hamstring muscle so it pulls on the hip
on<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.290> other<00:01:44.439> side<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.310> next<00:01:45.520> time<00:01:45.640> we're

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
on the other side so the next time we're

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.300 
on the other side so the next time we're
going<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:45.909> talk<00:01:46.119> about<00:01:46.149> is<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.840> hamstring<00:01:47.310> how

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
going to talk about is the hamstring how

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.370 
going to talk about is the hamstring how
many<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.640> you<00:01:48.790> have<00:01:48.909> seen<00:01:49.090> someone<00:01:49.479> go<00:01:49.689> up<00:01:49.840> to

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
many of you have seen someone go up to

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.899 
many of you have seen someone go up to
the<00:01:50.500> hamstring<00:01:50.950> stretch<00:01:50.979> bend<00:01:51.490> over<00:01:51.850> and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
the hamstring stretch bend over and

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.330 
the hamstring stretch bend over and
touch<00:01:52.090> their<00:01:52.329> toes<00:01:52.439> yeah<00:01:53.439> good<00:01:53.649> good<00:01:53.950> have<00:01:54.189> any

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
touch their toes yeah good good have any

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.389 
touch their toes yeah good good have any
snow<00:01:54.610> issues<00:01:55.000> but<00:01:55.899> you're<00:01:56.079> wrong<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
snow issues but you're wrong the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.920 
snow issues but you're wrong the
important<00:01:57.850> thing<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.090> got<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.210> realize<00:01:58.450> is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
important thing you got to realize is

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.510 
important thing you got to realize is
that<00:01:58.960> when<00:01:59.200> you're<00:01:59.350> doing<00:01:59.469> that<00:01:59.770> it's<00:02:00.340> all

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
that when you're doing that it's all

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.889 
that when you're doing that it's all
through<00:02:00.729> your<00:02:00.850> back<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.450> we're<00:02:01.570> not<00:02:01.719> actually

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
through your back and we're not actually

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.420 
through your back and we're not actually
getting<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.409> decent<00:02:02.619> stretch<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.189> hamstring

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
getting a decent stretch that hamstring

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.190 
getting a decent stretch that hamstring
so<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.119> best<00:02:04.329> technique<00:02:04.719> that<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.049> could

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
so the best technique that you could

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.260 
so the best technique that you could
really<00:02:05.380> employ<00:02:05.799> is<00:02:06.399> to<00:02:06.579> put<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:06.880> leg<00:02:07.090> out

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
really employ is to put the leg out

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.699 
really employ is to put the leg out
straight<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.630> front<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:08.079> you<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.590> ground

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
straight in front of you on the ground

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.729 
straight in front of you on the ground
keep<00:02:09.670> your<00:02:09.820> hips<00:02:10.000> set<00:02:10.299> and<00:02:10.509> flex<00:02:11.200> forward<00:02:11.530> at

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
keep your hips set and flex forward at

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.800 
keep your hips set and flex forward at
the<00:02:11.829> hip<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.370> keep<00:02:12.820> a<00:02:12.940> nice<00:02:13.239> straight<00:02:13.780> line

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the hip and keep a nice straight line

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.840 
the hip and keep a nice straight line
through<00:02:14.350> your<00:02:14.500> back<00:02:14.680> but<00:02:15.310> holding<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
through your back but holding the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.520 
through your back but holding the
straightest<00:02:16.450> line<00:02:16.630> possible<00:02:17.170> through<00:02:17.380> your

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
straightest line possible through your

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.860 
straightest line possible through your
trunk<00:02:17.799> you<00:02:18.100> can<00:02:18.579> pull<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:18.970> toes<00:02:19.209> back<00:02:19.510> if<00:02:19.720> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
trunk you can pull the toes back if you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.410 
trunk you can pull the toes back if you
want<00:02:20.109> to<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.340> changes<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:22.180> type

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
want to and this just changes the type

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.520 
want to and this just changes the type
of<00:02:22.450> feeling<00:02:22.959> you'll<00:02:23.079> get<00:02:23.230> through<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
of feeling you'll get through the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.710 
of feeling you'll get through the
stretch<00:02:23.799> you<00:02:24.459> should<00:02:24.640> really<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.150> feeling<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
stretch you should really be feeling the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.660 
stretch you should really be feeling the
stretch<00:02:26.019> all<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.350> way<00:02:26.650> along<00:02:26.950> your<00:02:27.160> hamstring

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
stretch all the way along your hamstring

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.060 
stretch all the way along your hamstring
but<00:02:28.180> probably<00:02:29.019> predominately<00:02:29.530> down<00:02:29.829> the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
but probably predominately down the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.729 
but probably predominately down the
distal<00:02:30.609> end<00:02:30.790> down<00:02:31.090> towards<00:02:31.630> your<00:02:31.720> knee<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.470> for

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
distal end down towards your knee so for

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.110 
distal end down towards your knee so for
a<00:02:32.799> little<00:02:32.919> bit<00:02:33.100> of<00:02:33.220> variation<00:02:33.489> with<00:02:33.910> this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
a little bit of variation with this

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.540 
a little bit of variation with this
stretch<00:02:35.049> for<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.320> hamstring<00:02:35.829> we<00:02:36.310> can

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
stretch for the hamstring we can

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.190 
stretch for the hamstring we can
look<00:02:36.700> at<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:36.970> changing<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.600> angle<00:02:37.840> with

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
look at just changing the angle with

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.750 
look at just changing the angle with
which<00:02:38.230> you're<00:02:38.620> trying<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.070> take<00:02:39.340> your<00:02:39.490> chest

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
which you're trying to take your chest

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.730 
which you're trying to take your chest
towards<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.120> ground<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:41.110> will<00:02:41.350> be<00:02:41.530> helpful

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
towards the ground this will be helpful

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.710 
towards the ground this will be helpful
as<00:02:41.980> well<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.490> in<00:02:42.700> helping<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.390> figure<00:02:43.570> out

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
as well in in helping you figure out

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.540 
as well in in helping you figure out
where<00:02:44.230> exactly<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.950> are<00:02:44.980> tighten<00:02:45.490> your

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
where exactly you are tighten your

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.670 
where exactly you are tighten your
hamstring<00:02:46.060> because<00:02:46.780> does<00:02:47.050> cover<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.440> whole

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
hamstring because does cover the whole

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.680 
hamstring because does cover the whole
area<00:02:48.070> at<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.550> back<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.730> your<00:02:48.910> leg<00:02:49.150> so

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
area at the back of your leg so

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.120 
area at the back of your leg so
sometimes<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.320> might<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> little<00:02:51.040> bit

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
sometimes you might be a little bit

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.980 
sometimes you might be a little bit
tighter<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.880> outside<00:02:52.330> or<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.840> inside

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
tighter on the outside or on the inside

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.810 
tighter on the outside or on the inside
and<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.770> can<00:02:54.010> help<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> determine<00:02:54.790> that

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
and this can help you determine that

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.760 
and this can help you determine that
just<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.780> don't<00:02:55.960> get<00:02:56.110> really<00:02:56.410> good<00:02:56.650> at

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
just like you don't get really good at

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.650 
just like you don't get really good at
hockey<00:02:56.920> overnight<00:02:57.510> stretching<00:02:58.510> and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
hockey overnight stretching and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.810 
hockey overnight stretching and
flexibility<00:02:59.380> needs<00:02:59.830> to<00:03:00.040> be<00:03:00.160> done<00:03:00.400> over<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.760> long

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
flexibility needs to be done over a long

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.000 
flexibility needs to be done over a long
period<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.540> time<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:02.410> we<00:03:02.530> want<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.770> look<00:03:02.860> to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
period of time so we want to look to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.620 
period of time so we want to look to
hold<00:03:03.220> these<00:03:03.400> stretches<00:03:03.670> for<00:03:04.120> at<00:03:04.180> least<00:03:04.390> a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
hold these stretches for at least a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.390 
hold these stretches for at least a
minute<00:03:04.960> another<00:03:05.380> important<00:03:05.980> aspect<00:03:06.100> for

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
minute another important aspect for

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.590 
minute another important aspect for
hockey<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.940> make<00:03:07.090> sure<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.330> we've<00:03:07.450> got

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
hockey is to make sure that we've got

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.540 
hockey is to make sure that we've got
good<00:03:07.810> range<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.200> motion<00:03:08.380> around<00:03:08.770> our<00:03:08.980> ankle<00:03:09.370> I

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
good range of motion around our ankle I

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.670 
good range of motion around our ankle I
want<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.210> make<00:03:10.360> sure<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.870> we<00:03:11.200> can<00:03:11.350> get<00:03:11.530> that

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
want to make sure that we can get that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.100 
want to make sure that we can get that
heel<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.250> ground<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:12.880> take<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.300> knee<00:03:13.600> as

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
heel to the ground and take the knee as
