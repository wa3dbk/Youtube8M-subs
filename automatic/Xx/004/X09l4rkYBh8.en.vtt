00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.340 
of fears that come up a whole lot of
fears<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:53.390> doing<00:03:54.390> bright-line<00:03:54.810> eating<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.320> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
fears and doing bright-line eating is a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.800 
fears and doing bright-line eating is a
process<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:55.950> transformation<00:03:56.490> in<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.660> many

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
process of transformation in so many

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.580 
process of transformation in so many
ways<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.470> it's<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.550> process<00:04:00.410> fundamentally<00:04:01.410> of

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
ways and it's a process fundamentally of

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.510 
ways and it's a process fundamentally of
letting<00:04:02.430> go<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.640> fear<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.420> trusting<00:04:04.520> trusting

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
letting go of fear and trusting trusting

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.220 
letting go of fear and trusting trusting
that<00:04:05.850> you're<00:04:06.120> not<00:04:06.270> going<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.480> starve<00:04:06.750> between

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
that you're not going to starve between

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.770 
that you're not going to starve between
lunch<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.530> dinner<00:04:07.940> trusting<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.240> your<00:04:09.570> food

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
lunch and dinner trusting that your food

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.090 
lunch and dinner trusting that your food
is<00:04:09.930> going<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.140> be<00:04:10.260> enough<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.830> you're<00:04:10.920> going

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
is going to be enough that you're going

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.280 
is going to be enough that you're going
to<00:04:11.130> be<00:04:11.250> okay<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.840> trusting<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.050> you're

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
to be okay and trusting that you're

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.860 
to be okay and trusting that you're
going<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.470> like<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:14.070> person<00:04:14.520> you<00:04:14.640> are<00:04:14.670> on<00:04:15.270> the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
going to like the person you are on the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.740 
going to like the person you are on the
other<00:04:16.049> side<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:16.650> transformation<00:04:17.459> and

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
other side of this transformation and

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.150 
other side of this transformation and
just<00:04:18.750> think<00:04:19.169> about<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.530> difference<00:04:19.980> of

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
just think about the difference of

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.820 
just think about the difference of
showing<00:04:20.520> up<00:04:20.669> in<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.880> world<00:04:21.090> before<00:04:22.049> you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
showing up in the world before you

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.500 
showing up in the world before you
address<00:04:23.130> your<00:04:23.430> weight<00:04:23.640> challenges<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.419> your

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
address your weight challenges and your

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.020 
address your weight challenges and your
food<00:04:24.690> challenges<00:04:25.260> showing<00:04:25.919> up<00:04:26.040> that<00:04:26.250> way

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
food challenges showing up that way

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.830 
food challenges showing up that way
in<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.600> body<00:04:27.840> with<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.860> spirit<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.840> think

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
in that body with that spirit and think

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.780 
in that body with that spirit and think
about<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.290> difference<00:04:31.620> showing<00:04:31.980> up<00:04:32.130> after

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
about the difference showing up after

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.330 
about the difference showing up after
your<00:04:33.150> weight<00:04:33.330> loss<00:04:33.540> with<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.320> body<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.860> that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
your weight loss with that body and that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.180 
your weight loss with that body and that
spirit<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.090> loose<00:04:37.020> skin<00:04:37.290> is<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.470> very<00:04:37.830> tiny

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
spirit the loose skin is a very tiny

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.480 
spirit the loose skin is a very tiny
piece<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:39.030> transformation<00:04:39.540> so<00:04:40.490> you

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
piece of that transformation so you

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.520 
piece of that transformation so you
might<00:04:41.700> find<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.389> at<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.720> end<00:04:42.810> of<00:04:43.230> your

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
might find that at the end of your

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.650 
might find that at the end of your
journey<00:04:43.590> there<00:04:44.310> actually<00:04:44.820> is<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> pot<00:04:45.450> of<00:04:45.570> gold

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
journey there actually is a pot of gold

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.390 
journey there actually is a pot of gold
at<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.900> end<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.290> rainbow<00:04:46.530> it<00:04:46.950> might<00:04:47.190> turn

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
at the end of that rainbow it might turn

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.810 
at the end of that rainbow it might turn
out<00:04:47.550> just<00:04:47.790> fine<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:49.200> that's<00:04:50.070> my<00:04:50.250> message<00:04:50.310> to
