00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
have kind of noticed that the longer you

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.550 
have kind of noticed that the longer you
play<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.760> worse<00:05:13.970> your<00:05:14.210> frames<00:05:14.539> get<00:05:17.560> maybe

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
it's because all the additional stuff I

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:28.540 
it's because all the additional stuff I
added<00:05:22.720> I'm<00:05:23.720> not<00:05:24.020> really<00:05:24.200> sure<00:05:27.100> there<00:05:28.100> we<00:05:28.310> go
