00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.350 
amazing in just one afternoon I went
from<00:00:13.349> having<00:00:13.559> pretty<00:00:14.009> much<00:00:14.099> no<00:00:14.490> 3d<00:00:14.940> modeling

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
from having pretty much no 3d modeling

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:25.960 
from having pretty much no 3d modeling
experience<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.580> making<00:00:17.580> stuff<00:00:18.390> like<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:24.890> and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
experience to making stuff like this and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.670 
experience to making stuff like this and
I<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.269> feel<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.260> reasonably

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
I I feel like this is reasonably

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.430 
I I feel like this is reasonably
impressive<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.310> don't<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:33.170> found<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> be

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
impressive I don't know I found it to be

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.410 
impressive I don't know I found it to be
pretty<00:00:34.680> exciting<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.550> how<00:00:35.820> easy<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
pretty exciting and with how easy it is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.970 
pretty exciting and with how easy it is
to<00:00:36.570> make<00:00:36.719> stuff<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.890> about

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to make stuff I think that just about

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.470 
to make stuff I think that just about
anybody<00:00:38.370> who<00:00:38.700> has<00:00:38.820> any<00:00:39.000> interest<00:00:39.180> in

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
anybody who has any interest in

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
anybody who has any interest in
sculpting<00:00:39.809> stuff<00:00:40.200> at<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.430> even<00:00:41.700> if

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
sculpting stuff at all you know even if

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.190 
sculpting stuff at all you know even if
you<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.030> messed<00:00:42.300> around<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.629> clay<00:00:42.960> before

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you just messed around with clay before

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.240 
you just messed around with clay before
I<00:00:43.410> think<00:00:43.680> you'll<00:00:43.950> find<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.309> very<00:00:44.399> intuitive

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
I think you'll find this very intuitive

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.670 
I think you'll find this very intuitive
I've<00:00:47.250> tried<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.820> things<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.680> more

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
I've tried to do things with more

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.069 
I've tried to do things with more
advanced<00:00:50.190> ones<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.640> 3d<00:00:50.969> max<00:00:51.239> before<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
advanced ones like 3d max before and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
advanced ones like 3d max before and
Maya<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.980> mostly<00:00:53.550> didn't<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:53.940> much

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
Maya and I mostly didn't have much

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
Maya and I mostly didn't have much
success<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.230> extremely<00:00:55.920> easy<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
success but this is extremely easy and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.180 
success but this is extremely easy and
you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:57.600> export<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.410> bunch<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:58.859> stuff

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you can export to a bunch of other stuff

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
you can export to a bunch of other stuff
too<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.640> I'm<00:00:59.910> pretty<00:01:00.120> sure<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
too so I'm pretty sure this is going to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.280 
too so I'm pretty sure this is going to
be<00:01:01.140> able<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.620> used<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.100> other<00:01:02.870> 3d<00:01:03.870> design

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
be able to be used in other 3d design

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.609 
be able to be used in other 3d design
Suites<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:08.750> I<00:01:09.750> haven't<00:01:09.990> even<00:01:10.170> messed<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.439> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
Suites and I haven't even messed with it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
Suites and I haven't even messed with it
enough<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.790> painting<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.360> like

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
enough to see what the painting is like

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
enough to see what the painting is like
as<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.020> actually<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.860> basically

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
as you can actually you know basically

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.390 
as you can actually you know basically
texture<00:01:14.610> these<00:01:14.790> things<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:17.250> made

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
texture these things up and I made

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.660 
texture these things up and I made
another<00:01:17.640> thing<00:01:17.909> too<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:22.250> think<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.460> thing<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
another thing too I think this thing is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.830 
another thing too I think this thing is
pretty<00:01:23.850> cool

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
pretty cool

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.700 
pretty cool
oops<00:01:26.840> wrong<00:01:27.560> button<00:01:27.940> put<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.180> better

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
oops wrong button put it to a better

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.070 
oops wrong button put it to a better
texture<00:01:30.710> for<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:35.240> going<00:01:35.450> for<00:01:35.660> some<00:01:35.810> sort

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
texture for you it's going for some sort

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.500 
texture for you it's going for some sort
of<00:01:36.170> like<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.880> HR<00:01:37.880> Giger<00:01:38.710> aesthetic<00:01:40.390> with<00:01:41.390> a

little bit of a duel monster thrown in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.100 
little bit of a duel monster thrown in
kind<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.030> looks<00:01:44.150> like<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.300> face<00:01:44.540> hugger<00:01:44.870> on<00:01:44.990> the
