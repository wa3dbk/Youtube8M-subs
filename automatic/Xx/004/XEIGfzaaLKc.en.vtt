some feedback on that you know because
you<00:02:07.789> guys<00:02:08.179> might<00:02:08.450> not<00:02:08.570> want<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> see<00:02:08.960> any<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.200> it

you guys might not want to see any of it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.470 
you guys might not want to see any of it
so<00:02:10.369> I'll<00:02:10.789> probably<00:02:10.909> just<00:02:11.120> stick<00:02:11.330> to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
so I'll probably just stick to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.119 
so I'll probably just stick to
highlights<00:02:11.900> unless<00:02:12.230> anyone's<00:02:12.620> got<00:02:12.830> any<00:02:12.860> good

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
highlights unless anyone's got any good

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
ideas that I can follow just leaving the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.000 
ideas that I can follow just leaving the

going to be one of my biggest dreams in
the<00:02:56.209> sense<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.569> i'm<00:02:56.780> going<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.959> be<00:02:57.019> streamed

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
the sense that i'm going to be streamed

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.759 
the sense that i'm going to be streamed
for<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.560> long<00:02:57.799> time<00:02:58.129> hopefully<00:02:59.739> originally<00:03:00.739> i

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
for a long time hopefully originally i

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.530 
for a long time hopefully originally i
was<00:03:00.829> thinking<00:03:01.159> of<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> 24<00:03:01.700> hour<00:03:01.819> stream<00:03:02.209> but

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
was thinking of a 24 hour stream but

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.589 
was thinking of a 24 hour stream but
chances<00:03:02.930> are<00:03:03.079> i<00:03:03.290> won't<00:03:03.319> make<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:04.239> i'm<00:03:05.239> just<00:03:05.450> at

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
chances are i won't make it i'm just at

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.420 
chances are i won't make it i'm just at
the<00:03:05.690> point<00:03:05.870> now<00:03:06.019> where<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.500> get<00:03:06.889> tired<00:03:07.129> I<00:03:07.370> get

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
the point now where I get tired I get

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.759 
the point now where I get tired I get
cranky<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.329> I'll<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.780> fall<00:03:09.230> asleep<00:03:09.379> in<00:03:09.709> the

cranky and I'll just fall asleep in the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:10.960 
cranky and I'll just fall asleep in the
chair<00:03:09.799> or<00:03:10.159> something<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.609> that's<00:03:10.790> not

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
chair or something so that's not

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.089 
chair or something so that's not
interesting<00:03:11.329> plus<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.349> means<00:03:12.470> for<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.889> next

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
interesting plus it means for the next

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.030 
interesting plus it means for the next
few<00:03:13.250> days<00:03:13.599> until<00:03:14.599> I<00:03:14.750> slumber<00:03:15.260> again<00:03:15.290> I'm<00:03:15.829> going

few days until I slumber again I'm going

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.710 
few days until I slumber again I'm going
to<00:03:16.129> be<00:03:16.310> very<00:03:16.670> tired<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.269> won't<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.540> able<00:03:17.599> to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
to be very tired and I won't be able to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.970 
to be very tired and I won't be able to
do<00:03:17.810> any<00:03:17.959> more<00:03:18.019> streams<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.650> then<00:03:18.769> won't<00:03:18.920> be

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
do any more streams and then won't be

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.319 
do any more streams and then won't be
able<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.159> create<00:03:19.400> any<00:03:19.489> more<00:03:19.519> content<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:22.329> what

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.839 
able to create any more content so what
I'll<00:03:23.449> probably<00:03:23.480> do<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.260> try<00:03:25.129> and<00:03:25.160> just<00:03:25.519> do<00:03:25.699> an

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
I'll probably do is try and just do an

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.110 
I'll probably do is try and just do an
all-nighter<00:03:26.000> which<00:03:26.870> isn't<00:03:27.199> as<00:03:27.290> bad<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:28.120> just

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
all-nighter which isn't as bad and just

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.610 
all-nighter which isn't as bad and just
bring<00:03:29.419> you<00:03:29.629> lots<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:30.019> streaming<00:03:30.319> content
