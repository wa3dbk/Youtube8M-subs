00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
like proper read for so long so it's

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.589 
like proper read for so long so it's
like<00:05:48.169> crazy<00:05:49.169> just<00:05:49.889> go<00:05:50.759> get<00:05:50.940> used<00:05:51.090> to<00:05:51.210> it<00:05:51.330> now

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
like crazy just go get used to it now

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.870 
like crazy just go get used to it now
probably<00:05:51.930> like<00:05:52.380> it<00:05:52.620> I've<00:05:52.919> got<00:05:53.130> like<00:05:53.310> darker

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
probably like it I've got like darker

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.080 
probably like it I've got like darker
bits<00:05:54.030> on<00:05:54.539> top<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:55.229> then<00:05:55.759> bright<00:05:56.759> if<00:05:56.940> it's

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
bits on top and then bright if it's

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.790 
bits on top and then bright if it's
underneath<00:05:57.360> so<00:05:57.659> that<00:05:57.690> it<00:05:57.900> like<00:05:58.169> comes<00:05:58.500> through

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
underneath so that it like comes through

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.580 
underneath so that it like comes through
on<00:05:58.949> my<00:05:59.070> fringe<00:05:59.310> and<00:06:00.300> then<00:06:00.479> I've<00:06:01.199> got<00:06:01.380> my<00:06:01.409> her

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
on my fringe and then I've got my her

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.260 
on my fringe and then I've got my her
pin<00:06:01.830> back<00:06:02.070> so<00:06:02.250> you<00:06:02.310> can't<00:06:02.550> see<00:06:02.699> the<00:06:02.820> depth<00:06:03.030> as

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
pin back so you can't see the depth as

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.189 
pin back so you can't see the depth as
much<00:06:04.940> some<00:06:05.940> reason<00:06:06.240> it's<00:06:06.360> gone<00:06:06.509> really<00:06:06.960> dark

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
much some reason it's gone really dark

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.370 
much some reason it's gone really dark
there<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:08.300> I<00:06:09.300> think<00:06:09.360> this<00:06:09.750> will<00:06:09.870> fit<00:06:09.930> to<00:06:10.229> like

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
there and I think this will fit to like

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.089 
there and I think this will fit to like
an<00:06:10.530> orangey<00:06:10.800> color<00:06:11.419> because<00:06:12.419> in<00:06:13.099> actual

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
an orangey color because in actual

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.600 
an orangey color because in actual
daylight<00:06:15.080> you<00:06:16.080> can<00:06:16.110> see<00:06:16.620> an<00:06:16.889> orange<00:06:17.190> tinge<00:06:17.490> to

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
daylight you can see an orange tinge to

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.689 
daylight you can see an orange tinge to
it<00:06:18.050> you<00:06:19.050> can't<00:06:19.259> tell<00:06:19.470> on<00:06:19.500> this<00:06:19.800> camera<00:06:20.099> must<00:06:20.580> be

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
it you can't tell on this camera must be

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.390 
it you can't tell on this camera must be
the<00:06:20.789> white<00:06:20.940> balance

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.480
