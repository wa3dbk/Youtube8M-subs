 we smile personally I think it 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.530
 but it's a pleasure 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.259

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.580
 a genre in France and these are diseases 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.580

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.080

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.240
 in audio 5 1 the proof is that it has become a very important element of the 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.160
 SIVOM 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.200

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.220
 by 2 6% 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.170
 the red and gold belt 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.710
 I feel uncomfortable at home 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.710
 that's done 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.890
 court will have to stop the chaos but in strong progression 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.490
 twitter as soon as there is a little bit difficult 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.150

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.700

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.690

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 he may be one of the best defenders in the world 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 a very delicate period 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 clear on one side of 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.620
 head to toe 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.620

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
 ajaccio 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.839

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.839

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:16.749
