Schmo and this of course is a fallacy it
doesn't<00:01:05.449> make<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.600> lot<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.840> sense<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.380> if<00:01:06.439> you

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
doesn't make a lot of sense and if you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.249 
doesn't make a lot of sense and if you
compare<00:01:07.299> x-large<00:01:08.299> bodybuilder<00:01:08.960> 2x

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
line you go this fallacy shows itself

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.050 
line you go this fallacy shows itself
pretty<00:01:15.200> obviously<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:15.979> it's<00:01:16.670> never<00:01:16.820> worked

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
pretty obviously and it's never worked

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.060 
pretty obviously and it's never worked
out<00:01:17.270> that<00:01:17.509> way<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.020> again<00:01:18.439> it's

out that way and it again it's

out that way and it again it's
unfortunate<00:01:19.729> but<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.539> have<00:01:20.929> said<00:01:21.259> many<00:01:21.289> times

unfortunate but I have said many times

and so on its own and I can tell you
that<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.470> know<00:02:26.680> what<00:02:27.010> they<00:02:27.130> do<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.300> tell

that I know what they do and I can tell
you<00:02:28.480> they<00:02:28.720> don't<00:02:28.960> do<00:02:29.200> anything<00:02:29.440> really<00:02:29.770> all

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
you they don't do anything really all

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.490 
you they don't do anything really all
that<00:02:30.250> different<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.900> their<00:02:32.080> day-to-day<00:02:32.260> lives

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that different in their day-to-day lives

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.920 
that different in their day-to-day lives
than<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.010> do<00:02:33.160> now<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.690> main<00:02:34.900> difference

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
than you do now the main difference

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.449 
than you do now the main difference
unfortunately<00:02:35.860> as<00:02:35.920> they<00:02:36.040> picked<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.370> right

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
unfortunately as they picked the right

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.580 
unfortunately as they picked the right
parents<00:02:36.790> it's<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.750> great<00:02:37.870> expression<00:02:38.200> somebody

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
parents it's a great expression somebody

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.020 
parents it's a great expression somebody
had<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.250> don't<00:02:39.370> know<00:02:39.459> said<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.000> a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
had that I don't know said it but it's a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.760 
had that I don't know said it but it's a
great<00:02:40.120> expression<00:02:40.420> which<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:40.990> if<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.590> had

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
great expression which is if if you had

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.230 
great expression which is if if you had
the<00:02:41.800> genetics<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.310> be<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> pro<00:02:42.640> bodybuilder<00:02:43.150> you

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
the genetics to be a pro bodybuilder you

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.840 
the genetics to be a pro bodybuilder you
know<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.570> already<00:02:43.690> now<00:02:44.470> that's<00:02:45.100> not<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.370> say

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
know it already now that's not to say

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.320 
know it already now that's not to say
that<00:02:47.250> training<00:02:48.250> hard<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.700> eating<00:02:49.120> well<00:02:49.270> and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
that training hard and eating well and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.750 
that training hard and eating well and
all<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:51.160> throw<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.550> out<00:02:51.580> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
all that is just you throw that out the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.710 
all that is just you throw that out the
window<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.090> say<00:02:52.180> well<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.360> don't<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
window and say well I don't have the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.600 
window and say well I don't have the
kinetics<00:02:53.080> for<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.650> don't<00:02:53.920> know<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.459> will

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
kinetics for it you don't know you will

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.300 
kinetics for it you don't know you will
never<00:02:54.820> know<00:02:55.060> until<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.540> try<00:02:55.800> what<00:02:56.800> genetics

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
never know until you try what genetics

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.530 
never know until you try what genetics
you<00:02:57.489> have<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.120> that's<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.420> unfortunate

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
you have and that's the unfortunate

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.020 
you have and that's the unfortunate
again<00:02:59.140> we<00:02:59.290> don't<00:02:59.410> have<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> magic<00:02:59.920> test<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.820> give

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
again we don't have a magic test to give

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.910 
again we don't have a magic test to give
you<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.269> say<00:03:01.420> well<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:02.320> guy<00:03:02.560> has<00:03:02.769> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
you to say well this guy has the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.410 
you to say well this guy has the
phonetics<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.400> look<00:03:03.550> like<00:03:03.700> durian<00:03:04.060> needs<00:03:04.239> and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
phonetics to look like durian needs and

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.670 
phonetics to look like durian needs and
if<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.570> ever<00:03:04.600> saw<00:03:04.870> pictures<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.290> Dorian<00:03:05.560> each

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
if you ever saw pictures of Dorian each

if you ever saw pictures of Dorian each
one<00:03:05.860> is<00:03:05.920> young<00:03:06.100> he<00:03:06.640> didn't<00:03:06.820> look<00:03:06.910> like

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
one is young he didn't look like

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.030 
one is young he didn't look like
anything<00:03:07.300> special<00:03:07.420> as<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> lot<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.650> guys<00:03:08.890> you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
anything special as do a lot of guys you

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.860 
anything special as do a lot of guys you
start<00:03:09.340> yes<00:03:09.820> there<00:03:10.060> are<00:03:10.120> some<00:03:10.239> guys<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.630> can

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
start yes there are some guys you can

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.690 
start yes there are some guys you can
meet<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.680> can<00:03:12.220> see<00:03:12.370> these<00:03:12.489> guys

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
meet and you can see these guys

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.060 
meet and you can see these guys
obviously<00:03:12.940> have<00:03:13.560> genetics<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.680> are<00:03:14.830> above

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
obviously have genetics that are above

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.280 
obviously have genetics that are above
average<00:03:15.250> for<00:03:15.459> example<00:03:16.090> I've<00:03:16.810> known<00:03:17.019> Jay
