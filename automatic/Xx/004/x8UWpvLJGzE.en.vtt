is my least favorite level in the game
but<00:00:13.860> um<00:00:14.509> it's<00:00:15.509> not<00:00:15.660> too<00:00:15.929> bad<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.410> thought<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.920> was

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
but um it's not too bad I thought I was

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.710 
but um it's not too bad I thought I was
gonna<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> lot<00:00:17.369> worse<00:00:17.520> than<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.449> um

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
gonna be a lot worse than it was but um

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.040 
gonna be a lot worse than it was but um
I<00:00:19.109> had<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.340> lot<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.000> luck<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> Big<00:00:21.689> Daddy's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
I had a lot of luck with the Big Daddy's

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.660 
I had a lot of luck with the Big Daddy's
um<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.529> found<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.920> good<00:00:23.039> strategies<00:00:23.340> while

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
um I found some good strategies while

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.310 
um I found some good strategies while
researching<00:00:24.180> how<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.510> take<00:00:24.750> him<00:00:24.869> down<00:00:24.900> most

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
researching how to take him down most

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.460 
researching how to take him down most
efficiently<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.240> I<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.660> they're<00:00:28.349> all

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
efficiently and I think they're all

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.950 
efficiently and I think they're all
repeatable<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.420> what<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
repeatable so what we're going to do is

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.600 
repeatable so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> kind<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.130> make<00:00:32.309> our<00:00:32.399> way

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610

shot<00:02:50.090> off<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.709> did<00:02:51.709> do<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.190> here<00:02:52.519> he<00:02:52.760> saw<00:02:52.940> me

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
shot off I did do that here he saw me

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.880 
shot off I did do that here he saw me
after<00:02:53.420> my<00:02:53.540> first<00:02:53.780> shot<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.320> kind<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.650> biffed

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
after my first shot so I kind of biffed

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.140 
after my first shot so I kind of biffed
my<00:02:55.190> third<00:02:56.120> shot<00:02:56.450> um<00:02:56.980> now<00:02:57.980> once<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.640> get<00:02:58.760> all

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
my third shot um now once you get all

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.690 
my third shot um now once you get all
those<00:03:00.040> explosive<00:03:01.040> barrels<00:03:01.310> out<00:03:01.430> at<00:03:01.610> them

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
those explosive barrels out at them

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.130 
those explosive barrels out at them
there's<00:03:01.880> three<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.269> first<00:03:02.480> area<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.080> you

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
there's three in that first area so you

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.930 
there's three in that first area so you
fire<00:03:03.410> one<00:03:03.440> from<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.950> ground<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.519> in<00:03:04.850> those

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
fire one from the ground and in those

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.880 
fire one from the ground and in those
two<00:03:05.150> barrels<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:06.170> can<00:03:06.320> run<00:03:06.440> back<00:03:06.620> here

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
two barrels and you can run back here

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.590 
two barrels and you can run back here
for<00:03:07.070> another<00:03:07.310> supply<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.910> them<00:03:08.120> barrels<00:03:08.480> I

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
for another supply of them barrels I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.080 
for another supply of them barrels I
think<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.959> takes<00:03:08.989> five<00:03:09.500> direct<00:03:09.890> hits<00:03:10.130> from

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
think it takes five direct hits from

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.810 
think it takes five direct hits from
these<00:03:11.300> barrels<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:12.110> UM<00:03:12.380> kill<00:03:12.680> them<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.670> what<00:03:13.760> I

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
these barrels to UM kill them so what I

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.850 
these barrels to UM kill them so what I
like<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:13.970> do<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.180> throw<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.570> first<00:03:14.840> couple<00:03:15.079> run

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
like to do is throw the first couple run

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.199 
like to do is throw the first couple run
back<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.250> area<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.730> kind<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:16.940> draws

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
back in this area and it kind of draws

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.030 
back in this area and it kind of draws
him<00:03:17.480> back<00:03:17.660> into<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:17.989> little<00:03:18.260> tiny<00:03:18.530> corridor

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
him back into this little tiny corridor

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.710 
him back into this little tiny corridor
because<00:03:19.670> she<00:03:19.820> never<00:03:19.940> make<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.329> out<00:03:20.390> into<00:03:20.630> this

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
because she never make it out into this

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.380 
because she never make it out into this
top<00:03:20.959> area<00:03:21.380> um<00:03:21.670> we<00:03:22.670> should<00:03:22.820> kill<00:03:23.000> before<00:03:23.150> he

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
top area um we should kill before he

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.789 
top area um we should kill before he
gets<00:03:23.540> out<00:03:23.690> here<00:03:23.900> or<00:03:24.019> else<00:03:24.110> he'll<00:03:24.560> be<00:03:24.590> in<00:03:24.680> an

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
gets out here or else he'll be in an

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:25.870 
gets out here or else he'll be in an
open<00:03:25.010> area<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.400> you'll<00:03:25.519> be<00:03:25.640> at<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.730> big

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
open area and you'll be at a big

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.060 
open area and you'll be at a big
disadvantage<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:27.079> just<00:03:27.410> keep<00:03:27.530> these<00:03:27.709> tanks

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
disadvantage so just keep these tanks

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.800 
disadvantage so just keep these tanks
just<00:03:28.250> keep<00:03:28.459> running<00:03:28.670> back<00:03:28.940> refilling<00:03:29.630> and

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
just keep running back refilling and

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.690 
just keep running back refilling and
then<00:03:29.900> firing<00:03:30.230> out<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:31.280> can<00:03:31.400> see<00:03:31.549> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
then firing out and you can see the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.190 
then firing out and you can see the
massive<00:03:31.880> damage<00:03:32.209> they<00:03:32.450> do<00:03:32.510> in<00:03:32.780> fact<00:03:32.840> are<00:03:33.110> the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
massive damage they do in fact are the

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.270 
massive damage they do in fact are the
most<00:03:33.320> efficient<00:03:33.739> way<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.860> killing<00:03:34.070> these

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
most efficient way of killing these

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.910 
most efficient way of killing these
things<00:03:34.579> in<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.940> entire<00:03:35.180> game<00:03:35.450> but

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
things in the entire game but

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.539 
things in the entire game but
unfortunately<00:03:36.920> they're<00:03:37.040> not<00:03:37.070> lying<00:03:37.430> around

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
unfortunately they're not lying around

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.130 
unfortunately they're not lying around
all<00:03:37.910> over<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.150> place<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:38.630> for<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.870> other<00:03:38.959> two

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
all over the place so for the other two

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.360 
all over the place so for the other two
Big<00:03:39.320> Daddy's<00:03:39.620> will<00:03:39.769> have<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:39.950> fight<00:03:40.160> them<00:03:40.280> head

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
Big Daddy's will have to fight them head

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.240 
Big Daddy's will have to fight them head
on<00:03:40.459> but<00:03:41.329> as<00:03:41.780> this<00:03:42.410> last<00:03:42.769> shot<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:44.299> he's<00:03:44.600> dead

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
on but as this last shot and he's dead

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.680 
on but as this last shot and he's dead
while<00:03:46.250> running<00:03:46.430> out<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.910> area<00:03:47.420> while

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
while running out of that area while

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.300 
while running out of that area while
you're<00:03:47.810> really<00:03:48.320> filling<00:03:48.590> your<00:03:48.709> explosive

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
you're really filling your explosive

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.560 
you're really filling your explosive
barrels<00:03:49.610> be<00:03:49.730> careful<00:03:50.060> because<00:03:50.180> there's<00:03:50.480> a

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
barrels be careful because there's a

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.300 
barrels be careful because there's a
rocket<00:03:50.930> turret<00:03:51.230> out<00:03:51.350> there<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:52.040> if<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.190> move

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
rocket turret out there but if you move

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.800 
rocket turret out there but if you move
fast<00:03:52.549> enough<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.970> won't<00:03:53.030> get<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.269> lock<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.630> you

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
fast enough it won't get a lock on you

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.430 
fast enough it won't get a lock on you
and<00:03:54.110> it

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
and it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.110 
and it
generally<00:03:54.740> caused<00:03:54.920> many<00:03:55.100> problems<00:03:55.280> again

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
generally caused many problems again

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.530 
generally caused many problems again
rescue<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.170> big<00:03:57.320> sister<00:03:57.710> so<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:59.360> was<00:03:59.510> the
