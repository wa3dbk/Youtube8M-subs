00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.280
 hello everyone today we are going to present the 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.990
 great game 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.869
 this is the box is a game 4 the family 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.540
 has prizes is pretty fun to 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.130
 play and very simple is very familiar the 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.220
 time to spend the dead hours 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.320
 let's go to see how it is already you will see 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.500
 how easy it is to play come on let's go 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.300
 fall out 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.910
 - it's the game mounted 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.520
 let's see how it develops because 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.850
 simple to play like the one done before and 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.059
 let's see how to start and a 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.920
 cloth bag where we put all the 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:50.210
 chips to go welcoming look 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.629
 the game is about making the most 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.180
 the number of combinations with 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.910
 colors that we place we are going to 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.600
 see what this means on the board 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.320
 there is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.810
 six colors put on it 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.270
 on the fixed board fixed 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.150
 then this board is divided 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.430
 between the white zone 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.590
 this one that is smaller white gray and this one that 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.720
 it's a little bit darker when they're two 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.730
 players perform only the white zone 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.950
 when they are three players if used 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.820
 this area too and when they are four it is 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.820
 tourist highlighting ice 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.340
 the player starts with six chips 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 fichitas I will teach how they are 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.110
 for example 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.270
 for example they usually come 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.450
 or different colors or as in this case 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.400
 Same colors can come out of any 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.400
 thing we are going to take 6 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.760
 we have six and there are some slots here 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.890
 on the board to go putting them for 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.890
 that our opponent does not see them 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.409
 it's lucky who starts and why 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.990
 example, I'll put it here in front 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.289
 so you can see what are the pieces that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.289
 I have 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:20.950
 and let's start, let's see 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.950
 for example for yellow and red 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.620
 we put it there 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.960
 the way to score in this game is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.540
 pretty simple 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.290
 the card that we just put does not count 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.970
 we only cut the combinations that have 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.170
 with colors that we have the same is 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.270
 tell 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.010
 a point 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.010
 as red to see nowhere 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.489
 only one point 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.269
 so what I do move the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.269
 my yellow 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.629
 the game is that until you 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.060
 fill the board can not move 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.859
 no letter the purpose of the game is 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.349
 get advance so many points of all 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.510
 the colors in the end what is done 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.010
 when you can not put chips anymore 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.680
 do a count of 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.049
 the total point of each color 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.940
 for example this may end then this 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.590
 in eleven is to have 14 be in 6 this one 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.280
 and it will add up, it will look for all the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.240
 trillions of 25 etc etc and the one that more 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.100
 points at the end is the one that wins 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.590
 always interested then and moving then 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.590
 all colors and getting points 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.750
 as quickly as possible once 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.750
 I have placed a tab what I do is 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.290
 another steal yours now be the turn 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.860
 of the other player we would go back to mine and 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.860
 now let's do 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.450
 this movement so you can see the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.450
 points that points would get 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.629
 as here I have another yellow would count 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.030
 a point this never the one that I never put 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.769
 a point is counted as I have also 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.930
 put red and here there is also red then 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.829
 would count another point in total of day 2 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.450
 points 1 decade that is to say I would move 1 red 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:28.310
 and another yellow 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.310
 or I could choose to make this move 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.249
 then what I would get would be two 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.919
 points 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:37.869
 this does not count but I have here two 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.629
 yellows that are online then two 

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:43.629
 points we are going to make this better for 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.800
 can move to be able to move also the 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:50.960
 red would be a point and a point 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.960
 I would catch that I would take another tab 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.950
 I have a double of these 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.840
 and now for example any move 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.060
 well here 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.080
 let's go back here 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.889
 here I would have two points because 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.590
 a straight line one point and here another 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.990
 point that is from here I get a point 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.260
 because it goes 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.450
 is united is in the rectum and here another 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.240
 point because you are straight they would be two 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.240
 points would move the purple two points 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.650
 then once we have the 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.740
 stable mounted 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.470
 we will take another file 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.669
 what would this be but let's move now 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.669
 this time as it would be 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.690
 I would get here 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.690
 12 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.030
 and 4 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:54.420
 that is, I have this side 2 for this 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:59.790
 side 1 and on this side another total would be 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:03.140
 1 2 3 and 4 would move 4 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.140
 I would see 6 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.450
 I would take another file 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.450
 now it's a green blue 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.660
 and we are going to move it for example then here 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.650
 here I would get for example 1 2 and 3 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.650
 purple 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.160
 12 repaired 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:31.890
 next tab lame would be one of these 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.890
 and we're going to go for example 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.650
 here 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.759
 2 yellow only because as I do not 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.040
 I have with no side here would be 2 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:47.970
 yellows all yellow moving 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.710
 next turn with a red for example 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.880
 with what I put here 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.950
 12 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.570
 two reds per move two reds 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:02.290
 collecting shifts and once it has already 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.910
 filled the board it counts all 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.480
 points in case one of them arrived 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.270
 16 to 18 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.880
 I would have an extra shift to move another 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:16.009
 tab I arrived on 18 said 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:19.759
 with one and put another 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:22.159
 as a reward for having reached 18 and 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:25.310
 after this well this is the game is 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:29.860
 infertile has no more stories 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.860
 and I hope you like it and enjoy it
