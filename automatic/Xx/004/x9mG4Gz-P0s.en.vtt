like<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.370> design<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:48.719> it's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
like the design of it I like how it's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.060 
like the design of it I like how it's
got<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> Todd<00:00:49.920> graph<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:51.590> it's<00:00:52.590> also<00:00:52.739> got<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
got the Todd graph here it's also got a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.090 
got the Todd graph here it's also got a
moon<00:00:53.280> phase<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:54.680> whether<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.980> can

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
moon phase which whether or not you can

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.799 
moon phase which whether or not you can
actually<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.210> filled<00:00:57.629> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
actually see it it's filled in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.610 
actually see it it's filled in
representing<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> new<00:00:58.770> moon<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> correct

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
representing a new moon which is correct

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.110 
representing a new moon which is correct
when<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.649> receive<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> watch<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
when you receive the watch you have to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.350 
when you receive the watch you have to
enter<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.769> longitude<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.549> latitude<00:01:05.610> and

enter your longitude and latitude and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.320 
enter your longitude and latitude and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
oil interval which is about the hardest

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
oil interval which is about the hardest
part<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.689> setting<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> watch<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.560> even<00:01:10.619> then

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's really not too bad if you can find

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.249 
it's really not too bad if you can find

can<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.740> we've<00:01:44.009> got<00:01:44.040> rust<00:01:44.520> resist<00:01:45.530> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
can see here we've got rust resist and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.980 
can see here we've got rust resist and
how<00:01:46.680> they<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:48.079> that<00:01:49.079> all<00:01:50.990> metal

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
how they do that is that all metal

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.230 
how they do that is that all metal
pieces<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.829> are<00:01:52.950> exposed<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.759> made<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
pieces that are exposed are made of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.389 
pieces that are exposed are made of
titanium

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
titanium

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.819 
titanium
including<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> screws<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.810> case<00:01:58.049> back<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
including the screws the case back and

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.340 
including the screws the case back and
as<00:01:59.490> far<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.000> tell<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.509> buckles<00:02:00.990> pretty

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
as far as I can tell the buckles pretty

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.420 
as far as I can tell the buckles pretty
dark<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.369> think<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.060> titanium<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:05.280> not

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
dark so I think it's titanium it's not

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.859 
dark so I think it's titanium it's not
nearly<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.880> shiny<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.689> think

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
nearly as shiny as what I would think

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.529 
nearly as shiny as what I would think
like<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> stainless<00:02:07.469> steel<00:02:07.619> would<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> I'm

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
like a stainless steel would be so I'm

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.850 
like a stainless steel would be so I'm
even<00:02:09.660> pretty<00:02:09.959> sure<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> buckles

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
even pretty sure that the buckles

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.110 
even pretty sure that the buckles
titanium

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.470

also<00:02:13.050> from<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> remember<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
also from what I remember that the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.830 
also from what I remember that the
pushers<00:02:16.849> Fisher<00:02:17.849> shafts<00:02:18.180> are<00:02:18.569> made<00:02:18.599> of

pushers Fisher shafts are made of

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.979 
pushers Fisher shafts are made of
titanium<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:21.090> overall<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.510> makes<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:21.959> a

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
titanium and overall that makes for a

can<00:04:02.670> tell<00:04:02.910> us<00:04:03.090> about<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.389> Todd<00:04:03.600> graphs<00:04:03.930> that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
can tell us about the Todd graphs that

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.340 
can tell us about the Todd graphs that
right<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.940> looked<00:04:05.940> at<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.540> nearest<00:04:06.780> beach<00:04:06.989> east

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
right I looked at the nearest beach east

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.020 
right I looked at the nearest beach east
of<00:04:07.500> me<00:04:07.650> which<00:04:07.859> was<00:04:07.889> the<00:04:08.100> Tappahannock<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
of me which was the Tappahannock and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.979 
of me which was the Tappahannock and
this<00:04:09.870> was<00:04:10.079> pretty<00:04:10.560> much<00:04:10.650> spot-on<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.989> to

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
this was pretty much spot-on to the to

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.740 
this was pretty much spot-on to the to
their<00:04:13.139> table<00:04:13.380> predictions<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.600> there's<00:04:15.600> no

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
their table predictions so there's no

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.750 
their table predictions so there's no
real<00:04:16.289> decent<00:04:16.709> body<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:17.070> water<00:04:17.250> near<00:04:17.579> me

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
real decent body of water near me

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.580 
real decent body of water near me
