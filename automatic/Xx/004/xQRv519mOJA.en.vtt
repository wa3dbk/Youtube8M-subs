wake up these students is rocket and you
got<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.650> Associated<00:00:20.580> little<00:00:20.789> tender<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.390> I

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
got the Associated little tender and I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.120 
got the Associated little tender and I
thought<00:00:21.869> he<00:00:22.020> wants<00:00:22.260> 76<00:00:22.650> scale<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
thought he wants 76 scale it's going to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.590 
thought he wants 76 scale it's going to
be<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:23.460> small<00:00:23.699> model<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.539> you

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
be a really small model so what do you

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.710 
be a really small model so what do you
get<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.140> these<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:27.180> same<00:00:27.390> size

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
get with this one these the same size

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.630 
get with this one these the same size
regulation<00:00:28.680> base<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.310> get<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.550> all

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
regulation base then you get with all

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.840 
regulation base then you get with all
the<00:00:29.730> models<00:00:30.529> 1829<00:00:31.529> Stephenson's<00:00:32.489> rocket<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the models 1829 Stephenson's rocket and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.280 
the models 1829 Stephenson's rocket and
I<00:00:32.880> thought<00:00:33.059> well<00:00:33.239> that's<00:00:33.690> gonna<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> big

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
I thought well that's gonna be a big

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.500 
I thought well that's gonna be a big
base<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> rocket<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.180> tender

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
base just for the rocket and it's tender

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.010 
base just for the rocket and it's tender
now<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.710> tender

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
now what you get with this is the tender

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.869 
now what you get with this is the tender
and<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:45.600> rocket<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.710> thought<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.730> as

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and the rocket and I thought that's as

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.970 
and the rocket and I thought that's as
far<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.300> goes<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
far as it goes because it's like the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.090 
far as it goes because it's like the
epics<00:00:50.250> kid<00:00:50.430> nor<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.629> one

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
epics kid nor what you get with this one

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.910 
epics kid nor what you get with this one
also<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:55.550> passenger<00:00:56.550> carriage<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:56.910> well

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
also on is a passenger carriage as well

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
also on is a passenger carriage as well
so<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.039> get<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.799> there's<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so you get so what you get there's a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.800 
so you get so what you get there's a
really<00:01:08.159> nice<00:01:09.110> mostly<00:01:10.110> plastic<00:01:10.350> rocket<00:01:11.810> apart

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
really nice mostly plastic rocket apart

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.450 
really nice mostly plastic rocket apart
from<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> wheels<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.590> plastic<00:01:14.040> tender

plastic fully glazed passenger coach at
the<00:01:20.670> bike<00:01:21.080> that's<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.619> nice<00:01:22.799> setup<00:01:23.759> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the bike that's a really nice setup so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
the bike that's a really nice setup so
that's<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> 1829<00:01:25.530> Stephenson's<00:01:26.310> rocket<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that's the 1829 Stephenson's rocket and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.760 
that's the 1829 Stephenson's rocket and
nor<00:01:27.210> point<00:01:27.479> me<00:01:27.540> take<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.840> apart<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.500> when

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
nor point me take it apart because when

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
nor point me take it apart because when
you<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> underside<00:01:29.549> you'll<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you see the underside you'll know how it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.399 
you see the underside you'll know how it
goes<00:01:30.479> together<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.810> mean<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.110> fairly<00:01:31.259> basic

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
goes together I mean it's fairly basic

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.520 
goes together I mean it's fairly basic
and<00:01:31.979> four<00:01:32.700> screws<00:01:33.060> hold<00:01:33.750> me<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> base

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and four screws hold me all to the base

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
and four screws hold me all to the base
i<00:01:34.799> wonder<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> screws<00:01:35.820> obviously<00:01:36.240> sort<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
i wonder the screws obviously sort it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
i wonder the screws obviously sort it
look<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.229> what<00:01:38.070> has<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> smallest

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
look at this what has to be the smallest

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.950 
look at this what has to be the smallest
and<00:01:39.860> currently<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.520> probably<00:01:42.360> more<00:01:42.479> spirit

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and currently it's probably more spirit

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.940 
and currently it's probably more spirit
model<00:01:43.229> store<00:01:43.409> file<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> range

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.250 

so<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:52.810> tiny

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.590 

18:29<00:01:56.260> steer<00:01:56.740> which<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.040> rocket<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:58.330> get<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
18:29 steer which is rocket you get the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.900 
18:29 steer which is rocket you get the
rocket<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.600> tender<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.620> this<00:02:03.430> really<00:02:03.700> nice

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
rocket the tender and this really nice

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.340 
rocket the tender and this really nice
passenger<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.840> rocket<00:02:08.140> model<00:02:10.110> nicely<00:02:11.110> made

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
passenger the rocket model nicely made

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.740 
passenger the rocket model nicely made
but<00:02:12.310> these<00:02:12.460> two<00:02:12.760> wires<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.210> go<00:02:13.390> up<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.600> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
but these two wires that go up to the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.400 
but these two wires that go up to the
chimney<00:02:15.060> which<00:02:16.060> again<00:02:16.540> they<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.930> push<00:02:17.170> fit

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
chimney which again they just push fit

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.860 
chimney which again they just push fit
so<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.280> bit<00:02:18.459> loose<00:02:19.390> where<00:02:19.630> they<00:02:19.750> engage

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
so that a bit loose where they engage

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.090 
so that a bit loose where they engage
the<00:02:20.230> hole<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> side<00:02:21.280> oh<00:02:22.080> no<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.380> really

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
the hole in the side oh no I really

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:33.150 
the hole in the side oh no I really
nicely<00:02:26.070> well-detailed<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> model<00:02:32.160> very

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
nicely well-detailed like a model very
