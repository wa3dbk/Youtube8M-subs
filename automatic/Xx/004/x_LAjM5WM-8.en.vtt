00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.130
 every day Rosana teaches her son to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.469
 best way to prevent accidents from 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.509
 crossing the street we do not respect the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.600
 band so there's no use but 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.300
 unfortunately not everyone thinks as she is 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.000
 scenes like this are repeated at all 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.230
 moment just a few meters from the strip 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.480
 of pedestrians 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.359
 this street vendor see these 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.130
 recklessness every day we have to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.500
 stop at another that does not stop or brake 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.649
 including beating women and I think 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.360
 that this has to stop in the range for the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.620
 person has to have respect with the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.280
 people, especially the people of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 age, right? 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.899
 drivers also complain of me for 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.550
 example nobody here goes through this 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.879
 walkway everyone goes under the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.620
 walkway and justification in fun 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.379
 every once in a while right here I am 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.390
 rushed into what soon crosses attitudes 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.090
 how do they increase the chances of 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.019
 accidents last week an elderly woman 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.360
 68 years old died while crossing the 7th avenue 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.729
 of May in the Santa Etelvina district. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.310
 victim tried to cross in front of a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.890
 bus that was preparing to leave 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.350
 the survey made at least 3 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 showed that trampling is the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 traffic incidents that kill the most 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.250
 in capital 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.770
 altogether died in Manaus 52 pedestrians 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 between the 1st of January and the 8th of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.619
 increase of 10.60 and 4% in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 compared to the same period last year 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.750
 the autaz mirim avenue here in the east zone 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 of the city is between the avenues where 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.850
 more people died victims of 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.119
 this year was only behind the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.340
 brazil avenue in the west of the city 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.009
 according to the manaustrans investments to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.170
 minimize accidents there is more 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.570
 problem will only be resolved when 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.759
 all comply with the rules of transit 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.790
 it is important that the pedestrian cross 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.560
 he crosses in the lane as he raises her 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.869
 hand to the driver to realize that he 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.850
 will go through and that he will do all 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.870
 tries to try but is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.410
 important that 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.640
 and there drivers are do not transfer to 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.880
 the others 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.950
 stress it as the driver it has 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.220
 with all those care 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.580
 necessary to ensure that these 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.580
 accidents
