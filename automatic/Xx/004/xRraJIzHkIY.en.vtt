wad of jute twine I just pulled it apart

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.929 
wad of jute twine I just pulled it apart
into<00:01:34.399> its<00:01:34.579> various<00:01:35.109> fibers<00:01:36.109> and<00:01:36.289> wadded<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.679> up

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:47.150 
into its various fibers and wadded it up
I'm<00:01:37.939> going<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.179> try<00:01:38.389> the<00:01:38.450> jute<00:01:38.779> twine<00:01:39.079> first

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.130 

I'm<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:47.940> sure<00:01:48.180> exactly<00:01:48.450> how<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.020> works<00:01:49.970> so

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
I'm not sure exactly how this works so

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.630 
I'm not sure exactly how this works so
we're<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.230> to<00:01:52.320> shine<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.710> into<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.130> Sun<00:01:53.400> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
we're going to shine it into the Sun and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.820 
we're going to shine it into the Sun and
hope<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.120> can<00:01:54.300> see<00:01:54.510> this<00:02:02.210> yes<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.480> works

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
hope you can see this yes it works

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.680 
hope you can see this yes it works
instantaneously<00:02:04.830> if<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.940> do<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.390> blow<00:02:06.540> on

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
instantaneously if I do this and blow on

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:21.210 
instantaneously if I do this and blow on
it

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.020 

there's<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.340> fire

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.550 

try<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.870> with<00:02:27.020> cotton<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:29.110> saw<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.140> guy<00:02:30.350> on

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
try it with cotton I saw a guy on

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.160 
try it with cotton I saw a guy on
YouTube<00:02:30.890> try<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.220> cotton<00:02:31.640> ball<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.570> he<00:02:32.960> could

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
YouTube try the cotton ball and he could

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.990 
YouTube try the cotton ball and he could
not<00:02:33.350> get<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.650> work<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:34.370> thinking<00:02:34.820> maybe

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
not get it to work I'm thinking maybe

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.640 
not get it to work I'm thinking maybe
because<00:02:35.210> it's<00:02:35.360> white<00:02:35.570> maybe<00:02:36.230> because<00:02:36.500> it's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
because it's white maybe because it's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.530 
because it's white maybe because it's
too<00:02:36.800> large<00:02:37.120> let<00:02:38.120> me<00:02:38.240> see<00:02:38.420> what<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.660> can<00:02:38.690> do<00:02:43.540> I'm

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
too large let me see what I can do I'm

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:53.760 
too large let me see what I can do I'm
getting<00:02:44.720> smoke<00:02:45.110> from<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.440> cotton<00:02:45.740> ball

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.480 

the<00:02:54.370> cotton<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.760> hard<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.060> ignite<00:02:56.190> let's<00:02:57.190> try<00:02:57.460> a

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
the cotton is hard to ignite let's try a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:12.699 
the cotton is hard to ignite let's try a
piece<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.880> tissue<00:02:58.060> paper

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.190 

it<00:03:13.519> seems<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.970> white<00:03:14.180> materials<00:03:14.720> are<00:03:14.900> harder

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
it seems that white materials are harder

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.699 
it seems that white materials are harder
to<00:03:15.230> ignite<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:18.610> have<00:03:19.610> here<00:03:19.879> a<00:03:19.909> piece<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:21.370> twig

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
to ignite I have here a piece of twig

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.270 
to ignite I have here a piece of twig
back<00:03:24.709> if<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.190> don't<00:03:25.370> burn<00:03:25.459> myself<00:03:25.670> here<00:03:27.280> see

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
back if I don't burn myself here see

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:42.760 
back if I don't burn myself here see
then<00:03:28.489> get<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.940> burn<00:03:29.120> oh<00:03:33.819> instantaneously

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.650 

so<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.400> have<00:03:43.580> coals<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:44.030> could<00:03:44.240> start<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.510> fire

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
so I have coals I could start a fire

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.940 
so I have coals I could start a fire
with<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.810> jute<00:03:48.020> twine<00:03:48.290> seems<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.740> be<00:03:48.830> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
with this the jute twine seems to be the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:04:00.649 
with this the jute twine seems to be the
best<00:03:49.070> I'm<00:03:49.370> going<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.610> do<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.820> one<00:03:49.970> more<00:03:50.120> time

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:07.530 

we<00:04:01.260> have<00:04:01.379> smoke

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.509 

and<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.200> jute<00:04:08.409> twine<00:04:08.650> continues<00:04:09.159> burning

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
and the jute twine continues burning

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.009 
and the jute twine continues burning
nicely<00:04:09.909> so<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.180> could<00:04:11.129> take<00:04:12.129> this<00:04:12.310> over<00:04:13.019> to

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
nicely so you could take this over to

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.039 
nicely so you could take this over to
your<00:04:14.110> tinder<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.700> start<00:04:16.479> a<00:04:16.540> fire<00:04:16.780> because

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
your tinder and start a fire because

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.939 
your tinder and start a fire because
it's<00:04:17.199> still<00:04:17.350> smoking<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.970> I'd<00:04:19.209> say<00:04:19.769> if<00:04:20.769> you

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
it's still smoking so I'd say if you

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.000 
it's still smoking so I'd say if you
have<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.250> right<00:04:21.400> tinder<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:24.250> this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
have the right tinder that this

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.750 
have the right tinder that this
parabolic<00:04:27.010> fire<00:04:27.940> starter<00:04:29.250> has<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> very<00:04:30.580> good

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
parabolic fire starter has a very good

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.360 
parabolic fire starter has a very good
tool<00:04:31.979> it's<00:04:32.979> still<00:04:33.280> smoking<00:04:34.949> yeah<00:04:35.979> cardboard

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
tool it's still smoking yeah cardboard

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.439 
tool it's still smoking yeah cardboard
is<00:04:36.610> never<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.240> good<00:04:37.780> firestarter<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:40.030> doesn't

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
is never a good firestarter it doesn't

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.150 
is never a good firestarter it doesn't
burn<00:04:40.600> well<00:04:40.870> but<00:04:41.289> I<00:04:41.380> figured<00:04:41.680> I'd<00:04:41.800> give<00:04:41.979> it<00:04:42.010> a

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
burn well but I figured I'd give it a

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.439 
burn well but I figured I'd give it a
shot

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
shot

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:58.159 
shot
see<00:04:43.449> what<00:04:43.570> happens<00:04:44.070> just<00:04:45.070> out<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.310> curiosity

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.770 

I've<00:04:58.860> got<00:04:59.129> one<00:04:59.310> more<00:04:59.520> idea<00:04:59.699> I<00:05:00.090> just<00:05:00.270> wondered

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
I've got one more idea I just wondered

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.459 
I've got one more idea I just wondered
if<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.139> could<00:05:01.169> take<00:05:01.499> a<00:05:02.900> wad<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:03.930> leaves<00:05:04.379> I<00:05:06.469> just

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
if I could take a wad of leaves I just

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.260 
if I could take a wad of leaves I just
felt<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.830> heat<00:05:08.009> in<00:05:08.129> my<00:05:08.159> hand<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:08.789> you<00:05:09.029> have<00:05:09.150> to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
felt the heat in my hand so you have to

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.499 
felt the heat in my hand so you have to
be<00:05:09.389> very<00:05:09.599> careful<00:05:10.050> loading<00:05:10.379> this<00:05:11.509> it's

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
be very careful loading this it's

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.059 
be very careful loading this it's
crunched<00:05:12.960> up<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.169> lot<00:05:13.319> of<00:05:13.469> leaves<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:16.680> feeling

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
crunched up a lot of leaves the feeling

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:27.679 
crunched up a lot of leaves the feeling
would<00:05:17.159> be<00:05:17.279> almost<00:05:17.430> instantaneous<00:05:17.729> fire<00:05:26.689> lots

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:27.689 
would be almost instantaneous fire lots

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.490 
would be almost instantaneous fire lots
of<00:05:27.810> smoke<00:05:29.360> see<00:05:30.360> if<00:05:30.419> I<00:05:30.539> can<00:05:30.719> blow<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.900> fire<00:05:31.199> into

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
of smoke see if I can blow a fire into

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.890
