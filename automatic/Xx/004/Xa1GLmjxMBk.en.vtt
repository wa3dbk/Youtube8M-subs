00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.520

using it for the first time this device
here<00:01:23.950> yeah<00:01:24.370> so<00:01:25.000> this<00:01:25.450> is<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.890> thing<00:01:27.090> basically

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
here yeah so this is the thing basically

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.690 
here yeah so this is the thing basically
it's<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:29.050> hotspot<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:30.390> mobile<00:01:31.390> hotspot<00:01:32.370> and<00:01:33.370> I

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
it's a hotspot a mobile hotspot and I

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.440 
it's a hotspot a mobile hotspot and I
believe<00:01:34.150> this<00:01:34.480> is<00:01:39.660> pretty<00:01:40.660> much<00:01:40.960> just<00:01:41.290> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
believe this is pretty much just the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.480 
believe this is pretty much just the
exact<00:01:43.450> same<00:01:43.750> thing<00:01:44.050> that<00:01:44.080> Sprint<00:01:44.680> users<00:01:45.220> I

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
exact same thing that Sprint users I

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.180 
exact same thing that Sprint users I
think<00:01:45.550> they<00:01:45.910> just<00:01:46.620> put<00:01:47.620> a<00:01:47.650> little<00:01:47.830> sticker

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
think they just put a little sticker

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.450 
think they just put a little sticker
over<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:50.320> face<00:01:50.650> of<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.700> Sprint<00:01:52.090> logo<00:01:52.480> up<00:01:52.630> here

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
reception because my actual cellphone

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.600 
reception because my actual cellphone
doesn't<00:03:54.290> get<00:03:54.440> very<00:03:54.620> good<00:03:54.890> reception<00:03:55.220> down

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
doesn't get very good reception down

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.720 
doesn't get very good reception down
here<00:03:55.880> either<00:03:56.150> so<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:57.069> guess<00:03:58.069> we'll<00:03:58.280> have<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.430> see

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
here either so I guess we'll have to see

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.770 
here either so I guess we'll have to see
if<00:03:59.030> it<00:04:00.099> finds<00:04:01.099> a<00:04:01.280> network<00:04:01.670> outside<00:04:02.269> this<00:04:02.510> house

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
if it finds a network outside this house

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.210 
if it finds a network outside this house
and<00:04:04.480> maybe<00:04:05.480> we<00:04:05.690> could<00:04:05.840> get<00:04:05.959> these<00:04:06.200> two<00:04:06.829> linked

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
and maybe we could get these two linked

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.729 
and maybe we could get these two linked
up<00:04:08.140> that's<00:04:09.140> too<00:04:09.379> bad

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.520 

we'll<00:04:12.739> be<00:04:12.860> back<00:04:13.069> in<00:04:13.099> we'll<00:04:13.700> see<00:04:13.730> if<00:04:14.540> I<00:04:15.170> can<00:04:15.379> get

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
we'll be back in we'll see if I can get

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.690 
we'll be back in we'll see if I can get
this<00:04:15.709> linked<00:04:16.039> up<00:04:16.160> anywhere<00:04:16.760> outside<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.359> here

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
this linked up anywhere outside of here

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.690 
this linked up anywhere outside of here
see<00:04:19.700> you<00:04:19.789> guys<00:04:19.970> later

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.730 

ok<00:04:25.700> looks<00:04:26.479> like<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.780> finally<00:04:26.990> got<00:04:27.289> the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
ok looks like I finally got the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.379 
ok looks like I finally got the
freedompop

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
freedompop

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.029 
freedompop
to<00:04:30.280> connect<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:32.110> it's<00:04:33.110> really<00:04:33.740> simple

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
to connect and it's really simple

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.279 
to connect and it's really simple
actually<00:04:34.370> if<00:04:34.880> you<00:04:35.389> look<00:04:35.419> at<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.870> device

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
actually if you look at the device

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.570 
actually if you look at the device
there's<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:38.080> password<00:04:39.080> for<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.010> network<00:04:40.370> is

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
there's the password for the network is

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.850 
there's the password for the network is
right<00:04:40.820> up<00:04:41.030> under<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.360> network<00:04:41.720> name<00:04:42.110> so<00:04:42.770> you

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
right up under the network name so you

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.320 
right up under the network name so you
just<00:04:43.099> look<00:04:43.280> at<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:43.639> you<00:04:43.820> type<00:04:44.030> in<00:04:44.210> the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
just look at that you type in the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.250 
just look at that you type in the
password<00:04:44.539> and<00:04:45.050> then<00:04:45.229> you'll<00:04:45.919> be<00:04:46.070> connected<00:04:47.260> so

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
password and then you'll be connected so

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.250 
password and then you'll be connected so
what<00:04:48.560> I'm<00:04:48.680> going<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:48.950> do<00:04:49.130> is<00:04:49.570> send<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.870> text

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
Google Voice to send that text message

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.279 
Google Voice to send that text message
I'm<00:05:06.860> going<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.250> send<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:09.940> let<00:05:10.940> me<00:05:11.060> not<00:05:11.270> let<00:05:12.139> you

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.400 

okay

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
okay

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.379 
okay
so<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:21.830> looks<00:05:22.010> like<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.370> text<00:05:22.700> message<00:05:23.060> sent

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
so it looks like the text message sent

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.670 
so it looks like the text message sent
and<00:05:24.070> everything's<00:05:25.070> working<00:05:25.220> just<00:05:25.730> fine<00:05:25.940> so

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
and everything's working just fine so

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.909 
and everything's working just fine so
now<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.980> looks<00:05:28.190> like<00:05:28.370> I<00:05:28.580> have<00:05:28.970> my<00:05:29.600> own<00:05:29.930> personal

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
now it looks like I have my own personal

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.950 
now it looks like I have my own personal
phone<00:05:31.570> as<00:05:32.570> long<00:05:32.930> as<00:05:33.200> I<00:05:33.230> have<00:05:34.540> freedompop<00:05:35.540> to<00:05:35.840> go

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
phone as long as I have freedompop to go

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.190 
phone as long as I have freedompop to go
with<00:05:36.169> it<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:36.669> I<00:05:37.669> get<00:05:38.240> five<00:05:38.540> hundred<00:05:38.750> three

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
with it so I get five hundred three

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.800 
with it so I get five hundred three
minutes<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:40.210> not<00:05:41.210> five<00:05:41.389> hundred<00:05:41.480> three

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
minutes of not five hundred three

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.870 
minutes of not five hundred three
minutes<00:05:42.169> five<00:05:42.560> hundred<00:05:42.889> three<00:05:42.980> megabytes<00:05:43.520> per

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
minutes five hundred three megabytes per

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.800 
minutes five hundred three megabytes per
month

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
month

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.870 
month
so<00:05:45.139> with<00:05:45.380> that<00:05:45.530> five<00:05:45.770> hundred<00:05:45.800> free<00:05:46.340> megabytes

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
so with that five hundred free megabytes

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.600 
so with that five hundred free megabytes
per<00:05:46.970> month<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.600> read<00:05:48.110> in<00:05:48.530> an<00:05:48.740> article<00:05:48.830> online

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
per month I read in an article online

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.290 
per month I read in an article online
that<00:05:50.270> it's<00:05:50.660> about<00:05:51.020> 14<00:05:51.740> megabytes<00:05:52.130> per<00:05:52.430> hour

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
that it's about 14 megabytes per hour

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.170 
that it's about 14 megabytes per hour
on<00:05:53.750> average<00:05:54.139> for<00:05:54.770> some<00:05:55.130> voice<00:05:55.940> over<00:05:56.270> IP<00:05:56.950> style

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
on average for some voice over IP style

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.370 
on average for some voice over IP style
telephones<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.860> you'll<00:06:01.450> 14<00:06:02.450> megabytes<00:06:02.750> will

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
telephones and you'll 14 megabytes will

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.629 
telephones and you'll 14 megabytes will
probably<00:06:03.800> give<00:06:04.160> you<00:06:04.340> about<00:06:05.139> somewhere<00:06:06.139> around

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
five to six hours per hundred megabytes

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.340 
five to six hours per hundred megabytes
