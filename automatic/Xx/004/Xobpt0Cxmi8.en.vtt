00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.730
 john miss your race you can add another 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.650
 new complete here on my channel breed 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.910
 the game from 4 in their game you on the 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.740
 background and it is because I am today 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.390
 possibly talk about the next call or 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.130
 duty and also a bit about the previous one 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.480
 call of duty to quickly complete you 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.340
 but of course as you know in 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.080
 black us there was the system that you 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.880
 could earn points per game that you 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.920
 played point could earn with could 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.750
 tracks that buys and therefore you could again 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.580
 arms buys old cows from esme scope 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.110
 and therefore you could buy cam forest and me 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.820
 from that a whole lot of system 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.680
 call of duty it added again is niels 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.629
 Make it adds something extra and 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.700
 added is niels to think about 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.899
 you were really good at making decisions 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.370
 the game itself from 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.260
 do I want to buy that weapon or do I want that 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 buy a weapon and I really liked that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.899
 you also had something to do with it 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.430
 just all the way through prestige and 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.260
 everything as now also on leaks or always 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.640
 So if you all were by pressures 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.800
 you just have everything and lures and then you can 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.850
 you also just no longer leveling 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.989
 but then you have everything and 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.760
 lochting you can play with anything 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.350
 and I really like that type of system 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.000
 just fat to see you 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.740
 make decisions from which 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.270
 bat and lure where you will get points 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.250
 for spending and that check marks and 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.110
 just frog in bollendorf 3 or the whole 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.369
 middle-office series actually have that 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.410
 never had but in a new call 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.910
 or duty call or duty ghosts as already on 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.869
 kent was made, I just hope that again 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.800
 go see again 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.959
 and I actually wanted it for you too 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.819
 ask what kind of system do you want 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.319
 see back in the call or duty ghost one 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.479
 new call of duty here of course this 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.800
 coming out somewhere in November 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.910
 just let me know in the comments and 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.770
 maybe you have super good ones 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.060
 ideas that I can possibly elaborate 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.679
 go tell and hope further 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.300
 of course just to release something again 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.030
 go see as they can also game on 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.709
 place as always so as all i finish 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.000
 for example to warm me 3 was that think 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.560
 I also just always watched to play 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.630
 you just don't feel like it anymore 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.220
 info normal games can of course take a moment 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.899
 back from my back game boy sticks and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.099
 stones is going to do with friends like x one 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.450
 stones really just the lag calm 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.520
 game play ever it is sticks and stones 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.390
 stuff hear flower with that crossbow you stand 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.739
 first 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.509
 waist still 10 seconds and there you are 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.890
 you just not a soldier I will walk out 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.479
 swear with your friends and you can really 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.259
 just task so hard you laugh something 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.030
 play seriously 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.319
 you can bump so hard to go with it 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.550
 with it guys it was a very fast 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.319
 just complete for you within the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.069
 that and I lasted about two minutes 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.450
 hope you just have it again 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.250
 I enjoyed your course fall again with the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.959
 bliss I will let you know in the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.490
 just kind of hope again 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.840
 get to see your point system 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.130
 not just everything at once and lure like 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.570
 you had some guts where 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.250
 maybe you should buy that for example 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.720
 again such a created class point system 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.850
