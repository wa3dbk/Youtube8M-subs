00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
green run transit into the nav card

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.359

machine<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.359> map<00:00:30.570> die<00:00:30.810> rise<00:00:31.109> now<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> don't

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
machine on this map die rise now I don't

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.040 
machine on this map die rise now I don't

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
know if inserting that nav card will

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.799 
know if inserting that nav card will
actually<00:00:34.500> activate<00:00:35.070> something<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.630> might

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
actually activate something but it might

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.510 
actually activate something but it might
