00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:12.989
 LORNA SEE PHYSICAL ANGELS. 

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:18.607
 And he sees much more than he says to us. 

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:22.958
 Angels have taught me to see something very rare for you 

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:26.131
 and that is the physical power of love. 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.694
 When you were born as babies, you were very happy, 

00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:34.692
 because you knew you were 100% pure love. 

00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:39.568
 90% of people lock their love. 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.833
 You can't destroy or diminish love 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.261
 is still inside you, at 100%. 

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:53.128
 When I see a person coming out of love, 

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:58.187
 it is like a fog coming out of every part of it 

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:06.051
 and that is crystal clear, transparent, and gently moving. 

00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:12.943
 But often I see a person with locked love 

00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:19.748
 and such a man has a belt around him that looks hard and cold. 

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:24.601
 Angels told me that the more you relax the love that is in you 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.485
 the happier and happier you will be and the more fulfilled your life will be. 

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:36.237
 Now I'll tell you five ways to help you unleash the love you have in yourself. 

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:40.094
 CHOOSE THAT YOU WILL HAVE MORE RADIO. 

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:44.680
 You have a choice and you can choose to recognize that you are pure love. 

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:53.119
 You are the ones who can release this belt that is around your chest, and release the love. 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.415
 Don't worry, and remember, it's never too late to let you know how much you want. 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.542
 KNOW LOVE 

00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:06.125
 You begin to feel love. 

00:02:06.796 --> 00:02:09.814
 I know that many of you have never thought about love. 

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:14.623
 You may have always thought of affiliate love, but forgot all the other love. 

00:02:15.504 --> 00:02:20.677
 Be aware of all the opportunities you have to show love every day. 

00:02:21.314 --> 00:02:27.142
 It can be just a smile or a nice word or a helping hand. 

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:30.510
 Do not allow any opportunity to escape you. 

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:36.589
 Do not be cold and do not forbid to show love. 

00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:42.636
 Do not tighten the belt around your chest, but release your pure love out. 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.317
 NOBODY IS PERFECT 

00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:55.365
 Think about past events that have made you lock your love and tighten the belt, 

00:02:56.547 --> 00:03:01.662
 and start launching these things that hurt you. 

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:09.296
 Maybe when you were a little kid, someone didn't give you or you couldn't have it, 

00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:13.805
 or when you were a teenager, they bullyed you at school, 

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:20.066
 or perhaps now, as an adult, someone has told you something ugly that has hurt you, 

00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:23.190
 and nobody helped you ... 

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:32.580
 It's good to remember all the things that made you lock in love 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:40.325
 and who have hurt you so much, and accept and release them. 

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:44.513
 SOMETHING YOU 

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:47.107
 Prayer is powerful. 

00:03:48.132 --> 00:03:50.569
 I always say he can carry mountains. 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.732
 But one of the things you may never have realized 

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:58.044
 is that prayer can help you relax the love that is in you. 

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:04.356
 Because every time you pray for yourself or someone else, 

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:09.144
 or you pray for something you have heard happened in the world 

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:13.596
 something that has made you feel compassionate or touched your emotions, 

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:19.070
 Helps you and everyone in the world free your love. 

00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:24.449
 I received a prayer from the angels to help you relax your love. 

00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:44.278
 If you start to release your love more, you will become happier internally 

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:48.990
 and everyone around you will be happier. 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.380
 And if everyone in the world today began to release more of their love, 

00:04:55.907 --> 00:05:03.975
 the world would become more loving, peaceful and happy.
