temperature sensing dipstick off the
gene<00:00:17.100> bird<00:00:17.369> website<00:00:18.710> I<00:00:20.060> understood<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.359> they

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
the guys who sold the gene Berg or not

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.510 
the guys who sold the gene Berg or not
but<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.489> guy<00:00:36.559> claims<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.800> he's<00:00:38.309> been

in the 60s so anyway this one's actually

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139 
in the 60s so anyway this one's actually
you<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.160> crimp<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> ends<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.940> they

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you don't have to crimp the ends on they

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.639 
you don't have to crimp the ends on they
do<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> which<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.260> kind<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> nice

the<00:00:52.890> wires<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:54.210> shorter<00:00:54.570> than<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> Jean

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the wires a lot shorter than the Jean

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.939 
the wires a lot shorter than the Jean
Berg<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> instructions<00:00:56.489> are<00:00:56.899> not<00:00:57.949> heat

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
Berg and the instructions are not heat

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
Berg and the instructions are not heat
shrink<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> plastic<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.359> that's<00:01:00.570> nice<00:01:00.780> but

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
shrink to the plastic so that's nice but

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
shrink to the plastic so that's nice but
anyway<00:01:01.949> we're<00:01:02.489> gonna<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.879> installed

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
anyway we're gonna get this installed

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
anyway we're gonna get this installed
I'm<00:01:03.539> gonna<00:01:03.690> feel<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> lot<00:01:04.140> better<00:01:04.409> having<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I'm gonna feel a lot better having that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
I'm gonna feel a lot better having that
canary<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.519> mine<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
canary in the mine it's not going to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.210 
canary in the mine it's not going to
tell<00:01:07.020> me<00:01:07.170> cylinder<00:01:07.560> head<00:01:07.680> temperature<00:01:08.100> or

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
tell me cylinder head temperature or

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.679 
tell me cylinder head temperature or
anything<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.210> gonna<00:01:09.450> tell

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
anything like that but it is gonna tell

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
anything like that but it is gonna tell
me<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> oil<00:01:10.619> gets<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.280> too<00:01:11.490> hot

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
me when the oil gets a little too hot

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.160 
me when the oil gets a little too hot
and<00:01:12.380> we'll<00:01:13.380> we'll<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> installed<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
and we'll we'll get this installed and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.499 
and we'll we'll get this installed and
hopefully<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> engine

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
hopefully you know when the engine

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
hopefully you know when the engine
overheats<00:01:18.900> or<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> oil<00:01:20.040> starts<00:01:20.310> getting

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
overheats or when the oil starts getting

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
overheats or when the oil starts getting
hot<00:01:20.580> we'll<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:21.030> about<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.750> yeah<00:01:21.900> we're

gonna start our operation here just by
removing<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.619> old<00:01:25.740> dipstick<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.580> got

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
removing the old dipstick there got

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.510 
removing the old dipstick there got
plenty<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> Earl<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.439> I'm<00:01:28.770> gonna<00:01:28.920> set<00:01:29.280> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
plenty of Earl and I'm gonna set that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.090 
plenty of Earl and I'm gonna set that
just<00:01:30.360> right<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.020> ground<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.979> I'll

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

I've got enough clearance around it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.649 
I've got enough clearance around it
looks<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:52.369> we're<00:01:53.369> gonna<00:01:53.520> twist<00:01:54.420> him<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
looks like we do we're gonna twist him a

looks like we do we're gonna twist him a
little<00:01:54.899> bit<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.340> I'm<00:01:56.340> gonna<00:01:56.549> run<00:01:56.729> this

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
little bit like that I'm gonna run this

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.469 
little bit like that I'm gonna run this
wire<00:01:57.979> back<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.460> behind<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.000> generator

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
wire back here behind the generator

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.010 
wire back here behind the generator
maybe<00:02:01.130> maybe<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:03.090> never<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.750> I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.309 
maybe maybe you never know you know I
always<00:02:07.350> say<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> should<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.069> been<00:02:08.250> born<00:02:08.550> with

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
always say I should have been born with

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.470 
always say I should have been born with
much<00:02:10.319> bigger<00:02:10.590> hands

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
much bigger hands

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.680 
much bigger hands
make<00:02:11.960> things<00:02:12.290> even<00:02:12.500> more<00:02:12.680> difficult<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.790> guess

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
make things even more difficult I guess

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.360 
make things even more difficult I guess
I<00:02:14.930> was<00:02:15.020> born<00:02:15.260> with<00:02:15.440> really<00:02:15.709> little<00:02:15.980> hands

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520
