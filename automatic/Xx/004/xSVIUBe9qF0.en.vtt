00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
hair to curl hair instead of doing this

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.049 
hair to curl hair instead of doing this
you<00:00:32.940> might<00:00:33.150> actually<00:00:33.330> have<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.280> look<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.940> much

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you might actually have to look so much

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
you might actually have to look so much
hair<00:00:36.269> spray<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.629> here<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.410> might<00:00:37.559> actually

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
hair spray it here you might actually

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.490 
hair spray it here you might actually
have<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.339> spray<00:00:39.269> each<00:00:39.540> individual<00:00:40.260> piece

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
have to spray each individual piece

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.180 
have to spray each individual piece
before<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.309> after<00:00:41.720> but<00:00:42.720> um<00:00:42.900> because<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.040> want

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
before and after but um because we want

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.729 
before and after but um because we want
this<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.339> be<00:00:44.519> more<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.970> a<00:00:45.089> flowy<00:00:45.510> BG<00:00:46.229> like<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this to be more of a flowy BG like I

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.960 
this to be more of a flowy BG like I
didn't<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.519> try<00:00:47.850> Harris<00:00:48.540> tutorial<00:00:49.909> if<00:00:50.909> you

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
didn't really try Harris tutorial if you

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.270 
didn't really try Harris tutorial if you
can<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.750> away<00:00:51.869> with<00:00:52.290> just<00:00:52.500> spraying<00:00:52.830> her<00:00:53.129> like

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
can get away with just spraying her like

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.280 
can get away with just spraying her like
this<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.729> I<00:00:53.879> did<00:00:54.059> before<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:55.049> going

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
this like I did before then that's going

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.979 
this like I did before then that's going
to<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.650> most<00:00:55.799> ideal<00:00:56.040> so<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.390> putting

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
to be the most ideal so I'm just putting

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.200 
to be the most ideal so I'm just putting
my<00:00:58.199> fingers<00:00:58.530> through<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.400> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.729> hairspray

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
my fingers through all of the hairspray

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.229 
my fingers through all of the hairspray
so<00:01:00.269> that<00:01:00.540> doesn't<00:01:00.809> clump<00:01:01.110> up<00:01:02.119> next<00:01:03.119> we're

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so that doesn't clump up next we're

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.810 
so that doesn't clump up next we're
going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.479> take<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.019> curling<00:01:04.500> iron<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.489> be

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
going to take a curling iron it can be

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
going to take a curling iron it can be
any<00:01:06.240> size<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.170> Nina<00:01:10.470> doesn't

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
any size and just as is Nina doesn't

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.709 
any size and just as is Nina doesn't
really<00:01:10.860> matter<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> very<00:01:12.000> thin<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.539> I

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
really matter this is a very thin one I

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.899 
really matter this is a very thin one I
probably<00:01:13.020> recommend<00:01:13.560> using<00:01:14.039> a<00:01:14.399> thicker<00:01:14.670> one

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
probably recommend using a thicker one

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
probably recommend using a thicker one
alright<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.719> I'm<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.020> take<00:01:16.229> sections

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
alright so I'm going to take sections

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.349 
alright so I'm going to take sections
you're<00:01:17.219> not<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> take<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.969> sections

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
you're not going to take little sections

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.520 
you're not going to take little sections
but<00:01:18.479> we're<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:18.719> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.960> try<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.170> make<00:01:19.380> this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
but we're not going to try to make this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
but we're not going to try to make this
really<00:01:19.920> tight<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.399> a<00:01:20.490> curl<00:01:20.729> we're<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
really tight of a curl we're going to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
really tight of a curl we're going to
take<00:01:21.750> bigger<00:01:22.140> sections<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:24.119> hair<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
take bigger sections of hair so this is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.039 
take bigger sections of hair so this is
pretty<00:01:26.490> big<00:01:26.729> section<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> went<00:01:27.539> normally<00:01:27.960> if

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
pretty big section you went normally if

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.080 
pretty big section you went normally if
you're<00:01:28.140> trying<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.499> do<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.640> tight<00:01:29.640> hair<00:01:29.850> call

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you're trying to do a tight hair call

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
you're trying to do a tight hair call
you<00:01:30.210> wouldn't<00:01:30.479> use<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.719> big<00:01:30.899> of<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> section

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you wouldn't use this big of a section

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.149 
you wouldn't use this big of a section
ok<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:32.429> there<00:01:32.609> flip<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.829> kind<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.859> bring<00:01:35.039> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
ok do there flip it kind of bring it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
ok do there flip it kind of bring it
down<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:36.270> curling<00:01:36.630> iron<00:01:36.749> barrel<00:01:38.869> ok<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> then

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
down the curling iron barrel ok and then

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.919 
down the curling iron barrel ok and then
we're<00:01:40.319> just<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:40.530> wrap<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.719> I<00:01:42.749> just

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
we're just gonna wrap it up but I just

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.349 
we're just gonna wrap it up but I just
it<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.350> trick<00:01:43.679> to<00:01:43.920> easily<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:44.999> the

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
it was like a trick to easily get the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.230 
it was like a trick to easily get the
ends<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.719> your<00:01:45.749> hair<00:01:45.929> in<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.149> curling<00:01:48.149> iron

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
ends of your hair in the curling iron

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.450 
ends of your hair in the curling iron
because<00:01:48.539> sometimes<00:01:48.929> they'll<00:01:49.170> stick<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.280> if

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
because sometimes they'll stick out if

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.830 
because sometimes they'll stick out if
you<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.729> try<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> start<00:01:51.179> at<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> bottom<00:01:51.389> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you just try to start at the bottom and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
you just try to start at the bottom and
then<00:01:52.679> up<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:52.829> where<00:01:53.310> my<00:01:53.340> hair<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:53.819> little

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
then up here where my hair is a little

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.749 
then up here where my hair is a little
um<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.649> thicker<00:01:55.979> there's<00:01:56.369> more<00:01:56.579> hair

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
um you know thicker there's more hair

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.489 
um you know thicker there's more hair
round<00:01:56.969> instead<00:01:57.569> of<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.929> touching<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
round instead of like touching the

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:00.469 
round instead of like touching the
actual<00:01:58.799> metal<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.789> kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.999> touch<00:02:00.179> it<00:02:00.359> to

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
actual metal I just kind of touch it to

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330 
actual metal I just kind of touch it to
feel<00:02:00.659> once<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> gets<00:02:01.109> warm<00:02:01.380> ok<00:02:02.039> and<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.249> going

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
feel once it gets warm ok and it's going

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.319 
feel once it gets warm ok and it's going
to<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.490> warm<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.819> we're<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.210> take

makes<00:04:32.820> it<00:04:33.000> look<00:04:33.150> cuter<00:04:34.140> than<00:04:34.410> just<00:04:34.650> having

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
makes it look cuter than just having

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.720 
makes it look cuter than just having
the<00:04:35.510> back<00:04:35.720> pieces<00:04:35.990> both<00:04:36.410> be<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:36.950> straight<00:04:37.430> and

the back pieces both be so straight and
gives<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.150> more<00:04:38.330> dimension<00:04:38.840> maybe<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.950> don't

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
gives it more dimension maybe I don't

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.150 
gives it more dimension maybe I don't
really<00:04:40.370> know<00:04:40.550> what<00:04:40.640> I'm<00:04:40.670> looking<00:04:40.790> for<00:04:41.090> but
