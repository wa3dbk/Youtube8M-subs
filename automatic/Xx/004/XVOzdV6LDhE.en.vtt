 will love even more since after 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.019
 cooking you have to remove the divorced 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.420
 in the kitchen I can otherwise my daughter pig 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.670

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.440
 you get faster and faster, better and better 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.660
 better in principle from work after the game already 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.819
 decided you can not bathe the following 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.650
 that you will never be hungry in 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.989
 cooking time from light smell 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.780
 eating appetite flies away far distant lands 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.030
 and tells you bye bye alone 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.829
 taste you must try to create when 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.049
 I was little with my grandmother very often 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.510
 made all kinds of pastry pancakes 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.519
 cakes cakes and so on and it seems like I already 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.380
 grew a habit to quietly eat 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.320
 the dough is still left so sometimes 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:12.420
 such a little bit tasty can happen 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.420

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.380

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.910
 specially made the sword dough and by the way 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.579
 now when viewing any 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.410
 cooking shows you understand who and how 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.170

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.180

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.069
 liquid stuffing inside to dock well someone 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.930

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.090
 dish on the ingredients to cookies me 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.870
 seems to have added a little zest 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.150
 orange and yes lemons it's just all on 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.700
 and a cookie, but it clearly feels 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.530
 nutmeg or cardamom just 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.140
 oat cookies 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.329
 before nutmeg is definitely possible 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.370
