00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 some robbie girls here I'm from 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 new with all of you and welcome to 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.349
 a minecraft Sunday or maybe 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.840
 I should say my pins or my pages 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.420
 traps and ribs because today I bring you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.570
 a new trick lovers tricks in the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.600
 that I'm going to show you a couple of pack of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.350
 textures with which to have the skill 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.570
 to see through the walls but without 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.939
 no type of program is not necessary 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.380
 x-ray or anything like that simply with 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 this textures pack that puts 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.559
 transparent most objects 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.579
 that are not entirely valuable so much for 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:47.489
 the 1.8 point x that is to say for all the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.840
 version of the 1.800 1.7 point 2 up 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.340
 1.7 point 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.040
 of agreement are two structures 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.170
 different ones that are not worth the two for 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.239
 two versions worth so guys for 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.100
 readings you have below in the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.780
 description of agreement and I will try 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.340
 because I'm in 1.8 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.440
 I'm going to try one of the two according 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.479
 by the way a trick that many people 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.369
 do not know to go to the main point folder 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.140
 thank you and put our packages there 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.150
 resources that you have, I insist below in the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.430
 description is to go here to packages of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.869
 resources and give it here to open folder of 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.080
 agreement and so we avoid having to 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.220
 put the percent or app data 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.360
 so much percent and all that that 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.710
 normally used 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.080
 well, giving you directly here 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.110
 We open this folder we go to page 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.020
 agreement and good guys let's show 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.479
 that textures pack this is the one of the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.399
 1.8 onwards why that's the plus this 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.080
 the plus and this the 7 16 64 is that of the 1.7 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.310
 ok and you're not going to put it on because 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.600
 I could put it what happens it's not going to 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.610
 work is not going to see practically 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.460
 nothing will be fatal so I'm going to put 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.520
 the 1.8 which is this one here and you go 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.229
 to see as without any kind of program 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.180
 or anything like that I have the active 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.300
 there is but good has nothing to do 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.010
 we can see through the trees already 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.710
 through the earth through 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.890
 absolutely all my vineyards of my 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.380
 pages the truth that sometimes appear 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.539
 of them that fails a little bit and you have to 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.640
 so that it recharges what is the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.709
 chips and all that but let's see what 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.720
 they will begin to appear and if not for 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.160
 we go down a little bit because it's good 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.750
 we are under the sea so 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.980
 better do not appear much we are going to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.450
 wait a bit in fact let's go down 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.070
 a little bit we go down a little bit here 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.600
 we have the iron 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.010
 here we have we are biting here 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.360
 around here you see you go back to 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.010
 appear technical things we have a 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.720
 cave out there it 's very easy to find the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.180
 school because simply by seeing that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.560
 there are those gray rays or there are bugs 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.660
 it just makes the zombie is 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.489
 burning poor me because we know that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.440
 there is a cave worth there is a cave and super 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.630
 cool and you see that they keep loading here 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.040
 the little things we have gold here to see 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.750
 if it appears some damn day so that what 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.850
 can teach and if not then we continue by 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.410
 digging a little bit more will appear 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.730
 little by little agree and now 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.200
 looking little by little though 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.310
 usually from the top I 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.110
 because I'm recording a bit and then 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.310
 resources is going a little bad because 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.750
 look 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.250
 we can here quietly chop up 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.660
 the diamonds we explain we prick 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.490
 and we arrived at mother land we already have 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.770
 a few call ticos out there 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.320
 we have more out there we have more good 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.780
 we already have coal under the earth 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.030
 mother of the mother stone honored the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.320
 really a little inaccessible basically and 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.270
 As you are seeing around here, we have 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.220
 a lot of little things and resources that 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.020
 in as we go down and updating 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.570
 the chips will be appearing more 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.040
 there are more diamonds here more diamonds 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.980
 etcetera etcetera and as I say guys 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.830
 for the 1 point for the 1.7 then 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.480
 you simply use the other package of 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.450
 textures is worth it is this that is called 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.520
 that 16 64 and just download it and 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.380
 without decompressing is simply the 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.510
 file that you have in the folder 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.160
 of download you put in that part 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.360
 Also, as you are seeing, I do not know 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.310
 it's night because if right now if 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.040
 you remove me for textures obviously 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.600
 all this is dark, it is worth fixing 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.250
 that I'm going to take this away and not know 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.930
 absolutely nothing because there is no 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.400
 torch there you are seeing that there is no 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.860
 a single torch therefore looks 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.790
 dark so guys I hope that I have 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.080
