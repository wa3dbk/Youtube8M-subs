00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
battlefield 3 I don't know why it can't

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.860 
battlefield 3 I don't know why it can't
work<00:02:33.650> both<00:02:34.040> ways<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.760> not<00:02:35.030> only<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.269> but<00:02:35.420> EA

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
work both ways and not only that but EA

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.600 
work both ways and not only that but EA
came<00:02:36.470> out<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.860> officially<00:02:37.310> said<00:02:37.489> that

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
came out and officially said that

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.850

they're<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:38.030> after<00:02:38.209> modern<00:02:38.629> warfare<00:02:38.780> 3<00:02:38.959> so

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
they're going after modern warfare 3 so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.170 
they're going after modern warfare 3 so
it's<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.040> bit<00:02:40.160> hard<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.489> have<00:02:40.640> an<00:02:40.730> opinion<00:02:40.910> on

it's a bit hard to have an opinion on

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.759 
it's a bit hard to have an opinion on
battlefield<00:02:41.569> 3<00:02:41.780> when<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.170> developer<00:02:42.380> says

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
battlefield 3 when the developer says

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.920 
battlefield 3 when the developer says
that<00:02:43.099> sorry<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.730> publisher<00:02:44.299> says<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.720> and

that sorry the publisher says that and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.870 
that sorry the publisher says that and
then<00:02:45.739> you're<00:02:45.920> not<00:02:45.950> allowed<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.340> compare<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
then you're not allowed to compare the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.880 
then you're not allowed to compare the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
but it's perfectly okay to compare
