yeah we're going to add and cutting this
hill<00:00:25.859> all<00:00:26.130> down<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:26.970> bringing<00:00:27.529> what's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
hill all down and then bringing what's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.409 
hill all down and then bringing what's
out<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.949> level<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> building<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
out of level in the building in the

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.750 
out of level in the building in the
floor<00:00:30.689> on

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.819 

then<00:00:34.090> that<00:00:34.269> way<00:00:34.480> it<00:00:34.629> let<00:00:34.839> me<00:00:34.870> get<00:00:35.199> those<00:00:35.410> poles

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
then that way it let me get those poles

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.790 
then that way it let me get those poles
on<00:00:36.129> its<00:00:36.309> side<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.609> fill<00:00:37.149> in<00:00:37.839> a<00:00:37.899> lot<00:00:38.199> deeper<00:00:38.469> than

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
on its side to fill in a lot deeper than

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.990 
on its side to fill in a lot deeper than
if<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:39.039> would<00:00:39.190> have<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.399> go<00:00:39.519> through<00:00:39.550> another

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
if I would have to go through another

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.920 
if I would have to go through another
three<00:00:40.239> or<00:00:40.269> four<00:00:40.539> feet<00:00:40.780> of<00:00:40.870> hail<00:00:41.140> so<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:43.690> works

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
three or four feet of hail so this works

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.060 
three or four feet of hail so this works
out<00:00:44.199> pretty<00:00:44.500> well

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
out pretty well

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.459 
out pretty well

on the metal because the metals ribs
stick<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:50.820> three-quarters<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.810> you'll<00:01:52.470> have

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
stick out three-quarters so you'll have

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.710 
stick out three-quarters so you'll have
a<00:01:52.680> build<00:01:53.070> outboard<00:01:55.640> we'll<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.149> built

there's<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.310> lot<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.579> load<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> lot<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.180> wind

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
there's a lot of load and a lot of wind

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:47.400 
there's a lot of load and a lot of wind
on<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> door<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.230> 16<00:02:37.920> 14<00:02:38.850> foot

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.630 

well<00:02:48.410> we're<00:02:48.590> down<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.920> last<00:02:49.040> piece<00:02:49.580> of

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
well we're down to the last piece of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.190 
well we're down to the last piece of
siding<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.390> building<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:50.960> we're<00:02:51.110> gonna

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
siding on the building so we're gonna

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.780 
siding on the building so we're gonna
film<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:54.440> then<00:02:54.920> we<00:02:55.160> just<00:02:55.340> have<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.610> put

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
film that and then we just have to put

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.330 
film that and then we just have to put
the<00:02:55.880> rake<00:02:56.060> covers<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.900> corner<00:02:57.860> trim<00:02:58.130> on

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
the rake covers and the corner trim on

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.640 
the rake covers and the corner trim on
and<00:02:58.580> we're<00:02:58.700> done<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.210> little<00:03:00.110> bit<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.380> door

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
and we're done a little bit of door

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:14.950 
and we're done a little bit of door
hardware<00:03:13.090> yeah<00:03:14.090> I'm<00:03:14.240> lucky<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.630> have<00:03:14.780> these

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
hardware yeah I'm lucky to have these

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.420 
hardware yeah I'm lucky to have these
guys<00:03:15.230> not<00:03:15.860> got<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.790> two<00:03:17.000> younger<00:03:17.390> guys<00:03:17.600> there

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
guys not got the two younger guys there

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.550 
guys not got the two younger guys there
one<00:03:19.430> has<00:03:19.670> been<00:03:19.910> 110<00:03:20.510> years<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.200> other<00:03:21.230> one

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
one has been 110 years and the other one

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:34.600 
one has been 110 years and the other one
one<00:03:21.830> year

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.170 

I<00:03:36.130> figured<00:03:37.130> I'd<00:03:37.250> show<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.610> door<00:03:37.820> hardware

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
I figured I'd show the door hardware

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.250 
I figured I'd show the door hardware
just<00:03:39.050> goes<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.740> stop<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:41.210> then<00:03:41.990> there's<00:03:42.200> a

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
just goes in to stop and then there's a

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.130 
just goes in to stop and then there's a
stay<00:03:42.680> roller<00:03:43.040> though<00:03:43.850> keeps<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.660> door<00:03:44.900> from

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
stay roller though keeps the door from

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.680 
stay roller though keeps the door from
wanting<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:45.860> blow<00:03:46.130> in<00:03:46.370> or<00:03:46.520> out<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:47.600> it

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
wanting to blow in or out and then it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.690 
wanting to blow in or out and then it
rolls<00:03:47.960> nice<00:03:48.380> when<00:03:48.740> you're<00:03:48.860> trying<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.190> then

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
rolls nice when you're trying to then

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.520 
rolls nice when you're trying to then
you<00:03:49.850> have<00:03:49.880> another<00:03:50.180> stop<00:03:50.570> to<00:03:50.870> hold<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.320> door

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
you have another stop to hold the door

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.760 
you have another stop to hold the door
when<00:03:51.770> it's<00:03:51.920> all<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.160> way<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.490> open<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:54.380> inside

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
when it's all the way I open the inside

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.620 
when it's all the way I open the inside
of<00:03:54.920> doors<00:03:55.070> is<00:03:55.370> simple<00:03:55.790> enough<00:03:56.000> we<00:03:56.240> just<00:03:56.270> have<00:03:56.600> a

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
of doors is simple enough we just have a

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.010 
of doors is simple enough we just have a
hook<00:03:56.950> each<00:03:57.950> side<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.540> ratchets<00:03:59.540> so<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.870> can

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
hook each side that ratchets so you can

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.380 
hook each side that ratchets so you can
get<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.350> really<00:04:00.590> tight<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.340> then<00:04:01.430> up<00:04:02.209> at<00:04:02.360> the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
get it really tight and then up at the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.600 
get it really tight and then up at the
top<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.990> have<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.380> bolt<00:04:03.620> through<00:04:03.860> trolley

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
top you have the bolt through trolley

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.300 
top you have the bolt through trolley
hangers<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.990> then<00:04:06.470> there's<00:04:06.740> the<00:04:06.980> rollers

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
hangers and then there's the rollers

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.260 
hangers and then there's the rollers
that<00:04:07.340> go<00:04:07.610> up<00:04:07.790> into<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.360> track<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:10.280> these<00:04:10.459> doors

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
that go up into the track on these doors

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.020 
that go up into the track on these doors
you<00:04:11.630> have<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.840> door<00:04:12.140> rail<00:04:12.470> we<00:04:13.370> just<00:04:13.550> put<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.760> two

stay roller there two of them and then

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.729 
stay roller there two of them and then
you<00:04:19.880> stop<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.810> keeps<00:04:21.079> it<00:04:21.260> built<00:04:21.530> out

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
you stop that keeps it built out

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.070 
you stop that keeps it built out
three-quarters<00:04:22.160> more<00:04:22.910> than<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.360> ribs<00:04:23.690> on<00:04:23.960> the

protrudes<00:04:47.180> out<00:04:47.570> then<00:04:47.870> there's<00:04:48.050> a<00:04:48.110> track<00:04:48.440> cover

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.499 

we<00:04:53.500> had<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.740> bring<00:04:53.949> in<00:04:54.160> our<00:04:55.350> 40-foot<00:04:57.090> JLT<00:04:58.090> lift

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
we had to bring in our 40-foot JLT lift

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.510 
we had to bring in our 40-foot JLT lift
because<00:04:59.080> we<00:04:59.350> couldn't<00:04:59.680> get<00:04:59.800> on<00:04:59.919> the<00:04:59.949> roof<00:05:00.250> to

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
because we couldn't get on the roof to

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.129 
because we couldn't get on the roof to
put<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.850> rake<00:05:01.000> covers<00:05:01.449> on<00:05:01.600> because<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.050> the

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
put the rake covers on because of the

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.790 
put the rake covers on because of the
snow<00:05:02.639> so<00:05:03.660> we're<00:05:04.660> very<00:05:04.750> close<00:05:05.259> to<00:05:05.530> getting<00:05:05.650> done

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
snow so we're very close to getting done

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.950 
snow so we're very close to getting done
here<00:05:06.220> we<00:05:06.310> get<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.580> rakes<00:05:06.789> on<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.389> then<00:05:07.509> we've

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960
