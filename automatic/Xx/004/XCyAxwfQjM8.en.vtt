00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 so before you leave if I can 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.570
 allow me a little self-criticism a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.960
 self-critical that I hope is not going too much 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.920

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.180

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.880

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.429
 global warming of addicts 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.570

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.780
 retirement and other topics taken over 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.579
 as well 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.579
 sometimes I ask myself this question 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:50.300
 can we laugh at all at this question 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.829

 buttons drags there really are some 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.680
 men in the field 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.840
 I know that today the u laughed evolved 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.820

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:33.860
 taking the gag of lulu berlu 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:37.050

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.479
 discreetly the mammoth's shin that 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.800
 serves as bar stools just 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.920
 before that bitch do is sit 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.179
 a young dynamic executive today 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.289
 the water is that the coit is missing in the rex and 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.289

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.950

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.340
 hardly tell us so much these 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.060
 10 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:24.230
 the day of the Father's Day 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.230
 orphans save money 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.270
 I agree with you it's 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.090
 disgusting 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.450
 plus it's not very funny but 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.470
 sophie all these couples 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.720
 indeed if this time we calculate on 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.360
 the whole year and well these 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.180
 savings that realizes and orphans for 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.400
 Father's Day never do that 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.180
 compensate what they spend for the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.320
 cus a good game there you a little 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.090
 shamefully happened to me too 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.620
 personally to practice humor 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.950
 black as before I said and 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.150
 frankly happily I do not say anymore 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:15.880
 and I'm sorry I said like that all 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:18.660
 the terminally ill do not go 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.660
 not up to the tray 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.370
 so now I have remorse 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.819
 when I think that a persons 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.050
 member of their family in terminal 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.020
 also now to unattractive mans 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.840
 and against the current I try to make 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.060
 the kind humor of humorous comic 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.420
 and as soon as I have the opportunity and well I 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.489
 defends the orphan of the 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.920
 widow and one who suddenly jumps 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.959
 humanitarian comic but also 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.330
 comic fair and comic 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.390
 fair that makes the rich laugh like 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.600

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.840
 fair joke a few years ago 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.850
 the king of morocco will meet the pope the 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.700
 encounter between the two men was very 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.209
 balanced and ended in a sharing 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.709
 points 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:23.380
 match hassan 2 jean paul 2 of the committee 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:29.669
 fair but also sustainable comic 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:33.129
 and renewable sustainable and renewable 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.729
 sustainable and renewable 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.779
 and that is to say the repetition comic 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.119
 I have a friend who is comic of 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:44.789
 repetition 

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:47.949

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.949
 of the humanitarian committee of the comic team 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:54.789

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.759
 of comics citizens like this good 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.419
 old Republic joke is that it is 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:08.849
 true how to adapt to the growl 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.849
 question him 16 is he guilty 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:15.939

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:20.399
