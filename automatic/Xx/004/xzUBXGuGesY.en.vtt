00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469

thought to figuring since she lays down
most<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.100> time<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.820> wouldn't<00:00:57.149> really

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
most of the time it wouldn't really

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.150 
most of the time it wouldn't really
matter<00:00:57.510> too<00:00:57.840> much<00:00:57.870> how<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.859> looked

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
matter too much how the back looked

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
matter too much how the back looked
because<00:00:59.399> no<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.760> would<00:00:59.910> see<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.210> Plus<00:01:01.140> babies

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
because no one would see it Plus babies

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
because no one would see it Plus babies

something<00:03:11.319> like<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> fabric

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
something like this this is a fabric

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.819 
something like this this is a fabric
that<00:03:13.299> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.570> bind<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.019> has<00:03:14.200> all<00:03:14.410> sorts<00:03:14.650> of

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.830 
that you can bind it has all sorts of
designs<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.489> are<00:03:15.549> kind<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.060> coordinating

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
designs that are kind of coordinating

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.020 
designs that are kind of coordinating
colors<00:03:17.230> together<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.370> cut<00:03:18.549> it<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.760> cut<00:03:18.880> out

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
colors together and I cut it and cut out

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.360 
colors together and I cut it and cut out
some<00:03:19.060> strips<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:19.959> had<00:03:20.170> liked<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.829> and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
some strips that I had liked of this and

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.710 
some strips that I had liked of this and
when<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:21.519> use<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.030> have<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.360> really

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
when you use this you have to really

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.509 
when you use this you have to really
make<00:03:23.019> sure<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.470> you've<00:03:23.680> preshrunk<00:03:24.160> this

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
make sure that you've preshrunk this

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.759 
make sure that you've preshrunk this
trim<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.630> preshrunk<00:03:26.079> your<00:03:26.350> normal

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
trim and you preshrunk your normal

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.009 
trim and you preshrunk your normal
fabric<00:03:27.190> if<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.430> don't<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.510> put<00:03:28.750> two

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
fabric if you don't and you put two

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.569 
fabric if you don't and you put two
different<00:03:29.170> kinds<00:03:29.680> together<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.280> then<00:03:30.430> this

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
different kinds together and then this

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.340 
different kinds together and then this
shrinks<00:03:31.000> different<00:03:31.360> than<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.570> fabric<00:03:31.930> you're

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
shrinks different than the fabric you're

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.289 
shrinks different than the fabric you're
gonna<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:32.650> kind<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.010> puckering<00:03:33.430> mess<00:03:33.820> you

morning I tried the dress on and I was

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.490 
morning I tried the dress on and I was
really<00:04:19.239> disappointed<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.019> find<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.320> the

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
really disappointed to find that the

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.800 
really disappointed to find that the
dress<00:04:20.709> was<00:04:20.919> about<00:04:21.280> two<00:04:21.459> inches<00:04:21.760> too<00:04:22.000> short<00:04:22.030> so

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
dress was about two inches too short so

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.260 
dress was about two inches too short so
I<00:04:22.840> added<00:04:23.080> two<00:04:23.380> inches<00:04:23.710> fabric<00:04:24.190> here<00:04:24.400> but<00:04:24.940> I

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
I added two inches fabric here but I

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.689 
I added two inches fabric here but I
didn't<00:04:26.110> really<00:04:26.229> feel<00:04:26.470> like<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.949> knew<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.370> should

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
didn't really feel like I knew I should

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.370 
didn't really feel like I knew I should
but<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:27.970> didn't<00:04:28.300> feel<00:04:28.419> like<00:04:28.449> taking<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:28.990> apart

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
but I didn't feel like taking this apart

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.200 
but I didn't feel like taking this apart
and<00:04:29.500> making<00:04:29.770> another<00:04:30.100> apron<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.760> making<00:04:31.060> it

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
and making another apron and making it

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.900 
and making another apron and making it
longer<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.720> was<00:04:32.139> rather<00:04:32.490> exhausted<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:33.880> I

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
longer I was rather exhausted and so I

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.909 
longer I was rather exhausted and so I
just<00:04:34.150> let<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.419> go<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:35.110> think<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.770> probably

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
just let it go as is I think it probably

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.860 
just let it go as is I think it probably
was<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.220> first<00:04:36.340> day<00:04:36.699> of<00:04:36.729> Oktoberfest<00:04:37.270> -<00:04:37.630> so

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
was the first day of Oktoberfest - so

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.469 
was the first day of Oktoberfest - so
there's<00:04:38.050> no<00:04:38.169> time<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.530> mess<00:04:38.710> around<00:04:38.740> okay<00:04:39.479> to

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
there's no time to mess around okay to

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.659 
there's no time to mess around okay to
the<00:04:40.600> apron<00:04:40.960> ties<00:04:41.169> they're<00:04:41.770> each<00:04:41.889> about<00:04:41.919> 14

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
the apron ties they're each about 14

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.210 
the apron ties they're each about 14
inches<00:04:42.699> long<00:04:43.090> on<00:04:43.600> each<00:04:43.870> side<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.949> dress

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
inches long on each side the dress

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.430 
inches long on each side the dress
itself<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.850> entire<00:04:46.270> dress<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.840> about<00:04:47.080> 12

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
itself the entire dress is about 12

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.770 
itself the entire dress is about 12
inches<00:04:47.710> long<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.729> think<00:04:49.000> yeah<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.479> scrips

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
inches long and I think yeah the scrips

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.390 
inches long and I think yeah the scrips
9<00:04:50.080> inches<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.680> really<00:04:50.949> if<00:04:51.039> you're<00:04:51.190> going<00:04:51.340> to

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
9 inches so really if you're going to

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.340 
9 inches so really if you're going to
make<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.580> 9<00:04:51.820> inch<00:04:52.060> skirt<00:04:52.389> then<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:52.960> think<00:04:53.199> your

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
make a 9 inch skirt then I think your

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.050 
make a 9 inch skirt then I think your
apron<00:04:53.740> should<00:04:53.919> be<00:04:54.070> probably<00:04:54.460> eight<00:04:54.699> inches

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
apron should be probably eight inches

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.090 
apron should be probably eight inches
finished<00:04:55.479> or<00:04:55.990> maybe<00:04:56.440> even<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.710> little<00:04:56.830> closer

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
finished or maybe even a little closer

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.250 
finished or maybe even a little closer
to<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.430> length<00:04:57.639> here<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.120> this<00:04:58.810> whole<00:04:58.990> thing

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
to the length here and this whole thing

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.110 
to the length here and this whole thing
was<00:04:59.440> so<00:04:59.650> easy<00:04:59.860> because<00:05:00.039> it's<00:05:00.250> all<00:05:00.430> one<00:05:00.820> piece

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
was so easy because it's all one piece

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.029 
was so easy because it's all one piece
when<00:05:01.690> you<00:05:01.720> throw<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.080> in<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:02.260> wash<00:05:02.440> boom<00:05:02.830> it's

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
when you throw it in the wash boom it's

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.520 
when you throw it in the wash boom it's
all<00:05:03.130> ready<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:03.789> do<00:05:03.970> have<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.270> iron<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.840> even<00:05:05.440> if

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
all ready you do have to iron it even if

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.900 
all ready you do have to iron it even if
you<00:05:05.650> pull<00:05:05.889> it<00:05:05.979> out<00:05:06.070> at<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.280> dryer<00:05:06.490> right<00:05:06.669> away

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
you pull it out at the dryer right away

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.820 
you pull it out at the dryer right away
it<00:05:07.000> just<00:05:07.060> doesn't<00:05:07.570> have<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:07.750> crisp<00:05:08.199> look<00:05:08.530> and

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
it just doesn't have that crisp look and

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.010 
it just doesn't have that crisp look and
I<00:05:09.310> think<00:05:09.340> when<00:05:09.699> you<00:05:09.820> start<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.570> resists

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
I think when you start it it resists

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.409 
I think when you start it it resists
spills<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.979> little<00:05:12.220> bit<00:05:12.340> better<00:05:12.520> -<00:05:12.789> and<00:05:13.240> when<00:05:13.360> it

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
spills a little bit better - and when it

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.150 
spills a little bit better - and when it
comes<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.780> babies<00:05:14.110> there's<00:05:14.320> lots<00:05:14.530> of<00:05:14.680> drooling

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
comes to babies there's lots of drooling

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.640 
comes to babies there's lots of drooling
and<00:05:15.370> things<00:05:16.120> happening<00:05:16.600> that<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:17.080> want<00:05:17.440> when

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
and things happening that you want when

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.620 
and things happening that you want when
every<00:05:17.860> drip<00:05:18.100> resist<00:05:18.789> your<00:05:19.000> spill<00:05:19.360> so<00:05:19.599> I

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
every drip resist your spill so I

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.320 
every drip resist your spill so I
suggest<00:05:20.620> that<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.889> start<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.430> that's<00:05:21.789> a<00:05:21.970> good

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
suggest that you start it that's a good

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.740 
suggest that you start it that's a good
idea<00:05:23.430> well<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.460> recommend<00:05:24.849> if<00:05:25.180> you're<00:05:25.360> making<00:05:25.510> a

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750

have in a little box somewhere you pull
that<00:06:14.830> out<00:06:14.889> and<00:06:15.250> to<00:06:15.729> make<00:06:15.880> a<00:06:15.910> baby<00:06:16.180> dress
