secret is there see I switched if you
see<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> show<00:00:30.359> say<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:31.529> gal<00:00:31.710> since

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
see on the show say that one gal since

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.180 
see on the show say that one gal since
he<00:00:32.460> turns<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.149> right<00:00:34.110> yeah<00:00:34.500> he<00:00:34.950> turns

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
he turns you right right yeah he turns

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880 
he turns you right right yeah he turns
right<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.570> means<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.500> spikes

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
right so that means that the spikes

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400 
right so that means that the spikes
going<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.610> opposite<00:00:39.210> direction<00:00:39.410> creating

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
going in opposite direction creating

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.880 
going in opposite direction creating
more<00:00:40.770> attack<00:00:41.960> when<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> attack<00:00:43.440> power<00:00:43.680> drops

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
more attack when I attack power drops

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
more attack when I attack power drops
basically<00:00:45.050> he<00:00:46.050> spend<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:47.010> way<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:48.450> he

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
basically he spend this way and then he

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.060 
basically he spend this way and then he
spikes<00:00:49.250> go<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> opposite<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.890> but<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
spikes go out in the opposite way but I

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.990 
spikes go out in the opposite way but I
figure<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> same<00:00:54.899> way<00:00:54.930> as

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
figure it out they go the same way as

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.510 
figure it out they go the same way as
the<00:00:57.000> beyblade<00:00:57.629> actually<00:00:58.050> stronger<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.399> can

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the beyblade actually stronger you can

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
the beyblade actually stronger you can
tell<00:00:59.670> if<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> attack<00:01:00.690> type<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
tell if it's going if the attack type is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.950 
tell if it's going if the attack type is
stronger<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.550> goes<00:01:03.090> around<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.629> arena

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
stronger when it goes around the arena

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.929 
stronger when it goes around the arena
faster<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.280> tell<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.610> stronger

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
faster so you can tell if it's stronger

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.109 
faster so you can tell if it's stronger
so<00:01:06.689> let's<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> children<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> makes

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
so let's see the children this makes

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.420 
so let's see the children this makes
coughs<00:01:09.450> space<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.439> fast<00:01:10.650> so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
coughs space is really really fast so

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.090 
coughs space is really really fast so
like<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:15.080> no<00:01:16.080> smeared<00:01:16.409> my<00:01:16.740> sister
