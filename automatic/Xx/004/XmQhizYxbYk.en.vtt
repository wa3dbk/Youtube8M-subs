- Wow, fuck this, I'm out.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.867
- What?
- What?

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:21.288
- That's our thing, don't do that.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.404
- Do you think I could buy some?

00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:23.654
- Just sort of keep this on the down-low

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:25.234

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:15.661
Take that, Zack.

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:19.624
- Hi, Andy, it's good to see
you, you're getting so big.

00:01:19.624 --> 00:01:21.562
- Oh, thanks Dr. Murphy, you too.

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:23.259
Hey, are you just like,
throwing out these cool knives?

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.013
- Oh, oh no, put it back.

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:26.008
- Oh.
- Put it back.

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:28.493
- Okay, okay I'm sorry.

00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:30.542
- Okay, so what are you here for?

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:32.395
Are the bumps back?

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.474
- No, I'm working on this like,

00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:36.708
really exciting energy drink project.

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:37.917
- Oh, good for you.

00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:39.269
- Oh, thanks Dr. Murphy,

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:41.744
but oxycottton is like, super
expensive on the black market

00:01:41.744 --> 00:01:44.062
so can you get me some, like for cheap?

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.575
Like, I need like, 20
big bottles, you know,

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:49.507
with no child-proof tops, write that down.

00:01:49.507 --> 00:01:53.309
- Andy, that's a very
addictive controlled substance.

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:55.427
Are you taking that?

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:56.626
- Only a little.

00:01:56.626 --> 00:01:58.487
I'm mostly selling it.

00:01:58.487 --> 00:02:03.006
Wait, Dr. Murphy, are you
playing hardball with me?

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.800
I'm gonna give you a
cut, you little bitch.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.986
- Stop it.
- Ow.

00:02:05.986 --> 00:02:07.638
- I want you to go, just go.

00:02:07.638 --> 00:02:10.874
- Okay, stop talking
to me like I'm a puppy.

00:02:10.874 --> 00:02:12.562
I'll do it the legit way.

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:16.645
Oh, and the bumps are back
so good job with that.

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:23.115
In conclusion, who drinks energy drinks?

00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:24.234
Tired people.

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:25.484
Who gets tired?

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:27.377
Everybody.

00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:31.412
Quatro Cotton, business opportunity.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.790
It's fucking foolproof as fuck.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.761
I need 10K today or my business
dies, what do you say, mom?

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.165
- So you're dealing drugs now?

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:47.308
- No, no, I'm like,
dealing an energy drink

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:49.211
with a drug in it, it's very different.

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.991
- Oh my god, it's a great idea.

00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.273
- I can tell that you don't
think it's a great idea.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.490
- [Caroline] Well I do.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.880
- Fuck you, Caroline.
- Fuck you.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.153
- Like, why don't you go to your room

00:02:57.153 --> 00:02:58.262
and go fuck yourself.
- No, I'm doing something.

00:02:58.262 --> 00:02:59.446
No, I don't wanna fuck--
- stop it.

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.140
- Mom, she's like, fucking my best friend

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.098
and it's like, torn us apart.

00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:05.369
- Oh my god, you are not.

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.416
- What?

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:08.700
- Oh, you go, girl.
- Thanks, mom.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.247
- That's pretty amazeballs.

00:03:10.247 --> 00:03:13.948
- Stop, oh god, sluts stop,
you're derailing my moment.

00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:14.869
Mom, please like, look,

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.758
I tried to like, source the
oxycotton from Dr. Murphy

00:03:17.758 --> 00:03:19.560
but you know how like, old women are,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.193
they're just like "no, it's illegal".

00:03:22.193 --> 00:03:24.990
- Anderson, I am not
investing in your drug drink.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.291
- Please, I made you a fucking poster.

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:28.124
- No.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.650
(all argue)

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.332
- Oh my god, Zack, thank
god, something good today,

00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:33.450
I forgive you, okay.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.979
- Dude, I'm not here to talk to you.

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.525
- What?

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:37.358
- My love.

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.055
I suck at this but I wanna be the fly

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.616

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:47.116
Will you marry me?

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:49.328
- Oh my god, no.

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:52.002
- What?

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:54.452
- Zack, I haven't seen you in like, a week

00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:57.392
and I text you pictures
of other dudes' dicks.

00:03:57.392 --> 00:03:58.972
We're broken up.

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.376
- Wait, what?

00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:03.761
- Honey, remind me, is this
tattoo penis or long balls?

00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:05.519
- No, this is the one
that cries when he cums.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.564
- Right.

00:04:06.564 --> 00:04:07.787
(retches)

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:08.870
- Oh, ew, ew, ew.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.056

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:13.167
Zack, Zack, dude, it's okay, Zack.

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:14.601
Oh, fuck.

00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:17.341
Oh my god, why, why the

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:19.758
Oh god, it's okay, it's okay.

00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:24.365

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:27.229
There's nothing left,
get back, give him space,

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.896
give him some space.

00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:32.592
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:36.006
- You are such a little bitch.

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:37.296
- Are you fucking happy?

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:38.919
Are you fucking happy?

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.021
