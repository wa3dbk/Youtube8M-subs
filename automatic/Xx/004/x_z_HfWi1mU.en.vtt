roll of fabric that is two and a half

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.769 
roll of fabric that is two and a half
inches<00:00:15.900> wide<00:00:16.160> with<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.430> entire<00:00:17.910> line<00:00:17.940> of

fabric<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.220> if<00:00:20.400> there's<00:00:20.670> 40<00:00:21.270> pieces<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.960> fabric

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
fabric so if there's 40 pieces of fabric

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.540 
fabric so if there's 40 pieces of fabric
in<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.010> lineup

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
in that lineup

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.849 
in that lineup
they'll<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:24.000> 40<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.570> here<00:00:24.869> if<00:00:25.050> there's<00:00:25.289> 20

they'll be 40 in here if there's 20
they'll<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.310> 20<00:00:26.900> sometimes

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
they'll be 20 sometimes

they'll be 20 sometimes
the<00:00:28.380> companies<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:29.010> double<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.730> them<00:00:29.970> if

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the companies will double up on them if

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.479 
the companies will double up on them if
they<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.990> smaller<00:00:31.380> amount<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:32.189> their

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
they have a smaller amount in their

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.139 
they have a smaller amount in their
fabric<00:00:32.969> lineup<00:00:33.469> however<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:35.940> your

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
fabric lineup however you can make your

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.110 
fabric lineup however you can make your
own<00:00:36.329> jelly<00:00:36.660> rolls<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.350> keep<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.920> handy<00:00:38.430> for

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
own jelly rolls and keep them handy for

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.069 
own jelly rolls and keep them handy for
projects<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.300> what<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> did<00:00:42.780> is

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
projects like this one what I did is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.360 
projects like this one what I did is
whenever<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.190> finish<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.000> project<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.559> take

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
whenever I finish a project I just take

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.880 
whenever I finish a project I just take
whatever<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.000> leftover<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.989> cut<00:00:49.350> them<00:00:49.530> into

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
whatever is leftover and I cut them into

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.189 
whatever is leftover and I cut them into
two<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> half<00:00:50.550> inch<00:00:50.820> strips<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:52.020> take

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
two and a half inch strips I just take

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.020 
two and a half inch strips I just take
my<00:00:52.379> rotary<00:00:52.710> cutter<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.610> finish

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
my rotary cutter and I just finish

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.209 
my rotary cutter and I just finish
cutting<00:00:54.480> them<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.930> at<00:00:55.289> two<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> half<00:00:55.949> inch

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
cutting them all at two and a half inch

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.619 
cutting them all at two and a half inch
strips<00:00:56.899> then<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.230> keep<00:00:58.949> them<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.820> piles<00:01:00.210> so

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
strips then I keep them all in piles so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.280 
strips then I keep them all in piles so
I<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> light<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.590> medium<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.520> dark<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.290> I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
I have a light a medium and a dark and I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.130 
I have a light a medium and a dark and I
just<00:01:04.589> keep<00:01:04.739> accumulating<00:01:05.580> them<00:01:05.790> until<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> have

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
just keep accumulating them until I have

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.530 
just keep accumulating them until I have
enough<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> project<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.549> every<00:01:09.210> once<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
enough to do a project and every once in

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
enough to do a project and every once in
a<00:01:09.630> while<00:01:09.659> I'll<00:01:10.049> purge<00:01:10.320> through<00:01:10.650> my<00:01:10.799> fabric<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
a while I'll purge through my fabric and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.060 
a while I'll purge through my fabric and
take<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> fabric<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.840> thought<00:01:13.229> why<00:01:13.740> did

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
take that fabric that I thought why did

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
take that fabric that I thought why did
I<00:01:14.189> buy<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.119> thinking

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
I buy it what was I thinking

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.980 
I buy it what was I thinking
I<00:01:15.720> obviously<00:01:16.290> liked<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> time<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
I obviously liked it at the time so I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.859 
I obviously liked it at the time so I
cut<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> entire<00:01:20.159> piece<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.939> into<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
cut the entire piece up into two and a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.710 
cut the entire piece up into two and a
half<00:01:22.110> inch<00:01:22.350> strips<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.640> unlike<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> jelly<00:01:24.570> roll

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
half inch strips so unlike a jelly roll

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.160 
half inch strips so unlike a jelly roll
where<00:01:25.259> I'll<00:01:25.380> only<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.640> fabric<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.960> each

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
where I'll only have one fabric and each

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.789 
where I'll only have one fabric and each
roll

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
roll

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.749 
roll
I<00:01:28.829> might<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.850> 10<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.450> more<00:01:30.890> but<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:32.460> fine

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I might have 10 or more but that's fine

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
I might have 10 or more but that's fine
because<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.720> still<00:01:33.930> use<00:01:34.170> them<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.619> binding

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
because I can still use them for binding

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.060 
because I can still use them for binding
and<00:01:35.549> many<00:01:36.030> other<00:01:36.299> projects<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.590> having<00:01:37.950> them

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and many other projects but having them

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.600 
and many other projects but having them
already<00:01:38.430> pre-cut<00:01:39.200> it's<00:01:40.200> very<00:01:40.470> easy<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.009> grab<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
already pre-cut it's very easy to grab a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.830 
already pre-cut it's very easy to grab a
pattern<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.799> make<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.720> remember<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
pattern and make it just remember to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.020 
pattern and make it just remember to
keep<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.259> stacks<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.890> tow<00:01:47.040> medium<00:01:47.490> light<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
keep your stacks in tow medium light and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.539 
keep your stacks in tow medium light and
dark<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.930> any<00:01:49.229> time<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.100> grab<00:01:50.340> that
