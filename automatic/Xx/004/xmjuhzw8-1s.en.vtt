00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.250 
very firm dough and it's gonna resemble
almost<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.390> playdough<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.870> gonna<00:00:45.990> be<00:00:46.110> very

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's actually gonna be quite hard to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's actually gonna be quite hard to
stir<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.400> I<00:00:50.430> recommend<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.060> stir<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.620> with<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
stir so I recommend you stir it with the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.710 
stir so I recommend you stir it with the
spoon<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.310> then<00:00:53.580> just<00:00:53.970> get<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.480> there<00:00:54.600> with

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
spoon and then just get in there with

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.170 
spoon and then just get in there with
your<00:00:54.840> hands<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.410> mix<00:00:56.220> it<00:00:56.400> around<00:00:56.490> until

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
your hands and then mix it around until

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.230 
your hands and then mix it around until
all<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> cake<00:00:57.930> mix<00:00:58.200> is<00:00:59.240> uniformly

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
all the cake mix is uniformly

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.750 
all the cake mix is uniformly
incorporated<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.110> you<00:01:01.650> get<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:01.890> nice<00:01:02.100> smooth

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.630 
incorporated and you get a nice smooth
chocolate<00:01:03.510> colored<00:01:04.350> dough<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.339> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
chocolate colored dough just like this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and then let it sit for about 20 minutes

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.470 
and then let it sit for about 20 minutes
to<00:01:08.270> rest<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:10.200> take<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.220> small<00:01:11.580> marble

powdered sugar also called icing sugar

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.860 
powdered sugar also called icing sugar
and<00:03:04.850> just<00:03:05.850> blend<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.180> together

and just blend this together

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.610 
and just blend this together
a<00:03:08.390> little<00:03:09.390> bit<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.930> try<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.110> break<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.470> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
a little bit just to try to break up the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.870 
a little bit just to try to break up the
shortening<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.160> combine<00:03:11.520> them<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
shortening and combine them with the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.400 
shortening and combine them with the
sugar<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.209> little<00:03:12.540> bit<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:12.900> going<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.110> be<00:03:13.200> hard

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
sugar a little bit it's going to be hard

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.380 
sugar a little bit it's going to be hard
to<00:03:13.530> do<00:03:13.650> because<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.010> very<00:03:14.190> dry<00:03:14.520> then<00:03:15.239> you're

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
to do because it's very dry then you're

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.590 
to do because it's very dry then you're
gonna<00:03:15.540> add<00:03:15.750> your<00:03:16.080> gelatin<00:03:16.880> mixture<00:03:17.880> now<00:03:18.510> I'm

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
gonna add your gelatin mixture now I'm

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.030 
gonna add your gelatin mixture now I'm
only<00:03:18.810> gonna<00:03:18.989> add<00:03:19.140> half<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.739> because<00:03:19.920> I'm

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
only gonna add half of this because I'm

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.220 
only gonna add half of this because I'm
making<00:03:20.340> half<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.700> recipe<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.750> I'm<00:03:21.870> putting

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
making half a recipe so I'm putting

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.000 
making half a recipe so I'm putting
about<00:03:22.440> an<00:03:23.010> eighth<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.730> cup<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:25.010> gelatin

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
about an eighth of a cup of the gelatin

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.280 
about an eighth of a cup of the gelatin
water<00:03:26.340> mixture<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.049> need<00:03:31.170> only

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
water mixture so you really need only

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.170 
water mixture so you really need only
need<00:03:31.560> half<00:03:31.590> an<00:03:32.070> envelope<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.760> powder<00:03:32.970> at

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
need half an envelope of that powder at

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.400 
need half an envelope of that powder at
the<00:03:33.269> beginning<00:03:33.660> but<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.840> just<00:03:34.049> thought<00:03:34.260> it'd<00:03:34.380> be

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
the beginning but I just thought it'd be

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.020 
the beginning but I just thought it'd be
too<00:03:34.620> hard<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.890> split<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.610> half<00:03:35.640> at<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
too hard to split that in half at the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030 
too hard to split that in half at the
beginning<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.600> I'm<00:03:37.110> just<00:03:37.350> gonna<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.830> just

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
beginning so I'm just gonna I just

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.000 
beginning so I'm just gonna I just
measured<00:03:38.190> half<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.760> here<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.260> then<00:03:40.260> blend

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
measured half of it here and then blend

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.110 
measured half of it here and then blend
that<00:03:41.100> together<00:03:41.400> until<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.540> get<00:03:42.780> some<00:03:43.560> icing

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
that together until you get some icing

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.090 
that together until you get some icing
it's<00:03:45.120> gonna<00:03:45.299> be<00:03:45.480> stiff<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.040> depending<00:03:47.040> on

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
it's gonna be stiff and depending on

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.229 
it's gonna be stiff and depending on
your<00:03:47.220> mixer<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.640> might<00:03:47.760> have<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.910> hard<00:03:48.090> time

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
your mixer it might have a hard time

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.509 
your mixer it might have a hard time
with<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.600> know<00:03:48.750> mine<00:03:48.930> did<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:52.400> there<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
with that I know mine did and there it

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.420 
with that I know mine did and there it
is<00:03:53.989> it's<00:03:54.989> got<00:03:55.170> almost<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.680> marshmallow<00:03:56.130> like

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
is it's got almost a marshmallow like

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.180 
is it's got almost a marshmallow like
texture<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.269> tastes<00:03:57.930> just<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.440> Oreo

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
texture to it it tastes just like Oreo

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.670 
texture to it it tastes just like Oreo

cookies<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.760> you're<00:04:03.630> gonna<00:04:03.750> put<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> little

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
cookies and you're gonna put a little

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.890 
cookies and you're gonna put a little
bit<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.380> filling<00:04:04.650> on<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.540> bottom<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.660> the

bit of filling on the bottom of the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.890 
bit of filling on the bottom of the
cookie<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:09.900> take<00:04:10.140> another<00:04:10.260> cookie<00:04:11.040> and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
place it bottom side down so that you

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.430 
place it bottom side down so that you

like<00:04:45.150> Oreos<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.350> texture<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.920> little<00:04:47.220> bit

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
like Oreos the texture is a little bit

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.160 
like Oreos the texture is a little bit
different<00:04:47.820> than<00:04:48.120> an<00:04:48.270> Oreo<00:04:48.510> cookie<00:04:48.540> of<00:04:48.900> course

different than an Oreo cookie of course

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.260 
different than an Oreo cookie of course
because<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.860> cookies<00:04:50.160> are<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.310> bit<00:04:50.430> softer<00:04:50.790> but

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
because the cookies are a bit softer but

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.230 
because the cookies are a bit softer but
it's<00:04:51.420> a<00:04:51.480> really<00:04:51.690> good<00:04:51.900> cookie
