00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.620
 differences are the main ones competing 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.200

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.620

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.900
 kolke inventory fully equipped 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.360

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.470
 they played more mischievous together 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.390
 skater struggling with time with themselves 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.260
 ourselves and we still have the first place 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.880
 the first 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.310

 federation shot track in seaside 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.850
 land 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.560
 this sport is over three years old and 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.270
 for its further development and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.000
 young people are invited to popularize 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.800
 specialists other than Vladivostok 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.720
 short track is actively developing in large 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.000
 stone and all risks and cavalier 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.310
 this species despite its youth became 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.380
 basic in the region of Vladivostok into groups 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.450
 on short track take children from four 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.440
 five years old even if the child cannot 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.960
 influence skating 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.900
 this is not a problem short track evolve 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.760
 A lot of quality and all 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.430
 game sports we go through and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.620
 basketball and volleyball and football in the hall we 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.110
 constantly in it all plays a common 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.150
 child development will stand confidently 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.120
 on contact and on any hockey and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.010
 curly 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.040
 speed skating ie it will be on the knives 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.840
 stand confidently on all skates and overall 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.160
 development for the child will be enough 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.660
 good will be fully coordinated 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.960
 good pixel endurance 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.580
 kicking strong 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.040
 undoubtedly helps the development of short track 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.900
 in the seaside and the proximity of Asia where this species 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.540
 Sports is now at the highest 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.100
 level and connection is well used then 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.870
 there is and use it now 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.510
 used leave to collect 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.310
 they will be like that 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.790
 private which give more 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.200
 time to ride specialists 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.780
 Asian athletes how would they 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.610
 leaders are not allowed to be dumped from 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.610
 accounts still to be given 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.170
 run away 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.570
 many guys for this workout 1 but they 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.670
 already managed to learn the rules of shot shot 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.890
 not completely obey the instructions of the coach 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:10.460
 as in any sport the initial steps 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:13.040
 the most difficult for training are watching 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.440
 many parents write the only one 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.690
 the grid went to the track in the city asked 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.040
 the children themselves but with our child visiting okay 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.260
 they loved this sport and 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.350
 feedback i deal with some like us 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.280
 I never advised to skate goals 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.200
 familiar give the child a short track 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.680
 we came to the first workout led 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.750
 you liked the youngest child 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.440
 came older child followed decided 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.960
 stay both go with pleasure 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.230
 we are engaged in a total of one month 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.340
 two younger ones here have the results of that 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.780
 very good because we are crazy 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.570
 could not ride at all and the relay stood at 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.760
 older senior getting a lot 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.550
 here we are in the seaside region kids 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.710
 had to figure skating there 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.540
 sportsmen who came 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.169
 and we are also here they are present 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.990
 what is the normal situation because 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.810
 on skates put a sense of ownership skate 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.169
 slightly repurposed and calm 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.630
 ride and reach very good 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.560
 the results here are almost surely 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.720
 except cavalier 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.169
 in every city there are with dota top was on 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.900
 figure skating someone started what well 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.550
 what 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.180
 each layer of figure skating is very 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.860
 young sport if you start 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.320
 children show the result of about years 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.840
 ten nine ten years old they only 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.090
 reach the level of competing 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.680
 athletes 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.430
 some other sports in 910 this 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.440
 may already be old enough 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.440
 athlete therefore nothing in this 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.750
 no trouble and many come try 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.800
 like we never skated and 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.259
 she did not try 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:05.220
 you produce buzzards and not once for 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:06.780
 months are starting to go well one of 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.120
 main components of the short track 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.220
 special equipment skates helmet and 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.560
 overalls can buy sports 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.930
 stores but if there is no such possibility 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.639
 all necessary will be given at training 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.280
 There are shops that sell 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.770
 outfit which I think is not too 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.120
 expensive and for the initial form of the nakba 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.169
 fits of course when your kids 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.499
 become if 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.509
 need more professional inventory and 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:33.419
 it is already ordered through the CIS countries 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.279
 either through Moscow and Peter classes in 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.860
 short track sections are held in 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:40.499
 morning and evening shifts and a set of children 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.930
 being conducted on an ongoing basis not trainers 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:44.819
 doubt very soon in the seaside 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.219
 There will be candidates for the master of sports 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.810
 now our athletes are preparing for 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:51.749
 zonal championship of Russia among 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.319
 younger age but today is 

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:55.289
 this 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:58.259
 ride speed competition 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.740
 I will leave for the second time in Russia 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.099
 Omsk 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.680
 I dream to perform adult discharge 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:06.240
 indoor skating rinks now exist because 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.240
 it's even easier to develop 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.710
 as well as figure skating with 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.270
 speed skater yes it's harder then on the cube 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.460
 large area should be 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.379
 and here also by gay guna riding 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.439
 combine shooter on the same site 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:20.849
 very harmoniously fit in it 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.520
 much faster you can reach 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.199
 the results of discharges trips identity prizes 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.449
 choke other sports 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.280
 short track is basic kurt seaside 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:31.650
 land and despite the fact that he was 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.020
 Mom early development can 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.600
 in a few years we will learn about the stars 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.380
 short track from the seaside you watched 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.070
 around sports 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.070
 see you soon
