00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.189
 I'm sitting on my right outside 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.309
 best rammler would like you here in 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.440
 my own garden to show 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.759
 he is doing extremely well with that too 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.619
 what a cool kid after the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.960
 Now is how her cards helped play 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.750
 Therefore we want to be under customers 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.760
 now show what moves people to do so 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.980
 To say if the world is taking the game 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.470
 again as with the cards mix in that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.559
 in the second part of our course and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.260
 do not keep it in the same position 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.620
 on the corner but on the flat 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.239
 knew here is the thumb 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 and now the little finger is too 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.649
 exactly parallel to the so diagonal 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.129
 parallel to the thumb because of this 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.039
 location 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.710
 the game has a certain tension that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.899
 Looks like you see that when 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.109
 we would keep it here would be the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.960
 Do not fold here if you like the game 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.590
 So put under tension 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.590
 in this form here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.000
 and a bit of your finger opens 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.900
 depends on the map of your thumb 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.770
 depart 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.619
 she flies in such a bow, that is to say 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.690
 her presses the tension on that 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.909
 card game and starts slowly at the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.149
 to open hand during sprints and 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.710
 the cards will begin by too 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.350
 slip list more pressed and so far 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.170
 the first card has fallen is you catching 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.520
 slowly open on your hand so 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.149
 the other cards also follow 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.649
 can okay 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.539
 you still have a left hand we 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.580
 have noticed and that is very 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.080
 important what does this because you can 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.420
 not easy with the flat hand up 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.610
 the cards are waiting because then it can 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.360
 happen that the cards everywhere where 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.610
 fly through 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.190
 that means you hold your hand lightly 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.320
 you are wrapped and the little finger is 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.830
 the most important thing is to go up 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.740
 demonstrate 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.899
 because what happens when the cards are there 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.690
 land 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.649
 the small number of little fingers 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.060
 prevents the cards on the floor 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.079
 fall 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.750
 so dear people thank you very much 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.989
