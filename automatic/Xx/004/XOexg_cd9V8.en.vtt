00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
aluminum and some rivets and that's it I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
aluminum and some rivets and that's it I
don't<00:01:53.759> care<00:01:55.399> it's<00:01:56.399> got<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> straight<00:01:57.090> six

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that's old oh I think it's probably the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.539 
that's old oh I think it's probably the
original<00:02:01.040> name<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.100> know<00:02:02.219> where<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> hood

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
original name I know where the hood

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.389 
original name I know where the hood
latches<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.680> that'll<00:02:04.680> stay<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.040> there<00:02:05.219> until

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
latches and that'll stay in there until

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.429 
latches and that'll stay in there until
I<00:02:05.579> stomp<00:02:06.180> my<00:02:06.270> feet<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.600> cry<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.200> get

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
I stomp my feet and cry and get

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.290 
I stomp my feet and cry and get
something<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.069> faster<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.000> like

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
something a little faster because I like

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.460 
something a little faster because I like
to<00:02:09.390> drive<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.599> little<00:02:09.720> faster<00:02:09.899> than<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:22.600 

how<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.550> oh<00:02:13.580> here<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:22.400> think

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
how do you oh here it is so we think

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.660 
how do you oh here it is so we think
it's<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.060> 235<00:02:23.720> straight<00:02:24.470> six<00:02:26.950> basic<00:02:27.950> old<00:02:28.190> Chevy

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
it's a 235 straight six basic old Chevy

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.690 
it's a 235 straight six basic old Chevy
motor<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.300> not<00:02:29.930> too<00:02:30.110> complicated<00:02:30.550> we<00:02:31.550> are

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
motor it's not too complicated we are

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.040 
motor it's not too complicated we are
considering<00:02:32.180> putting<00:02:32.360> an<00:02:32.630> MSD<00:02:33.020> distributor

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
considering putting an MSD distributor

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.860 
considering putting an MSD distributor
in<00:02:33.740> just<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.460> starting<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.030> easier<00:02:35.420> and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
in just so the starting is easier and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.620 
in just so the starting is easier and
smoother<00:02:36.700> we're<00:02:37.700> also<00:02:37.850> considering<00:02:38.300> putting

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
smoother we're also considering putting

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.360 
smoother we're also considering putting
a<00:02:38.690> bicycle<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.440> back<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.950> truck<00:02:40.160> in

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
a bicycle on the back of the truck in

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.090 
a bicycle on the back of the truck in
case<00:02:40.550> I<00:02:40.700> just<00:02:40.970> can't<00:02:41.150> get<00:02:41.300> home<00:02:41.710> but<00:02:42.710> as<00:02:42.890> long

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
case I just can't get home but as long

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.920 
case I just can't get home but as long
as<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.370> safe<00:02:43.550> that's<00:02:43.970> kind<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.420> goal<00:02:44.570> so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
as it's safe that's kind of the goal so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.710 
as it's safe that's kind of the goal so
right<00:02:45.320> now<00:02:45.500> all<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.250> lights<00:02:46.459> work

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
right now all the lights work

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.260 
right now all the lights work
it<00:02:47.930> runs<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.680> gotta<00:02:48.920> figure<00:02:49.340> out<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.820> three<00:02:50.120> on

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
it runs I gotta figure out that three on

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.930 
it runs I gotta figure out that three on
the<00:02:50.360> tree<00:02:50.600> thing<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.470> can<00:02:52.130> drive<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> stick-shift

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
the tree thing I can drive a stick-shift

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.390 
the tree thing I can drive a stick-shift
great<00:02:53.330> into<00:02:53.870> great<00:02:54.230> burnouts<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.130> don't

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
great into great burnouts but I don't

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.800 
great into great burnouts but I don't
know<00:02:55.459> about<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:55.760> three<00:02:56.240> on<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.450> tree<00:02:56.660> thing

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
know about this three on the tree thing

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.930 
know about this three on the tree thing
and<00:02:57.530> then<00:02:57.770> I'm<00:02:58.100> learning<00:02:58.459> how<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.580> do<00:02:58.760> some

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
and then I'm learning how to do some

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.280 
and then I'm learning how to do some
kind<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.180> tap-dance<00:02:59.690> because<00:03:00.080> there's

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
kind of tap-dance because there's

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.730 
kind of tap-dance because there's
actually<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.950> starter<00:03:01.520> button<00:03:02.510> next<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.560> the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
actually a starter button next to the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.430 
actually a starter button next to the
gas<00:03:03.920> pedal<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.510> gotta<00:03:05.690> gotta<00:03:05.870> hit<00:03:06.230> that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
gas pedal and you gotta gotta hit that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.180 
gas pedal and you gotta gotta hit that
with<00:03:06.709> this<00:03:06.950> tow<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.300> then<00:03:08.870> pump<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.680> gas<00:03:09.830> with

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
with this tow and then pump the gas with

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.070 
with this tow and then pump the gas with
your<00:03:10.400> heel<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.180> feel<00:03:11.390> like<00:03:11.600> an<00:03:11.750> itch<00:03:11.870> and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
your heel and I feel like an itch and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.230 
your heel and I feel like an itch and
dog<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.709> don't<00:03:13.070> know<00:03:13.190> but<00:03:13.520> it's<00:03:13.730> working<00:03:14.120> it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
dog I don't know but it's working it

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.880 
dog I don't know but it's working it
starts

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.550 

joke<00:03:20.520> helps

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.330 

so<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.790> think<00:03:28.300> we<00:03:28.780> might<00:03:28.990> do<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.740> 12<00:03:30.130> volt

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
so I think we might do the 12 volt

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.780 
so I think we might do the 12 volt
conversion<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.950> just<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.220> know<00:03:33.310> maybe<00:03:33.520> some

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
conversion and just you know maybe some

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.730 
conversion and just you know maybe some
new<00:03:33.910> tires<00:03:34.150> because<00:03:34.600> these<00:03:35.290> aren't<00:03:35.560> holding

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
new tires because these aren't holding

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.760 
new tires because these aren't holding
any<00:03:36.010> air<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:37.630> want<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.959> get<00:03:38.050> them<00:03:38.200> caps<00:03:38.470> on

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
any air and I want to get them caps on

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.840 
any air and I want to get them caps on
the<00:03:38.920> front<00:03:39.190> because<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.370> think<00:03:39.430> those<00:03:39.670> look

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
the front because I think those look

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.180 
the front because I think those look
cool<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.390> basically<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:41.200> just<00:03:41.350> get<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.010> run

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
cool but basically it's just get it run

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.920 
cool but basically it's just get it run
and<00:03:42.340> get<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.550> drive<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.060> make<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.450> safe<00:03:43.690> and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
and get it drive and make it safe and
