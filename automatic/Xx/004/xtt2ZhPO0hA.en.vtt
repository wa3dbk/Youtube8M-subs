00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
website at this given time by now not so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
website at this given time by now not so
much<00:00:53.489> traffic<00:00:53.699> hopefully<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.660> video

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
much traffic hopefully up to this video

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.099 
much traffic hopefully up to this video
a<00:00:55.020> bit<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.180> anyhow<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.449> how<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> achieve

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
a bit more and anyhow so how to achieve

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.810 
a bit more and anyhow so how to achieve
the<00:00:58.559> afloat<00:00:59.070> function<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.530> unfortunately<00:01:01.530> not

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
the afloat function is unfortunately not

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
the afloat function is unfortunately not
native<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.480> max<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.049> what<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> need<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> do

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
native to the max so what you need to do

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.120 
native to the max so what you need to do
is<00:01:04.890> download<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:06.200> little<00:01:07.200> web<00:01:07.380> application

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
is download a little web application

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
is download a little web application
called<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.850> float<00:01:10.790> it's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> free<00:01:12.060> download<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
called a float it's a free download and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.950 
called a float it's a free download and
I<00:01:13.640> think<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.820> might<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.150> trial<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.840> I've

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
I think there might be a trial but I've

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
I think there might be a trial but I've
been<00:01:16.110> using<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.530> years<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.400> I'm<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.939> think

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
been using it for years so I'm I think

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
been using it for years so I'm I think
the<00:01:18.509> trial<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> more<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> want<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the trial is more of a if you want to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.730 
the trial is more of a if you want to
upgrade<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> higher<00:01:20.970> version<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
upgrade to a higher version and the the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.560 
upgrade to a higher version and the the
free<00:01:23.009> version<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.490> absolutely<00:01:24.000> fine<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.540> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
free version is absolutely fine as I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
free version is absolutely fine as I
said<00:01:24.869> we've<00:01:25.350> been<00:01:25.380> using<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:25.920> years<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
said we've been using it for years and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
said we've been using it for years and
it's<00:01:26.549> great<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.080> once<00:01:28.229> you've<00:01:28.350> downloaded

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it's great and so once you've downloaded

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.520 
it's great and so once you've downloaded
it<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> simple<00:01:30.060> double<00:01:30.390> click<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.500> drag

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
it and simple double click and then drag

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
it and simple double click and then drag

it into the Applications folder what

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
it into the Applications folder what
will<00:01:34.079> happen<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.950> will<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> new

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
will happen is you will have a new

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.020 
will happen is you will have a new
feature<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.990> certain<00:01:37.680> applications<00:01:38.670> and

I don't see this option and it might be

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.310 
I don't see this option and it might be
developed<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> future<00:01:48.930> there<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.259> be

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
developed in the future there might be

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.870 
developed in the future there might be
an<00:01:49.500> extension<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.159> haven't<00:01:50.399> worked<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
an extension but I haven't worked this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.929 
an extension but I haven't worked this

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
we can do is we can go to adjust effects

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.409 
we can do is we can go to adjust effects
and<00:03:15.409> say<00:03:15.919> that<00:03:16.220> we<00:03:16.370> want<00:03:16.609> to<00:03:16.760> make<00:03:16.939> it<00:03:17.180> for

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
and say that we want to make it for

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.979 
and say that we want to make it for
example<00:03:17.870> make<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:18.169> visible<00:03:18.409> and<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:20.359> while

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
we're working with it so now what

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.599 
we're working with it so now what
happens<00:03:23.449> is<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:24.109> stays<00:03:24.379> ok<00:03:24.859> it<00:03:25.069> stays<00:03:25.340> trans

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
happens is it stays ok it stays trans

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.089 
happens is it stays ok it stays trans
