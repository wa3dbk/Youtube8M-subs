00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.960 
bring over again and you do the same
process<00:02:19.359> we<00:02:20.359> keep<00:02:20.629> following<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.349> through

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
process we keep following it through

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.589 
process we keep following it through
just<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:26.060> then<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.329> keep<00:02:26.569> doing

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
just like that and then you keep doing

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.360 
just like that and then you keep doing
that<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.459> as<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.700> see<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.650> have<00:02:30.680> starts

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that and as you can see you have starts

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.080 
that and as you can see you have starts
to<00:02:31.489> show<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> pattern<00:02:32.329> of<00:02:32.709> plats<00:02:36.849> i've<00:02:37.849> got

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
to show a pattern of plats i've got

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.670 
to show a pattern of plats i've got
these<00:02:38.239> parts<00:02:38.569> coming<00:02:39.019> loose<00:02:41.500> sometimes<00:02:42.500> it

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
these parts coming loose sometimes it

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.220 
these parts coming loose sometimes it
doesn't<00:02:42.829> work<00:02:43.160> don't<00:02:43.459> worry<00:02:43.810> sometimes<00:02:44.810> it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
doesn't work don't worry sometimes it

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.460 
doesn't work don't worry sometimes it
does<00:02:45.410> go<00:02:45.590> all<00:02:45.739> messed<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.220> like<00:02:46.489> are<00:02:46.700> done<00:02:46.970> here

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
does go all messed it like are done here

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.190 
does go all messed it like are done here
so<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.530> just<00:02:48.769> try<00:02:49.069> again<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:50.599> problem<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.019> is

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
so you just try again the problem is is

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.370 
so you just try again the problem is is
with<00:02:51.349> my<00:02:51.500> hair<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:53.000> isn't<00:02:53.299> very<00:02:53.510> long<00:02:53.930> so

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
with my hair is it isn't very long so

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.039 
with my hair is it isn't very long so
sometimes<00:02:54.859> it<00:02:55.069> protests<00:02:55.989> too<00:02:57.310> little<00:02:58.310> strands

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
sometimes it protests too little strands

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.190 
sometimes it protests too little strands
so<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.139> keep<00:03:00.349> doing<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.959> do<00:03:03.079> it

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
so you keep doing this you can do it

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.670 
so you keep doing this you can do it
very<00:03:03.410> slow<00:03:03.739> if<00:03:03.799> you'd<00:03:04.069> like<00:03:04.280> very<00:03:05.000> fast

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
very slow if you'd like very fast

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.349 
very slow if you'd like very fast
