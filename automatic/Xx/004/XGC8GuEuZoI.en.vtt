 880 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:22.030
 This is a little bit thicker than I am. 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.990
 It also has some pretty large body size 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.830
 I should say that you have a taste for your hands.

 That's because the person who originally played the electric guitar played some other guitar 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:02.409
 Whether the moment now comes to me as a buff stick or my father at home 30 years 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.520
 I do not have a lot of models with the guitars I used before.
