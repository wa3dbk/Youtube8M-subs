00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.060 
so don't skip those too often either
okay<00:01:08.790> nope<00:01:09.150> okay<00:01:09.570> right<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:09.780> back<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.890> full

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
okay nope okay right so back to the full

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
okay nope okay right so back to the full
moon<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.340> Capricorn<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.869> degrees<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
moon in Capricorn that two degrees of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
moon in Capricorn that two degrees of
the<00:01:14.159> sign<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.580> capricorn<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.360> really

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the sign of capricorn so that's really

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
the sign of capricorn so that's really
early<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.200> sign<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.070> means<00:01:17.250> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
early in the sign so that means it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.120 
early in the sign so that means it's
pure<00:01:17.759> Capricorn<00:01:18.420> energy<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:20.100> charge

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
pure Capricorn energy it is in charge

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.940 
pure Capricorn energy it is in charge
Saturn's<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.180> charge<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.570> part<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
Saturn's in charge of that part of the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.399 
Saturn's in charge of that part of the
zodiac<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.659> look<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.229> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
zodiac and so what we look at with this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
hanging on too tightly to something that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.430 
hanging on too tightly to something that
you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.920> easily<00:02:41.340> release<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.480> let<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.690> go<00:02:42.960> all
