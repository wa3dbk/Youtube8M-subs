the first case I ever got was this case

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.689 
the first case I ever got was this case
and<00:00:42.879> it<00:00:42.969> was<00:00:43.090> just<00:00:43.270> originally<00:00:43.899> clear<00:00:44.260> I<00:00:44.699> added

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
on the studs and stuff so yeah it was

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.079 
on the studs and stuff so yeah it was
just<00:00:50.769> a<00:00:51.039> clear<00:00:52.030> case<00:00:52.239> Witek<00:00:53.160> bumper<00:00:54.160> on<00:00:55.149> it<00:00:55.859> and

so that is just my phone in the case and
it's<00:01:04.540> pretty<00:01:04.780> basic<00:01:04.989> I<00:01:05.379> guess<00:01:05.910> so<00:01:06.910> yeah<00:01:07.090> okay

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780
