solution so what I'm hoping to be able

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.990 
solution so what I'm hoping to be able
to<00:00:59.380> do<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.860> move<00:01:00.580> that<00:01:00.640> up<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:03.760> or

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
to do is move that up to the right or

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.390 
to do is move that up to the right or
left<00:01:04.560> buttons<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.710> are<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:05.890> top<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.160> the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
left buttons that are on top of the

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.650 
left buttons that are on top of the
controller's<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:06.940> can<00:01:07.060> see<00:01:07.180> right<00:01:07.210> here<00:01:07.510> you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
controller's you can see right here you

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.970 
controller's you can see right here you
do<00:01:07.780> get<00:01:07.960> an<00:01:08.050> extra<00:01:08.290> couple<00:01:08.470> buttons<00:01:08.740> up<00:01:08.950> here

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
do get an extra couple buttons up here

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.310 
do get an extra couple buttons up here
so<00:01:09.820> hopefully<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.300> will<00:01:10.390> work<00:01:10.570> out<00:01:10.810> as<00:01:11.170> you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
so hopefully that will work out as you

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.260 
so hopefully that will work out as you
can<00:01:11.410> see<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.680> d-pad<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.340> things<00:01:12.760> are<00:01:12.940> changed

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
can see the d-pad and things are changed

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.400 
can see the d-pad and things are changed
a<00:01:13.330> little<00:01:13.480> bit<00:01:13.660> so<00:01:13.870> that<00:01:13.900> should<00:01:14.200> be<00:01:14.230> a<00:01:14.290> little

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
a little bit so that should be a little

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.590 
a little bit so that should be a little
bit<00:01:14.560> easier<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.920> use<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.340> for<00:01:15.430> what<00:01:16.360> I've<00:01:16.480> been

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
bit easier to use and for what I've been

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.580 
bit easier to use and for what I've been
told<00:01:16.840> it's<00:01:17.080> relatively<00:01:17.590> easy<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:19.380> remap<00:01:20.380> those

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
told it's relatively easy to remap those

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.170 
told it's relatively easy to remap those
buttons<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.100> just<00:01:21.280> want<00:01:21.580> one<00:01:21.760> of<00:01:21.790> these<00:01:21.909> and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
buttons you just want one of these and

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.140 
buttons you just want one of these and
sit<00:01:22.390> where<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.630> want<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:23.440> new<00:01:23.560> button<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.890> go

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
sit where you want the new button to go

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.420 
sit where you want the new button to go
so<00:01:25.150> it's<00:01:25.330> just<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.659> basic<00:01:25.990> quick<00:01:26.380> video<00:01:26.950> oh<00:01:27.130> noe

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
so it's just a basic quick video oh noe

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.100 
so it's just a basic quick video oh noe
on<00:01:27.760> these<00:01:27.940> buttons<00:01:28.210> right<00:01:28.360> here<00:01:28.420> are<00:01:28.840> supposed
