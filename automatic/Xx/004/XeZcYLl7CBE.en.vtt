00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello friends stay with sick people 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.429
 I am going to show this set of the manufacturer 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.740
 jersey october this is the reference to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.230
 minimalist bowling for a person 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.059
 good that we are going to find we are going to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 find here a container that serves us 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.580
 as much as pot as thermo cup and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.800
 although this would be the cover he has here 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.420
 at the top you have to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.210
 vegetable perfectly for what we can 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.160
 use to drink directly from it 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.169
 inside we will find a 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.710
 new this does not take any kind of 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.269
 pizza and carry this type of visa that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.680
 has a double version here that we have 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.270
 the fingers and we'll take it like that 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.360
 directly 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.790
 because the novel one for example here 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.530
 I have the brightness if we see to use if 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.980
 we use a ring we will put it here 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.390
 that carries a magnet and as a novelty it carries 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.579
 this 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.970
 Fully folding fork spoon 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.270
 it hides like this to occupy less space 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.309
 this is the pot with a capacity of 0.6 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.170
 liters has a measure of about 11 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 centimeters high and a diameter of 10 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.380
 this would be what would be the pot of 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.930
 annualized aluminum and this would be in the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.630
 thermal case that we would use it for 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.860
 after heating the water 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.550
 perfectly on top of any one 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.050
 child because it is ideal I did it if not 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.580
 it becomes a material like titanium 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.680
 which is lighter I get clearer by 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.080
 that in terms of aluminum analyzed with 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.880
 the materials that are more resistant to 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.160
 Scratches to blows and changes 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.290
 of temperature perfectly 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.850
 we will heat our water for example 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.350
 in case we want to prepare because the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.960
 type of food the used one we can 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.790
 prepare us inside a soup etcetera what 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.460
 connects to water to make it drinkable 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.950
 then to catch what would be the pot 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.500
 that we create with our clip of these 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.440
 of fingers what we have here we would close 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.350
 and it is already we are going directly what 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.229
 we could save in our 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.930
 in our case and right here we 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.700
 we will prepare our made even 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.400
 we could cover and all but we 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.090
 will prepare a type of coffee or tea we can 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.340
 see directly from is a being for a 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.019
 person 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 ok commented here also here 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.910
 inside that we can get this is the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.650
 250 cartridge but the cartridges the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.450
 of 100 grams small and screws 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.760
 small can not enter perfectly 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.310
 here and take everything so look it's a lot 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.720
 more collected 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.130
 I hope the information we have 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.130
 help hello
