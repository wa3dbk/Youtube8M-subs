00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.480
 so you are welcome to wear a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 appart and then you know nobody 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.059
 then you like you want to go there 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.250
 to go but you have not like no 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.330
 to know who to talk about 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.539
 once we go to the parts whose 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.609
 people wishing like a little jean 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.779
 so since I propose something that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.990
 can be fun if you are you 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.699
 bring a wine that screamed conversation 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.859
 like that makes you talk about wine 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.090
 it allows press to pass to others 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.110
 discussions but it allows for good 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.680
 break the ice 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.070
 so for a party 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.610
 anonymous why not go with a 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.879
 squeezes into an uncertain that comes from the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.370
 budget region in France so 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.840
 uncertain actually what is fun already 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.329
 it is that you will not be too worried 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.960
 like a bit of a wine beer in these 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.170
 sites points 5% alcohol is really 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.329
 I love the greenhouse they are good for 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.450
 obviously we will taste the fox daf h 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.280
 together and then we'll talk about it as 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.409
 if you already predict when we 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.689
 remove the museum we always try 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.100
 after those to hold the bottle is 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.770
 what we know for the pressure they and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.770
 at which level to hold the bouchut 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.110
 good already it goes well the perfect ok 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.880
 reaches by tess s so go so if you 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.500
 keep like pasa pop like that of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.049
 times that there are lots of words 5 spell of a 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.369
 shot up it flows everywhere then we know 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.470
 not what to do when you look at the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.869
 bottle a little slow diagonal like that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.869
 it makes it possible to bring down the moss 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.869
 so it's a little trick then 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.490
 so it's a mix of range and and 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.149
 pulse is actually the method that's 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.740
 that wine and makes up and when 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.479
 is made to a certain level there in the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.230
 fermentation the tank went down to 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.730
 cold so the fermentation stops 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.370
 then the wine is bottled and 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.530
 then have other summits we put 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.450
 beer capsules we put on 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.250
 we leave it closes when the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.170
 fermentation ends in bottles and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.209
 did one of the age after gorges for 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.099
 remove the deposit so that means 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.750
 that's what does it contrary to 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.670
 champagne for example where there are two 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.230
 fermentation the second fermentation and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.120
 makes a snack water in this case one 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.120
 is just a fermentation that is 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.010
 ends in beauty so that there is 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.569
 less less alcohol obviously too 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.660
 the grapes must have less sugar 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:49.610
 departure also so it's beautiful it's pink 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.019
 that's it's for sure that when we see 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.220
 the color we do it smells strawberry 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.000
 but it's true that there is a small side 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.049
 strawberries 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.440
 there is a very cool side or if it's 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.079
 really a freshness there pretty awesome 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:11.870
 so or looted then you hold me a little 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:13.940
 acidulous side too we stumble everything 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.980
 depending on the cerdon there are more or less 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.350
 sugar here we still have a touch of 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.500
 sugar is really like chewing 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.760
 in dmc what damage from her I can 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.440
 if you eat what you were small 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.540
 the dga of her where it is at the market 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.970
 at the end of summer berry 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.530
 red where we have it is very chained 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.170
 tart is a little bit of sugar but 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.840
 it's like all that it's exactly that 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.579
 it's really a bit of acidity 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.069
 sugar it puts back on the piton it gives the 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:48.349
 liking to party does not taste 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:50.870
 so go take that into the party you 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.599
 do not you know anyone you open that 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.250
 you observe some of the huts 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.739
 why not commented on the discussion 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.090
 people know in any case of 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.950
 more and more people know but 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.920
 it's still something a little 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.440
 less known so vixen cerdon to 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.590
 angry rosy bugey sparklines wine drunk on 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.590
 the Web
