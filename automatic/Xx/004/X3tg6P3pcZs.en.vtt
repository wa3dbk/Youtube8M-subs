free end of this rope and wrap it around

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.520 
free end of this rope and wrap it around
the<00:00:42.840> pole<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.129> you've<00:00:44.309> got<00:00:44.340> two<00:00:44.940> ropes

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
the pole so now you've got two ropes

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.010 
the pole so now you've got two ropes
next<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.590> take<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.920> free<00:00:47.129> end<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.809> wrap<00:00:48.809> it

next you take the free end and wrap it
around<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.440> fingers<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.689 

next<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> take<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.350> palm<00:00:55.699> face

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
next you're going to take your palm face

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it down towards the ground again up once

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.979 
it down towards the ground again up once
again<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.190> palm<00:01:02.510> face<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> down

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
again you take the palm face it down

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
again you take the palm face it down
towards<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> ground<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.610> bring<00:01:05.850> your<00:01:06.060> hand

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
up around the outer edge of both ropes

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.420 
up around the outer edge of both ropes
then<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.229> reach<00:01:10.470> through<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.009> loop

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
then you reach through the loop

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.999 
then you reach through the loop
grabbing<00:01:12.420> again<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.869> free<00:01:13.170> end<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
grabbing again the free end of the

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.730 
grabbing again the free end of the
string<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.110> you're<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.320> pull<00:01:16.530> this

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
string and you're going to pull this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.270 
string and you're going to pull this
through<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.369> create<00:01:17.520> another<00:01:18.360> loop<00:01:19.280> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
through to create another loop you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.969 
through to create another loop you
tighten<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> pull<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
tighten this up and you can pull the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.620 
tighten this up and you can pull the
knot<00:01:23.420> taut<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:25.020> against<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> tree<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
knot taut up against the tree so in this

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.930 
knot taut up against the tree so in this
way<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.500> rope<00:01:28.679> has<00:01:28.890> tension<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.789> can

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
way the rope has tension and you can

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.570 
way the rope has tension and you can
pull<00:01:30.149> on<00:01:30.300> it<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.659> much<00:01:30.899> as<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.050> want<00:01:31.429> but<00:01:32.429> when

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
pull on it as much as you want but when

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.580 
pull on it as much as you want but when
it's<00:01:32.700> time<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> release<00:01:33.179> it<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.440> give

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it's time to release it you just give

00:01:34.590 --> 00:02:06.359 
it's time to release it you just give
this<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> ton

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.389 

so<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.640> Siberian<00:02:08.060> hitch<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.360> pretty<00:02:08.569> easy

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
so the Siberian hitch is pretty easy

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.080 
so the Siberian hitch is pretty easy
just<00:02:10.399> pull<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.789> around<00:02:11.799> wrap<00:02:12.799> it<00:02:13.010> go<00:02:13.489> down<00:02:13.670> go

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
just pull it around wrap it go down go

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.740 
just pull it around wrap it go down go
up<00:02:15.250> pull<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.280> string<00:02:16.610> through<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:20.269> tighten

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
up pull the string through and tighten

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.309 
up pull the string through and tighten
it<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:23.060> actually<00:02:23.209> useful<00:02:23.540> for<00:02:23.750> things<00:02:24.049> other

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319

course<00:02:32.209> when<00:02:32.329> you're<00:02:32.390> ready<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.690> take<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.989> down

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
course when you're ready to take it down

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.050 
course when you're ready to take it down
just<00:02:34.760> one<00:02:34.910> pole<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.360> good<00:02:35.480> enough

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
just one pole is good enough

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.039 
just one pole is good enough
now<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> next<00:02:38.360> night<00:02:38.569> I'm<00:02:38.690> going<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> show<00:02:39.019> you

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
now the next night I'm going to show you

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.339 
now the next night I'm going to show you
is<00:02:39.410> sort<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.489> tension<00:02:40.760> knot<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:42.200> use

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
is sort of a tension knot and you use

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.869 
is sort of a tension knot and you use
this<00:02:42.560> once<00:02:42.799> you've<00:02:42.950> tied<00:02:43.190> one<00:02:43.459> end<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.760> your

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
this once you've tied one end of your

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.569 
this once you've tied one end of your
tarp<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.900> tree<00:02:45.260> or<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> pole<00:02:45.890> or<00:02:45.950> something<00:02:46.459> of

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
tarp to a tree or a pole or something of

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.250 
tarp to a tree or a pole or something of
that<00:02:46.609> sort

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
that sort

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.869 
that sort
so<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.440> knot<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.799> use<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.129> other<00:02:49.280> end<00:02:49.640> of

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
so this knot you use the other end of

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.589 
so this knot you use the other end of
the<00:02:50.000> tarp<00:02:50.319> you<00:02:51.319> wrap<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.530> around<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.980> tree<00:02:52.010> and

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
the tarp you wrap it around a tree and

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.140 
the tarp you wrap it around a tree and
the<00:02:53.599> knot<00:02:53.750> allows<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.609> pull<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:55.730> tarp<00:02:55.970> as

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
the knot allows you to pull the tarp as

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.900 
the knot allows you to pull the tarp as
taut<00:02:56.420> as<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:58.280> let's<00:02:58.430> do<00:02:58.609> that<00:02:58.730> one

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
taut as you can so let's do that one

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.539 
taut as you can so let's do that one
next<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.989> first<00:03:00.230> step<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.980> knot<00:03:01.160> again

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
next the first step for this knot again

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.580 
next the first step for this knot again
is<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.849> pull<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.450> free<00:03:02.660> end<00:03:02.690> around<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.349> tree

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
is to pull the free end around the tree

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.970 
is to pull the free end around the tree
or<00:03:03.859> pull<00:03:04.599> now<00:03:05.599> you<00:03:05.660> take<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.019> free<00:03:06.230> end<00:03:06.410> and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
or pull now you take the free end and

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.819 
or pull now you take the free end and
bring<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.370> over<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.910> top<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.959> taut<00:03:09.169> side

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
bring it over the top of the taut side

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.860 
bring it over the top of the taut side
of<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.099> room<00:03:10.250> then<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.209> pull<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.480> free<00:03:11.840> end

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
of the room then you pull the free end

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.900 
of the room then you pull the free end
under<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.560> wrap<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.130> around<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.489> tree<00:03:13.700> one

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
under and wrap it around the tree one

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.770 
under and wrap it around the tree one
more<00:03:14.090> time<00:03:15.040> next<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:17.060> want<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.359> pinch<00:03:17.599> it

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
more time next you want to pinch it

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.039 
more time next you want to pinch it
against<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.590> taut<00:03:18.799> end<00:03:19.069> of<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.310> rope<00:03:19.989> now<00:03:20.989> the

allows<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.700> do<00:05:07.080> is<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:08.890> don't<00:05:09.070> have

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
allows you to do is that you don't have

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.160 
allows you to do is that you don't have
to<00:05:09.310> pull<00:05:09.580> your<00:05:10.210> string<00:05:10.570> all<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:10.750> way<00:05:10.930> out<00:05:11.140> and

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
to pull your string all the way out and

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.830 
to pull your string all the way out and
stake<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.770> down<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.820> can<00:05:12.850> have<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.600> stake<00:05:13.810> a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
stake it down you can have the stake a

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.360 
stake it down you can have the stake a
little<00:05:14.110> bit<00:05:14.200> closer<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.650> your<00:05:14.710> tarp<00:05:14.980> and<00:05:15.190> then

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
little bit closer to your tarp and then

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.640 
little bit closer to your tarp and then
just<00:05:15.730> how<00:05:16.480> tight<00:05:16.750> your<00:05:16.840> tarp<00:05:17.110> is<00:05:17.260> using<00:05:17.560> the

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
just how tight your tarp is using the

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.780 
just how tight your tarp is using the
knot<00:05:17.800> itself<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.800> speaking<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.430> knots

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
knot itself so speaking of knots

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.700 
knot itself so speaking of knots
once<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.360> work<00:05:22.540> my<00:05:22.690> way<00:05:22.720> through<00:05:22.900> this<00:05:23.500> little

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
once I work my way through this little

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.500 
once I work my way through this little
knot<00:05:23.950> here<00:05:24.600> we'll<00:05:25.600> do<00:05:25.720> that<00:05:27.120> after<00:05:28.120> driving

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
knot here we'll do that after driving

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.990 
knot here we'll do that after driving
your<00:05:28.720> stake<00:05:28.960> in<00:05:29.010> pull<00:05:30.010> the<00:05:30.220> rope<00:05:30.430> around<00:05:30.610> it

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
your stake in pull the rope around it

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.900 
your stake in pull the rope around it
forming<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.870> large<00:05:32.110> loop<00:05:35.370> then<00:05:36.370> take<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.730> loose

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
forming a large loop then take the loose

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.940 
forming a large loop then take the loose
end<00:05:37.060> of<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.300> string<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.720> wrap<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.560> around<00:05:38.650> the

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
end of a string and wrap it around the

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.350 
end of a string and wrap it around the
part<00:05:39.160> of<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.310> rope<00:05:39.460> that's<00:05:39.730> attached<00:05:40.060> to<00:05:40.180> the

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
part of the rope that's attached to the

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.170 
part of the rope that's attached to the
tarp<00:05:40.800> you're<00:05:41.800> going<00:05:41.980> to<00:05:42.040> wrap<00:05:42.220> it<00:05:42.250> twice<00:05:42.640> by

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
tarp you're going to wrap it twice by

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.330 
tarp you're going to wrap it twice by
feeding<00:05:43.570> it<00:05:43.690> through<00:05:43.720> the<00:05:44.620> large<00:05:44.860> loop<00:05:45.130> you've

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
feeding it through the large loop you've

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.240 
feeding it through the large loop you've
created<00:05:46.260> then<00:05:47.260> you'll<00:05:47.410> wrap<00:05:47.590> it<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.830> third<00:05:48.010> time

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
created then you'll wrap it a third time

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.760 
created then you'll wrap it a third time
but<00:05:48.490> this<00:05:48.670> time<00:05:48.870> you<00:05:49.870> take<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:50.260> rope<00:05:50.410> around

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
but this time you take the rope around

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.280 
but this time you take the rope around
both<00:05:51.250> ropes<00:05:51.730> in<00:05:52.000> other<00:05:52.600> words<00:05:52.810> you<00:05:52.900> take<00:05:53.140> it

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
both ropes in other words you take it

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.600 
both ropes in other words you take it
around<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.680> entire<00:05:54.070> loop<00:05:55.080> then<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:57.400> reach

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
around the entire loop then you reach

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.640 
around the entire loop then you reach
through<00:05:57.910> and<00:05:58.210> pull<00:05:58.780> the<00:05:58.960> loose<00:05:59.140> end<00:05:59.380> and

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
through and pull the loose end and

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.010 
through and pull the loose end and
tighten<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.370> knot<00:06:00.550> this<00:06:01.390> creates<00:06:01.780> another

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
tighten the knot this creates another

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:41.100 
tighten the knot this creates another
loop

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.659 

so<00:06:42.110> once<00:06:42.289> you<00:06:42.380> master<00:06:42.710> these<00:06:42.889> three<00:06:42.949> simple

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
so once you master these three simple

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.820 
so once you master these three simple
knots<00:06:43.880> you<00:06:44.660> can<00:06:44.810> pretty<00:06:44.960> much<00:06:45.080> set<00:06:45.410> up<00:06:45.440> a<00:06:45.590> tarp

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
knots you can pretty much set up a tarp

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.980 
knots you can pretty much set up a tarp
in<00:06:45.919> any<00:06:46.099> configuration<00:06:46.310> that<00:06:46.970> you<00:06:47.060> want<00:06:47.270> and

in any configuration that you want and

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.930 
in any configuration that you want and
they're<00:06:48.199> pretty<00:06:48.349> useful<00:06:48.560> and<00:06:48.919> other<00:06:49.039> sort<00:06:49.849> of

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
they're pretty useful and other sort of
