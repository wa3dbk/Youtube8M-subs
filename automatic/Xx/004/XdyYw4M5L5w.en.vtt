00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
but the the same setup just didn't

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.090 
but the the same setup just didn't
really<00:01:30.869> work<00:01:31.140> after<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> rain<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:31.890> the

really work after all the rain and the
track<00:01:32.310> conditions<00:01:32.700> being<00:01:32.850> slightly

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
track conditions being slightly

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.969

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
different we didn't really have the the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.200 
different we didn't really have the the
upper<00:01:35.220> hand<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.550> thought<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.820> were<00:01:35.940> going<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
upper hand we thought we were going to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.749 
upper hand we thought we were going to
have<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.860> kept<00:01:38.040> their<00:01:38.130> heads<00:01:38.280> down<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
have so I just kept their heads down and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.070 
have so I just kept their heads down and
didn't<00:01:39.060> move<00:01:39.180> too<00:01:39.390> far<00:01:39.540> away<00:01:39.690> from<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
didn't move too far away from the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.390 
didn't move too far away from the
setting<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.470> were<00:01:40.619> comfortable<00:01:40.830> with<00:01:41.070> but

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
setting we were comfortable with but

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.130 
setting we were comfortable with but
just<00:01:41.880> had<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> find<00:01:42.270> chin<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> suit

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
just had to find chin in a bit to suit

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.740 
just had to find chin in a bit to suit
the<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.770> new<00:01:43.920> conditions<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.750> fortunately

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the the new conditions and fortunately

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.590 
the the new conditions and fortunately
not<00:01:46.050> as<00:01:46.200> fast<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.740> test<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.509> after<00:01:48.509> all

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
not as fast as it the test but after all

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.859 
not as fast as it the test but after all
the<00:01:48.690> rain<00:01:48.810> were<00:01:48.990> pretty<00:01:49.200> close<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:50.660> 34<00:01:51.660> nine

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the rain were pretty close at a 34 nine

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.030 
the rain were pretty close at a 34 nine
so<00:01:52.430> we're<00:01:53.430> quite<00:01:53.610> pleased<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:53.880> that
