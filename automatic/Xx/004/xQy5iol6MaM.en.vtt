and<00:02:08.860> geometry<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:09.610> example<00:02:09.640> if<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.149> open<00:02:10.390> up

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
and geometry for example if I open up

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.960 
and geometry for example if I open up
the<00:02:10.690> sphere<00:02:11.430> you'll<00:02:12.430> see<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.760> there's<00:02:12.910> a

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
the sphere you'll see that there's a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.710 
the sphere you'll see that there's a
translate<00:02:13.540> rotate<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.470> scale<00:02:14.800> property<00:02:15.720> once

translate rotate and scale property once

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.360 
translate rotate and scale property once
this<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.959> open<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.349> also<00:02:17.530> see<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.160> there's<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
this is open you also see that there's a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
this is open you also see that there's a
transform<00:02:18.910> handle

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
transform handle

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.069 
transform handle
you<00:02:20.220> click<00:02:20.489> drag<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.970> handle<00:02:21.360> along<00:02:21.510> an<00:02:21.689> axis

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
you click drag the handle along an axis

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:31.970 
you click drag the handle along an axis
you<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:22.980> move<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.459> direction<00:02:30.980> for

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
you can move it in that direction for

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.460 
you can move it in that direction for
example<00:02:32.340> why<00:02:32.659> of<00:02:33.659> course<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.989> can<00:02:34.079> also<00:02:34.200> just

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
example why of course you can also just

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.000 
example why of course you can also just
enter<00:02:34.680> values<00:02:35.099> into<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.489> properties<00:02:35.849> panel
