00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.160
 have you ever wondered how you know how to be 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.859
 on the developer side instead of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.050
 that of players well me and that 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.820
 pumps we found out by interviewing 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.210
 of the children of the Milan Polytechnic 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.010
 who made video games 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.900
 they are specifically for their course of study 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.400
 computer engineering students e 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.400
 that 's what came out 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.010
 hi to all friends of jimbo network ci 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.660
 we find now with three professors 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.880
 respectively of the polytechnic of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.250
 Milan and the University of Milan that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.110
 they teach video game development 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 we have three questions for them at the first one 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.710
 question is what is the impact of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.930
 video games nowadays on the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.700
 our company 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.480
 well then the title of the impact of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.010
 video games 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.789
 I would like to talk about evolution 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.160
 in the impact in video games up to 10 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.800
 15 years ago the games were mainly 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.309
 designed to be a leisure object 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.799
 however, it is the subject of pastime taxes 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.970
 today we rightly have one 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 re-evaluation of what it is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.040
 the goal of the video game ie in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 to report rather than to be formative 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.110
 rather than communicating emotions 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.420
 and there are today not only aside 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.790
 of the big manufacturers but also 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.250
 by small developers 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.439
 independent of the excellent examples of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 games that for example teaches one 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.829
 little girl didn't lose supermarket 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 rather than teaching how to program 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.550
 go rhythms rather than 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.640
 communicate 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.580
 the civic sense we have also 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.080
 project on this for which it is just 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.680
 changing attitude with that 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.730
 company watch video games with today 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.950
 we can therefore speak of art 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.680
 videogames in some cases in some 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.020
 cases the second question is perfect 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.150
 instead it concerns the way it is 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.960
 changed teaching this type of 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.000
 matter 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.860
 in reality the teaching did not exist 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.160
 of video games until recent years 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.450
 up to the last 3 4 years 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
 let's say that one was also difficult 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.920
 time will teach video games because one 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.350
 they were looked at precisely as one of the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 extremely playful and little elements 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.510
 uninteresting and few serious 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.640
 now the perception has changed to 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.540
 then market and multi multimillionaire 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.950
 actually the type of investment 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.680
 this market also brought a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.970
 totally different interest 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.990
 the interesting thing that is also 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.070
 changed the approach to availability 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.690
 of development tools 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.790
 once wanting to develop video games 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.230
 1 didn't even know where to start and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.920
 don't even know how to distribute them 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.380
 so we had examples like nac 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.150
 developed by paolo thai and that he saw 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.400
 was then distributed through 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.860
 however, bbs through websites was not 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.570
 there was no real development market e 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.150
 employee distribution is now 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.380
 totally changed contextually there 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.850
 are a lot of tools that 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.800
 easily allow entering 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.520
 this world thinks only of the 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.800
 platforms like unity or even html5 by 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.010
 kappa that actually allow 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.080
 anyone to develop products or 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.330
 also exane for example allow a 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.489
 all of developing products of 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.050
 very high independent quality and this 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.360
 makes a number of games bloom 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.480
 let's say outside of the mainstream they are 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.250
 those of the three tests so we can 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.410
 affirm that this matter is in 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.430
 evolution will still evolve a lot 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.780
 yes there is a lot of evolution and the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.140
 number of available tools is 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.790
 increasing exponentially 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.140
 anyone who wants anyone 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.610
 developing a video game now says 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.470
 which of all these tools 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.160
 beautiful and powerful I can use 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.230
 once it wasn't like that really was 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.770
 in art it is a trade is extremely 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.380
 perfect third and last craft 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.930
 question or what the possibilities are 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.890
 a job for a young person wanted 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.350
 getting close to this type of job is 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.210
 therefore we say that we must distinguish 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.710
 first of all what it means to work 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.260
 this kind of job 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.080
 in the sense that an account is the location 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.450
 of the type in place in the large company 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.490
 employees or so on and another 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.740
 another view is to define what I am 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.020
 I want to make the world of video games 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.060
 then from the first point of view we say 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.530
 that the possibilities are going to 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.210
 working in a big company maybe 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.530
 also abroad, type at ubisoft and my son 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.360
 put a little the name you want or 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.530
 try to make your own startup 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.810
 work with some little ones 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.160
 independent or maybe work in a 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.630
 area that is not really that of the 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.210
 video games maybe a company that does 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.650
 even video games as can be ad 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.600
 example comes to mind in italy mix is 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.370
 actually of this type 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.600
 and then we also need to understand what 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.400
 I want to do it in the context of 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.660
 video games because clearly also 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.100
 we only teach that it does not exist 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.760
 only the programming in the field 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.500
 computer scientist 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.990
 indeed, the figures are more and more 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.390
 professionals that are included in 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.500
 in video games 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.460
 unlike what happened in 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.110
 past 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.669
 ubisoft for example told us just 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.930
 the other day they took on several 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.050
 psychologists for 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.030
 use new kinect type devices for 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.770
 take advantage of all the potential they have 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.690
 need skills that are not 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.389
 strictly those of the computer science 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.729
 just as there is the whole artistic part e 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.150
 graphic storytelling etc. 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.710
 etc 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.509
 let's say the possibilities are 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.380
 differentiated and do not concern only 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:27.270
 of computer scientists 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.380
 thanks it is true that they are developed 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.419
 only commercial video games 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.570
 commercial in the kind of the fact that 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.710
 they are sold it is in fact if if 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.310
 we want to distinguish we can 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.020
 distinguish between triple mainstream and the 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.490
 large number of independent companies 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.050
 who are now being born 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.550
 returning to the comment above 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.470
 development tools to the possibility 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.050
 to easily have instrument of 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.120
 development often free and easy 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.099
 access made the companies 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.160
 independent a very strong reality e 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.380
 very strong in Italy and throughout the 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.300
 world for example during our course 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.860
 during this course 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.080
 we have invited at least six or seven 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.240
 small companies of companies 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.349
 independent than actually 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.930
 developing in italy market 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.930
 their perfect overseas game
