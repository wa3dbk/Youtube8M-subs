the<00:00:02.909> lgbtq<00:00:03.510> may<00:00:03.659> look<00:00:03.840> like<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.990> big<00:00:04.170> box<00:00:04.380> of

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
the lgbtq may look like a big box of

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.230 
the lgbtq may look like a big box of
lights<00:00:04.740> but<00:00:05.310> it's<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> big<00:00:05.609> box<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.940> lights<00:00:06.150> that

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
lights but it's a big box of lights that

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.670 
lights but it's a big box of lights that
you<00:00:06.359> can<00:00:06.540> program<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:07.350> can<00:00:07.500> download

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
you can program you can download

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.530 
you can program you can download
applications<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.639> create<00:00:08.849> displays<00:00:09.000> that

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
applications and create displays that

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.000 
applications and create displays that
respond<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.019> things<00:00:10.170> like<00:00:10.440> sound<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
respond to things like sound and the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.770 
respond to things like sound and the
weather<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.759> team<00:00:11.940> at<00:00:12.059> lookin'-glass<00:00:12.300> which

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
weather the team at lookin'-glass which

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.450 
weather the team at lookin'-glass which
makes<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> cube<00:00:13.380> sees<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.099> as<00:00:14.219> an<00:00:14.340> early

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
makes the cube sees it as an early

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.290 
makes the cube sees it as an early
experiment<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.330> 3d<00:00:15.690> displays<00:00:16.109> pink<00:00:16.740> Holograms

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
experiment in 3d displays pink Holograms

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.679 
experiment in 3d displays pink Holograms
so<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.869> LED<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.359> first

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so this is the LED and it's the first

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.590 
so this is the LED and it's the first
full<00:00:22.230> color<00:00:22.560> easy<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.430> assemble<00:00:23.699> kit<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.570> a

full color easy to assemble kit for a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
full color easy to assemble kit for a
volumetric<00:00:24.960> display<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> simple

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
volumetric display it's like a simple

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.060 
volumetric display it's like a simple
hologram<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> little<00:00:28.380> 3d<00:00:28.710> display

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
hologram it's like a little 3d display

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
hologram it's like a little 3d display
and<00:00:29.310> they're<00:00:30.210> programmable<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and they're programmable just like a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.630 
and they're programmable just like a
screen<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.830> tell<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.160> display<00:00:32.460> any

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
screen you can tell it to display any

type of movie or video anything you like

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
type of movie or video anything you like
we<00:00:35.190> make<00:00:35.370> these<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.550> kit<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.450> it's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
we make these a kit and what it's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.819 
we make these a kit and what it's
showing<00:00:36.630> right<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:37.079> are<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.320> different

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
showing right now are just different

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.260 
showing right now are just different
demos<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:39.120> come<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.899> some<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> them<00:00:40.890> are

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
demos that come with it some of them are

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.760 
demos that come with it some of them are
just<00:00:42.270> standalone<00:00:42.719> programs<00:00:43.230> others<00:00:43.620> have

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
just standalone programs others have

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
just standalone programs others have
them<00:00:43.860> respond<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.820> listening<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
them respond so this is listening to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.459 
them respond so this is listening to
sound<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.379> you

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
sound so if I go like and I think you

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
sound so if I go like and I think you
can<00:00:52.680> download<00:00:53.250> programs<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> internet

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
can download programs from the internet

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
can download programs from the internet
as<00:00:54.809> well<00:00:54.840> right<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> made<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.800> website<00:00:56.250> for

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
as well right so I made this website for

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.130 
as well right so I made this website for
the<00:00:56.699> cubes<00:00:56.940> called<00:00:57.149> cube<00:00:57.360> tube<00:00:57.570> which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.960> like

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the cubes called cube tube which is like

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
the cubes called cube tube which is like
YouTube<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.800> 4<00:00:59.460> cubes<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> site

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
YouTube for 4 cubes so this is a site

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
YouTube for 4 cubes so this is a site
where<00:01:00.960> people<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.350> create<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> put<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.730> all

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
where people can create and put up all

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.759 
where people can create and put up all
kinds<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> their<00:01:03.510> own<00:01:03.660> programs<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> ideas

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
kinds of their own programs and ideas

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
kinds of their own programs and ideas
that<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.189> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> cube<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> it's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that they want to put on a cube and it's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.149 
that they want to put on a cube and it's
just<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> way<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.600> people<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> experiment<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
just a way for people to experiment and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250 
just a way for people to experiment and
explore<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.630> they<00:01:09.750> want<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> show<00:01:10.110> in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
explore with what they want to show in

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.920 
explore with what they want to show in
3d<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.670> had<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.330> we

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
3d and what we can do if we had as we

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
3d and what we can do if we had as we
get<00:01:13.080> closer<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.740> dream<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> holograms

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
get closer to this dream of holograms

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.609 
get closer to this dream of holograms
being<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.600> fingertips<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> my

favorites is by this user Ben and he did

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.330 
favorites is by this user Ben and he did
a<00:01:19.710> 3d<00:01:20.220> game<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:21.000> snake<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.530> gonna<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
a 3d game of snake so I'm gonna just

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.969 
a 3d game of snake so I'm gonna just
click<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.210> click<00:01:24.509> send<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.869> my<00:01:25.020> cube<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.710> cube

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
click I click send to my cube the cube

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.670 
click I click send to my cube the cube
in<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.240> second<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:27.780> start<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> load<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
in just a second will start to load that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
in just a second will start to load that
program<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.729> picks<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.119> over

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
program and it just picks that up over

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.020 
program and it just picks that up over
Wi-Fi<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.130> few<00:01:32.340> seconds<00:01:32.670> later<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
Wi-Fi and then a few seconds later it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.190 
Wi-Fi and then a few seconds later it
just<00:01:33.060> starts<00:01:33.360> running<00:01:33.420> whatever<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.079> other

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
just starts running whatever this other

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.550 
just starts running whatever this other
program<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.180> goes

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
program is and there it goes

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.590 
program is and there it goes
so<00:01:37.560> where<00:01:37.890> did<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> idea<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> Alpha<00:01:39.210> DQ

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
so where did the idea for the Alpha DQ

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.469 
so where did the idea for the Alpha DQ
come<00:01:39.810> from<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.680> about<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> year<00:01:42.090> year<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
come from so about a year year and a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.200 
come from so about a year year and a
half<00:01:42.630> ago<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.140> developed<00:01:43.560> something<00:01:43.799> called

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
half ago we developed something called

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.830 
half ago we developed something called
volumetric<00:01:45.210> printing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
volumetric printing

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350 
volumetric printing
it's<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.860> 3d<00:01:47.189> printing<00:01:47.579> except<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> uses

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it's like 3d printing except it uses

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
it's like 3d printing except it uses
just<00:01:48.509> ink<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.140> hundreds<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> layers<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
just ink on hundreds of layers of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.050 
just ink on hundreds of layers of
plastic<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.869> actually<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.380> here

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
plastic and you can see actually in here

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.990 
plastic and you can see actually in here
there's<00:01:54.060> no<00:01:54.240> object<00:01:54.479> inside<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.759> just<00:01:56.759> ink

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
there's no object inside it's just ink

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.789 
there's no object inside it's just ink
suspended<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> volume<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:58.649> we

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
suspended in the volume and as we

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679 
suspended in the volume and as we
started<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> show<00:01:59.280> these<00:01:59.490> around<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.969> bars<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
started to show these around at bars and

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.749 
started to show these around at bars and
parties<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.380> events<00:02:01.469> about<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> quarter<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
parties and events about a quarter the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
parties and events about a quarter the
people<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.090> showed<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> said<00:02:03.780> that's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
people we showed it to said that's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.649 
people we showed it to said that's
awesome<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.219> what<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.850> could<00:02:06.149> replace

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
awesome but what if you could replace

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.139 
awesome but what if you could replace
the<00:02:06.960> ink<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.560> light<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.670> could<00:02:08.970> have

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the ink with light then you could have

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.630 
the ink with light then you could have
the<00:02:09.360> display<00:02:09.780> actually<00:02:09.959> move

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the display actually move

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
the display actually move
and<00:02:10.729> be<00:02:11.030> changing<00:02:11.540> or<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.870> can<00:02:11.990> have<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
and be changing or you can have the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.140 
and be changing or you can have the
print<00:02:12.440> turn<00:02:12.620> into<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.860> display<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.730> also<00:02:13.880> see

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
print turn into a display you also see

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.490 
print turn into a display you also see
this<00:02:14.300> sort<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> first<00:02:15.230> step

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
this sort of is like the first step

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.680 
this sort of is like the first step
towards<00:02:15.980> these<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:17.120> know<00:02:17.210> sort<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.540> this

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
towards these you know sort of like this

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.230 
towards these you know sort of like this
future<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.260> volumetric<00:02:18.680> displays<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:20.120> want

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
future of volumetric displays you want

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.340 
future of volumetric displays you want
to<00:02:20.300> talk<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> little<00:02:20.540> bit<00:02:20.750> about<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:21.110> where<00:02:21.290> do

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
to talk a little bit about like where do

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.260 
to talk a little bit about like where do
you<00:02:21.410> see<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.770> sure<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.880> prints<00:02:23.180> to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
you see this going sure so the prints to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.510 
you see this going sure so the prints to
us<00:02:23.420> are<00:02:23.630> like<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> freeze-frame<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.130> perfect

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
us are like a freeze-frame of a perfect

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.140 
us are like a freeze-frame of a perfect
