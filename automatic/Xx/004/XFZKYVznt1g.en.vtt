mode and pass 2014 I can I'm not gonna
guarantee<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.329> because<00:03:23.389> I<00:03:23.569> don't<00:03:23.630> know<00:03:23.900> but<00:03:24.260> I

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
guarantee it because I don't know but I

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.280 
guarantee it because I don't know but I
just<00:03:24.590> scored<00:03:24.889> but<00:03:25.630> I'm<00:03:26.630> gonna<00:03:26.810> give<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.019> guess

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
just scored but I'm gonna give a guess

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.069 
just scored but I'm gonna give a guess
because<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.040> fact<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.370> it's<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.180> beta<00:03:29.419> and

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
because of the fact that it's a beta and

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.890 
because of the fact that it's a beta and
you<00:03:30.410> know<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:30.650> would<00:03:30.799> put<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:31.010> bit<00:03:31.190> on<00:03:31.340> Facebook

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
you know I would put a bit on Facebook

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.170 
you know I would put a bit on Facebook
and<00:03:32.900> that's<00:03:33.139> one<00:03:33.410> thing<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.250> if<00:03:34.760> there's<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.030> bit

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
and that's one thing so if there's a bit

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.610 
and that's one thing so if there's a bit
on<00:03:35.299> Facebook<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.049> then<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.440> would<00:03:36.530> suggest

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
on Facebook and then that would suggest

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.610 
on Facebook and then that would suggest
that<00:03:36.919> it<00:03:37.280> will<00:03:37.400> probably<00:03:38.060> be<00:03:38.510> reinstated<00:03:39.470> a

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
that it will probably be reinstated a

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.530 
that it will probably be reinstated a
full<00:03:39.950> proper<00:03:40.370> thing<00:03:40.609> and<00:03:40.940> then<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.389> can

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
full proper thing and then I can

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.240 
full proper thing and then I can
understand<00:03:41.959> maybe<00:03:42.200> you'll<00:03:42.680> be<00:03:42.829> playing<00:03:43.099> some

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
understand maybe you'll be playing some

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.190 
understand maybe you'll be playing some
offline<00:03:43.609> games<00:03:44.000> as<00:03:44.180> well<00:03:44.329> as<00:03:44.389> online<00:03:44.930> games

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
offline games as well as online games

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.830 
offline games as well as online games
and<00:03:45.380> well<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.849> seems<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.269> maybe<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.630> leaked

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
and well it seems that maybe the leaked

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.539 
and well it seems that maybe the leaked
form<00:03:48.109> week<00:03:48.560> sort<00:03:48.859> of<00:03:48.919> thing<00:03:49.040> will<00:03:49.130> be<00:03:49.220> bad<00:03:49.370> can

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
form week sort of thing will be bad can

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.690 
form week sort of thing will be bad can
a<00:03:49.700> mole<00:03:49.910> which<00:03:50.209> we<00:03:50.329> play<00:03:50.510> in<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.690> same<00:03:50.870> and

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
a mole which we play in the same and

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.490 
a mole which we play in the same and
yeah<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.000> let<00:03:53.540> em<00:03:53.780> alone<00:03:53.989> maybe<00:03:54.290> they'll

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
yeah so let em alone maybe they'll

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.409 
yeah so let em alone maybe they'll
actually<00:03:54.650> was<00:03:54.919> upgraded<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.459> Association<00:03:56.180> and

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
actually was upgraded to Association and

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.240 
actually was upgraded to Association and
people<00:03:57.260> what<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.590> hell<00:03:57.709> yes<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.130> it's

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
people what the hell yes and it's

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.400 
people what the hell yes and it's
actually<00:03:58.700> that's<00:03:59.209> probably<00:03:59.810> a<00:04:00.109> much<00:04:00.230> better

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
actually that's probably a much better
