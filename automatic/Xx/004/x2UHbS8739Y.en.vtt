really let me explain how this works if

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.060 
really let me explain how this works if
these<00:02:50.480> are<00:02:50.630> regular<00:02:51.049> tests<00:02:51.500> what<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.739> would<00:02:51.950> do

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
these are regular tests what I would do

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.560 
these are regular tests what I would do
is<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.340> would<00:02:52.370> find<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.820> smartest<00:02:53.030> students

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
is I would find the smartest students

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.509 
is I would find the smartest students
Maya<00:02:53.780> now<00:02:54.200> at<00:02:54.260> markers<00:02:54.650> first<00:02:54.950> all<00:02:55.340> right

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
Maya now at markers first all right

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.729 
Maya now at markers first all right
then<00:02:55.760> I'd<00:02:55.880> use<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.209> as<00:02:56.330> my<00:02:56.450> answer<00:02:56.750> key<00:02:56.900> but

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
then I'd use that as my answer key but

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.680 
then I'd use that as my answer key but
these<00:02:57.890> are<00:02:58.010> essay<00:02:58.280> questions<00:02:58.670> now<00:02:59.360> if<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.570> were

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
these are essay questions now if I were

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.780 
these are essay questions now if I were
to<00:02:59.720> read<00:02:59.959> these<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.560> would<00:03:00.650> take<00:03:00.799> forever<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.430> I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
to read these it would take forever so I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.759 
to read these it would take forever so I
don't<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.540> look<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:02.900> their<00:03:03.049> mark<00:03:03.290> going<00:03:03.470> into

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
don't so look at their mark going into
