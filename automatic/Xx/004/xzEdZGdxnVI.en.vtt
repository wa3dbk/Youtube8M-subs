00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.200
 imperative victory 3.3.2 plus I 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.360
 hope to continue our adventure 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.920
 and still believe in cutting dreams 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.539
 of the world in brazil so a match 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.240
 important it will have to be serious 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.160
 and then you're very realistic because we 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.770
 expects a complicated match with a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.730
 team regrouped so it will have to find 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.809
 solutions and 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.059
 and why not score very quickly 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.500
 in this match to free us 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.559
 Georgian played behind it will be 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.240
 a defense certainly as it is 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.410
 already happened in the past to others 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.110
 our nation had 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.760
 they have nothing to lose either so they 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.460
 have the image of what they faced 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.460
 in Spain at home they will try 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.470
 to make the 0-0 last the longest 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.180
 possible in the match and why a 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.440
 exploit but but we will try to 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.300
 Saw to pack this match right away 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.390
 and as I would really be important to 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.340
 mark to score in the first 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.730
 moments of the match match score 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.550
 quickly 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.460
 I think after if we have to wait until the 90th 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.490
 comcom did the Spanish but we 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.220
 will do it I think the supporters 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.520
 must also remember that 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.220
 that the match can last 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.880
 a long time to 0 0 and I hope they in 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.020
 will be aware and who 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.159
 who supports us until the end 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.869
 so as long as we have not scored this 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.850
 first goal that they be patients like 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.440
 as no will be on the ground because 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.920
 that there are three important points 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.040
 is that the qualification will be played out on 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.040
 details 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.270
 a direct qualification I mean 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.859
 the first place so 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.619
 so to us to be really 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.780
 focused and realize that the game 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.329
 needs a particular speech compared 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.799
 to your teammates 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.780
 no I think everyone knows this 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.920
 he has to do we know what to do 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.020
 expect 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.280
 we all talk a lot together since 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.319
 the beginning of the week from the beginning 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.660
 rally in the field and in 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.760
 outside the field and to talk 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.780
 especially in fact I also so we are 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.800
 I feel that the team is concerned 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.730
 and of course everyone wants 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.140
 to be on the ground but the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.140
 coach will make his choices
