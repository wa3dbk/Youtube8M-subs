00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
even cm gives you so you shoot if you

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.060 
even cm gives you so you shoot if you

races and even the car the cars with a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
races and even the car the cars with a
lot<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> horsepower<00:00:59.460> even<00:01:00.120> though<00:01:00.270> they're<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
lot of horsepower even though they're a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.229 
lot of horsepower even though they're a
lot<00:01:00.960> heavier<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:02.010> extra<00:01:02.370> horsepower<00:01:02.550> really

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
lot heavier the extra horsepower really

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
lot heavier the extra horsepower really
helps<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:03.780> longer<00:01:04.199> half<00:01:04.409> mile<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.920> one

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
helps in those longer half mile and one

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.880 
helps in those longer half mile and one
mile<00:01:05.369> races<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> show<00:01:07.830> you

mile races so what I want to show you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.969 
mile races so what I want to show you
was<00:01:08.310> these<00:01:09.090> cars<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.540> both<00:01:09.720> level<00:01:10.170> six<00:01:10.439> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
was these cars are both level six this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.640 
was these cars are both level six this
is<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.369> Nissan<00:01:11.880> GTR<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:14.220> has<00:01:15.290> for<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> level

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
is the Nissan GTR it has for the level

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.179 
is the Nissan GTR it has for the level
six<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:20.119> 763<00:01:21.119> horsepower

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
six if you can see this 763 horsepower

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.270 
six if you can see this 763 horsepower
now<00:01:23.540> this<00:01:24.540> car<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.860> will<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.580> beat<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
now this car for it will not beat the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.740 
now this car for it will not beat the
the<00:01:29.280> level<00:01:29.640> six<00:01:29.850> creamer<00:01:30.240> boss

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the level six creamer boss

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
the level six creamer boss
it's<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.650> doesn't<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.400> enough

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's it just doesn't have enough

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.819 
it's it just doesn't have enough
horsepower<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.590> long

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
horsepower to really do it in that long

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.300 
horsepower to really do it in that long
one-mile<00:01:35.280> race<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.909> mile<00:01:36.090> track<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
one-mile race one mile track but if you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.530 
one-mile race one mile track but if you
pick<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.790> Ford<00:01:39.329> GT<00:01:40.320> even<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.299> same

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
pick the Ford GT even here in the same

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.310 
pick the Ford GT even here in the same
level<00:01:42.780> six

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
level six

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.580 
level six
it<00:01:43.439> has<00:01:45.799> 1025<00:01:46.799> horsepower<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:49.290> quite<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it has 1025 horsepower so that's quite a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:02.340 
it has 1025 horsepower so that's quite a
bit<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> jump<00:01:50.430> from<00:01:51.140> 765<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:53.060> 1025

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.679 

so<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.710> second<00:02:04.130> gear<00:02:04.340> tune<00:02:04.580> what<00:02:05.479> you

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
so this is a second gear tune what you

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.059 
so this is a second gear tune what you
do<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.189> try<00:02:07.189> this<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.670> basically<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.860> press<00:02:09.860> on

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
do to try this is basically you press on

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.760 
do to try this is basically you press on
the<00:02:10.310> gas<00:02:10.750> which<00:02:11.750> will<00:02:11.959> start<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.290> race<00:02:12.470> and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
the gas which will start the race and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.860 
the gas which will start the race and
then<00:02:12.890> slide<00:02:13.190> your<00:02:13.220> finger<00:02:13.640> down<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:14.300> on<00:02:14.480> top<00:02:14.720> of

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
then slide your finger down to on top of

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.229 
then slide your finger down to on top of
the<00:02:14.959> shifter<00:02:15.250> once<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.430> race<00:02:16.580> starts<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:17.060> can

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
the shifter once the race starts you can

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.850 
the shifter once the race starts you can
let<00:02:17.420> go<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.750> shifter<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.170> continue<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
let go of the shifter and continue the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:30.170 
let go of the shifter and continue the
race

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.509 

even<00:02:31.049> though<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.439> Viper<00:02:31.709> does<00:02:32.069> take<00:02:32.340> off

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
even though the Viper does take off

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.990 
even though the Viper does take off
quicker<00:02:33.239> than<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.659> car<00:02:34.790> all<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
quicker than this car all that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.880 
quicker than this car all that
horsepower<00:02:36.299> will<00:02:36.810> eventually<00:02:37.290> catch<00:02:37.530> up<00:02:37.560> as

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
horsepower will eventually catch up as

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.110 
horsepower will eventually catch up as
you<00:02:38.040> see<00:02:38.220> he's<00:02:38.370> catching<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.760> where<00:02:38.939> now<00:02:39.060> he

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
you see he's catching up where now he

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.030 
you see he's catching up where now he
passes<00:02:39.689> the<00:02:39.780> biker<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.379> it's<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.650> real<00:02:40.829> easy

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
passes the biker and it's a real easy

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:58.800 
passes the biker and it's a real easy
race

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.920 

so<00:02:59.810> here's<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.320> tune<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.650> use<00:03:00.860> for<00:03:01.070> this<00:03:01.190> car
