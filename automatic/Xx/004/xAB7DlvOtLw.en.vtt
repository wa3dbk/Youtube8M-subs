purpose and strategy in bringing these
kind<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.210> devices<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> market<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.340> Intel's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
kind of devices to the market so Intel's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
kind of devices to the market so Intel's
vision<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.320> enrich<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.010> enable

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
vision is really to enrich and enable

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.490 
vision is really to enrich and enable
the<00:00:50.850> life<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.270> every<00:00:51.449> person<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.289> earth

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the life of every person on this earth

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
the life of every person on this earth
and<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.980> means<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> look<00:00:54.210> across

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and that means we have to look across

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
and that means we have to look across
all<00:00:54.780> sectors<00:00:55.020> education<00:00:55.980> being<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> them

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
all sectors education being one of them

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.450 
all sectors education being one of them
and<00:00:57.390> our<00:00:57.539> strategy<00:00:58.140> around<00:00:58.289> education<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and our strategy around education is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.660 
and our strategy around education is
really<00:00:59.489> around<00:01:00.230> holistic<00:01:01.230> education

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
really around holistic education

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.860 
really around holistic education
transformation<00:01:02.670> which<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.570> more<00:01:03.809> than

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
transformation which is about more than

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
transformation which is about more than
just<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.530> device<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> device<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
just the device that the device is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.539 
just the device that the device is
important<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.470> many<00:01:08.250> pillars

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
important it's also about many pillars

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.740 
important it's also about many pillars
being<00:01:09.000> software<00:01:09.659> hardware<00:01:10.130> content<00:01:11.130> device

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
being software hardware content device

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.899 
being software hardware content device
professional<00:01:12.750> development<00:01:13.409> measurement<00:01:14.310> etc

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
professional development measurement etc

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.710 
professional development measurement etc
so<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> holistic<00:01:17.000> method<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.509> look

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so it is a holistic method that we look

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
so it is a holistic method that we look
at<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.380> terms<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.830> taking<00:01:20.100> education

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
at in terms of taking education

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.359 
at in terms of taking education
transformation<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> classroom<00:01:22.590> why<00:01:23.310> is

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
transformation into the classroom why is

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.030 
transformation into the classroom why is
in<00:01:23.759> Chau<00:01:24.080> getting<00:01:25.080> involved<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> hardware

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
in Chau getting involved in the hardware

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.789 
in Chau getting involved in the hardware
business<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.259> involved

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
business so we don't really get involved

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.100 
business so we don't really get involved
we're<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> manufacturer<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.299> hardware<00:01:30.900> but

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
we're not a manufacturer of hardware but

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.710 
we're not a manufacturer of hardware but
what<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.409> find<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.119> these<00:01:33.119> educational

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
what we find is that these educational

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.380 
what we find is that these educational
devices<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.100> what<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.490> call<00:01:35.520> fit<00:01:36.180> for

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
devices have to be what we call fit for

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.330 
devices have to be what we call fit for
purpose<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:37.619> you're<00:01:37.770> looking<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
purpose so when you're looking at the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.370 
purpose so when you're looking at the
classroom<00:01:38.579> their<00:01:39.090> specific<00:01:39.720> needs<00:01:39.750> their

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
classroom their specific needs their

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.039 
classroom their specific needs their
children<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.030> these<00:01:42.329> devices<00:01:42.780> have

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
children have and and these devices have

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.319 
children have and and these devices have
certain<00:01:43.710> features<00:01:44.130> such<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.369> their<00:01:44.820> agonized

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
certain features such as their agonized

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.260 
certain features such as their agonized
you<00:01:46.049> could<00:01:46.259> drop<00:01:46.470> these<00:01:46.950> devices<00:01:47.369> from<00:01:47.700> 70

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you could drop these devices from 70

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
you could drop these devices from 70
meters<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.960> nothing<00:01:49.259> would<00:01:49.350> happen<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.710> them

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
meters and nothing would happen to them

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.999 
meters and nothing would happen to them
there's<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.759> proof<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.390> does<00:01:51.600> proof<00:01:52.049> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
there's for proof there does proof so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
there's for proof there does proof so
it's<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.340> made<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> lot<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.390> emerging

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
it's really made for a lot of emerging

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.010 
it's really made for a lot of emerging
markets<00:01:55.920> where<00:01:56.189> dust<00:01:56.430> etc<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.210> problem<00:01:57.659> but

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
markets where dust etc is a problem but

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.810 
markets where dust etc is a problem but
it's<00:01:58.200> also<00:01:58.350> made<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.920> child<00:01:59.189> friendly<00:01:59.579> with

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
it's also made to be child friendly with

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.520 
it's also made to be child friendly with
the<00:01:59.909> child<00:02:00.180> cannot<00:02:00.479> worry<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> device

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the child cannot worry about the device

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.340 
the child cannot worry about the device
and<00:02:01.829> more<00:02:02.369> concentrate<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> learning<00:02:03.810> so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
and more concentrate on the learning so

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.260 
and more concentrate on the learning so
there's<00:02:04.560> there's<00:02:04.829> those<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.090> things

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
there's there's those kind of things

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.119 
there's there's those kind of things
there's<00:02:06.630> also<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.049> software<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.649> enables

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
there's also the software that enables

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.270 
there's also the software that enables
teaching<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.379> example<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:11.039> this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
teaching so we have for example on this
