gold plugs on two three and four is
hiding<00:01:26.140> somewhere<00:01:27.040> around<00:01:27.190> here<00:01:27.490> you'll<00:01:27.940> see

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
hiding somewhere around here you'll see

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.400 
hiding somewhere around here you'll see
the<00:01:28.210> fourth<00:01:28.420> injector<00:01:28.750> um<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:31.290> basically<00:01:32.290> just

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
the fourth injector um I basically just

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.410 
the fourth injector um I basically just
pulled<00:01:32.770> mine<00:01:32.979> off<00:01:33.220> mine's<00:01:33.610> pretty<00:01:33.910> good<00:01:34.180> shape

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
pulled mine off mine's pretty good shape

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.900 
pulled mine off mine's pretty good shape
but<00:01:34.720> if<00:01:34.990> they're<00:01:35.320> fragile<00:01:35.710> be<00:01:36.130> ready<00:01:36.340> careful

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
but if they're fragile be ready careful

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.770 
but if they're fragile be ready careful
with<00:01:37.030> them<00:01:37.210> this<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.840> brand<00:01:38.380> news<00:01:38.680> harness<00:01:39.340> so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
with them this is brand news harness so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.240 
with them this is brand news harness so
I'm<00:01:40.780> not<00:01:40.930> likely<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.440> have<00:01:41.590> any<00:01:41.710> problems<00:01:42.100> with

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
I'm not likely to have any problems with

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.650 
I'm not likely to have any problems with
it<00:01:43.560> um<00:01:44.580> way<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:45.640> can<00:01:45.850> check<00:01:46.030> your<00:01:46.180> glow<00:01:46.390> plugs

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
it um way you can check your glow plugs

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.249 
it um way you can check your glow plugs
once<00:01:46.869> you<00:01:47.020> put<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.470> settings<00:01:48.009> on<00:01:49.110> take<00:01:50.110> the

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
once you put the settings on take the

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.560 
once you put the settings on take the
tip<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.960> positive<00:01:53.860> put<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.700> directly<00:01:54.820> onto

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
tip of the positive put it directly onto

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.830 
tip of the positive put it directly onto
the<00:01:55.990> tip<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.009> glow<00:01:57.250> plug<00:01:59.130> you<00:02:00.130> should<00:02:00.840> get

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the tip of the glow plug you should get

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:11.150 
the tip of the glow plug you should get
a<00:02:01.869> readings<00:02:02.350> anywhere<00:02:03.190> between<00:02:03.630> 0.5<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:06.450> 1.5

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.650 

1.5<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.340> probably<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.700> brand<00:02:13.030> new<00:02:13.180> glow<00:02:13.360> plug

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
1.5 is probably a brand new glow plug

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.020 
1.5 is probably a brand new glow plug
which<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.620> reading<00:02:17.489> generally<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.519> get<00:02:18.820> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
which is this reading generally I get I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.539 
which is this reading generally I get I
don't<00:02:19.510> know<00:02:19.630> folder<00:02:20.130> generally<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.160> usually

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
don't know folder generally I usually

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.460 
don't know folder generally I usually
get<00:02:21.670> about<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.959> 1.2<00:02:24.780> last<00:02:25.780> time<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.049> check<00:02:26.260> these

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
get about a 1.2 last time I check these

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:42.980 
get about a 1.2 last time I check these
they're<00:02:27.459> not<00:02:27.489> brand<00:02:28.030> new<00:02:28.120> plugs

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:51.310 

make<00:02:43.990> sure<00:02:44.230> your<00:02:44.440> ground<00:02:44.860> wire<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.460> set

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.390 

so<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.560> get<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.770> positive<00:02:53.750> reading<00:02:55.400> it's

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
so you can get a positive reading it's

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:21.979 
so you can get a positive reading it's
one<00:02:56.550> more<00:02:56.670> time<00:03:11.090> busy<00:03:12.980> third<00:03:13.980> plug

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.270 

generally<00:03:22.989> they<00:03:23.140> should<00:03:23.319> all<00:03:23.530> be<00:03:23.560> within<00:03:24.040> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
generally they should all be within the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:35.040 
generally they should all be within the
same<00:03:24.550> proximity<00:03:29.879> I'm<00:03:30.879> getting<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.860> 1.6<00:03:33.720> 1.7<00:03:34.720> for

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
same proximity I'm getting a 1.6 1.7 for

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.830 
same proximity I'm getting a 1.6 1.7 for
most<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.410> these<00:03:36.300> 1.5<00:03:39.420> MA

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
most of these 1.5 MA

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.190 
most of these 1.5 MA
I<00:03:41.370> don't<00:03:42.370> know<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.459> think<00:03:42.550> I'm<00:03:42.840> from<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> ground

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
I don't know I think I'm from the ground

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.839 
I don't know I think I'm from the ground
because<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.650> just<00:03:44.950> tested<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.370> before<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.819> I

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
because I just tested it before and I

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:53.039 
because I just tested it before and I
got<00:03:46.000> Oh<00:03:46.239> like<00:03:47.519> 1.3<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:50.500> not<00:03:51.930> trying<00:03:52.930> to

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
got Oh like 1.3 and I'm not trying to

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.430 
got Oh like 1.3 and I'm not trying to
get<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.170> good<00:03:53.349> ground<00:03:53.650> put<00:03:54.160> this<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.230> maybe

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
get a good ground put this and maybe

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:14.360 
get a good ground put this and maybe
this<00:03:59.680> might<00:03:59.950> work<00:04:00.160> now<00:04:03.420> tested<00:04:04.420> several<00:04:04.750> times

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.250 

as<00:04:15.370> long<00:04:15.549> as<00:04:15.610> they<00:04:15.910> all<00:04:15.940> read<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:17.049> same

as long as they all read the same

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.379 
as long as they all read the same
proximity<00:04:18.329> but<00:04:19.329> anything<00:04:19.900> below<00:04:20.250> 1.5<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.729> would

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
proximity but anything below 1.5 I would

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.050 
proximity but anything below 1.5 I would
probably<00:04:23.229> end<00:04:23.440> up<00:04:23.680> replace<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.310> mean<00:04:24.550> point<00:04:24.850> 5

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
probably end up replace I mean point 5

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.250 
probably end up replace I mean point 5
anything<00:04:25.750> below<00:04:26.130> 0.5<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:28.270> 1.5<00:04:28.810> okay<00:04:29.080> they're

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
anything below 0.5 and 1.5 okay they're

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.190
