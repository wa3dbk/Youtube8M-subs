00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.210
 righteousness the depth the width 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.269
 here are three of the nine criteria judged 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 of the World Plowing Contest 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.540
 organized by young farmers 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.550
 under the name of Jim's lands the 61st 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.500
 World Plowing Finale brought together a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.080
 thirty nationalities in Gironde 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.029
 in total there are 62 competitors who 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.470
 compete in two categories on 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.300
 plowing planks with plows 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.670
 simple and flat plowing with 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.289
 reversible plows of competitors for 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.480
 most Europeans who have only one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.370
 the only goal is to dig furrows 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.809
 more perfect possible with criteria 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.210
 number one righteousness 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.680
 for this reason each competitor perfects 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.530
 himself his plow to make it a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.180
 competitive beast 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 the French competitor in the lab reminded 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.360
 they will shoot for already thirty years 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.980
 of experience behind him a 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.899
 slow progression but who has already 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.379
 allowed to be twice champion of the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 world in 2008 and 2012 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.930
 the latest encouragement from 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.699
 supporters and a slap on the shoulder of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.170
 the part of the coach and it's gone 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.550
 each competitor has three 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 hours to plow a plot of 20 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.210
 years to be world champion as much 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 say that it will not be necessary to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.440
 stuff the wood that from little corner 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.770
 only love of work well done 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.810
 admin took place here always get back 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.370
 in question all the info on our 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.950
 dead but never questioned 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.710
 resume the reliefs of departure and all 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.600
 returns refugees take a long time to climb 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.670
 the echelons of the press and in my opinion 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.410
 a little with the experience that did 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.630
 that I arrived at the hardware level 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.630
 himself 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.850
 but this winter challenge in what is going 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.280
 pretty good for groups that will even 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.380
 very well since all cons 95% and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.009
 conclusive of the global are 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.390
 are equipped with a moland thatched cottage these 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.250
 plowing competition exists in France 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.950
 for over 150 years and have a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.390
 very specific regulation for example for 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.700
 a slice wins the most 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.799
 points she must average 32 cm 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.740
 wide with a tolerance of two 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.390
 centimeters to train in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.250
 actual conditions the competitors the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.619
 more motivated rents agricultural land to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.940
 a few kilometers from the championship and 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.110
 deliver whole days of 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.890
 plowing during the three weeks 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.890
 preceding the competition 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.980
 after three hours of toil under a 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.150
 lead sunshine albert turn the coach off 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.280
 the team of France who always 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.190
 supported yves indulge in the first 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.110
 analyzes the performance today is 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.150
 a little bit less compared to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.610
 the habit 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.030
 he made some small mistakes and 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.470
 then the difficulty of the field in fact that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.730
 he worked I would say below 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.650
 his level what he can do 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.950
 much better the problem he's going to have 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.959
 he's going to have a judgment that's going to be a 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.519
 little bit less on his teenager his 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.010
 first try to start because they 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.170
 are not the same width they are not 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.459
 regular so he will lose takes 4.1 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.129
 already at that level while his 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.629
 opening was relatively correct and 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.849
 then at the lab level he had a 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.140
 problem we will determine later I 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.870
 do not know where it comes from to the body I do not 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.889
 can no longer look at the loan but it has 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.760
 otherwise they are also regular so 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.319
 Regulation asks to see signs 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.489
 absolutely the same width of an engine 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.959
 and that's not the case everywhere 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.250
 many competitors today from 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.659
 problems since Thursday the ground of 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.879
 relatively difficult to master 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.650
 despite the ranking predictions for 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.720
 this final is the scottish scoop 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.609
 the gold medal the french got 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.939
 that the 9th place of the plowing contest at 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.040
 dish 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.599
 a disappointment for yves who was hoping 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.069
 keep a place on the podium this 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.659
 year 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.220
 a disappointment certainly but that does not entangle 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.750
 in no way the will of yves and albert 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.040
 who is already planning to train 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.980
 more for the next 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.980
 qualifications scheduled for spring 2015
