they do have DNA this is yellow instead
of<00:01:50.549> black<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.000> there's<00:01:51.149> no<00:01:51.390> DNA<00:01:51.780> no<00:01:52.590> so

there's no DNA it won't have any mention
of<00:01:55.740> dimensions<00:01:56.189> anywhere<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.240> won't<00:01:57.630> be

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
of dimensions anywhere so that won't be

anything about DNA or bakugan dimensions

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.920 
anything about DNA or bakugan dimensions
so<00:02:02.520> there's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> few<00:02:03.420> different<00:02:03.479> ways<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.869> can

so there's a few different ways you can

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.660 
so there's a few different ways you can
tell<00:02:04.170> if<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.860> does<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> doesn't<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.490> DNA

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
tell if it does it doesn't have DNA

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520 
tell if it does it doesn't have DNA
without<00:02:06.000> tribunal<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.750> tell<00:02:07.140> where<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.500> on

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
without tribunal is tell where it is on

our ventus taylean there and get our
little<00:02:22.200> gift<00:02:22.379> card<00:02:22.650> here<00:02:22.970> yep<00:02:25.370> that'd<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.610> the

little gift card here yep that'd be the
metal<00:02:26.909> gate<00:02:27.060> card<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.540> let's<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.410> how<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.530> go

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
metal gate card and let's see how we go

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.789 
metal gate card and let's see how we go
kinda<00:02:30.840> hard<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:30.989> do<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.349> table<00:02:31.650> here

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
kinda hard to do on the table here

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.039 
kinda hard to do on the table here
that's<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> set<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.849> here<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.360> here<00:02:33.900> is

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
that's going to set on here so here is

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.470 
that's going to set on here so here is
the<00:02:34.230> Rapa<00:02:34.440> later<00:02:35.720> see<00:02:36.720> how<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.900> opens<00:02:37.049> up<00:02:37.470> there

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.350 

so<00:02:42.480> sprains<00:02:43.470> out<00:02:43.680> some<00:02:44.129> ranch<00:02:45.060> or<00:02:45.150> what<00:02:45.269> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
so sprains out some ranch or what to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.110 
so sprains out some ranch or what to
call<00:02:45.540> uh<00:02:45.569> mine<00:02:46.129> some<00:02:47.129> sort<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.370> winds<00:02:47.670> this

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
call uh mine some sort of winds this

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.640 
call uh mine some sort of winds this
actually<00:02:48.510> causes<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.930> big<00:02:49.079> opening<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
actually causes a big opening in the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.170 
actually causes a big opening in the
front<00:02:49.890> there<00:02:50.129> all<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.670> stuff<00:02:50.849> that's<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
front there all the stuff that's in the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.140 
front there all the stuff that's in the
back<00:02:51.359> was<00:02:52.019> up<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.440> front<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.950> pops<00:02:53.849> out

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
back was up in the front and pops out

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.390 
back was up in the front and pops out
into<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> back<00:02:54.989> portion<00:02:55.410> its<00:02:56.310> G<00:02:56.670> value<00:02:58.310> 280<00:02:59.310> G

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
into the back portion its G value 280 G

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.180 
into the back portion its G value 280 G
looks<00:02:59.819> like<00:03:00.739> there<00:03:01.739> we<00:03:01.859> go

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
looks like there we go

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.000 
looks like there we go
280<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.150> looks<00:03:06.299> like<00:03:06.359> this<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:07.319> very<00:03:07.560> back

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
280 and so looks like this the very back

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.630 
280 and so looks like this the very back
tail<00:03:08.400> fin<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:09.109> poseable<00:03:10.109> to<00:03:10.230> extent<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.459> can

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
tail fin is poseable to extent you can

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.970 
tail fin is poseable to extent you can
put<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.000> straight<00:03:12.390> up<00:03:12.420> or<00:03:13.260> cue<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.769> point

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
put it straight up or cue a point

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.240 
put it straight up or cue a point
forward<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:18.440> can't<00:03:19.440> really<00:03:19.530> tell<00:03:19.919> them<00:03:20.099> the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
forward I can't really tell them the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.759 
forward I can't really tell them the
picture<00:03:20.730> looks<00:03:20.970> like<00:03:21.030> almost<00:03:21.930> looks<00:03:22.169> emotion

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
picture looks like almost looks emotion

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.000 
picture looks like almost looks emotion
in<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.919> back<00:03:23.069> there<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.169> right<00:03:25.169> after<00:03:25.560> chosen

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
in the back there so right after chosen

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.569 
in the back there so right after chosen
the<00:03:26.099> popping<00:03:26.489> open<00:03:26.910> motion<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:29.340> let's

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
the popping open motion so and let's

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.890 
the popping open motion so and let's
even<00:03:29.760> figure<00:03:29.940> out<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> best<00:03:30.239> way<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.510> get<00:03:30.810> our

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
even figure out the best way to get our

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.780 
even figure out the best way to get our
clothes<00:03:31.290> then<00:03:31.769> oh<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.590> actually<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:35.760> whole

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
clothes then oh so actually the whole

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.470 
clothes then oh so actually the whole
thing<00:03:36.269> swings<00:03:36.840> forward<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.700> looks<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.269> we

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
thing swings forward so looks like we

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.780 
thing swings forward so looks like we
can<00:03:39.630> just<00:03:39.660> ah

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
can just ah

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.720 
can just ah
so<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.599> tail<00:03:42.810> fin<00:03:43.109> drop<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.190> pointer

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
so for the tail fin drop the pointer

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.610 
so for the tail fin drop the pointer
well<00:03:45.389> I<00:03:45.540> guess<00:03:45.750> put<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.109> bigger<00:03:46.260> part<00:03:46.500> down

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
well I guess put the bigger part down

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.140 
well I guess put the bigger part down
first<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.220> then<00:03:47.280> pull<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.609> air<00:03:47.669> part<00:03:47.940> back<00:03:48.120> in

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
first and then pull the air part back in

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.319 
first and then pull the air part back in
and<00:03:48.599> then<00:03:49.349> just<00:03:49.650> swing<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.669> away<00:03:50.819> around<00:03:51.090> like

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
and then just swing it away around like

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.440 
and then just swing it away around like
that<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.810> actually<00:03:52.380> locks<00:03:52.560> into<00:03:52.829> place<00:03:53.040> and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
that it actually locks into place and

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.180 
that it actually locks into place and
then<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.989> fins<00:03:55.319> or<00:03:55.620> winds<00:03:55.919> right<00:03:56.040> now<00:03:56.069> a

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
then the fins or winds right now a

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.940 
then the fins or winds right now a
column<00:03:56.989> looks<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.200> they<00:03:58.319> should<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.680> snap

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
column looks like they should just snap

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.240 
column looks like they should just snap
right<00:03:59.250> in<00:04:00.680> perhaps<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.859> have<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.160> to

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
right in perhaps you have to have to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.940 
right in perhaps you have to have to
close<00:04:02.459> those<00:04:02.669> in<00:04:02.879> first<00:04:03.470> let's<00:04:04.470> try<00:04:04.769> that

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
close those in first let's try that

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.550 
close those in first let's try that
again<00:04:05.010> then<00:04:06.440> so<00:04:07.440> okay<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.290> right<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
again then so okay so right in the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.640 
again then so okay so right in the
wayans<00:04:10.799> first<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.900> then<00:04:12.900> bring<00:04:13.199> that<00:04:13.379> part

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
wayans first and then bring that part

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.490 
wayans first and then bring that part
down<00:04:14.030> then<00:04:15.030> hold<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.629> all<00:04:15.720> together<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.410> just

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
down then hold it all together I just

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.610 
down then hold it all together I just
swing<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.099> back<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:18.079> so<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.169> appears<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.560> be

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
swing it back in so that appears to be

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.470 
swing it back in so that appears to be
the<00:04:19.769> easiest<00:04:20.489> way<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.669> go<00:04:20.849> about<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.209> then

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
the easiest way to go about that then

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.270 
the easiest way to go about that then
then<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.930> Pirates<00:04:23.410> trap<00:04:23.590> later<00:04:23.860> one<00:04:24.100> more

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
then the Pirates trap later one more

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.960 
then the Pirates trap later one more
time<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.700> there<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.150> at<00:04:28.440> 280<00:04:29.440> G<00:04:29.970> so

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
time and there it is at 280 G so

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.450 
time and there it is at 280 G so
