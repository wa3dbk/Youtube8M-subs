00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
we go so this first screen side as you

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.450 
we go so this first screen side as you
see<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.500> know<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:06.710> pretty<00:01:06.860> normal<00:01:07.040> do<00:01:07.280> but

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
see you know it's pretty normal do but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.490 
see you know it's pretty normal do but
actually<00:01:07.880> if<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.030> look<00:01:08.060> closely<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.869> texture

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
actually if you look closely the texture

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.370 
actually if you look closely the texture
for<00:01:10.100> leather<00:01:10.640> armor<00:01:11.150> is<00:01:11.270> actually<00:01:11.750> change<00:01:12.110> so

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
for leather armor is actually change so

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.690 
for leather armor is actually change so
it's<00:01:12.560> pretty<00:01:12.830> cool<00:01:13.010> yet<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:13.490> know<00:01:13.610> it

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's pretty cool yet it you know it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.580 
it's pretty cool yet it you know it
looks<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.909> lot<00:01:14.000> better<00:01:14.210> now<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.689> then<00:01:15.079> also<00:01:15.289> in

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
looks a lot better now and then also in

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.709 
looks a lot better now and then also in
his<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.159> know<00:01:16.280> it's<00:01:16.549> in<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:16.850> bar<00:01:17.090> he's

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
his it you know it's in a bar he's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.929 
his it you know it's in a bar he's
holding<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.380> mask<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.159> I'm<00:01:19.430> actually<00:01:19.609> going<00:01:19.820> to

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
holding a mask and I'm actually going to

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.819 
holding a mask and I'm actually going to
another<00:01:20.270> screenshot<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.409> one<00:01:21.590> actually

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
another screenshot and this one actually

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.340 
another screenshot and this one actually
shows<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.820> mask<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.329> on<00:01:23.539> him<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.960> as<00:01:24.170> you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
shows that the mask is on him and as you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.840 
shows that the mask is on him and as you
see<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.680> just<00:01:24.799> put<00:01:24.859> it<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.280> normal<00:01:25.460> slot

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
see you just put it in a normal slot

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.910 
see you just put it in a normal slot
like<00:01:26.119> armor<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.689> you<00:01:27.109> can<00:01:27.289> wear<00:01:27.469> it<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:27.770> that's

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
like armor and you can wear it so that's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.779 
like armor and you can wear it so that's
pretty<00:01:28.100> cool<00:01:28.189> annihilated<00:01:28.670> in<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
pretty cool annihilated in the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.849 
pretty cool annihilated in the
background<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.270> can<00:01:29.390> see<00:01:29.450> little<00:01:29.840> jungle<00:01:30.170> but

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
background you can see little jungle but

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.830 
background you can see little jungle but
I'll<00:01:30.979> get<00:01:31.159> more<00:01:31.250> into<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:31.490> later<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.600> moving

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
I'll get more into that later so moving

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.029 
I'll get more into that later so moving
into<00:01:33.049> this<00:01:33.170> one<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.469> actually<00:01:33.740> have<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:33.920> new

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
into this one we actually have the new

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.349 
into this one we actually have the new
tutorial<00:01:34.609> world<00:01:34.789> have<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.060> couple<00:01:35.299> of

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
tutorial world have a couple of

options and then we move in on into the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.180 
options and then we move in on into the
jungles<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:15.049> pictures<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.590> little<00:03:15.680> bit<00:03:15.859> dark

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
actually like it you know look it

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.610 
actually like it you know look it
definitely<00:03:47.209> looks<00:03:47.419> a<00:03:47.480> lot<00:03:47.599> better<00:03:47.870> than<00:03:48.500> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
definitely looks a lot better than the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.520 
definitely looks a lot better than the
last<00:03:48.650> one<00:03:49.099> but<00:03:49.569> moving<00:03:50.569> on<00:03:50.690> we're<00:03:51.230> gonna<00:03:51.349> move

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
last one but moving on we're gonna move

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.409 
last one but moving on we're gonna move
on<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.980> another<00:03:52.099> jungle<00:03:52.549> this<00:03:52.910> one<00:03:53.150> or<00:03:53.389> another

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
on to another jungle this one or another

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.089 
on to another jungle this one or another
jungle<00:03:53.870> screenshot<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.620> one<00:03:54.769> actually<00:03:54.889> has

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
jungle screenshot this one actually has

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.339 
jungle screenshot this one actually has
an<00:03:55.519> ocelot<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.359> I<00:03:56.569> like<00:03:56.870> i<00:03:56.930> said<00:03:57.139> i'll<00:03:57.260> be

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
an ocelot and I like i said i'll be

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.990 
an ocelot and I like i said i'll be
doing<00:03:57.470> in<00:03:57.769> depth<00:03:57.980> when<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.250> slack<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.760> all<00:03:58.819> that

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
doing in depth when I slack and all that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.990 
doing in depth when I slack and all that
stuff<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.500> look<00:04:00.500> forward<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.859> that<00:04:00.919> but<00:04:01.699> I

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
stuff so look forward to that but I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.030 
stuff so look forward to that but I
think<00:04:02.540> they<00:04:02.720> actually<00:04:02.750> they<00:04:03.560> wind<00:04:03.739> up<00:04:03.829> killing

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
think they actually they wind up killing

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.319 
think they actually they wind up killing
this<00:04:04.250> one<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.519> was<00:04:04.579> pretty<00:04:04.730> fun<00:04:04.970> in<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.150> live

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
this one it was pretty fun in the live

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.990 
this one it was pretty fun in the live
stream<00:04:05.599> but<00:04:06.199> pretty<00:04:06.889> cool<00:04:07.099> ocelots<00:04:07.669> and<00:04:07.910> which

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
stream but pretty cool ocelots and which

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.270

one<00:04:08.209> in<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.359> way<00:04:08.510> right<00:04:08.720> there<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.169> then<00:04:10.099> we're

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
one in a way right there and then we're

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.619 
one in a way right there and then we're
going<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.430> move<00:04:10.489> into<00:04:10.639> the<00:04:10.910> cocoa<00:04:11.419> beans
