00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.340
 adding each time to the near strand 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.380
 new hair and loose hair that is 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.320
 twist our strands add 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.369
 a little hair to the near strand 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.369
 we twist and continue in the same spirit 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.790
