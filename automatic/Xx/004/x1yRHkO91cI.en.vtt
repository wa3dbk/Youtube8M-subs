00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
playstation 3 is essentially a blu-ray

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.779 
playstation 3 is essentially a blu-ray
player<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.420> an<00:00:25.109> exclusives<00:00:25.800> machine<00:00:26.340> because

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
player and an exclusives machine because

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.339 
player and an exclusives machine because
the<00:00:26.939> PlayStation<00:00:27.570> clearly<00:00:27.930> has<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.109> best

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the PlayStation clearly has the best

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.080 
the PlayStation clearly has the best
exclusives<00:00:29.010> because<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.310> actually<00:00:29.460> has<00:00:29.789> some

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
exclusives because it actually has some

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.520 
exclusives because it actually has some
zing<00:00:30.840> um<00:00:31.579> but<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:32.940> my<00:00:33.120> xbox<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:34.500> I

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
zing um but you know my xbox is what I

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.020 
zing um but you know my xbox is what I
like<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> play<00:00:34.920> online<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> service

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
like to play online because the service

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.209 
like to play online because the service
is<00:00:36.149> better<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> should<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.320> prefer<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
is better as it should be I prefer the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.790 
is better as it should be I prefer the
control<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> achievements<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.050> nine

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
control I like the achievements and nine

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.619 
control I like the achievements and nine
times<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.309> ten<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.760> multi-platform<00:00:42.239> game

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
times out of ten a multi-platform game

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.200 
times out of ten a multi-platform game
will<00:00:42.840> probably<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.230> better<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.280> xbox<00:00:44.760> 360

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
will probably be better on the xbox 360

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.520 
will probably be better on the xbox 360
because<00:00:45.329> that's<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> way<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.079> code<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
because that's the way they code the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.470 
because that's the way they code the
game<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> playstation<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> difficult

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
game and the playstation is difficult

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
game and the playstation is difficult
for<00:00:48.539> developers<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.170> code<00:00:49.469> too<00:00:49.739> hence<00:00:50.250> why<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
for developers to code too hence why it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
for developers to code too hence why it
looks<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> little<00:00:51.120> bit<00:00:51.300> worse<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.660> little<00:00:51.870> bit

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
looks a little bit worse a little bit

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
looks a little bit worse a little bit
darker<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.379> playstation<00:00:52.949> 3<00:00:53.100> now

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
darker on the playstation 3 now

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.779 
darker on the playstation 3 now
regardless<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.020> don't<00:00:55.230> know

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
regardless of that if you don't know

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
regardless of that if you don't know
games<00:00:56.789> these<00:00:57.059> days<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.719> getting<00:00:57.809> fucking

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
games these days are getting fucking

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
games these days are getting fucking
huge<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> gigabytes<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
huge in the in the gigabytes and the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.799 
huge in the in the gigabytes and the
megabytes<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.649> whatever<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> fuck<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.390> if

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
megabytes and whatever the fuck and if

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
megabytes and whatever the fuck and if
you<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.710> PlayStation<00:01:05.309> 3<00:01:05.610> games

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
you don't know the PlayStation 3 games

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.390 
you don't know the PlayStation 3 games
run<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.080> call<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> blu-ray<00:01:07.830> disc<00:01:08.159> which

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
run on what we call a blu-ray disc which

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.170 
run on what we call a blu-ray disc which
I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.180> hold<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.600> about<00:01:09.810> 50<00:01:10.170> gig<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
I think can hold up to about 50 gig of

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.700 
I think can hold up to about 50 gig of
space<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.689> there's<00:01:12.990> no<00:01:13.110> game<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> has

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
space now there's no game that has

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
space now there's no game that has
probably<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.130> probably<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.880> no<00:01:15.060> game<00:01:15.299> than

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
probably there probably is no game than

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.740 
probably there probably is no game than
is<00:01:15.600> used<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.170> 50<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:17.970> they

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
is used that for 50 but if they do they

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.800 
is used that for 50 but if they do they
have<00:01:18.990> 50<00:01:19.409> gig<00:01:19.710> an<00:01:19.950> Xbox<00:01:20.549> disc<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.299> now<00:01:21.540> use<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
have 50 gig an Xbox disc which now use a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
have 50 gig an Xbox disc which now use a
Microsoft<00:01:22.320> proprietary<00:01:22.979> disc<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:23.820> holds

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
Microsoft proprietary disc I think holds

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.749 
Microsoft proprietary disc I think holds
seven<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> eight<00:01:24.780> gigabytes<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.759> sometimes

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
seven to eight gigabytes and sometimes

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.510 
seven to eight gigabytes and sometimes
there<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:27.630> games<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.470> don't<00:01:29.130> fit

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
there are just some games that don't fit

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.840 
there are just some games that don't fit
on<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.790> disc<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.900> those<00:01:31.470> games<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.579> rattle

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
on one disc and those games I can rattle

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.670 
on one disc and those games I can rattle
off<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> few<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> battlefield<00:01:33.659> 3<00:01:34.170> oh<00:01:34.380> sorry

off a few a battlefield 3 oh sorry
that's<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> bad<00:01:35.220> example<00:01:35.369> battlefield<00:01:36.060> 3<00:01:36.240> has

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that's a bad example battlefield 3 has

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.789 
that's a bad example battlefield 3 has
an<00:01:36.479> added<00:01:36.659> texture<00:01:37.049> pack<00:01:37.320> which<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> should

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
an added texture pack which you should

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.109 
an added texture pack which you should
download<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.280> I've<00:01:38.460> played<00:01:38.700> battlefield
