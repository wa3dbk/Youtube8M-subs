face in circular motion like this and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
sometimes it seems like you're not

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.840 
sometimes it seems like you're not
really<00:00:52.440> putting<00:00:52.710> anything<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.370> face<00:00:53.579> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
really putting anything on your face but

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.139 
really putting anything on your face but
really<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.360> does<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:55.379> pretty<00:00:56.309> nice<00:00:56.670> light<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
really it does have pretty nice light to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.000 
really it does have pretty nice light to
medium<00:00:57.300> coverage<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.350> doesn't<00:00:58.739> feel

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
medium coverage and it doesn't feel

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.779 
medium coverage and it doesn't feel
heavy<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.640> your<00:01:00.329> face<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.309> as<00:01:02.309> I'm<00:01:02.489> applying

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
heavy on your face and as I'm applying

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.850 
heavy on your face and as I'm applying
it<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.750> already<00:01:04.229> had<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it right now I actually already had it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950 
it right now I actually already had it
on<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.299> makeup<00:01:06.780> on

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
on as you can see I have my makeup on

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960 
on as you can see I have my makeup on
let<00:01:07.290> me<00:01:07.439> show<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> looks<00:01:08.640> like

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
let me show you what it looks like

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.920 
let me show you what it looks like
blended<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.700> blends<00:01:12.090> into<00:01:12.360> your<00:01:12.600> skin

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
blended in it just blends into your skin

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
blended in it just blends into your skin
really<00:01:13.170> nicely<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.340> becomes<00:01:14.729> part<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
really nicely like it becomes part of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
really nicely like it becomes part of
your<00:01:15.270> skin<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.680> nice<00:01:16.860> thing<00:01:17.130> about

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
your skin which is the nice thing about

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.670 
your skin which is the nice thing about
its<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.549> downside<00:01:18.090> about<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
its the downside about it is that you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.859 
its the downside about it is that you
have<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> shake<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.360> comes<00:01:21.630> out

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
have to shake it and then it comes out

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.350 
have to shake it and then it comes out
in<00:01:22.110> an<00:01:22.530> awkward<00:01:22.740> way<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.759> sprays<00:01:24.150> out

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
in an awkward way like it sprays out

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.260 
in an awkward way like it sprays out
like<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> foam<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:26.310> guess<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> only<00:01:26.939> way<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
like a foam and I guess the only way you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.179 
like a foam and I guess the only way you
can<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.540> apply<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.290> your<00:01:28.320> face<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.979> with

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
can really apply it on your face is with

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.490 
can really apply it on your face is with
your<00:01:29.369> fingers<00:01:29.880> unless<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> use<00:01:31.470> one

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
your fingers unless you want to use one

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.350 
your fingers unless you want to use one
of<00:01:31.710> those<00:01:31.890> sponges<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:33.119> think

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
of those sponges but then I don't think

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.060 
of those sponges but then I don't think
it<00:01:33.450> would<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.689> very<00:01:33.900> effective<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it would be very effective if you do it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.600 
it would be very effective if you do it
that<00:01:35.340> way<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:37.259> guess<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> coverage<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.369> not

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
that way and I guess the coverage is not

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.880 
that way and I guess the coverage is not
full<00:01:39.240> coverage<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.290> those<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.740> who

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
full coverage but for those of you who

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.999 
full coverage but for those of you who
just<00:01:41.040> want<00:01:41.340> light<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.150> medium<00:01:42.270> coverage<00:01:43.009> for

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
just want light to medium coverage for

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.620 
just want light to medium coverage for
everyday<00:01:44.430> wear<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.299> would<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
everyday wear then this would be a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
everyday wear then this would be a
really<00:01:45.869> nice<00:01:46.170> foundation<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.340> actually

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
really nice foundation and it actually

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
really nice foundation and it actually
makes<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.149> skin<00:01:48.210> look<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.930> nice<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
makes my skin look really nice and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.929 
makes my skin look really nice and
smooth<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.829> besides<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:50.759> am<00:01:50.850> i

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
smooth and besides that what am i

and I've been using it a lot I really
like<00:02:27.099> it<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:28.060> glides<00:02:28.569> on<00:02:28.780> really

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
like it because it glides on really

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.680
