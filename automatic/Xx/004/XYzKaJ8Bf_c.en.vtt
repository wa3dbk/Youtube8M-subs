need<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.879> clear<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.739> getting

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
need to clear and that are just getting

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.030

harder<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.430> harder

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
harder and harder

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.089 
harder and harder
harder<00:02:12.219> for<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:14.170> should<00:02:14.560> be<00:02:14.709> quite<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
harder for you it should be quite the

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.619 
harder for you it should be quite the
challenge<00:02:15.129> but<00:02:15.700> at<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.909> same<00:02:16.090> time<00:02:16.269> I<00:02:16.329> feel

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
challenge but at the same time I feel

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.899
