the first of which is spell write by
Blake<00:02:39.170> Charlton<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.890> yes<00:02:41.610> Blake<00:02:42.090> Shelton

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600

Blake Charlton I think yes Blake Shelton
this<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.930> obviously<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.350> library<00:02:43.800> book<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.130> it's

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
this is obviously a library book so it's

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.470 
this is obviously a library book so it's
got<00:02:44.460> stickers<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.940> things<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.210> that<00:02:45.270> I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
got stickers and things like that I

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.410 
got stickers and things like that I
believe<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.930> magic<00:02:46.080> system<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.920> world

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
believe the magic system in this world

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.840 
believe the magic system in this world
involves<00:02:48.420> spell<00:02:49.050> casters<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.590> write<00:02:50.280> down<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
involves spell casters to write down the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.270 
involves spell casters to write down the
spells<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.870> write<00:02:52.050> them<00:02:52.170> into<00:02:52.290> text<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:53.100> order

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
spells to write them into text in order

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.470 
spells to write them into text in order
to<00:02:53.460> create<00:02:53.730> them<00:02:53.970> or<00:02:54.120> something<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.420> that

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
to create them or something like that

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.210 
to create them or something like that
I'm<00:02:54.660> not<00:02:54.750> entirely<00:02:54.960> sure<00:02:55.080> I'll<00:02:55.710> find<00:02:55.890> out<00:02:56.070> when

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
I'm not entirely sure I'll find out when

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.010 
I'm not entirely sure I'll find out when
I<00:02:56.250> read<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.240> main<00:02:57.420> character<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:57.870> this

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
I read it but the main character if this

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.380 
I read it but the main character if this
one<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.440> dyslexic<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.640> obviously<00:02:59.970> his<00:03:00.150> spell

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
one is dyslexic so obviously his spell

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.600 
one is dyslexic so obviously his spell
casting<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> little<00:03:01.590> unreliable<00:03:02.340> and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
casting is a little unreliable and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.490 
casting is a little unreliable and
troublesome<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.780> don't<00:03:04.050> really<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.290> too<00:03:04.470> much

as you can see it's a black-and-white

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.140 
as you can see it's a black-and-white

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
Harry take to Hogwarts and I've never

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.060 
Harry take to Hogwarts and I've never
I've<00:03:30.630> never<00:03:30.930> seen<00:03:31.200> these<00:03:31.350> before<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.770> my<00:03:31.860> life

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
I've never seen these before in my life

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.060 
I've never seen these before in my life
and<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.810> needed<00:03:34.020> I<00:03:34.380> needed<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.890> take<00:03:35.010> it

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
and I just I needed I needed to take it

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.610 
and I just I needed I needed to take it
at<00:03:35.880> I'm<00:03:36.480> thinking<00:03:36.960> that<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:37.200> one<00:03:37.350> must<00:03:37.530> have

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
at I'm thinking that this one must have

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.020 
at I'm thinking that this one must have
been<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.830> donation<00:03:38.340> as<00:03:38.430> well<00:03:38.460> because<00:03:38.850> there's

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
been a donation as well because there's

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.910 
been a donation as well because there's
no<00:03:39.120> library<00:03:39.360> stickers<00:03:39.870> or<00:03:40.110> anything<00:03:40.680> like

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
no library stickers or anything like

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.680 
no library stickers or anything like
that<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.580> think<00:03:41.820> someone<00:03:42.240> dropped<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.540> off

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that so I think someone dropped this off

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.390 
that so I think someone dropped this off
and<00:03:43.430> yeah<00:03:44.630> now<00:03:45.630> I've<00:03:45.810> got<00:03:46.050> another<00:03:46.410> copy<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:47.280> a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.980 
and yeah now I've got another copy of a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.860 
I'll probably end up buying my own copy
and<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:56.280> one<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:56.670> private<00:03:57.210> peaceful<00:03:57.690> by

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
and that one is a private peaceful by

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.720 
and that one is a private peaceful by
Michael<00:03:58.380> Morpurgo

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
Michael Morpurgo

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.280 
Michael Morpurgo
the<00:04:00.030> main<00:04:00.150> character<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.660> one<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.960> Thomas

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
the main character of this one is Thomas

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.660 
the main character of this one is Thomas
peaceful<00:04:01.710> and<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:01.890> think<00:04:02.070> this<00:04:02.160> book<00:04:02.310> centers

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
peaceful and I think this book centers

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.360 
peaceful and I think this book centers
around<00:04:02.850> world<00:04:03.690> war<00:04:03.810> one<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.920> think<00:04:04.980> kind<00:04:05.340> of

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
around world war one and I think kind of

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.280 
around world war one and I think kind of
like<00:04:05.430> his<00:04:05.700> memories<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.750> battlefield<00:04:06.990> and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
like his memories of the battlefield and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.960 
like his memories of the battlefield and
things<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:07.800> not<00:04:08.220> entirely<00:04:08.520> sure<00:04:08.670> but

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
things like that not entirely sure but

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.430 
things like that not entirely sure but
it's<00:04:09.120> quite<00:04:09.240> a<00:04:09.270> short<00:04:09.450> book<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.870> I'm<00:04:10.170> really

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
it's quite a short book and I'm really

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.600 
it's quite a short book and I'm really
looking<00:04:10.680> forward<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.920> reading<00:04:11.100> this<00:04:11.220> one<00:04:11.370> the
