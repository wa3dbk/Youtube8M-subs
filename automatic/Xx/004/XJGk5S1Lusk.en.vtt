00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
believe I get out of school on June 18th
but<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.329> sure<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.750> second<00:00:55.110> question

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
but I'm not for sure the second question

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
but I'm not for sure the second question
is<00:00:55.649> beaches<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.280> pools<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.420> depends<00:00:57.870> on

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
is beaches or pools and it depends on

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
is beaches or pools and it depends on
the<00:00:58.050> time<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.440> did<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.890> midday<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.309> would

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
rather be at the pool because usually

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
rather be at the pool because usually
the<00:01:01.530> beach<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.039> really<00:01:02.370> crowded<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.879> hot

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
in the middle of the day but if it's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.740
