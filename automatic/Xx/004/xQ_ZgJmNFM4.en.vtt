mine happens to be it there's no Cali
converter<00:01:04.260> online<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.430> where<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> would

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
converter online which is where it would

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.690 
converter online which is where it would
go<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.340> then<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:10.159> is<00:01:11.159> what

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
go right here and then over here is what

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.140 
go right here and then over here is what
you're<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:13.340> all<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> tools<00:01:14.880> all

you're going to have all the tools all
the<00:01:15.420> extra<00:01:15.840> parts<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.270> bhr<00:01:18.270> has

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the extra parts that bhr has

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.090 
the extra parts that bhr has
gladly<00:01:19.820> included<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> kit<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.630> nice

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.560 

so<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> side<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
so this is the side that it's going to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.830 
so this is the side that it's going to
be<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.530> headers<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:30.540> got<00:01:30.689> your

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
be going to the headers and you got your

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 
be going to the headers and you got your
three<00:01:31.020> bolt<00:01:31.320> pattern<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.920> bolts<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
three bolt pattern it bolts right up to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.429 
three bolt pattern it bolts right up to
the<00:01:33.180> stock<00:01:33.479> exhaust<00:01:34.640> header<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the stock exhaust header if you have the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.590 
the stock exhaust header if you have the
regular<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.369> or<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:39.119> bolt<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
regular one on there or you can bolt it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.450 
regular one on there or you can bolt it
up<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.460> aftermarket<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:43.070> going<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.189> down

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
up to a aftermarket one going on down

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.960 
up to a aftermarket one going on down
you<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:46.399> your<00:01:48.320> temperature<00:01:49.320> sensor<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.790> is

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
you have your temperature sensor this is

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.510 
you have your temperature sensor this is
where<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.750> sensor<00:01:52.320> goes<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.860> might<00:01:53.280> get

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
where the sensor goes now you might get

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.600 
where the sensor goes now you might get
a<00:01:53.630> check<00:01:54.630> engine<00:01:54.840> light<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.579> not

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
a check engine light on if you do not

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.469 
a check engine light on if you do not
have<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> catalytic<00:01:57.689> converter<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.700> be

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
have the catalytic converter in it so be

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.020 
have the catalytic converter in it so be
aware<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:03.229> going<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.409> down<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.850> your

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
aware of that going on down this is your

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.779 
aware of that going on down this is your
resignate<00:02:06.630> ER<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.099> then<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> other

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
resignate ER and then this is the other

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.150 
resignate ER and then this is the other
side<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.690> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:10.649> catback

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
side that's going to go to your catback

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.290 
side that's going to go to your catback
so<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> rest<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.840> exhaust

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
so the rest of the exhaust

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
so the rest of the exhaust
systemthat<00:02:13.960> after<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.910> mid-pipe<00:02:15.910> or<00:02:16.320> regular

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
systemthat after the mid-pipe or regular

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.260 
systemthat after the mid-pipe or regular
pipe<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.920> have<00:02:18.190> your<00:02:18.370> cali<00:02:18.670> converter

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
pipe that you have your cali converter

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.870 
pipe that you have your cali converter
attached<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.110> then<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.490> hanger

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
attached to and then this is the hanger

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.440 
attached to and then this is the hanger
so<00:02:22.590> pretty<00:02:23.590> much<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.040> attach<00:02:24.910> this<00:02:25.240> to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
so pretty much you just attach this to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.620 
so pretty much you just attach this to
where<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.900> stock<00:02:26.350> exhaust<00:02:27.310> mid<00:02:27.850> pipe<00:02:28.060> usually

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
where the stock exhaust mid pipe usually

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.630 
where the stock exhaust mid pipe usually
goes<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.290> hangs<00:02:30.130> on<00:02:30.370> there<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:30.940> support<00:02:32.640> so

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
goes and hangs on there for support so

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.270 
goes and hangs on there for support so
let's<00:02:33.850> take<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> look<00:02:34.300> closer<00:02:35.110> at<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.800> actual

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
let's take a look closer at the actual

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.930 
let's take a look closer at the actual
parts<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.940> come<00:02:37.180> with<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.280> mid<00:02:39.280> pipe<00:02:39.550> itself

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
parts that come with the mid pipe itself

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.970 
parts that come with the mid pipe itself
from<00:02:40.330> bhr<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.060> open<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.450> up<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.980> you're

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
from bhr so you open it up and you're

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.310 
from bhr so you open it up and you're
going<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.250> have<00:02:45.870> your<00:02:46.870> three<00:02:48.720> lug<00:02:49.720> nuts<00:02:50.020> or

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
going to have your three lug nuts or

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.890 
going to have your three lug nuts or
whatever<00:02:50.980> you'd<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.430> call<00:02:51.760> them<00:02:51.970> with

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
whatever you'd like to call them with

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.330 
whatever you'd like to call them with
Springs<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:54.070> go<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.910> front<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.860> to<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
Springs that go to the front and to the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:11.240 
Springs that go to the front and to the
back<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:09.100> you're<00:03:09.310> also<00:03:09.460> going<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:09.970> get<00:03:10.210> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
back and you're also going to get to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.510 
back and you're also going to get to
both<00:03:12.900> gaskets<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.200> you're<00:03:14.950> going<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.340> need

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
both gaskets that you're going to need

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.990 
both gaskets that you're going to need
so<00:03:15.990> might<00:03:16.990> as<00:03:17.050> well<00:03:17.200> replace<00:03:17.410> them<00:03:17.890> since<00:03:18.850> they

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
so might as well replace them since they

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.160 
so might as well replace them since they
give<00:03:19.180> them<00:03:19.300> two<00:03:19.480> for<00:03:19.690> free<00:03:19.870> with<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.920> kit

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
give them two for free with the kit

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.040 
give them two for free with the kit
let's<00:03:23.170> take<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.380> closer<00:03:23.709> look<00:03:23.860> at<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.400> two<00:03:25.050> ones

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
let's take a closer look at the two ones

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.220 
let's take a closer look at the two ones
that<00:03:26.320> go<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.709> back<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.840> these<00:03:28.989> are<00:03:29.110> gonna

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
that go on the back so these are gonna

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.370 
that go on the back so these are gonna
be<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.500> longer<00:03:29.920> ones<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:31.080> they're<00:03:32.080> going<00:03:32.260> to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
be the longer ones and they're going to

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.880 
be the longer ones and they're going to
be<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:33.010> same<00:03:33.280> exact<00:03:33.700> ones<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.810> get<00:03:35.110> with

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
be the same exact ones that you get with

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.160 
be the same exact ones that you get with
the<00:03:36.070> stock<00:03:36.370> exhaust<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.450> they'll<00:03:37.750> bolt<00:03:37.930> up

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
the stock exhaust so they'll bolt up

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.770 
the stock exhaust so they'll bolt up
nicely<00:03:38.640> what's<00:03:39.640> also<00:03:39.820> nice<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.420> mean<00:03:40.570> those

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
nicely what's also nice I mean those

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.120 
nicely what's also nice I mean those
things<00:03:40.989> they'll<00:03:41.200> probably<00:03:41.380> just<00:03:41.560> break<00:03:41.920> off

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
things they'll probably just break off

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.830 
things they'll probably just break off
anyways<00:03:42.610> while<00:03:43.030> you're<00:03:43.180> trying<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.510> take<00:03:43.630> off

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
anyways while you're trying to take off

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840 
anyways while you're trying to take off
the<00:03:43.989> stock<00:03:44.230> exhaust<00:03:44.680> if<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.160> use<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.580> stock

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
the stock exhaust if you use the stock

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.780 
the stock exhaust if you use the stock
exhaust<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.650> got<00:03:47.800> your<00:03:47.980> washer<00:03:48.520> you

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
exhaust so you just got your washer you

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.570 
exhaust so you just got your washer you
got<00:03:49.000> your<00:03:49.180> nut<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.720> got<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.140> spring<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.770> the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
got your nut you got the spring and the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.970 
got your nut you got the spring and the
custom<00:03:52.060> lug<00:03:52.570> nut<00:03:52.780> or<00:03:52.959> bolt<00:03:53.020> or<00:03:53.560> whatever<00:03:53.830> you

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
custom lug nut or bolt or whatever you

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.500 
custom lug nut or bolt or whatever you
would<00:03:54.130> like<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.520> call<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:57.060> then<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.150> have<00:03:58.330> your

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
would like to call it then you have your

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.810 
would like to call it then you have your
three<00:03:58.840> other<00:03:59.380> ones<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.980> bolts<00:04:00.280> up<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.670> the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
three other ones that bolts up to the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.170 
three other ones that bolts up to the
header<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.920> no<00:04:02.920> Springs<00:04:03.310> on<00:04:03.520> these<00:04:03.700> ones<00:04:03.940> just

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
header and no Springs on these ones just

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.350 
header and no Springs on these ones just
washers<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.350> lock<00:04:05.410> nuts<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.970> regular

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
washers and lock nuts and the regular

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.930 
washers and lock nuts and the regular
bolts<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.170> nuts

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.420 

then<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.330> going<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.780> your<00:04:14.080> 3d<00:04:14.830> donut

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
then this is going to be your 3d donut

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.460 
then this is going to be your 3d donut
or<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:16.000> ring<00:04:16.269> or<00:04:16.510> whatever<00:04:16.630> you'd<00:04:16.959> like<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.140> call

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
or a ring or whatever you'd like to call

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.759 
or a ring or whatever you'd like to call
it

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
it

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.259 
it
well<00:04:18.340> actually<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.730> other<00:04:18.850> one<00:04:19.030> looks<00:04:19.209> like

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
well actually the other one looks like

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.890 
well actually the other one looks like
an<00:04:19.480> O<00:04:19.540> ring<00:04:19.750> but<00:04:20.140> this<00:04:21.130> one<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.640> believe<00:04:21.700> goes<00:04:22.420> to

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
an O ring but this one I believe goes to

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.320 
an O ring but this one I believe goes to
the<00:04:23.230> front<00:04:23.650> by<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.670> header<00:04:26.580> so<00:04:27.580> that's<00:04:27.850> that

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
the front by the header so that's that

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.660 
the front by the header so that's that
and<00:04:28.930> then<00:04:29.590> this<00:04:29.740> one<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:30.340> going<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.000> go<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.320> the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
and then this one is going to go to the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.600 
and then this one is going to go to the
cap<00:04:33.670> back<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:38.190> unfortunately<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.310> actually

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
cap back and unfortunately I actually

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.860 
cap back and unfortunately I actually
purchased<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:42.220> same<00:04:42.490> exact<00:04:42.910> thing<00:04:43.150> before

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
purchased the same exact thing before

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.010 
purchased the same exact thing before
buying<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.470> mid-pipe<00:04:44.860> because<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.790> was<00:04:46.510> just

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
buying the mid-pipe because I was just

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.860 
buying the mid-pipe because I was just
going<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.290> replace<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.800> gaskets<00:04:48.310> anyways<00:04:48.870> so

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
going to replace the gaskets anyways so

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.950 
going to replace the gaskets anyways so
now<00:04:50.260> I<00:04:50.740> got<00:04:50.950> two<00:04:51.130> sets<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.520> them<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:52.750> can<00:04:52.930> find

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960
