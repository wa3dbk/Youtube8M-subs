00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 stoker 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.290
 many people work in the line of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.529
 steam locomotives all have 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.090
 different jobs all over the world 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.610
 work as a team so that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.650
 locomotives arrive on time and so that 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.130
 passengers and workers are 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.130
 insurance 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.150
 the stoker has a very hard job 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.610
 important in the locomotive line of 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.200
 steam is called that because he 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.530
 handles the fire in the boiler of the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.530
 locomotive 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 the fire of the boiler makes the steam that 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.890
 the locomotive used to advance 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.429
 early in the morning the stoker 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.429
 clean the boiler 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.860
 then he makes the new campfire with a lot 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.650
 watch out 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:12.270
 to read a bit of coal in the boiler 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.719
 then very carefully turn it on 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.719
 and wait until the coal burns 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.719
 intensely 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.509
 while the fire heats the water 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.549
 stoker prepares the rest of the 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.110
 locomotive for the busy day that you 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.240
 wait 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.350
 makes sure that the locomotive has 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.600
 a lot of coal 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.720
 Steam locomotives use a lot 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.300
 coal to make a lot of steam 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.550
 then the stoker makes sure that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.760
 all the levers and buttons work 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.210
 all right 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.990
 once the locomotive is checked 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.080
 It is full of steam and has been polished 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.340
 is ready to work the stoker goes 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.340
 in the cabin with the driver 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.890
 the driver and the stoker work in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.780
 equipment throughout the day 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.490
 the stoker will ensure that the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.240
 driver has all the steam that 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.640
 needs for the locomotive to move forward 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.390
 the work of the stoker is very hot 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.390
 and dusty 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.050
 the stoker also helps to hook 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.050
 unhook the wagons 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.810
 that way the locomotive is ready 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.810
 for each new trip 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.470
 At the end of the day the stoker fills the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.100
 tank one more time and takes the locomotive 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.100
 to the garage 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.459
 then the stoker goes home for a 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.239
 Well-earned rest will return tomorrow 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.239
 very early 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.720
 As you can see the stoker has a 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.720
 very important work
