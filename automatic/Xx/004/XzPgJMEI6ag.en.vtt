know when humans like go down like this

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.969 
know when humans like go down like this
area<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:16.470> they're<00:01:16.740> usually

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
area would be like I'm they're usually

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
area would be like I'm they're usually
like<00:01:17.400> very<00:01:17.700> old<00:01:17.970> facility<00:01:18.780> no<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.049> would<00:01:19.229> go

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
like very old facility no one would go

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.530 
like very old facility no one would go
to<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.740> humans<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.490> randomly<00:01:21.150> drop

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to the humans just like randomly drop

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
to the humans just like randomly drop
over<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> love

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
over here and then it's like a love

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.960 
over here and then it's like a love
infected<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.540> flood<00:01:24.960> okay<00:01:25.590> over<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:25.970> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
infected like flood okay over here so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.270 
infected like flood okay over here so
it'll<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> very<00:01:28.020> close<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> kind<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it'll be very close like this kind of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.429 
it'll be very close like this kind of
Martin<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> free<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.810> Halo<00:01:30.990> 3<00:01:31.110> we

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
Martin when a free because in Halo 3 we

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.929 
Martin when a free because in Halo 3 we
still<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> flood<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.549> make<00:01:32.700> more

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
still have a flood that would make more

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.420 
still have a flood that would make more
sense<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.540> now<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.810> don't<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> lot<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.799> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
sense but now we don't have a lot but it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.850 
sense but now we don't have a lot but it
still<00:01:35.729> works<00:01:36.000> very<00:01:36.479> well<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.930> suppose<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
still works very well I suppose the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.090 
still works very well I suppose the
story<00:01:38.159> thing<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.200> blue<00:01:40.409> team<00:01:40.619> wins<00:01:40.920> in

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
story thing so the blue team wins in

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.160 
story thing so the blue team wins in
here<00:01:41.340> which<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:41.880> infected<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
here which is then infected and the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.499 
here which is then infected and the
humans<00:01:43.560> will<00:01:43.680> screen<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.509> there's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
humans will screen in there and there's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.899 
humans will screen in there and there's
so<00:01:45.840> many<00:01:45.930> ways<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.920> around<00:01:47.280> girl

so many ways you can like go around girl

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.050 
so many ways you can like go around girl
the<00:01:48.060> map<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.600> hold<00:01:49.290> out<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.740> many<00:01:49.920> faces<00:01:50.430> what

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060

and<00:02:09.520> I'm<00:02:09.640> gonna<00:02:09.820> block<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.120> off<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.450> little<00:02:10.810> bit

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
and I'm gonna block it off a little bit

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.260 
and I'm gonna block it off a little bit
more<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:11.710> I'm<00:02:11.920> running<00:02:12.310> low<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.460> resources<00:02:12.730> so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
more but I'm running low on resources so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.610 
more but I'm running low on resources so
i<00:02:13.300> will<00:02:13.570> see<00:02:13.690> what<00:02:13.720> kind<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.080> things<00:02:14.320> i'd<00:02:14.470> be

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620

i will see what kind of things i'd be
using<00:02:14.860> probably<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.370> fines<00:02:15.720> we'll<00:02:16.720> find<00:02:16.930> out<00:02:17.080> i

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
using probably in fines we'll find out i

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.840 
using probably in fines we'll find out i
pretty<00:02:17.500> much<00:02:17.560> used<00:02:17.830> oh<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.250> rocks<00:02:18.520> over<00:02:18.820> here

pretty much used oh the rocks over here
to<00:02:19.150> make<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.600> as<00:02:19.810> rocky<00:02:20.560> as<00:02:20.590> possible<00:02:21.160> this

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
to make it as rocky as possible this

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.820 
to make it as rocky as possible this
room<00:02:22.180> over<00:02:22.330> here<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.600> pretty<00:02:22.780> cool<00:02:22.990> as<00:02:23.440> like<00:02:23.800> a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
room over here is pretty cool as like a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.270 
room over here is pretty cool as like a
purple<00:02:24.370> Rock<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.320> actually<00:02:26.320> as<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> very<00:02:27.010> cool

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
purple Rock and actually as a very cool

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.690 
purple Rock and actually as a very cool
effect<00:02:27.610> into<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.030> surrounding<00:02:28.510> area<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:30.310> I

effect into the surrounding area and I

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.390 
effect into the surrounding area and I
displacement<00:02:31.420> be<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.660> little<00:02:32.400> place

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
displacement be like a little place

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.330 
displacement be like a little place
where<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.880> flood<00:02:34.270> with<00:02:34.480> easy<00:02:34.660> spoon<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:36.280> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
where like flood with easy spoon like a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.550 
where like flood with easy spoon like a
place<00:02:36.700> where<00:02:36.910> them<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.540> don't<00:02:38.290> know<00:02:38.380> what<00:02:38.500> I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
place where them I don't know what I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.860 
place where them I don't know what I
fell<00:02:38.860> open<00:02:39.010> grave<00:02:39.460> mind<00:02:39.790> would<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:40.120> it'll<00:02:40.780> be

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
fell open grave mind would be it'll be

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.600 
fell open grave mind would be it'll be
very<00:02:41.020> good<00:02:41.320> good<00:02:41.830> for<00:02:42.130> these<00:02:42.220> kind<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.550> things

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
very good good for these kind of things

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.300 
very good good for these kind of things
into<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.240> but<00:02:44.080> we<00:02:44.290> don't<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.590> kinetic

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
into it but we don't have a kinetic

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.430 
into it but we don't have a kinetic
knology<00:02:45.700> i'll<00:02:46.000> probably<00:02:46.300> might<00:02:46.960> be<00:02:47.140> able<00:02:47.230> to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
knology i'll probably might be able to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.770 
knology i'll probably might be able to
put<00:02:47.650> something<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.300> normal<00:02:49.570> tools

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780
