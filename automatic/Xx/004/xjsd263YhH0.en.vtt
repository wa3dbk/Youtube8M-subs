00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
know in my case in particular like I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.760 
know in my case in particular like I
wasn't<00:00:53.190> even<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> NHL<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.329> age<00:00:54.449> 30<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.989> you
