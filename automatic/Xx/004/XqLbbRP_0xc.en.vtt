projector<00:01:48.450> room<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.229> didn't<00:01:49.439> actually<00:01:49.530> add

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
projector room and I didn't actually add

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.560 
projector room and I didn't actually add
anything<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.090> didn't<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.450> know

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
anything because I didn't really know

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
anything because I didn't really know
what<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.259> should<00:01:52.950> make<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> projector<00:01:53.640> out<00:01:53.789> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
what I should make the projector out of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.639 
what I should make the projector out of
so<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.119> yeah<00:01:54.210> these<00:01:54.390> suggestions<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.500> go

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.260 
section below but as you can see the
projector<00:01:59.610> would<00:01:59.700> sit<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.000> front<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.210> those
