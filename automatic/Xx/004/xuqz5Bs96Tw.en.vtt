hey guys we're back here at the table of
carburetors<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.689> I'm<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> do<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> kind

there's<00:00:15.000> been<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> lot<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.420> conjecture<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
there's been a lot of conjecture and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
there's been a lot of conjecture and

hundreds no 825 no 850 is now funding a
factor<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.420> there's<00:00:39.600> some<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:40.200> there's

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
factor now there's some I think there's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.580 
factor now there's some I think there's
some<00:00:40.559> people<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:42.020> resell<00:00:43.020> quarter<00:00:43.379> Jets

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
some people that resell quarter Jets

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.700 
some people that resell quarter Jets
like<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> LeBrock<00:00:44.450> that<00:00:45.450> claim<00:00:45.840> than<00:00:46.050> 850<00:00:46.469> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
like a LeBrock that claim than 850 I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.760 
like a LeBrock that claim than 850 I
don't<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:48.140> from<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> factory

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
don't think so but from the factory

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.240 
don't think so but from the factory
there<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.100> only<00:00:50.660> two

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
there was only two

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.459 
there was only two
so<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> hear<00:00:54.449> somebody<00:00:54.870> say<00:00:55.110> otherwise

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so if you hear somebody say otherwise

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.470 
so if you hear somebody say otherwise
they're<00:00:55.949> full<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> they're<00:00:57.270> just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
they're full of that I they're just

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
they're full of that I they're just
guessing<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:59.780> because<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:00.899> sure<00:01:01.320> they

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
guessing at it so because I'm sure they

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.429 
guessing at it so because I'm sure they
probably<00:01:01.649> don't<00:01:01.920> know<00:01:02.070> anyway<00:01:03.229> you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.350> if

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
probably don't know anyway you know if

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.320 
probably don't know anyway you know if
you<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.739> some<00:01:05.010> guys<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.760> bit<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you have some guys a little bit the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.770 
you have some guys a little bit the
other<00:01:06.869> guy<00:01:07.100> 875<00:01:08.100> CFM<00:01:08.909> quarters<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
other guy 875 CFM quarters I think you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.190 
other guy 875 CFM quarters I think you
came<00:01:09.960> off<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.200> big-block<00:01:10.590> Buick<00:01:11.070> well<00:01:12.030> no<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
came off a big-block Buick well no it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
came off a big-block Buick well no it
doesn't<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> 875<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.670> probably<00:01:14.970> did<00:01:15.119> come

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
doesn't have a 875 it probably did come

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.929 
doesn't have a 875 it probably did come
off<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> big<00:01:15.930> might<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.610> most<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.759> those

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
off a big might do it but most of those

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.359 
off a big might do it but most of those
were<00:01:18.270> seven<00:01:18.720> 50s<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.650> were<00:01:19.770> fairly<00:01:20.040> rare

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
were seven 50s there were fairly rare

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
were seven 50s there were fairly rare
ones<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> were<00:01:20.909> eight<00:01:21.119> hundred<00:01:21.799> but<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:24.710> mean

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
ones that were eight hundred but I mean

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
ones that were eight hundred but I mean
I<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.070> these<00:01:26.250> two<00:01:26.490> parts<00:01:26.850> carburetors<00:01:27.360> here

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I got these two parts carburetors here

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
I got these two parts carburetors here
one<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> them<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.170> actually<00:01:28.820> guitar<00:01:29.820> brighter

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
one of them is actually guitar brighter

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.690 
one of them is actually guitar brighter
than<00:01:30.240> others<00:01:30.390> pile<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.409> junk<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:32.490> going

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
than others pile of junk but I'm going

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.310 
than others pile of junk but I'm going

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.010 
now look at see how we're looking
through<00:02:03.740> here<00:02:04.040> see<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.520> got<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:05.000> set<00:02:05.840> that

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
through here see it's got a set that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.370 
through here see it's got a set that
little<00:02:06.640> ring<00:02:07.640> right<00:02:07.939> there<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.929> side<00:02:09.170> of

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
little ring right there on the side of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.669 
little ring right there on the side of
it

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
it

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.010 
it
it's<00:02:10.310> boosters<00:02:10.940> what<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.540> actually<00:02:14.020> see

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
it's boosters what this is actually see

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.199 
it's boosters what this is actually see
how<00:02:15.110> thick<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.380> thing<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:15.980> look<00:02:16.760> at<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> all

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
how thick that thing is look at it all

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.580 
how thick that thing is look at it all
the<00:02:17.239> way<00:02:17.480> around<00:02:19.270> notice<00:02:20.270> its<00:02:20.480> uniform<00:02:21.050> does

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the way around notice its uniform does

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.559 
the way around notice its uniform does
not<00:02:21.769> bulge<00:02:22.040> out<00:02:22.310> anywhere<00:02:22.850> it's<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.330> same

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
not bulge out anywhere it's the same

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.960 
not bulge out anywhere it's the same
thickness<00:02:23.840> as<00:02:24.260> hurt<00:02:24.440> as<00:02:24.680> tire<00:02:25.099> circumference

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
thickness as hurt as tire circumference

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.780 
thickness as hurt as tire circumference
well<00:02:26.810> that's<00:02:27.170> immediately<00:02:28.040> tells<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.610> this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
well that's immediately tells you this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.770 
well that's immediately tells you this
is<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:29.120> 750<00:02:29.959> CFM<00:02:30.170> quarter<00:02:30.830> jet<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:33.069> why<00:02:34.780> okay

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
is a 750 CFM quarter jet so why okay

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.110 
is a 750 CFM quarter jet so why okay
let's<00:02:36.080> look<00:02:36.230> at<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> actual<00:02:36.650> 800<00:02:39.910> here's<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
let's look at the actual 800 here's the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.479 
let's look at the actual 800 here's the
same<00:02:41.390> area<00:02:41.989> an<00:02:42.170> 800<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.069> first<00:02:43.310> thing

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
same area an 800 and the first thing

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.870 
same area an 800 and the first thing
you're<00:02:43.610> going<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.850> notice<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:45.519> see<00:02:46.519> how<00:02:46.700> that

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
you're going to notice is see how that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.039 
you're going to notice is see how that
ring<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.269> thinner<00:02:49.390> that's<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.600> first<00:02:50.840> thing

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
ring is thinner that's the first thing

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.199 
ring is thinner that's the first thing
there's<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.380> tip<00:02:51.590> off<00:02:51.819> looks<00:02:52.819> pretty<00:02:53.030> much<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
there's a tip off looks pretty much the

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.289 
there's a tip off looks pretty much the
same<00:02:53.330> but<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.870> is<00:02:53.900> thinner<00:02:54.790> now<00:02:55.790> look<00:02:56.150> over

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
same but it is thinner now look over

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.059 
same but it is thinner now look over
here<00:02:56.660> that's<00:02:56.930> got<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.140> little<00:02:57.350> baby<00:02:57.500> bump<00:02:57.860> on

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
here that's got a little baby bump on

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.890 
here that's got a little baby bump on
the<00:02:58.190> side<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.670> wall<00:02:58.970> here<00:02:59.329> there's<00:02:59.750> one

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
the side of this wall here there's one

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.810 
the side of this wall here there's one
on<00:03:00.079> each<00:03:00.109> side<00:03:00.290> with<00:03:01.040> my<00:03:01.160> thumb<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.519> cover<00:03:01.730> it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
on each side with my thumb to cover it

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.240 
on each side with my thumb to cover it
but<00:03:01.910> there's<00:03:02.090> one<00:03:02.209> over<00:03:02.329> here<00:03:02.450> too<00:03:03.250> okay

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
but there's one over here too okay

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.670 
but there's one over here too okay
that's<00:03:05.030> an<00:03:05.180> 800<00:03:05.690> that's<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.109> that's<00:03:06.380> how<00:03:06.560> you

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
that's an 800 that's a that's how you

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.979 
that's an 800 that's a that's how you
distinguish<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.430> two<00:03:07.609> of<00:03:07.790> them<00:03:07.940> if<00:03:08.600> it's<00:03:08.780> got

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
distinguish the two of them if it's got

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.650 
distinguish the two of them if it's got
the<00:03:09.109> thick<00:03:09.350> ring<00:03:09.650> with<00:03:10.130> no<00:03:10.280> bump<00:03:10.549> it's<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:10.940> 750

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
the thick ring with no bump it's a 750

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.599 
the thick ring with no bump it's a 750
if<00:03:11.930> it's<00:03:12.200> got<00:03:12.410> thinner<00:03:12.829> ring<00:03:13.100> with<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.489> little

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
if it's got thinner ring with a little

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.880 
if it's got thinner ring with a little
bump<00:03:13.940> out<00:03:14.239> on<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> side<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.079> that's<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:17.890> 808

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
bump out on the side of it that's a 808

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.320 
bump out on the side of it that's a 808
hundreds<00:03:19.310> use<00:03:19.489> me

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.960 

so<00:03:22.990> that's<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.620> cut<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.040> dried<00:03:24.220> folks<00:03:24.610> that's

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
so that's it cut and dried folks that's

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.280 
so that's it cut and dried folks that's
how<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.150> tell<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.450> difference<00:03:25.660> on<00:03:25.960> one<00:03:26.140> they

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
how you tell the difference on one they

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.660 
how you tell the difference on one they
just<00:03:26.560> going<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.770> look<00:03:26.860> down<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.070> throat<00:03:27.340> as

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
just going to look down the throat as

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.060 
just going to look down the throat as
not<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:27.940> damn<00:03:28.300> thing<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.660> do<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.170> secondary's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
not a damn thing to do the secondary's

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.490 
not a damn thing to do the secondary's
of<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:31.590> now<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:32.890> actually<00:03:33.130> does<00:03:33.550> control<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
of it now this actually does control the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.310 
of it now this actually does control the
how<00:03:35.500> much<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.860> flows<00:03:36.300> but<00:03:37.300> that's<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:38.080> function

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
how much it flows but that's a function

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.650 
how much it flows but that's a function
of<00:03:38.590> engine<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.460> how<00:03:39.880> much<00:03:40.060> air<00:03:40.300> flow<00:03:40.600> the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
of engine and how much air flow the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.780 
of engine and how much air flow the
engine<00:03:40.960> requires<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.920> things<00:03:42.100> like<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.310> has

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
engine requires and things like that has

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.920 
engine requires and things like that has
nothing<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.180> do<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.570> carburetor<00:03:43.990> design<00:03:44.400> but

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
nothing to do the carburetor design but

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.690 
nothing to do the carburetor design but
there<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.110> one<00:03:47.290> special<00:03:47.590> carburetor<00:03:48.370> which<00:03:48.580> I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
there is one special carburetor which I

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.250 
there is one special carburetor which I
have<00:03:48.880> my<00:03:49.030> hand<00:03:49.330> on<00:03:49.480> right<00:03:49.720> here<00:03:49.960> which<00:03:50.110> I'm
