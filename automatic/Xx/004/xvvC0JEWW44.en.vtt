00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.049
 I started shooting a place in the sun on 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.240
 4 February it has been broadcast since 12 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.190
 March then entered for this reason 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.099
 in quotes I have very recently 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.099
 started working ten years ago 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 audition but just so I do n't say maybe 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:34.530
 everyone did an audition once 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:37.680
 in the very beautiful life that he won 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.239
 so many prizes and from there they are practically me 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.079
 I am found catapulted into this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.489
 world in short, never having 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.350
 imagined that is when maybe dreamed of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.440
 washing machine but not thinking about it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.440
 arrive 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.960
 open so always used 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.670
 privileged they thought school I thought of 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.520
 having to do a lot of mess like 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.220
 plant is always done in a room I have to 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.500
 say very very lucky 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.390
 so then after that movie that got me 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.550
 launched I started doing one 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.050
 york series to work so i have 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.490
 made various fiction for rai that for me 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.490
 here in Naples I published the team 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.220
 the peculiarity of a place in the sun the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.730
 own planet logo both in the mass 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.560
 on the air that having filmed and is a reality 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.140
 which for me was unknown because 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.250
 however any type of project you do 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.910
 working course at its end 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.310
 lasts 2 3 months 6 months in this 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.920
 character although very much maybe 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.630
 away from you and keep him alive for those 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.760
 two months three months then enough but 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.770
 pull the plug and go instead 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.230
 importance character the strange right 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.440
 because the character must in some 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.060
 way are the limbs warning to 3 or otherwise 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.070
 must draw much from what you are 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.540
 even from what you 've been from that 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.480
 that you would like to enter complete something 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.550
 much of your risk otherwise is 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 difficult to keep daily 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.290
 character that maybe completely 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.750
 the opposite of you to the one for 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.920
 regarding in my experience 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.840
 personal so it's complicated 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.130
 But the continuous character 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.450
 same time it's nice because you go to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.370
 fish in those that are yours 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.239
 true emotions otherwise you would 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:43.129
 fake try to get to the heart 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:47.599
 of people precisely because it is true 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:51.420
 what you say character what you like 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.299
 serene of me has all my adolescence 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.620
 I gave her all her emotions 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.370
 that I had in my adolescence because 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.190
 she is very instinctive she is a bit clumsy 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.019
 and is still tied to the great love of 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.700
 his life is looking for the prince charming 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.829
 that were all things you do 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.769
 really when you are 14 15 years old then 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.420
 maybe with maturity love hello 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.400
 looks love when with eyes to whom 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.890
 more mature more for function one 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.629
 language that is not so beautiful and so 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.840
 as exciting as when you are at the top 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.660
 years and then 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.239
 and so this made her all mine 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.580
 teen's emotions and it's very beautiful 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.580
 see them again and find them every day
