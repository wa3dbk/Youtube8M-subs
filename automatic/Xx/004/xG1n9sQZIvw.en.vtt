00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
right before I got here I thought for a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.060 
right before I got here I thought for a
long<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.350> way<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> labyrinth

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
long time the way out of the labyrinth

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.610 
long time the way out of the labyrinth
was<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.090> pretend<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> did<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.840> exist<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
was to pretend that it did not exist and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.470 
was to pretend that it did not exist and
it<00:00:53.219> pretend<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.059> was<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.480> lost<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.559> home

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.060 

but<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.629> resulted<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.500> lonely<00:01:01.890> life

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
but that resulted in a lonely life

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.039 
but that resulted in a lonely life
accompanied<00:01:02.730> only<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> last<00:01:03.539> words<00:01:03.899> of

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
accompanied only by the last words of

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.940 
accompanied only by the last words of
the<00:01:04.110> already<00:01:04.320> dead<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> came<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.770> looking
