will make some profits now there are a
lot<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.790> downsides<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.070> won't

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
lot of downsides to this in that I won't

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.100 
lot of downsides to this in that I won't
be<00:00:41.460> able<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> use<00:00:41.910> my<00:00:42.090> fair<00:00:42.360> odds<00:00:42.570> I've<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
be able to use my fair odds I've got to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.959 
be able to use my fair odds I've got to
get<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> bets<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> certain<00:00:44.399> time<00:00:44.550> also

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
get the bets in at a certain time also

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
get the bets in at a certain time also
I'd<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> space<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.960> bets<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.890> certain

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
I'd like to space the bets over certain

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
I'd like to space the bets over certain
periods<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> time<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.480> probably<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.960> biggest

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
periods of time but probably the biggest

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.229 
periods of time but probably the biggest
question<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.980> has<00:00:50.340> come<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.640> people<00:00:51.149> have

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
question that has come up people have

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.020 
question that has come up people have
asked<00:00:51.600> me<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.020> I've<00:00:52.199> asked<00:00:52.500> myself<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.160> how<00:00:53.850> am

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
asked me and I've asked myself is how am

asked me and I've asked myself is how am
I<00:00:54.090> gonna<00:00:54.210> approach<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.079> betting<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.829> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I gonna approach the betting because of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.680 
I gonna approach the betting because of
course<00:00:56.250> traditionally<00:00:57.000> when<00:00:57.149> I've<00:00:57.239> given<00:00:57.600> out

free picks I've always just given out

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.260 
free picks I've always just given out
win<00:01:00.120> place<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:01.550> frankly<00:01:02.550> when<00:01:02.789> plays<00:01:03.030> are

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270

a<00:01:03.300> lot<00:01:03.510> simpler<00:01:03.960> very<00:01:04.589> very<00:01:04.799> straightforward

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
a lot simpler very very straightforward

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
a lot simpler very very straightforward
also<00:01:06.299> they're<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.049> affected<00:01:07.710> by<00:01:07.740> money

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
also they're not as affected by money

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.240 
also they're not as affected by money
thrown<00:01:08.670> into<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> pool<00:01:09.590> typically<00:01:10.590> because

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
thrown into the pool typically because

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.130 
thrown into the pool typically because
of<00:01:11.369> course<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> big<00:01:12.240> payoff<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
of course if you have a big payoff in a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350 
of course if you have a big payoff in a
race<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.890> implies<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.909> aren't<00:01:15.240> as

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
race that implies that there aren't as

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.090 
race that implies that there aren't as
many<00:01:15.390> winners<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.710> start<00:01:16.950> betting

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
many winners and when you start betting

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.950 
many winners and when you start betting
exotics<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.939> you're<00:01:18.030> looking<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.630> those<00:01:18.750> big

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
exotics and you're looking for those big

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.590 
exotics and you're looking for those big
payoffs<00:01:19.409> you've<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.850> overcome<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
payoffs you've got that to overcome and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.200 
payoffs you've got that to overcome and
especially<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.500> type<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> situation

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
especially in this type of the situation

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.420 
especially in this type of the situation
it<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.630> difficult<00:01:25.009> again<00:01:26.009> though<00:01:26.220> people

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it can be difficult again though people

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.620 
it can be difficult again though people
always<00:01:26.610> tell<00:01:26.820> me<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.030> Derek<00:01:27.240> you've<00:01:27.330> got<00:01:27.509> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
always tell me with Derek you've got to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
always tell me with Derek you've got to
go<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> exotics<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:29.009> where<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> fun

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
go with the exotics that's where the fun

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.280 
go with the exotics that's where the fun
is<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> big<00:01:30.150> returns<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.020> kind<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
is the big returns all that kind of

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
is the big returns all that kind of
stuff<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> did<00:01:32.310> recently<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
stuff so what I did recently that I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
stuff so what I did recently that I
thought<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> would<00:01:33.780> share<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
thought I would share with all of you is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.149 
thought I would share with all of you is
a<00:01:35.250> study<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.150> exotic<00:01:36.860> specifically<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
a study on exotic specifically the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.910 
a study on exotic specifically the
exacta<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> trifecta<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> did

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
exacta and the trifecta and what I did

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
exacta and the trifecta and what I did
is<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.250> looked<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.670> wind<00:01:41.939> back<00:01:42.030> term<00:01:42.420> ethic

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
is I looked at my wind back term ethic

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.300 
is I looked at my wind back term ethic
and<00:01:43.110> I've<00:01:43.200> talked<00:01:43.470> about<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.890> wind<00:01:44.100> factor

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and I've talked about my wind factor

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.580 
and I've talked about my wind factor
method<00:01:44.790> before<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.360> an<00:01:45.509> automatic<00:01:45.810> or

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
method before that's an automatic or

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.819 
method before that's an automatic or
computer-generated<00:01:47.460> fair<00:01:48.450> odds<00:01:48.720> line<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.350> so

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
computer-generated fair odds line and so

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.340 
computer-generated fair odds line and so
I<00:01:49.860> took<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.670> at<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.180> best<00:01:51.540> races<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
I took a look at the best races the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620 
I took a look at the best races the
edible<00:01:52.950> races<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.520> those<00:01:54.030> are<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> races

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
edible races and those are the races

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.109 
edible races and those are the races
rated<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.170> 75<00:01:55.799> percent<00:01:56.310> or<00:01:56.430> better<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> I'm

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
rated at 75 percent or better and I'm

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.429 
rated at 75 percent or better and I'm
not<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.600> into<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> percentages

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
not going to get into the percentages

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.249 
not going to get into the percentages
that's<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.159> way<00:01:59.460> of<00:02:00.079> looking<00:02:01.079> at

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that's just a way of looking at

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.859 
that's just a way of looking at
different<00:02:01.469> races<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.130> assessing<00:02:03.000> inherent

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
different races and assessing inherent

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
different races and assessing inherent
value<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> race<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.130> also<00:02:05.549> how

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
value of the race and also how

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.649 
value of the race and also how
predictable

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
predictable

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.020 
predictable
is<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:07.020> race<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.439> looked<00:02:07.649> at<00:02:07.770> races<00:02:08.160> 75%<00:02:08.940> or

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
is that race so I looked at races 75% or

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.940 
is that race so I looked at races 75% or
greater<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.810> thought<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.289> start<00:02:10.679> by

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
greater and I thought we would start by

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.850 
greater and I thought we would start by
taking<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.489> look<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.450> statistics

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
taking a look at the statistics

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
taking a look at the statistics
when<00:02:14.250> Benny<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.730> looking<00:02:15.090> at<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.360> top

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
when Benny just looking at the top

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.160 
when Benny just looking at the top
selection<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:17.190> top<00:02:17.550> contender<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.960> wind

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
selection the top contender on my wind

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.950 
selection the top contender on my wind
factor<00:02:19.350> line<00:02:19.710> in<00:02:20.010> races<00:02:20.460> rated<00:02:20.780> 75%<00:02:21.780> or<00:02:21.930> better

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
factor line in races rated 75% or better

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.020 
factor line in races rated 75% or better
and<00:02:22.350> you'll<00:02:22.770> see<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.160> they<00:02:23.310> win<00:02:23.460> thirty<00:02:23.760> five

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and you'll see that they win thirty five

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.390 
and you'll see that they win thirty five
point<00:02:24.630> four<00:02:24.870> percent<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.410> time<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.860> they

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
point four percent of the time and they

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.420 
point four percent of the time and they
return<00:02:26.790> an<00:02:26.970> ROI<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.870> minus<00:02:28.590> eight<00:02:28.830> point<00:02:29.190> four

return an ROI of minus eight point four
eight<00:02:29.580> percent<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.450> course<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.750> might<00:02:30.900> look

eight percent of course you might look

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
at that and think well that's no good

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.830 
at that and think well that's no good
you're<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.730> gonna<00:02:32.850> make<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> profit<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.660> way

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
you're not gonna make a profit that way

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.930 
you're not gonna make a profit that way
well<00:02:34.440> true<00:02:34.890> you're<00:02:35.430> not<00:02:35.460> going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.760> make<00:02:35.880> a

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.140 
well true you're not going to make a
profit<00:02:36.240> but<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:37.560> ROI<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.130> about<00:02:38.520> half<00:02:38.910> of

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
profit but that ROI is about half of

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.640 
profit but that ROI is about half of
what<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.450> would<00:02:39.540> lose<00:02:39.780> if<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.110> just<00:02:40.440> bet

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
what you would lose if you just bet

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.010 
what you would lose if you just bet
indiscriminately<00:02:41.430> or<00:02:41.520> bet<00:02:41.910> favorites<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.870> at

indiscriminately or bet favorites so at

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.410 
indiscriminately or bet favorites so at

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
least it's a stepping stone now I added

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.930 
least it's a stepping stone now I added
some<00:02:45.930> criteria<00:02:46.620> as<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.070> went<00:02:47.250> along<00:02:47.370> here<00:02:47.820> the

we're<00:02:50.250> looking<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> race<00:02:50.910> rating<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.390> 75

improves<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.050> statistics<00:02:58.650> somewhat

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130

the exotics let's start first with the

the exotics let's start first with the

exacta now we're to go back to the start
and<00:03:31.560> look<00:03:31.860> at<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.310> races<00:03:32.730> weighted<00:03:33.180> 75%<00:03:34.080> or

and look at just races weighted 75% or
better<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.680> you'll<00:03:35.250> see<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.640> there<00:03:35.820> are

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
better and you'll see that there are

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.840 
better and you'll see that there are
losses<00:03:36.180> across<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.260> board<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.769> what's<00:03:38.430> worse

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
losses across the board and what's worse

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.140 
losses across the board and what's worse
is<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.840> those<00:03:40.290> losses<00:03:40.620> are<00:03:41.010> more<00:03:41.310> pronounced

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
is that those losses are more pronounced

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.050 
is that those losses are more pronounced
as<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:43.440> start<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.890> go<00:03:44.040> deeper<00:03:44.580> into<00:03:44.820> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
as you start to go deeper into the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.490 
as you start to go deeper into the
contention<00:03:45.540> which<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.810> lot<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.019> people<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.470> a

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
contention which a lot of people do a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.040 
contention which a lot of people do a
lot<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.830> people<00:03:47.040> love<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.250> wheel<00:03:47.670> use<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.360> key<00:03:48.780> or

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
lot of people love to wheel use a key or

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.170 
lot of people love to wheel use a key or
whatever<00:03:49.410> now<00:03:49.980> you'll<00:03:50.220> notice<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.760> always

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
whatever now you'll notice that I always

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.750 
whatever now you'll notice that I always
stuck<00:03:51.480> with<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.870> top<00:03:52.140> choice<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.739> did<00:03:53.190> test<00:03:53.580> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
stuck with the top choice I did test the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.970 
stuck with the top choice I did test the
second<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.480> third<00:03:54.690> choices<00:03:55.019> on<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.560> line<00:03:55.739> and

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
second and third choices on the line and

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.000 
second and third choices on the line and
the<00:03:56.459> stats<00:03:56.760> were<00:03:57.000> even<00:03:57.330> worse<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:58.680> we're<00:03:58.980> just

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
the stats were even worse so we're just

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.620 
the stats were even worse so we're just
looking<00:03:59.400> at<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.790> top<00:03:59.970> choice<00:04:00.239> here<00:04:00.480> but

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
looking at the top choice here but

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.110 
looking at the top choice here but
you'll<00:04:00.750> see<00:04:01.019> it's<00:04:01.290> not<00:04:01.410> very<00:04:01.920> encouraging<00:04:02.160> now

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
you'll see it's not very encouraging now

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.910 
you'll see it's not very encouraging now
if<00:04:03.330> we<00:04:03.450> go<00:04:03.630> down<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.260> little<00:04:04.290> bit<00:04:04.709> you'll

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
if we go down just a little bit you'll

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.240 
if we go down just a little bit you'll
see<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:06.030> as<00:04:06.360> we<00:04:06.390> start<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.110> add<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.320> criteria

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
see that as we start to add the criteria

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.520 
see that as we start to add the criteria
that<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.459> did<00:04:08.700> with<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.060> win<00:04:09.269> bets<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:10.260> it

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
that I did with the win bets that it

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.970 
that I did with the win bets that it
gets<00:04:10.799> better<00:04:11.160> but<00:04:11.700> not<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.000> whole<00:04:12.480> lot<00:04:12.720> better

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
gets better but not a whole lot better

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.710 
gets better but not a whole lot better
initially<00:04:13.980> with<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.489> win<00:04:14.820> factor<00:04:15.239> rating<00:04:15.570> of

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
initially with a win factor rating of

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.590 
initially with a win factor rating of
greater<00:04:16.019> than<00:04:16.140> one<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:17.040> race<00:04:17.250> rate<00:04:17.549> at<00:04:17.669> 75%

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
greater than one in a race rate at 75%

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.780 
greater than one in a race rate at 75%
or<00:04:18.810> better<00:04:19.080> you'll<00:04:19.590> see<00:04:19.769> there<00:04:19.950> is<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.130> positive

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
or better you'll see there is a positive

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.170 
or better you'll see there is a positive
ROI<00:04:21.000> on<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.540> 1<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.229> exact<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.950> by<00:04:23.039> 1/2<00:04:23.550> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
ROI on a 1 to exact and by 1/2 that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.730 
ROI on a 1 to exact and by 1/2 that
means<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.570> course<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.810> first<00:04:25.169> choice<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
means of course the first choice and the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.440 
means of course the first choice and the
second<00:04:26.729> choice

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
second choice

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.170 
second choice
and<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:27.960> you're<00:04:28.200> looking<00:04:28.350> also<00:04:29.040> at<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.190> very<00:04:29.310> low

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
and so you're looking also at a very low

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.670 
and so you're looking also at a very low
probability<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:32.190> coming<00:04:32.700> in<00:04:33.030> 8.9%<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.560> be

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
probability of that coming in 8.9% to be

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.740 
probability of that coming in 8.9% to be
precise<00:04:35.070> now<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.610> numbers<00:04:35.940> get<00:04:36.090> quite<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.420> bit

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
precise now the numbers get quite a bit

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.510 
precise now the numbers get quite a bit
better<00:04:36.960> when<00:04:37.530> we<00:04:37.680> look<00:04:37.890> at<00:04:38.070> that<00:04:38.220> third

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
better when we look at that third

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.610 
better when we look at that third
category<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.570> you'll<00:04:39.780> remember<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.320> when

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
category and you'll remember that when

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.950 
category and you'll remember that when
we<00:04:40.740> looked<00:04:40.950> at<00:04:41.070> just<00:04:41.460> straight<00:04:41.790> win<00:04:42.030> bets<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
we looked at just straight win bets the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.200 
we looked at just straight win bets the
winning<00:04:43.320> percentage<00:04:43.440> was<00:04:43.860> 41%<00:04:44.340> but<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:44.880> ROI

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
winning percentage was 41% but the ROI

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.440 
winning percentage was 41% but the ROI
just<00:04:45.660> 7%<00:04:46.110> here<00:04:46.830> looking<00:04:47.580> at<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.820> top<00:04:48.090> choice

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
just 7% here looking at the top choice

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.300 
just 7% here looking at the top choice
keyed<00:04:48.990> with<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.380> second<00:04:49.770> choice<00:04:49.920> just<00:04:50.220> a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
keyed with the second choice just a

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.630 
keyed with the second choice just a
straight<00:04:50.730> exacta<00:04:51.800> 10.1%<00:04:52.800> winning<00:04:53.280> rate<00:04:53.460> which

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
straight exacta 10.1% winning rate which

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.520 
straight exacta 10.1% winning rate which
isn't<00:04:53.970> bad<00:04:54.210> for<00:04:54.870> an<00:04:55.320> exotic<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.580> 34%<00:04:57.510> roi<00:04:58.140> so

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
isn't bad for an exotic and a 34% roi so

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.010 
isn't bad for an exotic and a 34% roi so
some<00:04:58.740> merit<00:04:59.070> possibly<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.910> that<00:05:00.090> approach<00:05:00.450> now

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
some merit possibly to that approach now

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.470 
some merit possibly to that approach now
where<00:05:01.260> I<00:05:01.290> did<00:05:01.770> start<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.370> see<00:05:02.610> some<00:05:03.210> nice

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
where I did start to see some nice

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.290 
where I did start to see some nice
positive<00:05:04.020> returns<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:05.010> in<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.460> trifecta<00:05:06.180> and

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
positive returns is in the trifecta and

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.390 
positive returns is in the trifecta and
this<00:05:06.930> is<00:05:07.110> interesting<00:05:07.410> because<00:05:07.740> in<00:05:08.190> my

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
this is interesting because in my

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.210 
this is interesting because in my
opinion<00:05:08.660> it's<00:05:09.660> easiest<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.470> pick<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.980> winner

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
opinion it's easiest to pick the winner

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.610 
opinion it's easiest to pick the winner
of<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.520> race<00:05:11.730> it's<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.750> little<00:05:13.080> bit<00:05:13.230> harder<00:05:13.590> to

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
of a race it's a little bit harder to

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.740 
of a race it's a little bit harder to
fake<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.010> second-place<00:05:14.580> finisher<00:05:15.090> in<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.570> race

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
fake the second-place finisher in a race

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.080 
fake the second-place finisher in a race
it's<00:05:16.260> a<00:05:16.440> whole<00:05:16.680> lot<00:05:16.920> harder<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.730> pick<00:05:17.940> the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
it's a whole lot harder to pick the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.670 
it's a whole lot harder to pick the
third-place<00:05:18.540> finisher<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.110> race<00:05:19.320> the

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
third-place finisher in the race the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.590 
third-place finisher in the race the
fourth<00:05:19.920> place<00:05:20.160> finisher<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:20.730> so<00:05:20.970> on<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.360> I

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
fourth place finisher and so on and I

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.300 
fourth place finisher and so on and I
think<00:05:21.840> that's<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.380> advantage<00:05:22.740> that<00:05:23.160> for

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
think that's the advantage that for

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.760 
think that's the advantage that for
effect<00:05:23.580> this<00:05:23.730> have<00:05:24.000> is<00:05:24.330> that<00:05:24.990> you<00:05:25.290> can<00:05:25.500> get
