00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
looking at and here is one of the

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.420 
looking at and here is one of the
gardens<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:15.560> see<00:01:15.710> what's<00:01:15.860> going<00:01:16.100> on<00:01:16.220> down

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
gardens just see what's going on down

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.310 
gardens just see what's going on down
here<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:16.940> I<00:01:17.930> can<00:01:18.290> live<00:01:19.100> with<00:01:19.460> sort<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.510> exposing

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
here so I can live with sort of exposing

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.090 
here so I can live with sort of exposing
this<00:01:21.470> garlic<00:01:21.980> a<00:01:22.100> little<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.710> there<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.010> is

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
this garlic a little and there it is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.490 
this garlic a little and there it is
down<00:01:25.400> there<00:01:25.760> I<00:01:26.890> think<00:01:28.720> maybe<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.960> can<00:01:30.140> see

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
down there I think maybe you can see

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.460 
down there I think maybe you can see
maybe<00:01:30.740> not<00:01:31.510> but<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.630> bulb<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.020> getting<00:01:33.320> there

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
maybe not but the bulb is getting there

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.890 
maybe not but the bulb is getting there
it's<00:01:33.620> definitely<00:01:34.040> got<00:01:34.160> some<00:01:34.190> clove<00:01:34.900> formation

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
it's definitely got some clove formation

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.890 
it's definitely got some clove formation
the<00:01:36.590> skin<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:37.040> hardening<00:01:37.550> that's<00:01:37.880> good<00:01:38.120> but

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
the skin is hardening that's good but

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.140 
the skin is hardening that's good but
I'm<00:01:39.080> going<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.320> let<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.500> go<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:40.040> little<00:01:40.970> bit

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
I'm going to let it go a little bit

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.080 
I'm going to let it go a little bit
longer<00:01:42.010> so<00:01:44.710> that's<00:01:45.710> garlic<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.670> far<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.000> I'd

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
longer so that's garlic so far so I'd

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.010 
longer so that's garlic so far so I'd
say<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.270> probably<00:01:47.450> got<00:01:47.660> about<00:01:47.869> two<00:01:48.590> more<00:01:48.800> weeks

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
say I probably got about two more weeks

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.930 
say I probably got about two more weeks
maybe<00:01:51.020> one<00:01:51.320> of<00:01:51.619> course<00:01:52.520> I'm<00:01:52.640> about<00:01:52.820> to

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
maybe one of course I'm about to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.240 
maybe one of course I'm about to
convocation<00:01:53.320> right<00:01:54.320> at<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.500> key<00:01:54.650> moment<00:01:54.680> but

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
convocation right at the key moment but

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.330 
convocation right at the key moment but
I<00:01:55.760> let<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.600> go<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.720> little<00:01:56.900> long<00:01:57.140> that's<00:01:57.680> okay<00:01:58.100> I

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
I let it go a little long that's okay I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.370 
I let it go a little long that's okay I
don't<00:01:59.090> think<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.330> garlic<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.750> rotting<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.229> had

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
don't think the garlic is rotting I had

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.030 
don't think the garlic is rotting I had
it<00:02:00.470> really<00:02:00.710> well

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
it really well

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.860 
it really well
mulched<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.380> far<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.830> good
