00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
in a center attacking mid roll he's

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.270

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
already on wall that goal was offside

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.770 
already on wall that goal was offside
but<00:05:30.460> he's<00:05:30.610> already<00:05:30.760> on<00:05:30.880> one<00:05:31.120> goal<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.390> here's
