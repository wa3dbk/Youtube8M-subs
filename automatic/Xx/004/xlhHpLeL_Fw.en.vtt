all the RAM slots and everything you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.729 
all the RAM slots and everything you
know<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.759> moved<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.630> took<00:00:33.809> out<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> RAM

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
know we moved we took out one of the RAM

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
know we moved we took out one of the RAM
sticks<00:00:35.100> put<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.520> another<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.210> another

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
turns out it's not the RAM or it could

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
turns out it's not the RAM or it could
be<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> RAM<00:00:42.210> that's<00:00:42.540> still<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> mystery<00:00:43.320> but

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
be the RAM that's still a mystery but

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380 
be the RAM that's still a mystery but
it's<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> motherboard<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.239> there's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
it's actually the motherboard so there's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.700 
it's actually the motherboard so there's
a<00:00:45.450> motherboard<00:00:45.719> problem<00:00:46.379> okay<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:49.590> review

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
a motherboard problem okay so to review

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.100 
a motherboard problem okay so to review
