put together and how to use the 9 inch
curved<00:00:08.340> seam<00:00:08.670> template<00:00:09.290> now<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.620> set<00:00:11.519> of

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
curved seam template now this set of

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.419 
curved seam template now this set of
templates<00:00:12.059> comes<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.570> two<00:00:12.990> pieces<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.620> let's

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
templates comes as two pieces and let's

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.320 
templates comes as two pieces and let's
look<00:00:14.580> at<00:00:14.730> one<00:00:14.910> piece<00:00:15.089> at<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> time<00:00:15.500> the<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.830> is

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
look at one piece at a time the first is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.120 
look at one piece at a time the first is
what<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.359> call<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.869> fill-in<00:00:19.140> template<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
what we call the fill-in template and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580 
what we call the fill-in template and
that<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.480> cutting<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.199> piece<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
that was is for cutting the piece that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.240 
that was is for cutting the piece that
you<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.490> fill-in<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.689> curve

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
you see here the fill-in of the curve

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.640 
you see here the fill-in of the curve
the<00:00:26.250> other<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:27.240> very<00:00:27.480> similar<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.080> shape<00:00:28.140> but

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the other is very similar in shape but

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.339 
the other is very similar in shape but
it<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.920> labeled<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.570> you'll<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.320> is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
it is labeled and you'll see that it is

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.490 
it is labeled and you'll see that it is
the<00:00:32.160> 9<00:00:32.489> inch<00:00:32.520> take<00:00:33.180> away<00:00:33.540> template<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.440> that

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the 9 inch take away template and that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.910 
the 9 inch take away template and that
will<00:00:35.489> create<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.660> piece<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:37.290> now<00:00:37.739> this

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
will create the piece here now this

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
will create the piece here now this
simplest<00:00:38.280> set<00:00:38.430> was<00:00:38.610> originally<00:00:39.600> designed<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
simplest set was originally designed to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
simplest set was originally designed to
work<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> 10<00:00:40.800> inch<00:00:41.010> pre-cut<00:00:41.610> square<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
work with the 10 inch pre-cut square so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.670 
work with the 10 inch pre-cut square so
that's<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> pieces<00:00:43.170> we're<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.590> be

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
that's the pieces we're going to be

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.060 
that's the pieces we're going to be
working<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.070> today<00:00:45.440> I'll<00:00:46.440> take<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.829> out

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
working with today I'll take this out

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.250 
working with today I'll take this out
just<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> could<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> etching<00:00:48.960> really

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
just so you could see the etching really

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.049 
just so you could see the etching really
well<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> we're<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> bring<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
well and we're going to bring in a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.799 
well and we're going to bring in a
rotating<00:00:51.899> mat<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.910> easy<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.420> cut

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
rotating mat so that it's easy to cut

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.119 
rotating mat so that it's easy to cut
the<00:00:55.350> shapes<00:00:56.149> required<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.539> block<00:00:58.129> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the shapes required for this block and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.779 
the shapes required for this block and
this<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> 10<00:01:00.239> inch<00:01:00.270> square<00:01:01.140> pre-cut<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
this is a 10 inch square pre-cut and you

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.060 
this is a 10 inch square pre-cut and you
could<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.359> could<00:01:03.510> use<00:01:03.629> yardage<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.739> cut<00:01:04.949> your

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
could you could use yardage and cut your

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.580 
could you could use yardage and cut your
own<00:01:05.100> ten<00:01:05.850> inch<00:01:06.030> strips<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:07.049> here's<00:01:07.380> what

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
own ten inch strips but here's what

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.969 
own ten inch strips but here's what
we've<00:01:07.710> got

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
we've got

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.390 
we've got
we're<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> put<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.479> template<00:01:10.400> aligning

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
we're going to put the template aligning

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.840 
we're going to put the template aligning
two<00:01:11.820> edges<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.250> cut<00:01:14.250> edge<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.670> our

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
two edges with the cut edge of our

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.990 
two edges with the cut edge of our
square<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.040> then<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> go

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
square here and then we are going to go

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210 
square here and then we are going to go
in<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> simply<00:01:19.049> make<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.439> nice<00:01:19.650> gentle

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
in and simply make that nice gentle

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.210 
in and simply make that nice gentle
curve<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.780> since<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> rotating

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
curve and since it's not a rotating

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.890 
curve and since it's not a rotating
minute<00:01:23.659> make<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:24.990> easy<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.530> reach<00:01:26.900> walk

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
minute make it very easy to reach walk

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.649 
minute make it very easy to reach walk
your<00:01:28.140> fingers<00:01:28.470> along<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.700> nice

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
your fingers along so that you can nice

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.130 
your fingers along so that you can nice
and<00:01:30.990> accurately<00:01:31.590> cut<00:01:32.100> these<00:01:32.400> great<00:01:32.790> curves

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
and accurately cut these great curves

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.330 
and accurately cut these great curves
and<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.470> must<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.799> missed<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and I must have missed it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.950 
and I must have missed it
just<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.759> tiny<00:01:36.000> thread<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:37.280> that<00:01:38.280> happens

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
just a tiny thread there that happens

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.780 
just a tiny thread there that happens
okay<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.680> would<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.549> perfect

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
okay then we would have this perfect

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.039 
okay then we would have this perfect
curve<00:01:44.840> for<00:01:45.840> us<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.590> piece<00:01:46.799> later<00:01:47.840> just<00:01:48.840> like

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
curve for us to piece later just like

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.530 
curve for us to piece later just like
the<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:49.829> or<00:01:50.100> although<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.149> ones<00:01:51.329> seen

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the one here or although the ones seen

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.270 
the one here or although the ones seen
behind<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.740> quilt<00:01:52.950> called<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
behind you and the quilt called the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.580 
behind you and the quilt called the
string<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.610> pearls<00:01:53.820> okay<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.439> go

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
string of pearls okay we would go

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
string of pearls okay we would go
through<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.159> cut<00:01:56.399> all<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.210> fill-in

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
through and cut all of the fill-in

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 
through and cut all of the fill-in
pieces<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.280> required<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.729> our<00:02:00.000> quilt

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
pieces that are required for our quilt

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.080 
pieces that are required for our quilt
in<00:02:00.420> our<00:02:00.509> pattern<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.070> would<00:02:02.369> take

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
in our pattern and then we would take

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.419 
in our pattern and then we would take
our<00:02:03.479> background<00:02:04.170> fabric<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:06.200> use<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
our background fabric and use now the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.020 
our background fabric and use now the
takeaway<00:02:09.270> template<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.580> we'll<00:02:11.580> lay<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.970> on

perfect<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> curve<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.090> by<00:02:36.360> using<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
perfect the curve is by using the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.290 
perfect the curve is by using the
template<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.460> course<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.880> called<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
template this of course is called the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.180 
template this of course is called the
take<00:02:39.570> away<00:02:39.840> template<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:40.890> means<00:02:41.070> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
take away template so that means that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.190 
take away template so that means that
the<00:02:41.310> fabric<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:41.880> under<00:02:42.240> our<00:02:42.270> template<00:02:42.780> we

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the fabric we have under our template we

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.520 
the fabric we have under our template we
take<00:02:43.650> away<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.760> take<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.120> out<00:02:45.270> now<00:02:45.570> we're

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
take away so we take that out now we're

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.240 
take away so we take that out now we're
going<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:47.390> talk<00:02:48.390> about<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.870> piecing<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.980> this

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
going to talk about the piecing of this

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.500 
going to talk about the piecing of this
block<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:52.640> sometimes<00:02:53.640> curves<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.360> a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
block and sometimes curves can be a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.870 
block and sometimes curves can be a
little<00:02:54.780> intimidating<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:56.190> because<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.700> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
little intimidating but because this is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.700 
little intimidating but because this is
a<00:02:56.910> large<00:02:57.300> block<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.930> it's<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.230> very<00:02:58.410> gentle

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
a large block and it's a very gentle

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.180 
a large block and it's a very gentle
curve<00:02:59.070> it's<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.880> great<00:03:00.090> beginner<00:03:00.620> curve<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:02.160> us

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
curve it's a great beginner curve for us

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.280 
curve it's a great beginner curve for us
to<00:03:02.400> work<00:03:02.520> on<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.420> what<00:03:03.600> I'm<00:03:03.690> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:04.050> is

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
to work on so what I'm going to do is

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.850 
to work on so what I'm going to do is
show<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:05.070> just<00:03:05.150> fold<00:03:06.410> each<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
show you that you just fold each of the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.210 
show you that you just fold each of the
curves<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.700> half<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.930> put<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> little<00:03:10.860> pinch

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
curves in half and put a little pinch

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.040 
curves in half and put a little pinch
there<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.630> tell<00:03:12.810> where<00:03:12.960> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
there so that you can tell where the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.540 
there so that you can tell where the
center<00:03:13.410> was<00:03:13.700> do<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.880> same<00:03:15.210> thing<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:16.550> the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
center was do the same thing with the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.380 
center was do the same thing with the
outer<00:03:17.790> piece<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.670> now<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.730> know<00:03:21.060> where

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
outer piece and now you know where

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.560 
outer piece and now you know where
centers<00:03:21.930> are<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.770> your<00:03:22.920> block<00:03:23.270> now<00:03:24.270> we<00:03:24.330> just

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
centers are on your block now we just

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.920 
centers are on your block now we just
take<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:25.050> couple<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.530> pins<00:03:26.480> actually<00:03:27.480> three<00:03:27.750> to

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
take a couple of pins actually three to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.050 
take a couple of pins actually three to
be<00:03:28.080> exact<00:03:28.410> that's<00:03:29.160> how<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> usually<00:03:29.610> do<00:03:29.880> them

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060

we have it set up for a quarter inch
seam<00:04:20.010> allowance<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:22.320> we're<00:04:22.710> going<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.919> put<00:04:23.070> it

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
seam allowance and we're going to put it

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.940 
seam allowance and we're going to put it
under<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.520> presser<00:04:23.850> foot<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.800> usually<00:04:25.800> leave

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
under the presser foot I usually leave

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
under the presser foot I usually leave
that<00:04:26.190> first<00:04:26.340> pin

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
that first pin

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.110 
that first pin
place<00:04:27.740> until<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.800> get<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.280> positioned<00:04:29.850> where<00:04:29.940> I

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
place until I get it positioned where I

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.630 
place until I get it positioned where I
need<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.720> take<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.830> first<00:04:32.070> couple<00:04:32.550> of

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
need it and take the first couple of

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.370 
need it and take the first couple of
stitches<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:33.480> so<00:04:33.660> that<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.110> know<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.680> the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
stitches just so that I know that the

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.970 
stitches just so that I know that the
cut<00:04:37.380> edges<00:04:37.770> won't<00:04:38.040> shift<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:39.480> then<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.770> just

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
cut edges won't shift and then you just

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.720 
cut edges won't shift and then you just
walk<00:04:41.190> it<00:04:41.400> along<00:04:41.640> slowly<00:04:43.250> making<00:04:44.250> sure<00:04:44.550> you're

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.180 
all the way along and as you open this
you'll<00:06:12.870> want<00:06:13.080> you'll<00:06:13.290> notice<00:06:13.620> that<00:06:13.800> the<00:06:13.980> seam

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
you'll want you'll notice that the seam

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.280 
you'll want you'll notice that the seam
allowance<00:06:14.580> will<00:06:14.730> want<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:15.000> go<00:06:15.240> towards<00:06:15.960> this

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290

kind of splay out and away so that's the
