00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
actually saved the package so I could

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.780 
actually saved the package so I could
put<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> video<00:01:21.470> it's<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:23.250> like

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
put it in the video it's actually like

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.160

when<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> first<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> thought<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> was

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
when I first put it on I thought it was

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.219 
when I first put it on I thought it was
really<00:01:25.290> uncomfortable<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.900> after<00:01:27.900> having<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
really uncomfortable but after having it

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:38.499 
really uncomfortable but after having it
on<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.159> better

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.240 

it's<00:01:39.509> cut<00:01:39.810> high<00:01:40.020> enough<00:01:40.290> under<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> arms<00:01:40.979> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it's cut high enough under the arms it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.830 
it's cut high enough under the arms it's
so<00:01:41.369> long<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.670> don't<00:01:41.820> keep<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.240> yanking<00:01:42.720> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so long you don't keep like yanking it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.090 
so long you don't keep like yanking it
down<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> don't<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.890> worry<00:01:44.040> about

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100

don't go bouncing around like that music
without<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> metronome<00:02:06.979> underneath<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> shirt

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539

see<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:15.370> would<00:02:16.370> say<00:02:16.549> that<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:16.939> you're<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:17.360> an<00:02:17.599> A

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.569 
see I would say that if you're like an A
or<00:02:17.870> B<00:02:18.200> Cup<00:02:18.469> this<00:02:18.739> would<00:02:18.920> make<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.099> perfectly

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
or B Cup this would make a perfectly

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.220 
or B Cup this would make a perfectly
good<00:02:19.760> binder<00:02:20.239> not<00:02:20.629> just<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.930> sports<00:02:21.200> problem

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
good binder not just a sports problem

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.429 
good binder not just a sports problem
it's<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.319> most<00:02:24.549> actually<00:02:26.260> despite<00:02:27.260> my

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
it's the most actually despite my

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.990

growing<00:02:28.040> collection<00:02:28.159> of<00:02:28.430> binders<00:02:28.849> I

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
growing collection of binders I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.339 
growing collection of binders I
definitely<00:02:29.540> have<00:02:29.659> to<00:02:29.750> say<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.049> this<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349
