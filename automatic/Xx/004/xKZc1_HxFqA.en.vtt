as<00:00:28.740> possible<00:00:29.570> this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> new<00:00:30.960> trick<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.439> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
as possible this is a new trick for you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
as possible this is a new trick for you
and<00:00:31.920> try<00:00:32.220> each<00:00:32.519> of<00:00:32.669> these<00:00:32.760> steps<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.180> couple<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and try each of these steps a couple of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
and try each of these steps a couple of
times<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:34.530> spend<00:00:34.800> most<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.250> time

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.079 
times then spend most of your time
practicing<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> actual<00:00:36.840> trick<00:00:39.530> step<00:00:40.530> one

sliding while riding slider frontside
180<00:00:46.640> then<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.850> switchback<00:00:48.570> semi<00:00:49.760> pay<00:00:50.760> attention

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
180 then a switchback semi pay attention

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.630 
180 then a switchback semi pay attention
to<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.479> line<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> approach<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.949> sitting<00:00:53.489> up

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to a line of approach I'm sitting up

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
to a line of approach I'm sitting up
using<00:00:54.000> an<00:00:54.180> obvious<00:00:54.690> heel<00:00:54.960> edge<00:00:55.140> turn<00:00:55.470> to<00:00:56.070> slide

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
using an obvious heel edge turn to slide

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.399 
using an obvious heel edge turn to slide
the<00:00:56.430> frontside<00:00:56.820> 180<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.420> using<00:00:57.839> my<00:00:57.960> toe<00:00:58.019> edge

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
the frontside 180 and using my toe edge

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.299 
the frontside 180 and using my toe edge
to<00:00:58.949> slide<00:00:59.159> the<00:00:59.280> switch<00:00:59.369> back<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.949> if<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.129> watch

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to slide the switch back so if you watch

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.520 
to slide the switch back so if you watch
closely<00:01:02.640> you'll<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:04.080> frontside

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
closely you'll see that the frontside

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.800 
closely you'll see that the frontside
180<00:01:04.860> has<00:01:05.280> more<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> rotational<00:01:06.360> movement

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
180 has more of a rotational movement

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
180 has more of a rotational movement
through<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.470> upper<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.950> lower<00:01:08.100> body<00:01:08.280> both

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
through my upper and lower body both

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.990 
through my upper and lower body both
rotate<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.920> switchback<00:01:11.520> 780

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
rotate to get up and the switchback 780

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.170 
rotate to get up and the switchback 780
is<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.740> counter-rotated<00:01:13.740> 180<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> upper

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
is a counter-rotated 180 with the upper

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.219 
is a counter-rotated 180 with the upper
and<00:01:15.299> lower<00:01:15.450> body<00:01:15.600> rotate<00:01:15.900> against<00:01:16.799> each<00:01:16.920> other

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
and lower body rotate against each other

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.870 
and lower body rotate against each other
sliding<00:01:19.229> these<00:01:19.320> two<00:01:19.679> 180s<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.549> give<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.789> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
sliding these two 180s will give you the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
sliding these two 180s will give you the
most<00:01:21.060> basic<00:01:21.630> movements<00:01:22.439> involved<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.009> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
most basic movements involved in this

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.489 
most basic movements involved in this
trick<00:01:25.579> step<00:01:26.579> 2<00:01:26.789> add<00:01:27.570> Ollie's<00:01:29.749> Ollie<00:01:30.749> frontside

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499 
trick step 2 add Ollie's Ollie frontside

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:35.260 
trick step 2 add Ollie's Ollie frontside
180<00:01:31.969> then<00:01:32.969> Ollie<00:01:33.299> switchbacks<00:01:34.289> okay

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
180 then Ollie switchbacks okay

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.730 
180 then Ollie switchbacks okay
this<00:01:36.270> uses<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.570> exact<00:01:36.990> same<00:01:37.020> pitch<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> pop

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
this uses the exact same pitch of pop

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.340 
this uses the exact same pitch of pop
and<00:01:37.920> movement<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.429> tip<00:01:38.880> 1<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> rotational
