presentation<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:58.469> lasts<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:58.920> about<00:00:58.980> two

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
presentation which lasts for about two

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
presentation which lasts for about two
hours<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.420> battery<00:01:00.780> can

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
hours and I think this battery can

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.009 
hours and I think this battery can
survive<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:02.719> pretty<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
survive that and also pretty much the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
survive that and also pretty much the
lines<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.650> people<00:01:05.100> everything<00:01:05.460> happening

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
lines the people everything happening

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.170 
lines the people everything happening

actually<00:01:09.299> not<00:01:09.510> taking<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:09.930> inspiration

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
actually not taking some inspiration

I've<00:01:10.470> seen<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.710> before<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.040> some<00:01:11.850> cues<00:01:12.150> from

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
I've seen it before but some cues from

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.210 
I've seen it before but some cues from
the<00:01:12.689> Chicago<00:01:13.170> video<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> provost<00:01:13.950> released

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
think and that's my coverage is not
going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.439> exactly<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.549> because

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
going to be exactly like that because

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
going to be exactly like that because
that<00:01:27.030> would<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.780> stupid<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.350> dumb

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that would kind of be stupid and dumb

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
that would kind of be stupid and dumb
because<00:01:28.829> he<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.100> free<00:01:29.340> cameras<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.000> better

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
because he have free cameras and better

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.330 
because he have free cameras and better
equipment<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.409> probably<00:01:31.740> more<00:01:31.890> experience

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
equipment and probably more experience

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
equipment and probably more experience
than<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.689> no<00:01:33.900> intention<00:01:34.380> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
than I have so I have no intention of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
than I have so I have no intention of

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
competing with them and that respect
