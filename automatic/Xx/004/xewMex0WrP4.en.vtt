all right welcome to part 4 of
fingerboard<00:00:02.730> geometry<00:00:03.419> today<00:00:03.840> we're<00:00:04.200> going

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
fingerboard geometry today we're going

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.450 
fingerboard geometry today we're going
to<00:00:04.380> talk<00:00:04.589> about<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.370> third<00:00:07.099> specifically<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
to talk about the third specifically the

to talk about the third specifically the
major<00:00:08.790> 3rd<00:00:09.269> ok<00:00:10.110> now<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.830> sound<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> major

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
major 3rd ok now the sound of the major

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.890 
major 3rd ok now the sound of the major
of<00:00:11.940> 3rd<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:15.139> this<00:00:16.820> you<00:00:17.820> might<00:00:18.029> identify<00:00:18.390> it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
of 3rd is this you might identify it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.950 
of 3rd is this you might identify it
with<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.740> folk<00:00:20.490> tune<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.240> he's<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> jolly<00:00:21.600> good

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
with the folk tune for he's a jolly good

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.240 
with the folk tune for he's a jolly good
fellow

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.620 

but<00:00:28.520> if<00:00:28.610> you<00:00:28.700> can<00:00:28.820> think<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.120> something<00:00:29.180> else

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
but if you can think of something else

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.540 
but if you can think of something else
you<00:00:29.900> can<00:00:29.930> also<00:00:30.200> use<00:00:30.380> that<00:00:32.440> now<00:00:33.440> there's<00:00:34.280> two

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
you can also use that now there's two

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.479 
you can also use that now there's two
basic<00:00:34.700> ways<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.300> play<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.630> major<00:00:35.840> 3rd<00:00:36.489> again

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
basic ways to play the major 3rd again

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.910 
basic ways to play the major 3rd again
you<00:00:37.730> can<00:00:37.880> play<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.120> major<00:00:38.570> 3rd<00:00:38.809> toward<00:00:39.380> the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
you can play the major 3rd toward the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.030 
you can play the major 3rd toward the
bridge<00:00:40.520> or<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:42.170> could<00:00:42.290> play<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.620> toward<00:00:42.920> the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
bridge or you could play it toward the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.689 
bridge or you could play it toward the
nut<00:00:43.600> okay<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.230> if<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:46.070> play<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.280> toward<00:00:46.580> the

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
nut okay so if you play it toward the

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.280 
nut okay so if you play it toward the
bridge<00:00:46.879> it's<00:00:47.420> going<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.690> be<00:00:47.870> on<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.080> same

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
bridge it's going to be on the same

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.970 
bridge it's going to be on the same
string<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.129> for<00:00:49.489> instance<00:00:50.290> from<00:00:51.290> every<00:00:51.650> string

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
string so for instance from every string

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.119 
string so for instance from every string
doesn't<00:00:52.610> matter<00:00:52.940> which<00:00:53.269> you<00:00:53.780> skip<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:54.800> play

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
doesn't matter which you skip you play

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.880 
doesn't matter which you skip you play
the<00:00:58.129> root<00:00:58.370> here<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.199> then<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:00.260> go<00:01:00.380> two<00:01:00.440> whole

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
the root here and then you go two whole

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.520 
the root here and then you go two whole
steps<00:01:02.230> do<00:01:03.230> your<00:01:03.380> major<00:01:03.559> third<00:01:04.149> okay<00:01:05.149> so<00:01:05.960> from

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
steps do your major third okay so from

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:20.080 
steps do your major third okay so from
the<00:01:06.770> strength<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.340> make<00:01:07.460> your<00:01:07.640> third<00:01:07.820> beer

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.970 

so<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.120> just<00:01:21.540> played<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> major<00:01:22.110> 3rd<00:01:22.440> for<00:01:22.710> eating

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
so I just played a major 3rd for eating

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.260 
so I just played a major 3rd for eating
each<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> pitches<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> fifth

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
each one of the pitches of the fifth

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.120 
each one of the pitches of the fifth
fret<00:01:25.040> now<00:01:26.040> let's<00:01:26.190> go<00:01:26.310> toward<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.670> nut<00:01:26.940> okay

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
fret now let's go toward the nut okay

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.010 
fret now let's go toward the nut okay
now<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.490> major<00:01:29.970> third<00:01:30.270> tour<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.660> night<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.900> go

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
now a major third tour the night you go

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.340 
now a major third tour the night you go
to<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.290> next<00:01:31.530> string<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.240> one<00:01:33.240> fret<00:01:33.540> lower<00:01:33.780> so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to the next string and one fret lower so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.440 
to the next string and one fret lower so
it<00:01:34.440> looks<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.680> this

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.300 

and<00:01:38.570> this<00:01:39.020> will<00:01:39.140> remain<00:01:39.439> true<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:39.950> most<00:01:40.100> of

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
and this will remain true for most of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.560 
and this will remain true for most of
the<00:01:40.430> strings<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:43.430> it's<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:43.729> same<00:01:43.969> for<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
the strings so it's the same for the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.249 
the strings so it's the same for the
fifth<00:01:47.469> it's<00:01:48.469> the<00:01:48.590> same<00:01:48.829> from<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.280> fourth

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
fifth it's the same from the fourth

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.810 
fifth it's the same from the fourth
however<00:01:51.259> crossing<00:01:52.009> from<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.280> third<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.549> the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
however crossing from the third to the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.480 
however crossing from the third to the
second<00:01:53.390> string<00:01:54.020> there<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.679> an<00:01:54.799> adjustment<00:01:55.220> for

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
second string there is an adjustment for

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.859 
second string there is an adjustment for
the<00:01:55.520> major<00:01:55.700> third<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.210> would<00:01:56.299> look<00:01:56.420> like<00:01:56.600> this

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
the major third it would look like this

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.289 
the major third it would look like this
now<00:01:58.390> at<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.569> same<00:01:59.780> fret<00:02:00.969> and<00:02:01.969> then<00:02:02.030> when<00:02:02.240> you

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
now at the same fret and then when you

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.940 
now at the same fret and then when you
get<00:02:02.450> back<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.869> top<00:02:02.899> two<00:02:03.289> strings<00:02:03.590> it's

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
get back to the top two strings it's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.520 
get back to the top two strings it's
back<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.340> normal<00:02:07.060> ok<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:08.810> now<00:02:09.019> let's<00:02:09.049> review

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
back to normal ok so now let's review

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.530 
back to normal ok so now let's review
that<00:02:09.890> one<00:02:10.129> more<00:02:10.280> time<00:02:10.340> playing<00:02:11.120> them<00:02:11.299> in<00:02:11.420> each

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
that one more time playing them in each

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
that one more time playing them in each
