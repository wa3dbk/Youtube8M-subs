 many times warning of the dangers that social networks have 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.080
 but and digital company 'that we will give a remarkable double-edged 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.559
 we'll make the silo kinder 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.540
 the tablet has revolutionized the kitchen through the internet is the faithful cook 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:20.159
 txaber allué with which today is a pleasure there will be a digital journalist 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.499
 welcome to present thank you very much pleased to be here 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.640
 here always like that is how it is 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.570
 paniego in the prologue of his book this cookbook cent what 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.880
 surprising is that you're 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.160
 is not easy 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.270
 Well, not the truth that these things that happen on the Internet 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.119
 In the end, he has the recognition that he is the first one who wants to 

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:41.830
 More professional 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.860
 it said nothing percent and that the originality resides a moderator and zinc 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.409
 and one of his recipes that more 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.959
 has triumphed so much more visited more commented has been the potato omelette 

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:55.880
 through social networks like youtube 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.889
 basically because 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.730
 yes it is obviously a super simple recipe is the first one I made 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 and since there was nobody doing what I do 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.770
 now we are many and it is more fun and jal but as there was no 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.520
 Nobody you put on google omelet potato and the mass comes out 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.450
 so 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.270
 how does mine know 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.870
 has become like a phenomenon kapranos it can not be good that the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.610
 membership of the pacata society does not scare him anything 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 special no 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.090
 is that it's very funny because people 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.890
 in only one generation ps he has forgotten to cook 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 i 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.300
 there is a fear entering the kitchen and when they see it I envy that it is the great 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.570
 difference what to make recipes on video 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.690
 and in my house 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.920
 they say that if this guy does not make his house 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.500
 and that reading has to go out to my people they try it and effectively they 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.030
 comes out 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.119
 hitler are encouraged to quit in all the others because they say if it is not so 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:43.790
 hard 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.580
 in fact there it is and a mba as it happens to us that they tried to do the same as 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.659
 I good and they continue to do more or less the professional format 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:51.400
 but they were 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.790
 just a couple of partners 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.010
 i 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.480
 spatial a professional that the bride and groom made recipes kilos also 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.460
 that are successful are those of the brides 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.530
 because as soon as I see the professional 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.729
 eco language techniques and professional material agent says that I'm not going to 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.989
 to be able to do there is not one that is a salamander 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.989
 with which I no longer encourage the holder two of the brides not 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.289
 the fact that he lived had the opportunity to teach your kitchen in your 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.399
 house without anything special 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.870
 removes many barriers and people are encouraged and leave 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.779
 and in fact in the book what I do is 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.519
 per cent are 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.579
 recipes that I have already posted on the internet 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.809
 the version 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:31.189
 percent incorporates everything he learned in three years which is a lot 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.339
 but it was considered then I learned a lot on the internet 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.709
 I disagree with the simplest version if I know that there is something 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.300
 it takes two hours more and it goes much better 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.509
 he usually resigned as he is spectacularly better mind 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.459
 or if it requires time and other techniques 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.329
 for a small difference I do not believe them 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.260
 undoubtedly avant-garde cuisine as axa to coria have done in the kitchen 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.489
 Spanish 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.109
 it was something important position 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.139
 / in the world but I do not know if the other part of the story is that 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.609
 from the daily pile, I took them a little away for a few years 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.749
 Of course he who is there all the lights what we do is forget 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.880
 how big is arguiñano not 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.989
 but 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.669
 for me I admire very much and I think that the work that these cooks have done 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.019
 it is exceptional hiddink we have put all the lights 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.950
 and now what we have to do is that the people live 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.980
 of those 40 million tourists you see that there is an important percentage that 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.280
 comes for the gastronomy 5 million 5 million that the next day 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.389
 to go to the bulli 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.619
 they are going to go to a 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:36.779
 jovana beach trustee go to the one next to the hotel and if to them 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:37.839
 we disappointed 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:42.119
 an agreement one sixth to 2 m worked frozen processed 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.019
 Well, it's going to be a big disappointment, it's not interesting and a great opportunity to 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:45.520
 do 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.109
 Traditional food 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.980
 percent and satisfy those 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.050
 palates that are not always demanding not to the bulli you do not go bulls of opas once 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.799
 in your life you will probably fall 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.549
 success isobel 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.439
 on the internet it came to him in a completely studied way 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.769
 unexpected 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.149
 Well, look at this question, it makes me very excited because every time I read 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.039
 percent the reportage of journalists especially those who go not 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.099
 those who talk about my book or anything but those who say the phenomenon 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.939
 internet the phenomenon dospuntocero sip interview them at 4 5 that we are always 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:16.699
 the same 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.379
 and you see my story 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:23.509
 it is he aspires as if this were a strategy fruit of an analysis all 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:24.719
 this has been 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.699
 pretty casual 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.249
 I do not really conceive to teach 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.269
 I lived god because I like cooking very much I like the audiovisual 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.889
 i 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:34.770
 and copper 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.639
 with jovi 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.870
 and immediately at ease and that encouraged me to continue 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.950
 I'm learning them and you're seeing opportunities 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.490
 Obviously, as I really like, take some opportunity to be a professional 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.069
 of this that I am not now, not because if there 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.249
 I would obviously bet but it has been 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.639
 get carried away trying new things have a great time 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.809
 i curiously 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.290
 what happened is that I did not share it 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.860
 for denver there is to teach 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.669
 by the way I'm learning a lot 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.620
 but that success is professionally what we have acquired to live with 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.919
 this 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.050
 now start earning some money 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.940
 pedro has taken out a book or one more mariotto padilla but for example year 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.450
 passed because I had to represent as a 30 percent of my income what yes 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.330
 that generates a lot of brand and me as a freelance consultant 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.830
 the point is that 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.900
 before I advised a lot they protected finances and now they call me for two 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.339
 0 points that I like much more than hamas 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:30.279
 the 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.220
 fortunately companies are still 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.259
 far away 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.659
 It costs me very little 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.370
 teach them things because they know nothing 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.610
 but really 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.750
 also because in the financial consultants mine 1 according to the rules more or 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.870
 less of a festive tradition market but I'm training when 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.569
 and gave him a tip even if he does not know anything 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.569
 there is some written rule 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.589
 there is no thread and again I start with percent any relationship of this kind 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:57.740
 saying 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.490
 if someone has come to you this fact that is an expert in something that makes five 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.809
 years did not exist 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:04.580
 distrust 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.539
 and another day a friend told me 'well it worked easier you do not tell him it's 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.059
 in the long term and tell him that nobody knows no 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:13.339
 what happens is that if it works 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.889
 What works is common sense 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.749
 i lobo pons if you explain that you understand by common sense and apply it 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:22.759
 Noel 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.509
 It can be him not to lie not to be heavy not always be a mark 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.330
 and the best thing is always to provide value is to say if you the only thing you do in your 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.219
 facebook on your twitter including you 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.589
 exposing is because he knew how to advertise your brand etc 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:41.080
 without giving anything in return the community will not have any success 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.449
 but if you 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.469
 the mko is for example you are a product 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.680
 and give recipes with that product those add a value if those recipes 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.300
 by the way, I'm interested 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.169
 in exchange for seeing your advertising 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.969
 I'm afraid of the recipes but if you do not give me anything, it changed in 3D because I'll leave 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.270
 defected friends facebook or to follow templete 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.699
 to watch your videos on youtube
