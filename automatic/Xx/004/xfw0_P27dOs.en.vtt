00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.730
 in the last year 4 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.120
 the victim goes in six 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.920
 cops 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.539
 the production of Brazilian cotton I would do ferraz 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.539
 what speaks for me is a parameter 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.569
 production but thousands of parents 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.880
 only need to give the finishing touch 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 money movement in the camera 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.780
 to give that the last touch of realism 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.250
 in our lady 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.830
 so, without wasting any more time, let's go 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.050
 add a camera in the pool like no nile 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.870
 I'm going to pick a gift from 50 girls were here 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.200
 It is worth remembering that with our seas are already 3 bi we need to decide 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.840
 builder here so we can do 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.810
 the page turn with this 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.270
 xistra 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.210
 I think this is absurd 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.570
 Also here 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.350
 so that the socks with 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.490
 other compositions I can interact with the camera is necessary 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.510
 that they are transformed into 3d objects because the camera is by nature a 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.970
 three-dimensional object 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.610
 so, as usual 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.420
 these people control the movement of the bed 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.600
 this uses a null object to create a nudity object 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 the dream is on and I'm going to djerba 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.050
 difficult 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.430
 to put the visibility here 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.740
 all this seems distant 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.490
 I will 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.480
 to send the camera 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.600
 the object in the world 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.080
 after taking 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.560
 the clubs that only gain visibility overseas 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.200
 think here 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.399
 the camerata paved the wall when we moved it transformed Lulistas with 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.560
 A bed 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.460
 another point added in three days 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.720
 will be 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.999
 We'll do it later. 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.789
 Let's make an approximation. 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.789
 tel the selector to operate vi 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.689
 I'm going to work here the public is not alone 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.919
 I get a little closer 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
 with marcos jose mayer 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.559
 I'll catch it here. 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.559
 but I got along myself 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:46.059
 the transition of the two books that I will return in that rear 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.829
 if you want to 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.639
 the limit 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.639
 certainly this here 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.739
 led to 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.739
 the middle of the other two that will bring again 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.839
 so we have 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.839
 Reef has here 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.759
 it's very subtle 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.759
 but we'll still add a rotation 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.129
 I'm going to return pleasure here 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.959
 the comet of transition let's bring 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:32.289
 You have to file an action in the 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.289
 already the remoteness 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.980
 cilic when he pulls the Italian bag was furious when she asked if I go 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.980
 know what he's doing here 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.139
 this is made very subtle but I find it interesting 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.379
 when we add the vote we will see what happened before 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.299
 that's it 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.029
 so let's continue here 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.939
 I'll bring it here. 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.939
 What's new? 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.740
 chic did not mention her ending 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 far I put it to zero again 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:45.740
 leave 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.550
 the parma of open position team type of virus that parish and let's open 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.740
 price 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.189
 we pressed shift r 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.059
 six people just want 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.339
 comparing those of voting the substitute of opposition to maintain two payments 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.330
 We have to press the chip7 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.819
 here where you played the network 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.419
 the shows 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.629
 that the fossil vote 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.610
 only I'll hold the vote 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.499
 to work on the 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.639
 I'll hold the one here where times 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.870
 be opposed 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.110
 an achievement 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.349
 the finland over 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.349
 Diogo with rotational a little bit 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.400
 but I can not be here if it happens to 0 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.160
 24 degrees so we have this movement here 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.559
 from when I bring here I'm going to put at least 4 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.159
 opportunities 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.159
 if I pass a lot it seems like an important political background 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.259
 in theory just a little bit 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.499
 I think I'll bring 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.300
 besides the following here 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.380
 3-4 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.879
 who does 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.879
 here comes here I'll bring you 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.639
 always here 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.050
 the position of the null 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.189
 tell 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.229
 x 0 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.229
 clô that faces mentem to take with the incident 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.369
 will be 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.300
 one more frustration here 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.300
 between 4 degrees 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.740
 separately 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.740
 Henrique, I'll bring it back. 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.849
 This concludes 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:51.550
 the entire process 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.550
 the model provides for the planting of 20 tries 

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:20.080
 hence the project 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.219
 and then you can 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:26.529
 is to do with any kind of engenho of interaction with the camera here steps to 

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.259
 creativity 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:30.259
 but the idea is this 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:31.789
 on here 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:34.789
 I think it's just that you arrested in the act 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.260
 several technicians and procedures during 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.330
 as I said 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.790
 this series two defeats 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.490
 Why can you make the best of Brazilians? 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.490
 Other 

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.259
 until the next 

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:54.300
 it's an abraço abraço 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.840
 again to see productions shows
