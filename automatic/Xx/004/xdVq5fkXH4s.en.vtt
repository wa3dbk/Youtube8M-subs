problems<00:00:19.289> then<00:00:20.189> we're<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> look<00:00:20.609> at<00:00:20.699> how

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
problems then we're going to look at how

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.609 
problems then we're going to look at how

tends to follow other languages down a
dark<00:00:26.460> alley<00:00:26.670> hit<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.180> over<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> head<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.720> go

through their pockets for loose

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
through their pockets for loose
vocabulary<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.570> end<00:00:30.689> up<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:30.900> some<00:00:31.050> pretty

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
vocabulary so we end up with some pretty

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.170 
vocabulary so we end up with some pretty
strange<00:00:31.470> words<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.160> don't<00:00:32.430> form<00:00:32.790> plurals

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
strange words that don't form plurals

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
strange words that don't form plurals
according<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> usual<00:00:33.899> English<00:00:34.410> rules

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
then we're going to do some practice at

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.959 
then we're going to do some practice at
forming<00:00:37.440> plurals<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.670> we're<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
forming plurals and then we're going to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.970 
forming plurals and then we're going to
look<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.329> some<00:00:39.390> tips<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.110> improve<00:00:40.230> your

look at some tips to improve your

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.150 
look at some tips to improve your
spelling<00:00:41.690> all<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> five

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

main<00:00:44.730> rules<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.719> English<00:00:46.020> plurals<00:00:46.379> first<00:00:46.920> add

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
main rules for English plurals first add

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.299 
main rules for English plurals first add
an<00:00:47.879> S<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.570> most<00:00:48.780> words<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.440> chair<00:00:49.800> becomes

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
an S to most words so chair becomes

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.360 
an S to most words so chair becomes
chairs<00:00:50.760> monkey<00:00:51.660> becomes<00:00:51.989> monkeys<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.739> rodeo

chairs monkey becomes monkeys and rodeo

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.569 
chairs monkey becomes monkeys and rodeo
becomes<00:00:53.760> rodeos<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> normally<00:00:55.649> works<00:00:55.800> here

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
becomes rodeos so it normally works here

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
becomes rodeos so it normally works here
come<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> exceptions<00:00:57.510> add<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:58.320> es<00:00:58.829> two

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
come all the exceptions add an es two

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.959 
come all the exceptions add an es two
words<00:00:59.489> ending<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.879> excess<00:01:00.590> or<00:01:01.590> chew<00:01:01.980> basically
