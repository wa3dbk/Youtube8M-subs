00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.600 
similar to the size the height of the
cutters<00:01:32.260> themself<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:32.950> all<00:01:33.310> you're<00:01:33.430> going<00:01:33.520> to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
cutters themself so all you're going to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.380 
cutters themself so all you're going to
do<00:01:33.790> is<00:01:34.060> go<00:01:34.840> ahead<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.020> cut<00:01:35.260> straight<00:01:35.560> down<00:01:35.860> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
do is go ahead and cut straight down and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.470 
do is go ahead and cut straight down and
then<00:01:37.390> you're<00:01:37.780> going<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.370> just<00:01:39.370> push<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.300> out

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
then you're going to just push it out

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.160 
then you're going to just push it out
and<00:01:40.930> put<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.470> on<00:01:41.740> your<00:01:42.190> rack<00:01:42.790> now<00:01:43.600> you'll

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
and put it on your rack now you'll

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.840 
and put it on your rack now you'll
notice<00:01:44.530> as<00:01:44.710> I'm<00:01:44.830> putting<00:01:44.980> these<00:01:45.190> on<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.670> rack

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
notice as I'm putting these on the rack

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.850 
notice as I'm putting these on the rack
that<00:01:45.880> crumbs<00:01:46.420> are<00:01:46.600> falling<00:01:46.930> through<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.380> don't

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
that crumbs are falling through I don't

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.990 
that crumbs are falling through I don't
want<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.070> crumbs<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.550> there

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
want the crumbs on there

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.940 
want the crumbs on there
so<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.840> might<00:01:50.140> be<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.350> good<00:01:50.530> idea<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.830> go<00:01:50.920> ahead

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
so it might be a good idea to go ahead

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.890 
so it might be a good idea to go ahead
and<00:01:51.160> set<00:01:51.370> your<00:01:51.400> rack<00:01:51.790> on<00:01:52.090> top<00:01:52.150> of<00:01:52.450> your<00:01:52.720> table

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
and set your rack on top of your table

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.570 
and set your rack on top of your table
so<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.710> crumbs<00:01:54.100> go<00:01:54.220> ahead<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:54.460> fall

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
so that the crumbs go ahead and fall

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.250 
so that the crumbs go ahead and fall
through<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.060> then<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.420> can<00:01:55.450> transfer<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.140> on

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
through and then you can transfer it on

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.250 
through and then you can transfer it on
to<00:01:56.530> your<00:01:56.710> tray<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:58.030> reason<00:01:58.420> being<00:01:58.600> all<00:01:58.990> of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
to your tray the reason being all of

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.140 
to your tray the reason being all of
that<00:01:59.410> icing<00:01:59.830> that<00:01:59.980> falls<00:02:00.220> through<00:02:00.370> onto<00:02:01.030> your

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
that icing that falls through onto your

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.480 
that icing that falls through onto your
tray<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.170> scrape<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.740> back<00:02:03.010> up<00:02:03.250> it's

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
tray you can scrape that back up it's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.250 
tray you can scrape that back up it's
perfectly<00:02:03.970> good<00:02:04.240> just<00:02:04.510> reheat<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.200> you

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
perfectly good just reheat it and you

perfectly good just reheat it and you
can<00:02:05.410> use<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.740> for<00:02:05.920> some<00:02:06.100> more<00:02:06.190> pet<00:02:06.400> ofourse

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
can use it for some more pet ofourse

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.389 
can use it for some more pet ofourse

you to feel like you have to be sparing

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.890 
you to feel like you have to be sparing
with<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.400> really<00:02:33.879> pour<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.390> there<00:02:34.569> thick

with this really pour it on there thick

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.420 
with this really pour it on there thick
because<00:02:35.170> all<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.920> falls<00:02:36.160> off

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
because all of that that falls off

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.490 
because all of that that falls off
you're<00:02:37.209> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.569> be<00:02:37.660> able<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.840> scrape<00:02:38.140> up<00:02:38.349> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
you're going to be able to scrape up and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.520 
you're going to be able to scrape up and
use<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.370> for<00:02:39.580> my<00:02:39.670> round<00:02:39.940> ones<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.510> really<00:02:41.260> start

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
use so for my round ones I really start

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.890 
use so for my round ones I really start
on<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> edge<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.940> just<00:02:43.150> really<00:02:43.450> be<00:02:43.540> generous

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
on the edge and just really be generous

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.360 
on the edge and just really be generous
with<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.349> just<00:02:44.380> all<00:02:44.650> falls<00:02:44.980> off<00:02:45.190> and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
with it so it just all falls off and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.280 
with it so it just all falls off and
every<00:02:45.640> little<00:02:45.849> bit<00:02:45.910> gets<00:02:46.209> coated<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.750> found

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
every little bit gets coated I found

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.750 
every little bit gets coated I found
that<00:02:47.470> if<00:02:47.560> I've<00:02:47.650> tried<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.010> be<00:02:48.099> sparing<00:02:48.430> with<00:02:48.640> it

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
that if I've tried to be sparing with it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.759 
that if I've tried to be sparing with it
that<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:48.910> end<00:02:49.150> up<00:02:49.299> with<00:02:49.420> little<00:02:49.660> holes<00:02:49.959> if<00:02:50.260> you

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
that I end up with little holes if you

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.020 
that I end up with little holes if you
go<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.920> try<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.099> patch<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.489> up<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:51.700> doesn't

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
go to try to patch it up it just doesn't

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.640 
go to try to patch it up it just doesn't
look<00:02:52.060> good<00:02:52.180> square<00:02:53.019> ones<00:02:53.230> are<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.380> little<00:02:53.440> bit

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
look good square ones are a little bit

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.370 
look good square ones are a little bit
more<00:02:53.680> difficult<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.310> do<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:55.720> focus<00:02:56.290> on

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
more difficult to do I really focus on

the<00:05:06.300> base<00:05:06.510> you<00:05:07.080> see<00:05:07.110> i<00:05:07.260> kind<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.560> flatten<00:05:07.980> this

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
the base you see i kind of flatten this

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.380 
the base you see i kind of flatten this
out<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.370> little<00:05:08.640> bit<00:05:08.760> and<00:05:09.000> then<00:05:09.150> I'm<00:05:09.210> going<00:05:09.330> to

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
out a little bit and then I'm going to

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.140 
out a little bit and then I'm going to
take<00:05:09.480> my<00:05:09.660> small<00:05:09.990> spatula<00:05:10.790> kind<00:05:11.790> of<00:05:11.880> scoot

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
take my small spatula kind of scoot

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.870 
take my small spatula kind of scoot
underneath<00:05:12.510> there<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:14.010> set<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.370> in<00:05:14.490> there<00:05:14.670> and

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
underneath there and set it in there and

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.730 
underneath there and set it in there and
then<00:05:15.390> that<00:05:15.600> way<00:05:15.810> it's<00:05:16.110> something<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.650> you

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
then that way it's something that you

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.020 
then that way it's something that you
can<00:05:16.890> serve<00:05:17.250> nicely<00:05:19.250> without<00:05:20.250> your<00:05:20.700> guests

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
can serve nicely without your guests

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
feeling like they're getting their hands

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.930 
feeling like they're getting their hands
too<00:05:23.910> dirty<00:05:25.010> alright<00:05:26.010> now<00:05:26.100> here's<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.340> square<00:05:26.730> so

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
too dirty alright now here's a square so

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.990 
too dirty alright now here's a square so
this<00:05:27.030> would<00:05:27.180> be<00:05:27.300> example<00:05:27.750> of<00:05:27.870> a<00:05:27.960> bigger<00:05:28.230> one

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
this would be example of a bigger one

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.520 
this would be example of a bigger one
okay<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.270> I'm<00:05:30.570> flattening<00:05:30.990> out<00:05:31.080> a<00:05:31.170> little<00:05:31.320> bit

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
okay so I'm flattening out a little bit

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.190 
okay so I'm flattening out a little bit
more<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:31.950> even<00:05:32.370> though<00:05:32.730> it<00:05:33.180> feels<00:05:33.600> like<00:05:34.020> the

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
more and even though it feels like the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.840 
more and even though it feels like the
cups<00:05:34.470> may<00:05:34.680> be<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.860> little<00:05:35.100> bit<00:05:35.190> small<00:05:35.490> for<00:05:35.520> that

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
cups may be a little bit small for that

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.250 
cups may be a little bit small for that
really<00:05:36.390> it<00:05:36.600> gives<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.080> nice
