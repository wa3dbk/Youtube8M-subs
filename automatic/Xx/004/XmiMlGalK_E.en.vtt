00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.579
 here is the video explaining how I did to go beyond james master 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.539
 leap to the time scale 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.669
 and I do not see why it's not true 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.279
 but among others it's like, after all, not bothered to listen to all 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 public actors 16 hours 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.290
 every time i do miss james bond of 20% meant for a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.410
 still better for my taste as for later 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.640
 with more ease for me I think it's better for me as 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.580
 in the next episode 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.409
 There you go 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:45.990
 in the case where m 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.090
 all you have French vacuum pumps I do not recommend 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.790
 to use that because what happens is that once the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.180
 days 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 Montreal 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.360
 once your day makes it when it's hot the Clermontans have it killed 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.640
 by a citizen act these products coming out it was not obvious that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.470
 here 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.330
 a bag filled we will say three quarters of the hair and half 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.479
 to take care of it he does not know if it's the best methods I can 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.070
 will try to learn with black and white 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.640
 this is the case here 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 with a hair dryer 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.980
 and not 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.470
 This is curiously years 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.520
 a figure that needs to be 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.780
 that it is necessary to do it and to be careful so that it does not fly because 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.870
 that my hair is very strong and that if I go well to the minimum 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.110
 I think he is very strong and so for this study 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.980
 what to remember podium of which 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.690
 and for 16% and everything done on record for the adoption of the euro 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.720
 for christelle the iphone 3 and falls directly into the short world 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.960
 mm watch out for the rose water like a moment I burned myself 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.340
 for the second method I turned to flu clinics 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.690
 swine train 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.399
 the boss of the team is very very very hot 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.809
 I have a lot of needs 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.059
 while we can 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.449
 madrid reuters - it's using a hell 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.179
 we will send a CV of 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.709
 France who cost the life who said it's for fun 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.849
 so I'm touched and I folded the match we'll say and like that then 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.900
 that he had pulled 30 off the list of goods that it was very easy to 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.789
 accept 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.119
 and for those who were very different from that of salvador with 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.119
 a clip of course 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.219
 you take your door 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.519
 they warned us it's a positive asset it goes further 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.620
 more deposit facility 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.929
 Japan was made 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:59.339
 meanwhile pay attention to verquigneul last I can tell you that 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.119
 your 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.679
 at the same time it's not too nervous 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.979
 look narrow enough that you are your skin 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.979
 he never got to know now that cut everything 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.419
 maybe the others I understand 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.699
 after more than 20 years 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.579
 in the other 30 p these studies 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.379
 as com 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.999
 and we love you 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:25.759
 the process whereas 30 seconds of euros it is not necessary to put it two 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.759
 minutes directly it must be done little by little 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.179
 so for 100 euros 24 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.989
 3 3% to 30 seconds you wait each time per year 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.809
 because the bike is getting hot 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:41.209
 so economically 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.639
 really 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.639
 concretely 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.309
 a list of finalists 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.189
 I go 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.189
 losses 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:07.969
 for the exit 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.969
 so I will not go back 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.249
 false 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:19.249
 so everything is out we can see 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.279
 I still hurt because I see someone still 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.939
 it is slightly 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:27.760
 girls 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.300
 here i was humiliated to drop but fatah ahmed djoghlaf before july 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.660
 graham I have a good team so the bank things versus 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.169
 the experience he was I just lived 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.180
 I recommend you to the gates of Paris if that's it 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.960
 the economy is so 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.509
 - you can do it because aesthetically it's cute 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:52.599
 one of his banks 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.539
 but as I told you there is some product that came out 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.879
 slightly participate 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.360
 so 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.919
 m bah here's actually it comes out like that before the sequence to do his 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.159
 hair 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.379
 to hama annual results when you do it in the oven at 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.979
 microwave is simply lizotte perfect neil in hand that spring 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.979
 slightly over here 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.159
 so me what I want to pass a microwave oven indeed god 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.210
 a time with the hair dryer and that makes m 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.999
 not all very nice corner of a good meal texture is the same there is no 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.999
 problem it's really the same thing 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.750
 so limits use hotspots 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.639
 in the genre you can use the brand in matter 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.100
 if you do not feel like putting back in tomato bins or big helpers for them 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.389
 of pigments please big compasses toddlers like that I 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.389
 tell me especially sephora 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.599
 to cliff sephora the large format of these formats the scholarly blade well 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.660
 a long time even if it's not small jars of 5 grams does not use anything of that 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.259
 that you are going to overflow everywhere 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.139
 so the state 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.580
 What advice do you have for bathing? 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.040
 pay attention to you to see if you live it you are making time 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.619
 in the microwave oven 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.229
 but his hair seemed to hold then the 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.419
 jumbo upside down with m la pass on it
