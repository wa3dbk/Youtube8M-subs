00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
me right to my cellular usage which is

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.629 
me right to my cellular usage which is
cool<00:02:12.510> um<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:14.439> can<00:02:14.560> do<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:14.799> with<00:02:14.859> multiple

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:15.639 
cool um you can do this with multiple

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.459 
cool um you can do this with multiple
different<00:02:15.790> ones<00:02:16.120> obviously<00:02:16.930> there's<00:02:17.079> over<00:02:17.260> 40

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
different ones obviously there's over 40

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.270 
different ones obviously there's over 40
so<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.709> can<00:02:17.829> solve

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
so you can solve

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.190 
so you can solve
all<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.490> them<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.850> then<00:02:19.569> here's<00:02:19.840> something<00:02:20.080> I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
all of them and then here's something I

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.280 
all of them and then here's something I
like<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.620> could<00:02:21.420> make<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.450> folder<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.170> them

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
like you could make a folder out of them

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.840 
like you could make a folder out of them
obviously<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.040> then<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.959> could<00:02:26.550> either<00:02:27.550> put

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
obviously and then you could either put

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.300 
obviously and then you could either put
it<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.060> your<00:02:28.150> dock<00:02:28.560> which<00:02:29.560> would<00:02:29.800> be<00:02:29.950> pretty

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
it in your dock which would be pretty

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
awesome you could just have like a

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.740 
awesome you could just have like a
