00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.800
 today we make a very rich recipe 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.380
 few ingredients because they are gods 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.809
 green beans we will make with cream 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.539
 we start to listen to the green beans 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.330
 take the salt 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.480
 here we have water that is boiling 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.480
 here it is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:33.870
 we put the salt and we go to cheat the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 our green beans here I would say that that is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.350
 a more than sufficient portion e 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 let it cook for about 5 minutes 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 pan a little butter 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.600
 let's say a spoon 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:57.510
 let's light up and take a spring onion 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.410
 cooler then say we have a 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.369
 outer film that those who make it harder 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's cut this other green piece into that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.850
 more coriaceous we cut in half and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.430
 we finally slice we can already 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.909
 put it in the pan and we do 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.909
 the other half 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.640
 here we are and now let's get bored 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.530
 softly these five minutes that us 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.159
 we are also discounting ours 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.159
 green beans 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 at this point we can go to school 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:47.200
 the beans then turn off and go to 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.439
 put our green beans in the pan 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:56.380
 where himself frying the spring onion here 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.479
 here ok at this point we can 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.219
 add the cream 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:07.410
 let's take our cream menapace cream 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:13.810
 pretty dense perfect at this point 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:17.440
 let's mix so well here 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.110
 this time we can not even 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:26.160
 use more mussolini spoons but 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:31.049
 simply turn so slowly 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.910
 consider about 15 minutes of cooking 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.549
 just to make me understand it must become 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.200
 a cream rather than hilt and therefore 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.200
 then bring our green beans to cooking 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.180
 you see that practically a now one 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.680
 cream should now be tasted with less 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.120
 taste to hear if the amount of 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.640
 salt is correct 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 consider that we have put 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.430
 adding the cream 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:05.760
 It is obvious that it has softened then enough 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.040
 taste a little the cream is not needed 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.980
 and still serves the salt is a nice one 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:17.120
 generous evening is really fat 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.610
 as a recipe but sometimes you can 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:29.910
 must 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:37.440
 here was perhaps more useful to use 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:43.890
 a tray in between, but let's go to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.450
 put a pattern on it now 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.310
 honestly it's not nice because you have to 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.100
 say it's not nice where I can 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.060
 really ensure that 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.060
 delicious
