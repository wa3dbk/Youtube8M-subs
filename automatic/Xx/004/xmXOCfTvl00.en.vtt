is you got to take your 16 blocks and
break<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.550> down<00:03:30.760> into<00:03:32.040> regular<00:03:33.040> diamonds<00:03:33.970> once

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
break it down into regular diamonds once

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.320 
break it down into regular diamonds once
you<00:03:34.570> break<00:03:35.080> all<00:03:35.350> 16<00:03:36.190> blocks<00:03:36.459> in<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.910> Diamonds

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
you break all 16 blocks in the Diamonds

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.410 
you break all 16 blocks in the Diamonds
then<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.290> immediately<00:03:38.820> immediately<00:03:39.820> switch

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
then you immediately immediately switch

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.630 
then you immediately immediately switch
back<00:03:40.660> over<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.440> blocks<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.190> then

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
back over to the blocks and then

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.180 
back over to the blocks and then
transform<00:03:43.390> them<00:03:43.720> back<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.530> blocks<00:03:44.830> it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
transform them back in the blocks it

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.150 
transform them back in the blocks it
basically<00:03:45.790> legs<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.750> system<00:03:47.170> just<00:03:47.500> enough<00:03:47.920> to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
basically legs the system just enough to

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.210 
basically legs the system just enough to
pull<00:03:48.370> off<00:03:48.580> an<00:03:48.850> actual<00:03:49.209> duplication<00:03:50.070> again<00:03:51.070> I'm

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220
