00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the powder is sitting on top because I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.170 
the powder is sitting on top because I
had<00:00:36.750> already<00:00:37.250> started<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> video<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
had already started the video and I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.920 
had already started the video and I
rerecord<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.100> decided<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> over<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
rerecord I decided to do it over and I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.959 
rerecord I decided to do it over and I
stopped<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> process<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.920> anyway<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.940> can

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
stopped the process so anyway as you can

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.270 
stopped the process so anyway as you can
see<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.390> already<00:00:45.570> basically<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.800> process

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
see I'm already basically in the process

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.660 
see I'm already basically in the process

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and that's because I had already put the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.590 
and that's because I had already put the
powder<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> added<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:56.600> some
