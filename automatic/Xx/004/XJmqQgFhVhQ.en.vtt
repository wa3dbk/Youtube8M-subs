00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.820
 we have already done to recover our picture tigrillo asad who 1817 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.829
 is the original of abraham cooper 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.170
 it does it in addition to sea force with nine to the original frame was not a frame 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.430
 that it was good for him, a cleaning and restoration has been done 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.199
 reading this principle is 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.199
 in 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.060
 for again laredo miguel german carlos good as it is sealed on 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.890
 two crystals for him 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.860
 should be considered 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.809
 per cent the frame or we want then where it is more in line with the general painting 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.390
 To the date 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.749
 who an inside piece of the boat that mahogany 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:01:00.040
 a visitor stops for 2013 to paint a centimeter 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.950
 and the back that amount 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.810
 the settlers have come back out 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.020
 after cleaning 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.409
 and I'm going to teach you 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.650
 more or less homogeneous 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.040
 the radiography 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.960
 of the box 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.220
 there were nobody can touch 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.700
 the iron has been left as it was but it was dehydrated in such 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.020
 sense that impose some kind of products 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.600
 for it the Pan-American 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 it was sealed it will get it 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.290
 nobody can touch it while they were alive and for the plaintiff 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.550
 since the serious problem of this type some 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.040
 serious problems that 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 they were not touching 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.420
 with your fingers and nobody can touch it 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.960
 you can see the beauty of when or how all the 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.180
 expeditions the colors 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
 as a good step and the colors of the box 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.520
 the color is that they did not look 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.449
 since I was 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.530
 dt I wish they were just was 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.989
 they had touched her 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.839
 at this moment it is totally 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.559
 they lied 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.559
 although the colors there was already a time 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.159
 and then the 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
 we are very satisfied 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.869
 of our hobby 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:35.679
 I decided to go home 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.589
 It is the fourth par excellence 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:40.749
 London 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.499
 Yes, good 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.979
 now you can not be 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.979
 it has been treated so well what is painting 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.559
 It has put some processions 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.349
 i 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.930
 and normally I should be here and now protected from the art 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.439
 many more years of which we are going to decide 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.289
 we are very proud it is a piece of collected collection 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.509
 it's an adventure that knows 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:20.940
 the published a lot of economics books explain 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.749
 but just like him 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.209
 according to a pretty high value for us 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.249
 since it's part of the race's history 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.649
 since these two copies 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.859
 they were the ones 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.969
 the first copies that a standard was inscribed on them 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.159
 and then it's part 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.090
 real story of our fantastic house in 2010 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.649
