00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
like it looks right now you can easily

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.140 
like it looks right now you can easily
use<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.630> opacity<00:02:08.960> tool<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.740> reverse<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.940> go

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
use the opacity tool and reverse and go

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.310 
use the opacity tool and reverse and go
back<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.720> then<00:02:12.710> it<00:02:12.770> looks<00:02:12.920> like<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:13.310> now<00:02:14.320> now

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
back and then it looks like this now now

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.000 
back and then it looks like this now now
you're<00:02:15.950> basically<00:02:16.190> done<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:17.830> there<00:02:18.830> is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
you're basically done but there is

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.770 
you're basically done but there is
something<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.700> really<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.330> do<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
something that I really like to do and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.610 
something that I really like to do and
that<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.440> change<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.370> mode<00:02:22.910> back<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.840> overlay

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
that is change the mode back to overlay

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.600 
that is change the mode back to overlay
to<00:02:25.490> overlay<00:02:25.880> you'll<00:02:26.570> notice<00:02:26.870> now<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:28.040> gave<00:02:28.340> her

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
to overlay you'll notice now it gave her

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.600 
to overlay you'll notice now it gave her
like<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.350> change<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.500> skin<00:02:30.740> tone<00:02:31.010> but<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.430> also

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
like a change of skin tone but it also

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.290 
like a change of skin tone but it also
made<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.180> look<00:02:32.330> much<00:02:33.020> much<00:02:33.410> more<00:02:33.739> realistic

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
made it look much much more realistic

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.820 
made it look much much more realistic
then<00:02:35.300> then<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.620> multiply<00:02:37.130> did<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.140> yeah<00:02:39.530> like

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
then then the multiply did so yeah like

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.930 
then then the multiply did so yeah like
that<00:02:40.070> overlay

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
that overlay

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.660 
that overlay
I<00:02:40.970> prefer<00:02:41.570> overlay<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.250> final<00:02:43.550> result

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
I prefer overlay is the final result

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.940 
I prefer overlay is the final result
