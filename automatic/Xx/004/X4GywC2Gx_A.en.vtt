00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.950
 that's his everyday life I believe 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.480
 but everyone would have a ford with one 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.510
 but can live in a draw 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.330
 After all, it remains 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.090
 tasting spaces always have to live 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.880
 So that's one story 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.900
 another gameplay honestly who 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.520
 training for us in all cases 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.920
 been we have had just as good 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.890
 can lose if you are in the 89th 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.210
 which they get 221 still have to 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.370
 so to speak , the team has 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.350
 Unbelievable everything is always in top 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.180
 order as far as we have said 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.710
 early, just not sack 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.090
 have closed up huge opportunities 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.239
 omitting the chance evaluation were 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.350
 just poor and therefore 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.589
 we only have quotation marks 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.900
 draw plays to the referee 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.239
 I have to say I am seriously disappointed 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.100
 was two line with yellow-red leaves 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.400
 there was something in the turmoil of the season 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.019
 with the going on and a word world i 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 understand would be a body rothweiler 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.830
 google there but you can in principle the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.840
 whole team then that goes 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.000
 not ok but you can not 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.440
 Hope is the way you are 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.710
 all the more annoying in a week stood 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.150
 is always important or at least that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.450
 prominent game against which he complains 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.720
 from wals siezenheim economy in the cup 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.510
 Player injured like Mr. Winkler 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.020
 Federer Lupo Amelete and now even though 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.300
 blocked 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.890
 that's certainly painfully bitter for 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.240
 safe painful and bitter but im 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.940
 end effect what can you do you can 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.380
 Do not change it so stay cool 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.200
 is already somehow team 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.810
 run up and yes you can change them 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.910
 season goes over 30 games and nice 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.350
 but this next player of the game 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.960
 we will see it will be somehow 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.940
 go on and keep your head up and up 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.120
 just keep then after maybe 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.080
 a bit of a lack of staff prevails 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.580
 could co-trainer too 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.980
 Rothensteiner accumulate 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.060
 yes is definitely alternative and 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.850
 I'll see that you can 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.590
 weeks two players still fit collar and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.090
 hope to go on again 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.070
 that happens halfway and then 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.750
 let's keep looking 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.619
 we summarize and do great things 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.420
 order 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.069
 look that goes on maybe 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.550
 with the little bit of luck community for the 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.690
 austria 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.690
 and I'm against you thank you 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.180
 Preparer at the 1 0 victory in Neumarkt 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.210
 through the preparation what the elfer 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.010
 out today once again the gate 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.870
 so it has prepared itself looks it 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.760
 everything will be back up or play 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.100
 then has strangely to the conclusion 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.840
 but still turned around and then again 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.120
 turned around and then more upside down 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.220
 strange today actually be like season 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.600
 full partie you were coming even everyday 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.610
 said that with a draw 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.160
 be satisfied though you are in the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.870
 play history is looked at 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.970
 natural disasters but in one point 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.140
 with abroad is always good stuff and 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.850
 charming that you continue to play like that 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.840
 especially annoying of course after that 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.800
 Great cheers the minute the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.030
 loss hit the defeats strike 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.610
 you can still compensate there 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.900
 really two players punished it is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.600
 I probably but probably about the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.790
 Referee Family Catastrophe Alert 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.340
 at the lake from over 22 at outdoor can 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.870
 What can we do for our two 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.660
 defender of the league have that 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.920
 as high as jumping grandma anne was 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.050
 Exaggerated though , is with me 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.290
 disasters but that does indeed know 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.110
 that he did a fuck speaks 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.480
 the word ever if it is an individual 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.420
 We are here from vollgepflastert 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.570
 in the fanblock of austria four hours 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.860
 hundreds of miles after age 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.890
 unique or motto in the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.390
 Regional football in Hallein in Zell am 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.350
 see et cetera was great as many people 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.390
 accompany the team 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.170
 well, madness so that had to 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.320
 I look in the Bundesliga 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.120
 Club of Cancer Act 1 Minutes Four 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.440
 corners and eu companies heartbeat expression 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.820
 give that really ten hours 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.060
 Sit in the trains or by car 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.410
 be driven and yes werner then 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.030
 still much joy 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.330
 next time from next saturday 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.330
 Everything will be good for him now 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.870
 uli schmidt the first half we came 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.939
 namely, 1 0 in the break 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.230
 but thomas de gegentor can bring 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.120
 cashed second half has one 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.040
 actually everyday small-war belongs 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.120
 had then shortly before closing 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.739
 still annoys the 12th hit and then 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.209
 makes still the compensation something all the more 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.479
 is more pleased and then punished too 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.350
 still for how many as a scorer 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.160
 I am generally meanwhile 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.680
 position game 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.470
 we said before a draw 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.740
 is enough for us but in hindsight you have to 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.789
 let's say we have to win the game 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.900
 a drawing to more always says 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.440
 abstract first in my view 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.120
 offside or not involved have also 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.930
 Sorry from the grandstand side 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.120
 is the better view of the jury 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.590
 At that time , his second goal was stupid 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.880
 Standard situations August at the Nissan 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.960
 dangerous because it is quite long inside 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.729
 we have luckily closed 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.639
 and will be punished for ours 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.349
 Positive emotions have to be said 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.750
 referee has no emotions 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.330
 needs your game and understands 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.650
 Of course not after the 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.229
 some excitement but still full with 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.250
 adrenaline trembled 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.990
 twice bitter or you shoot 2 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.620
 2-Compensation is then punished next 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.090
 games know who to meet 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.979
 one can still say that is the double 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.160
 disappointment that you sperner next 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.060
 one is punished that one the 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.010
 tv show offers 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.310
 We are looking forward to the fans in the game 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.310
 are 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.360
 unfortunately underestimated one side of 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.979
 chloe weakest week in the match of 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.330
 proved that you also from the side what 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.310
 can effect and his 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.050
 to drive teammates 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.509
 you stand next to and make sure that 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.860
 we have percent next saturday 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.930
 again, who put the obama there and 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.009
 earned that time twice quasi for us 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:59.590
 that's enough for an America product 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.590
 but it is so it is thanks anyway
