ago when I first I remember
doing<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.250> first<00:02:14.520> time<00:02:14.850> when<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
doing the this the first time when I

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.560 
doing the this the first time when I
moved<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.410> Greensboro<00:02:16.950> North<00:02:17.040> Carolina<00:02:17.570> about

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
moved to Greensboro North Carolina about

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.530 
moved to Greensboro North Carolina about
20<00:02:19.140> years<00:02:19.320> ago<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:20.010> was<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.570> 1993<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:22.200> think<00:02:22.560> and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
20 years ago it was in 1993 I think and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.140 
20 years ago it was in 1993 I think and
anyway<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.570> was<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.640> playing<00:02:26.640> around<00:02:26.790> this

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
anyway I was just playing around this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.900 
anyway I was just playing around this
idea<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.080> invented<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.740> little<00:02:29.100> plastic

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
idea and I invented this little plastic

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.730 
idea and I invented this little plastic
canvas<00:02:30.600> idea<00:02:31.550> where<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.990> mount<00:02:33.990> your<00:02:34.470> crochet

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
canvas idea where you mount your crochet

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.670 
canvas idea where you mount your crochet
piece<00:02:35.220> onto<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.880> plastic<00:02:36.330> canvas<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.110> then

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
piece onto the plastic canvas and then

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680 
piece onto the plastic canvas and then
at<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.010> bottom<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.610> put<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> little<00:02:39.300> bar

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
at the bottom you just put a little bar

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.920 
at the bottom you just put a little bar
and<00:02:40.400> then<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.670> could<00:02:41.820> slide<00:02:42.150> your<00:02:42.420> towel<00:02:42.630> in

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
and then you could slide your towel in

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.560 
and then you could slide your towel in
and<00:02:43.170> out<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.190> can<00:02:44.340> wash<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.390> then

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
and out and you can wash this and then

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.840 
and out and you can wash this and then
you<00:02:46.110> don't<00:02:46.380> have<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.070> doesn't<00:02:47.400> ruin<00:02:47.550> your

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
you don't have to it doesn't ruin your

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.780 
you don't have to it doesn't ruin your
topper<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.380> thought<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.160> very<00:02:50.220> very

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
topper so I thought that was very very

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.840 
topper so I thought that was very very
clever<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.830> towel<00:02:53.040> topper<00:02:53.610> and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
clever so this is the towel topper and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.750 
clever so this is the towel topper and
then<00:02:54.390> there's<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.750> matching<00:02:55.050> pot<00:02:55.560> holder<00:02:56.010> and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
then there's a matching pot holder and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360 
then there's a matching pot holder and
it's<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.510> same<00:02:57.780> idea<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.650> single<00:02:58.980> crochet

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
it's the same idea the single crochet

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.400 
it's the same idea the single crochet
the<00:02:59.640> changing<00:03:00.120> colors<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:00.990> go<00:03:01.230> on

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
the changing colors and if you go on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.860 
the changing colors and if you go on
YouTube<00:03:01.860> I've<00:03:02.160> got<00:03:02.460> some<00:03:02.760> projects<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.630> show
