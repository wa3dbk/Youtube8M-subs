Mississippi<00:00:20.220> inside<00:00:21.220> is<00:00:21.430> my<00:00:21.580> crane<00:00:21.789> machine<00:00:22.150> I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
Mississippi inside is my crane machine I

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.720 
Mississippi inside is my crane machine I
built<00:00:22.779> it<00:00:22.900> from<00:00:23.019> connects<00:00:23.439> over<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.519> summer

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
built it from connects over the summer

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.050 
built it from connects over the summer
it<00:00:25.330> took<00:00:25.449> me<00:00:25.570> about<00:00:25.720> two<00:00:25.960> weeks<00:00:25.990> and<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.939> a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
it took me about two weeks and it's a

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.089 
it took me about two weeks and it's a
one<00:00:28.449> of<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.660> few<00:00:29.019> engineering<00:00:29.500> projects<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:30.039> do

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
one of the few engineering projects I do

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.040 
one of the few engineering projects I do
here<00:00:30.369> while<00:00:30.519> on<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.730> school<00:00:30.970> so<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.869> crane

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
here while on the school so the crane

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.540 
here while on the school so the crane
machine<00:00:32.320> works<00:00:32.500> just<00:00:32.890> like<00:00:32.950> any<00:00:33.160> other<00:00:33.309> crane

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
machine works just like any other crane

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.549 
machine works just like any other crane
machine<00:00:33.850> you'll<00:00:34.090> pop<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.329> quarter<00:00:34.750> in<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.140> then

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
machine you'll pop a quarter in and then

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.410 
machine you'll pop a quarter in and then
you'll<00:00:35.710> take<00:00:35.980> a<00:00:36.040> hold<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.460> controls<00:00:36.820> now

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
you'll take a hold of the controls now

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.940 
you'll take a hold of the controls now
as<00:00:37.540> soon<00:00:37.719> as<00:00:37.840> you<00:00:37.960> put<00:00:38.170> your<00:00:38.200> quarter<00:00:38.590> in<00:00:38.739> a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
as soon as you put your quarter in a

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.799 
as soon as you put your quarter in a
timer<00:00:39.340> will<00:00:39.579> start<00:00:39.790> and<00:00:40.000> some<00:00:40.360> music<00:00:40.450> will

did<00:01:09.880> not<00:01:10.030> come<00:01:10.240> out<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.540> design<00:01:10.840> book<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.409> was

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
did not come out of a design book it was

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.280 
did not come out of a design book it was
not<00:01:11.799> all<00:01:12.010> something<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:13.030> did<00:01:13.750> design<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.260> myself

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
not all something I did design it myself

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.179 
not all something I did design it myself
I<00:01:14.970> actually<00:01:15.970> reverse<00:01:16.479> engineered<00:01:17.290> parts<00:01:17.979> of

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
I actually reverse engineered parts of

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.490 
I actually reverse engineered parts of
the<00:01:18.490> crane<00:01:18.700> machine<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.540> fit<00:01:19.689> my<00:01:19.810> own<00:01:19.960> needs<00:01:20.229> I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
the crane machine to fit my own needs I

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.070 
the crane machine to fit my own needs I
ripped<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.580> circuit<00:01:21.909> board<00:01:22.090> out<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.750> small

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
ripped the circuit board out of a small

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.850 
ripped the circuit board out of a small
toy<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.650> I<00:01:24.549> reverse<00:01:25.509> engineered<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.229> got<00:01:26.680> more

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
toy and I reverse engineered I got more

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.700 
toy and I reverse engineered I got more
wires<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:27.640> replaced<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.540> few<00:01:28.689> parts<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.290> then<00:01:29.680> I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
wires I replaced a few parts and then I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.319 
wires I replaced a few parts and then I
was<00:01:29.890> able<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.220> turn<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.610> into<00:01:30.700> what<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:30.939> is<00:01:31.030> now

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
was able to turn it into what it is now

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.990 
was able to turn it into what it is now
okay<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.829> crane<00:01:33.070> machine<00:01:33.340> has<00:01:33.460> been<00:01:33.579> live<00:01:33.790> for

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
okay the crane machine has been live for

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.560 
okay the crane machine has been live for
a<00:01:34.060> week<00:01:34.210> it's<00:01:34.780> already<00:01:35.200> made<00:01:35.350> $30<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.390> of
