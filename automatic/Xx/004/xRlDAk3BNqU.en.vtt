00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:07.640
 ha ha x although this is a dragon with us 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.030
 famous today are very popular 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.329
 pop artist 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.329
 the death of six cloth and tell about 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.189
 penguins are not sold on windows phone 7 and 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.999
 phones mozart 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.179
 and they first just tell us here 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.039
 conferences for developers why 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.159
 the developers are the usual tube conference on 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.780
 deadlines 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.520
 yes yes yes, that's it just for that 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.650
 tell me why it is this platform 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.730
 It is worth developing they say November 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.240
 got an android 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.370
 basic 1 2 3 1 2 3 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.300
 and who knows 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.400
 there are always technologies and two 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.370
 which the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.850
 most common for 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.060
 making large commercial 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.590
 applications 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.360
 which is easy in his speech 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.900
 stressed 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.070
 which is 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.829
 I left there operated 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.460
 In the studio, developers remain with friends 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.780
 technology developer 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.219
 interest rate clubs and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.679
 applications and therefore easy 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.079
 writes in the familiar language Spartak 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.000
 proximity to the application 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.450
 written for the phone at these prices 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.050
 on brent will be launched at the bedroom expo 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.330
 dobkin 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.850
 tolyatti mortal and valuable that this this 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.090
 special programming language 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.860
 language let's say technology 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.950
 programming extending 0 ones or 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.790
 other languages 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.590
 providing fast writing 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 pa 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.400
 and dynamic applications 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.340
 on it a representative sponsored and was 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.030
 released 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.330
 the work of the conference was told that there is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.570
 such 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.100
 concept as here is a lot on accuracy not two 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.960
 accuracy where involved 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.030
 phone processor and 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.740
 separation can be some kind of process 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.360
 beer sensor 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.850
 implemented it on other platforms 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.270
 summer of innovation from microsoft building on 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.110
 st when popova driven since 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.940
 use of these period A. glazunov 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.820
 Microsoft just went a few 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.700
 in another way, yes, respectively 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.079
 parts of the resource suffered by necessity it 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.860
 reveals prison secrets 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.080
 ok question about adaptation 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.330
 definitely like 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.710
 iron which will be in the future ie 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.430
 percentage is it provided 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.610
 only for 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.529
 so November 4th will 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:09.929
 Karelia will be full 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.129
 used and 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.309
 the keyboard is also microsoft it is like 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:15.760
 chela's previous development experience 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.949
 but if doses 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.999
 sky pauses three stages 4 5 6 and so on and now 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.149
 shots appropriate 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:24.909
 the requirement of the phone ie they are clearly 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:25.629
 identified 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.290
 if some developer wants 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.939
 release the phone then he accordingly 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.040
 because there is a set of technical requirements 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.489
 necessarily one gigahertz 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.159
 CPU 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.239
 this is sure to multitouch screen this 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.769
 Accelerometers required 4 promotions 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.569
 and the like then we are clearly 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.169
 fixed platform yes that is 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:43.930
 how would this platform include only three 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.539
 buttons 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.789
 underway 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:49.640
 about 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.740
 Do Kiev have these devices at all? 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.329
 future windows phone 7 in ukraine 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.919
 us that about this goal sushi are ready which are not 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.319
 ready 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.819
 when do you actually wait 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.089
 the store 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.449
 era telecom there are a few meters 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.039
 roads how to be service ready 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.909
 a priori 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.019
 kb some are ready since the phone 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.730
 completely cloudy yes surely already 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.760
 looked there 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.959
 Altai prototype actually chooses 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:13.689
 type of rub 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.499
 people dates ap people where I see all the changes in 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.079
 social networks occurred in 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.829
 the latter did not go to court judging by 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.859
 everything in Qatar is one of the most interesting 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:23.700
 moments that is 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.140
 I have friends in classmates scoreboard 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.219
 on the post of the main technopark yet 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.810
 this is stability in the republic 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.310
 that is, and alai in windows live there twitter and the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.920
 similar to what's happening there with those 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.349
 or otherwise come across yes in paypal 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.300
 as it is 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.510
 it doesn't matter there in Ukraine they are in Ukraine all this 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.359
 here it is, but here we have it 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.379
 and baths kolesnikov dmitry something 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.829
 wrote Ivan Nikitin writes and the like 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.069
 she this roll pita thousand actually third 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.829
 my friends are in all my networks and 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.069
 make up my 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.169
 phone book 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.389
 phones also fit there phones 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.909
 will be lost that everywhere the exchange server 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.500
 local databases 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.510
 percentage base on the kaspar principle 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.270
 the bases of this don't know him there 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.409
 that's some kind of there 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.120
 dust not long ago bath to find yes 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.129
 let's find vadim r it there edge 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.129
 but his and vadim dates here 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:19.909
 no differences working phone 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.499
 Ukraine phone working somewhere else 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:23.150
 not 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.009
 he as usual who gets all the basic 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.210
 services consumes 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.979
 dates spod which is similar yes and she 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.699
 another scenario of the same 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:31.740
 using the same 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.639
 pictures yes 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.139
 I can see the pictures as 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.229
 habitual which 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.750
 camera deal yes 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.890
 and so famously draw again all new 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.780
 photos taken people have yes friends a 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.530
 pluses if you look at an injection here we see 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.900
 at first only pictures are 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.729
 on the phone 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.059
 And after some time, the questionnaire is now a month 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.259
 Nikkezhich on the card so it will take 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:54.599
 time 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.430
 he won't pull so matched 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.720
 these are all my photos are all mine 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.460
 photo albums present 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.099
 In general, in all the gang was not given 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.159
 but what is often lacking data in Ukraine 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.229
 This is the Ukrainization of the entire interface. 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.459
 partial Ukrainization 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:12.899
 interface are present so 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:15.240
 For example, if you go to the settings, switch 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.099
 knee 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.839
 Ali tab on Ukrainian MOV 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.289
 then he would get 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.289
 This year's Ukrainian Pasat 3t chest of the day 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.599
 then I celebrate Lena ghost towns 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.170
 which is 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.460
 And the keyboard is, that is, we can 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.780
 develop third-party applications 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.690
 Daytona system keyboard but by itself 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.760
 imagine the keyboard 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.980
 here she is present 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.700
 so our employee wrote Denis 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.259
 beekeeper n 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.479
 such a traditional shopping for Canadian 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.080
 keyboard date asia pro russian 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.909
 Ukrainian mova yes then so that it looks like 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.339
 would be applications but nonetheless completely 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:52.430
 brought the market with an interface but only 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.009
 Ukrainize if you look 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:55.960
 sending message sending work with 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.369
 by the kidneys of a thousand cubic meters of the text itself 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:00.389
 will seem without problems 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.389
 aek and to type let's say i choose 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.169
 there to send to mobile dial 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.310
 this year so we condemn and send 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.719
 letter or there found in bingles found in 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:09.659
 dublin respectively 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.949
 search string is substituted 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.559
 so last question 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:16.789
 when on the phone in stores however it 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.360
 not so easy 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.889
 family, as it were, everything depends on 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:22.449
 Ukrainian legislation 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.659
 gives Russia and the CIS 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.119
 that is, again, Ukrainian palop 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.779
 there legislation issue with the brand 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.369
 Belt that is Volga 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:31.869
 to free apps 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:33.439
 marketplace even being in Ukraine 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:35.989
 I can deflate install and the 

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:39.199
 similar but water is acceptable 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.650
 and here is 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.330
 in many ways the date of the Oscar is already 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.010
 installed 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.840
 but I need to pay in Ukraine who 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.760
 No, I will not deceive the cold 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.650
 in Ukraine it is American and 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.230
 European card yes and Ukrainian 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.930
 cards, alas, does not apply yet 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.129
 again not a microsoft problem pox problems 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.439
 in each country and in legislation 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:02.470
 long time ago 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.740
 university state that 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.740
 this denial reports the site of the league he 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.270
 m 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.030
 phone overview and 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.899
 duties and windows phone 7 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:16.239
 ha ha ha
