00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.730

really<00:01:07.380> fine<00:01:08.450> little<00:01:09.450> exfoliating<00:01:10.229> particles

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
really fine little exfoliating particles

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
really fine little exfoliating particles
in<00:01:10.890> there<00:01:11.390> out<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> way<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.960> works

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
in there out in the way that this works

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.289 
in there out in the way that this works
is<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.619> put<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.040> your<00:01:14.340> skin<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.909> dry

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
is you put it on your skin when it's dry

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.450 
is you put it on your skin when it's dry
you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:16.259> also<00:01:16.470> use<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> wet<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.220> find<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you can also use it wet but I find that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
you can also use it wet but I find that
it's<00:01:17.610> more<00:01:17.820> effective<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> use<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.869> dry

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it's more effective if you use it on dry

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's more effective if you use it on dry
skin<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.890> massage<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.460> into<00:01:20.700> your

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
skin and you just massage it into your

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
skin and you just massage it into your
skin<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> eventually<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.650> massage<00:01:22.920> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
skin and eventually if you massage it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.240 
skin and eventually if you massage it
enough<00:01:23.460> usually<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.390> minute<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.830> grains

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
enough usually about a minute the grains

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
enough usually about a minute the grains
will<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> disappear<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.540> becomes

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
will kind of disappear it just becomes

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.160 
will kind of disappear it just becomes
this<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.200> smooth<00:01:28.619> creamy<00:01:29.130> consistency

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
this really smooth creamy consistency

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.240 
this really smooth creamy consistency
and<00:01:31.170> once<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.439> get<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.619> point<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and once you get to that point then you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.830 
and once you get to that point then you
can<00:01:32.369> rinse<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> off<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> say<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
can rinse it off and I have to say this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.060 
can rinse it off and I have to say this

an avocado clay one they have the pilaf
cucumber<00:02:57.620> one<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.490> they're<00:02:58.610> all<00:02:58.760> really<00:02:59.120> great
