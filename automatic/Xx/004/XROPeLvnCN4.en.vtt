00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
 there would be no sad prophecy 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.610
 came true 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:23.040

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:50.640
 forces of evil or my beloved are mine 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.950
 last hope flies over the whole region 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.220

 golden hair and red lips
