00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello everyone with you games tatler and 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.180
 Today I am with you Andrei stories 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:17.260
 and we will talk about the new assassin's 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:19.660
 creed syndicate sensor you were silent and and we 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.519
 and you have already watched the first videos on the network 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.289
 and made your first impression about 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.090
 a game that must be said beforehand 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.279
 spoiled by running the previous part 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.359
 franchises however few people know what 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.189
 some favorites 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.529
 have already shown the game behind closed doors 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.480
 Quebec studio ubisoft you listened 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.520
 what was there and also decided 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.780
 watch the chronicles and tell 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.690
 you about everything at the moment 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.760
 aware of the game and so character jacob 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.530
 and ivy fry twins born for 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.350
 outside london and grown 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.180
 assassins today it says gang 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.309
 rook who have some weight 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.050
 the underworld but despite all this 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.719
 they are still positive characters 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.449
 because gang is a tool which 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.070
 they throw against their old enemy 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.989
 the Knights Templar although everything is still relatively 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.940
 the third part of the game faction height is not 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.040
 ceased to be divided into black and white 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.750
 it seems to us very positive and we 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.780
 We hope that the further motivation of the characters 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.860
 will be even more complex and complex in 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.840
 this time animus and throw you in london 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.700
 1868 and will be about industrial 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.680
 revolution in its very drink and need 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.660
 note that this is the most modern place 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.580
 actions in the series and therefore a lot of new 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.330
 on the part of the gameplay for example appeared 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.280
 full gunshot 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.560
 revolver you will use it 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.570
 for long-range attacks and spectacular finishes 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.760
 Boat trips will also be available. 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.800
 the carriage and even the train judging because 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.900
 it will be possible to arrange cinematic 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.550
 scenes of battles on the roofs of the types then rather 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.770
 just something similar we will see and on 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.600
 the roof of the train in the end is not for nothing 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 they included a similar battle scene in 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.930
 the trailer by the way steal cobb and they always 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.760
 will go unpunished 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.980
 journalists noted that during the game 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.990
 sometimes you will be caught up by a cop and 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.910
 dump the scared and and the physics itself and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.740
 behavior is called and during the game is very 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.020
 reminds watch dogs that for many 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.370
 rather minus than plus after all there she is 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.930
 was too arcade 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.150
 and how it does not feel heavy 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.979
 car is not its not around too 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.850
 or assassin's creed cat hook 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.679
 Main character 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.390
 now opens up new possibilities for 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.430
 moving around the city now it's not 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.560
 only land on the roof but from the roof on 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.270
 roof and using the second option you 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.640
 you can make a surprise attack 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.590
 top in previously inaccessible places on 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.660
 according to the lucky ones who saw her play 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.340
 can be used as a weapon for now 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.020
 only there were mentions as a consequence 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.180
 disarming opponents like 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.519
 pulling out a revolver and from the hands of a battle system 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.510
 change for each game from year to year and 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.000
 will improve 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.980
 and proclaim the ideal but it seems on 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.290
 this time we are not cheated the game has become 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.660
 tougher more brutal days more violence and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.910
 it is yet to face she seemed to have grown up 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.010
 together with their players their roots 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.060
 combat system fits deep into 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.910
 English culture and she 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.550
 for a minute, the birthplace of boxing is now fighting on 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.010
 swords this past is now only fist 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.620
 fight with brass knuckles with knives for meat 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.630
 revolvers and god knows what else personally 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.300
 It all reminded me of an old Wanda movie. 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.519
 New York turns all these cylinders and 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.099
 fights wall to wall and one more thing 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.930
 now two years destroyer kim mood 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.030
 the game has a lot of women with 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.980
 which you have to fight what 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.000
 you will be middle-aged in a fistfight with 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.250
 real lady 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.470
 it is also worth mentioning the capture of territories 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.480
 which made one to one as old 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.880
 good look already on andreas only 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.980
 the mechanics will most likely be something else 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.470
 sort of step by step the last will be like 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.569
 on each video my bank is interested here 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.110
 two questions will opponents try 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.269
 to capture 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.069
 already conquered territory and will 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.230
 all this replacing the classic point 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.000
 review to open stealth cards too 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.280
 sort of changed to and in fact we didn't 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.430
 could not find a single difference from unity 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.750
 that is, we get a new feeling 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.549
 what investigation began to appear 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.230
 some pudding or who find 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.269
 temporary inconsistencies such as logo 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.400
 this branch of the train that appeared 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.200
 almost a century too main action 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.239
 campaigns change us like glitches 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.609
 explained by failures in the system they messi 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.230
 or rather attempts to hack it to us 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.000
 had to jump then into the past then into 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.280
 the future and find a way out of the glitch 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.680
 systems wondering if there will be something here 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.810
 similar or is it a developer oversight 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.640
 equals play and features everything seems to be 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.230
 clear but what we know about here 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.790
 siding of the game itself in general 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.650
 the Victorian era happened very 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.570
 many events in different areas of life 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.609
 countries the main one concerned development 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.620
 technology intervention in the affairs of the church and 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.479
 ingrained new moral styles 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.240
 behaviors at this particular time became 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.940
 popular for a long time 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.800
 care concept lady and gentleman as well 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.020
 a lot of controversial ruling decisions 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.729
 Parliament among which was an exercise 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.740
 Irish National Church and 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.080
 handing over her royal property 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.449
 commissions maybe that's what this is looking for 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.520
 because they are most often with all the tamplier 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.740
 they hunt for religious 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.030
 artifacts and jacob and ivy with his 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.729
 gang chose green 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.830
 basic outfit is such a true 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.630
 Irish color is known that this year 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.250
 the last public execution took place 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.020
 vangi and it happened this 26 mad of 1868 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.310
 this day before minheight he was hanged 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.110
 not a cat michael barrett 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.180
 Irish terrorist possibly this 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.550
 the story will be based on the storyline 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.539
 as a step against the main characters and their 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.849
 Irish gang 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.460
 although who knows, this can only be a date in 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.409
 stories are also known about emily panchos 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.090
 a woman who has become famous for her 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.580
 suffragist movement for women's rights 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.319
 she wanted to give everyone miss and mrs 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.270
 the right to vote which in that era 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.380
 did not even belong to all men 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.330
 only elite 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.159
 she really was at the time of the game 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.110
 today is a secret but remember girl 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.180
 who told jacob in the trailer where 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.520
 there is one of the series raid bank there 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.169
 examples of bloody nora may ubisoft 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.940
 tell us what is this girl 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.250
 plucked up courage clan many assassins 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.469
 and became a part of the history of society 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.150
 decoction is just a pseudonym and 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.830
 finally a few words about themselves 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
 developers of their diaries 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.860
 the representatives 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.620
 a dream for them is an opportunity to show 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.420
 yourself and for us that means guys 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.670
 tired of being in the shadows and others in the studio and 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.800
 for them it means a lot you surely 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.540
 there were a lot of good ideas in particular 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.400
 after the last failures and forests 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.650
 montreal that after so many years 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.930
 work on prices could simply end 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.700
 ideas and forces by the way montreal studio 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.260
 also said a few words for example 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.390
 claim that they sincerely feel sorry for 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.460
 launch of their previous title which 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.380
 so harshly criticized the network yubisoft 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.780
 in bag made a couple more statement on the go 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.460
 presentations of the game for example they are not exactly 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.290
 will do it for consoles 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.360
 previous generation and yet they 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.870
 mentioned that they focused on 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.850
 single 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.860
 and not the fact that multiplayer will be in general 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.110
 the game that maybe it will benefit 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.180
 It was announced during the presentations and 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.950
 new addition in which we have to 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.670
 solve the riddle of charles dickens and 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.670
 Darwin 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.130
 it seems that's all we wanted you 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.810
 say about the new assassin's creed 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.280
 syndicate write a comment about what you are 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.870
 want to know more 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.360
 and we on the channel will soon be much 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.800
 more new and cool movies so 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.030
 subscribe to nothing 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.030
 skip all bye
