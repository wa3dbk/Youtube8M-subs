00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
all right so I'm gonna show you now some

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.059 
all right so I'm gonna show you now some
more<00:00:03.480> animation<00:00:04.049> stuff<00:00:04.290> that<00:00:04.500> what<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.710> have<00:00:04.920> up

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
more animation stuff that what I have up

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.130 
more animation stuff that what I have up
here<00:00:05.310> now<00:00:05.549> basically<00:00:06.359> moves<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:06.870> ball

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
here now basically moves one ball

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.110 
here now basically moves one ball
straight<00:00:07.830> across<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.370> screen<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.880> another

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
straight across the screen and another

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.900 
straight across the screen and another
ball<00:00:09.420> straight<00:00:09.809> down<00:00:10.130> when<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.280> app<00:00:11.429> begins

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
ball straight down when the app begins

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.959 
ball straight down when the app begins
so<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.540> not<00:00:12.660> too<00:00:12.900> complex<00:00:13.670> I'm<00:00:14.670> gonna<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
so it's not too complex I'm gonna do a

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.670 
so it's not too complex I'm gonna do a
little<00:00:15.089> more<00:00:15.299> complexity<00:00:15.960> what<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.199> want<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.529> do

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
little more complexity what I want to do

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.460 
little more complexity what I want to do
is<00:00:16.970> trip<00:00:17.970> start<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.480> want<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.779> ball<00:00:19.109> that's

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
is trip start I want this ball that's

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.580 
is trip start I want this ball that's
going<00:00:19.560> across<00:00:20.039> when<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.520> hits<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.300> edge<00:00:21.600> want

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
going across when it hits this edge want

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.230 
going across when it hits this edge want
to<00:00:22.680> kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> loop<00:00:23.100> back<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.760> start<00:00:24.090> going

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
to kind of loop back and start going

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.380 
to kind of loop back and start going
again<00:00:24.859> okay<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> way<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
again okay so the way to do that is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.160 
again okay so the way to do that is
there<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.230> an<00:00:28.349> edge<00:00:28.619> reached<00:00:29.099> event<00:00:30.170> with

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
there it's an edge reached event with

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
there it's an edge reached event with
the<00:00:31.349> balls<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> image<00:00:33.000> rights<00:00:33.300> as

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the balls and with the image rights as

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330 
the balls and with the image rights as
well<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.020> gonna<00:00:34.110> grab<00:00:34.350> ball<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:35.040> edge

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
well but I'm gonna grab ball one edge

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.150 
well but I'm gonna grab ball one edge
reach<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.969> ball<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.719> guy<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> when<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
reach so ball one is this guy and when I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
reach so ball one is this guy and when I
reach<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> edge<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.079> want<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.320> just

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
reach the edge I kind of want to just

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.790 
reach the edge I kind of want to just
set<00:00:41.129> his<00:00:41.309> X<00:00:41.520> property<00:00:42.030> back<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.570> two<00:00:43.350> zero

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
set his X property back to two zero

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.340 
set his X property back to two zero
right<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.430> want<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> make<00:00:45.469> his<00:00:47.180> his<00:00:48.180> location<00:00:49.110> be

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
right I want to make his his location be

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
right I want to make his his location be
back<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> total<00:00:50.700> left<00:00:50.940> side<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
back to the total left side of the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
back to the total left side of the
screen<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.530> gonna<00:00:52.800> set<00:00:53.129> fall<00:00:53.370> dot<00:00:53.579> X

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
screen so I just gonna set fall dot X

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
screen so I just gonna set fall dot X
back<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> zero<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.469> I'll<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.860> know

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
back to zero and I'll you know

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.040 
back to zero and I'll you know
immediately<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:57.000> live<00:00:57.239> testing<00:00:57.780> kind<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
immediately my live testing kind of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.910 
immediately my live testing kind of
shows<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.699> works<00:00:59.940> right

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
shows that that it that it works right

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.939 
shows that that it that it works right
of<00:01:02.340> course<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> Y<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.719> still<00:01:04.260> stuck<00:01:04.650> where<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of course the Y is still stuck where it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.679 
of course the Y is still stuck where it
is<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.369> restart<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> app<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.299> would<00:01:06.420> start

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
is if I restart the app it would start

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.260 
is if I restart the app it would start
and<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:09.000> let's<00:01:09.150> do

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and go one one time so let's do

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.670 
and go one one time so let's do
something<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> up-and-down<00:01:10.320> ball

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
something with the up-and-down ball

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.770 
something with the up-and-down ball
instead<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.189> trying<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> loop<00:01:12.060> back<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.659> I'll

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
instead of trying to loop back what I'll

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
instead of trying to loop back what I'll
do<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.080> want<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> make<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.130> go<00:01:14.250> straight<00:01:14.520> down

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
do is want to make it go straight down

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.999 
do is want to make it go straight down
and<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:15.600> turnaround<00:01:16.080> straight<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.920> then

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and then turnaround straight up and then

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.800 
and then turnaround straight up and then
straight<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> continuously<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.570> back

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
straight down and continuously go back

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.149 
straight down and continuously go back
and<00:01:19.049> forth<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.740> difference<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and forth that's a little difference a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
and forth that's a little difference a
little<00:01:20.250> harder<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.439> I'm<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.680> do

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
little harder and what I'm going to do

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.550 
little harder and what I'm going to do
is<00:01:23.070> first<00:01:23.340> introduce<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.119> variable<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
is first introduce a variable so a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
is first introduce a variable so a
variable<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> way<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> remember<00:01:26.970> something

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
variable is a way to remember something

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.940 
variable is a way to remember something
I<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> call<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.920> variable<00:01:29.189> distance

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
I want to call this variable distance

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
I want to call this variable distance
and<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.549> gonna<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> distance<00:01:33.360> moved

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and this is gonna be the distance moved

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.690 
and this is gonna be the distance moved
and<00:01:34.380> I'm<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.680> gonna<00:01:34.829> put<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.509> chin<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:37.700> so

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and I'm just gonna put in a chin here so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.880 
and I'm just gonna put in a chin here so
distance<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.650> gonna<00:01:40.770> change

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
distance is you know it's gonna change

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.639 
distance is you know it's gonna change
it's<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.610> variable<00:01:42.180> we're<00:01:42.960> gonna<00:01:43.079> start<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.530> out

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
it's a variable we're gonna start it out

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.429 
it's a variable we're gonna start it out
as<00:01:43.829> ten<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.729> fact<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.170> rid<00:01:46.350> of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
as ten in fact I'm going to get rid of

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.330 
as ten in fact I'm going to get rid of
the<00:01:46.530> ten<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.220> using<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.880> move<00:01:48.030> Y<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
the ten that I'm using to move Y and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
the ten that I'm using to move Y and
instead<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:51.030> gonna<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:52.200> move

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
instead what I'm gonna do is move

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.690 
instead what I'm gonna do is move
distance<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.790> each<00:01:54.119> clock<00:01:54.420> time<00:01:55.280> okay<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
distance on each clock time okay so this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
distance on each clock time okay so this
should<00:01:56.759> work<00:01:57.240> exactly<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> same<00:01:58.140> right<00:01:58.409> so

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
should work exactly the same right so

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.310 
should work exactly the same right so
the<00:01:58.770> variable<00:01:59.159> distance<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.759> memory<00:02:00.090> cell

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
the variable distance this memory cell

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.830 
the variable distance this memory cell
holds<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.409> ten<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:03.180> instead<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
holds a ten in it and now instead of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.859 
holds a ten in it and now instead of
moving<00:02:04.110> Y<00:02:04.469> by<00:02:04.969> the<00:02:05.969> fixed<00:02:06.329> number<00:02:06.360> ten<00:02:06.780> I'm

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
moving Y by the fixed number ten I'm

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.510 
moving Y by the fixed number ten I'm
gonna<00:02:06.990> move<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.380> by<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.590> variable<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.369> that

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
gonna move it by the variable but that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.729 
gonna move it by the variable but that
variable<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> ten<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.530> should

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
variable as a ten in it so it should

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.740 
variable as a ten in it so it should
just<00:02:10.860> move<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.879> did<00:02:12.030> originally<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
just move like like it did originally so

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.970 
just move like like it did originally so
I'm<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.349> to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
I'm going to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.370 
I'm going to
we<00:02:14.370> set<00:02:14.640> my<00:02:14.819> emulator<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.630> show<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
we set my emulator just to show you that

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.449 
we set my emulator just to show you that
this<00:02:17.130> app<00:02:17.400> should<00:02:17.670> work<00:02:17.910> exactly<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.720> same

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
this app should work exactly the same

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.860 
this app should work exactly the same
and<00:02:20.459> you'll<00:02:20.610> see<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.300> ball<00:02:21.510> dropped

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
and you'll see that the ball dropped

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.470 
and you'll see that the ball dropped
from<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> top<00:02:22.410> down<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> bottom<00:02:23.150> at<00:02:24.150> 10

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
from the top down to the bottom at 10

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.979 
from the top down to the bottom at 10
pixels<00:02:24.930> every<00:02:25.230> every<00:02:25.739> time<00:02:26.069> frame<00:02:26.810> now<00:02:27.810> what

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
pixels every every time frame now what

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.370 
pixels every every time frame now what
we<00:02:28.110> really<00:02:28.140> want<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.650> do<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.420> when<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.569> ball<00:02:30.600> in

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
we really want to do is when the ball in

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.440 
we really want to do is when the ball in
that<00:02:31.440> ball<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.040> reaches<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.790> edge<00:02:32.940> reaches

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
that ball to reaches the edge reaches

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.320 
that ball to reaches the edge reaches
the<00:02:33.569> bottom<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.830> want<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.100> change<00:02:35.459> how<00:02:35.880> much<00:02:36.120> it

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
the bottom we want to change how much it

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.960 
the bottom we want to change how much it
moves<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:37.140> each<00:02:37.290> time<00:02:37.560> frame<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.950> fact<00:02:38.160> we<00:02:38.850> want

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
moves on each time frame in fact we want

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.940 
moves on each time frame in fact we want
to<00:02:39.090> make<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.360> go<00:02:39.480> negative<00:02:39.810> 10<00:02:40.260> instead<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.769> 10

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
to make it go negative 10 instead of 10

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.430 
to make it go negative 10 instead of 10
so<00:02:41.190> there<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.430> goes<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:41.940> back<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.330> back<00:02:43.140> to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
so there it goes so it's back to back to

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.080 
so there it goes so it's back to back to
just<00:02:43.650> moving<00:02:43.980> straight<00:02:44.220> down<00:02:44.489> but<00:02:44.880> when<00:02:45.060> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
just moving straight down but when I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.259 
just moving straight down but when I
reach<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.630> edge<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:47.280> want<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.550> go<00:02:47.700> back<00:02:47.970> up

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
reach this edge I now want to go back up

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.320 
reach this edge I now want to go back up
right<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.400> essentially<00:02:50.910> what<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.269> to

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
right and so essentially what I want to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.100 
right and so essentially what I want to
do<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.709> want<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.920> set<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.310> distance<00:02:53.549> to

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
do is I want to set the distance to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.729 
do is I want to set the distance to
negative<00:02:55.110> 10<00:02:55.440> instead<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.220> team<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.620> I'm

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
negative 10 instead of team and I'm

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.380 
negative 10 instead of team and I'm
going<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.489> ball<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.090> that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
going to do that on the ball to that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.150 
going to do that on the ball to that
edge<00:03:00.540> reached<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.440> I'll<00:03:01.530> grab<00:03:01.799> an<00:03:01.980> edge

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
edge reached so I'll grab an edge

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.449 
edge reached so I'll grab an edge
reached<00:03:02.549> up<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.880> football<00:03:03.239> too<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.709> I'm<00:03:05.340> not

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
reached up in football too and I'm not

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.160 
reached up in football too and I'm not
gonna<00:03:05.580> move<00:03:05.880> ball<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.480> at<00:03:06.600> all<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:06.900> I'm<00:03:06.989> going

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
gonna move ball to at all what I'm going

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.710 
gonna move ball to at all what I'm going
to<00:03:07.200> do<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.530> change<00:03:07.860> my<00:03:08.220> variable<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.569> way<00:03:09.690> I

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
to do is change my variable the way I

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.240 
to do is change my variable the way I
change<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.170> variables<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.769> go<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.010> my

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
change the variables I go to my

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.820 
change the variables I go to my
definitions<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.989> because<00:03:13.290> I've<00:03:13.440> defined

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
definitions and because I've defined

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.890 
definitions and because I've defined
this<00:03:14.069> variable<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:14.880> got<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> couple<00:03:15.600> blocks

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
this variable I now got a couple blocks

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.809 
this variable I now got a couple blocks
here<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.680> them<00:03:16.799> lets<00:03:16.980> me<00:03:17.130> change<00:03:17.519> the

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
here one of them lets me change the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.890 
here one of them lets me change the
variables<00:03:18.299> I'm<00:03:19.140> gonna<00:03:19.350> set<00:03:19.590> distance<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.900> and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
variables I'm gonna set distance to and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.900 
variables I'm gonna set distance to and
what<00:03:22.200> I'm<00:03:22.290> gonna<00:03:22.380> set<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.609> start

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
what I'm gonna set it to just a start

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.039 
what I'm gonna set it to just a start
I'll<00:03:24.030> set<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.359> negative<00:03:24.840> team<00:03:26.060> okay<00:03:27.060> so

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
I'll set it to negative team okay so

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.740 
I'll set it to negative team okay so
when<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.290> reach<00:03:28.530> an<00:03:28.709> edge<00:03:29.239> it's<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.480> cause

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
when I reach an edge it's going to cause

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.120 
when I reach an edge it's going to cause
the<00:03:30.780> ball<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.109> start<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.709> back<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.859> other

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
the ball to start going back the other

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.440 
the ball to start going back the other
way<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.820> saw<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.060> actually

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
way and you just saw it actually

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.020 
way and you just saw it actually
happened<00:03:34.130> let<00:03:35.130> me<00:03:35.190> show<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.400> again<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:35.940> I'm

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
happened let me show you again so I'm

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.240 
happened let me show you again so I'm
gonna<00:03:36.120> reset<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> emulator<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.950> what<00:03:38.100> should

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
gonna reset the emulator so what should

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.180 
gonna reset the emulator so what should
happen<00:03:38.430> when<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:38.880> restarts<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.980> ball

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
happen when this restarts is the ball

should start at the top go down at the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
edge and then go back to the top it's

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.569 
edge and then go back to the top it's
not<00:03:45.780> continuous<00:03:46.200> yet<00:03:46.650> because<00:03:46.950> my<00:03:47.100> codes<00:03:47.370> not

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
not continuous yet because my codes not

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.030 
not continuous yet because my codes not
complex<00:03:47.970> enough<00:03:48.260> but<00:03:49.260> at<00:03:49.350> least<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:49.709> kind<00:03:49.950> of

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
complex enough but at least I'm kind of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.979 
complex enough but at least I'm kind of
turned<00:03:50.310> around<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:51.090> know<00:03:51.660> I'm<00:03:51.750> turning

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
turned around you know I'm turning

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.650 
turned around you know I'm turning
around<00:03:52.230> because<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.970> know<00:03:54.030> as<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:54.450> going

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
around because you know as it's going

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.960 
around because you know as it's going
down<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:55.170> moving<00:03:55.500> by<00:03:55.650> 10<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.459> know<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.790> Y's

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
down it's moving by 10 you know the Y's

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.960 
down it's moving by 10 you know the Y's
going<00:03:57.329> down<00:03:57.480> by<00:03:57.660> 10<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.200> hit<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.829> edge<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.760> make

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
going down by 10 I hit the edge and make

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.330 
going down by 10 I hit the edge and make
it<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.750> y-coordinate<00:04:01.410> change<00:04:01.650> by<00:04:01.920> negative

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
it the y-coordinate change by negative

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.240 
it the y-coordinate change by negative
10<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:02.760> go<00:04:02.910> back<00:04:03.090> up<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.650> boom<00:04:04.859> change

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
10 so go back up so boom change

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.460 
10 so go back up so boom change
direction<00:04:05.609> go<00:04:05.940> back<00:04:06.150> up<00:04:06.390> now<00:04:07.109> when<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.350> hits

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
direction go back up now when it hits

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.920 
direction go back up now when it hits
this<00:04:07.650> edge<00:04:08.030> distance<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.420> getting<00:04:09.690> set<00:04:09.870> to

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
this edge distance is getting set to

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.780 
this edge distance is getting set to
negative<00:04:10.170> 10<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.889> it's<00:04:11.040> still<00:04:11.280> trying<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.639> go

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
negative 10 so it's still trying to go

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.720 
negative 10 so it's still trying to go
up<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.959> can't<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:14.220> really<00:04:14.579> what<00:04:14.700> I

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
up and and it can't so really what I

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.409 
up and and it can't so really what I
want<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.030> do<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.709> if<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.950> was<00:04:17.160> 10<00:04:17.549> change<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.299> to

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
want to do is if it was 10 change it to

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.810 
want to do is if it was 10 change it to
negative<00:04:18.600> 10<00:04:19.049> but<00:04:19.950> if<00:04:20.039> it's<00:04:20.220> negative<00:04:20.370> 10

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
negative 10 but if it's negative 10

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.839 
negative 10 but if it's negative 10
change<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.930> back<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.109> 10<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.310> one<00:04:23.490> way<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.640> do

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
change it back to 10 so one way to do

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.719 
change it back to 10 so one way to do
that<00:04:24.030> is<00:04:24.270> with<00:04:25.200> an<00:04:25.349> if-else<00:04:25.710> statement<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.669> I'm

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
that is with an if-else statement so I'm

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.730 
that is with an if-else statement so I'm
going<00:04:26.849> to<00:04:26.880> put<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.210> can

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
going to put this can

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.830 
going to put this can
walk<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.460> here<00:04:28.810> my<00:04:29.810> test<00:04:30.199> is<00:04:30.440> going<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.650> be

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
walk in here my test is going to be

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.230 
walk in here my test is going to be
comparing<00:04:32.840> distance<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:34.550> I'll<00:04:34.669> just<00:04:34.849> compare

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
comparing distance and I'll just compare

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.969 
comparing distance and I'll just compare
it<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.449> 10<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:37.250> equals<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.620> I'm<00:04:39.770> going<00:04:39.889> to

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
it to 10 and it equals and I'm going to

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.730 
it to 10 and it equals and I'm going to
say<00:04:40.099> you<00:04:40.160> know<00:04:40.340> what<00:04:40.520> if<00:04:40.970> my<00:04:41.030> distance<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.810> tan

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.939 

then<00:04:45.740> I'm<00:04:45.889> gonna<00:04:46.039> set<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.729> negative<00:04:47.180> 10

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
then I'm gonna set it to negative 10

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.790 
then I'm gonna set it to negative 10
otherwise<00:04:48.949> to<00:04:49.400> notice<00:04:49.669> copy<00:04:49.940> this<00:04:50.180> guy<00:04:50.800> I'm

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
otherwise to notice copy this guy I'm

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.920 
otherwise to notice copy this guy I'm
gonna<00:04:51.949> set<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.610> back<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:52.849> tan<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.720> it's<00:04:53.840> a

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
gonna set it back to tan so it's a

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.279 
gonna set it back to tan so it's a
little<00:04:54.139> funky<00:04:54.349> but<00:04:54.819> you<00:04:55.819> know<00:04:55.910> if<00:04:56.449> it's<00:04:56.780> 10

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
little funky but you know if it's 10

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.170 
little funky but you know if it's 10
when<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.800> reach<00:04:58.069> an<00:04:58.250> edge<00:04:58.370> change<00:04:58.940> it<00:04:59.090> to

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
when I reach an edge change it to

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.230 
when I reach an edge change it to
negative<00:04:59.360> 10<00:05:00.190> if<00:05:01.190> it's<00:05:01.400> not<00:05:01.580> 10<00:05:01.909> so<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.150> know

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
negative 10 if it's not 10 so I know

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.390 
negative 10 if it's not 10 so I know
it's<00:05:02.449> negative<00:05:03.080> can't<00:05:03.470> change<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:03.889> back<00:05:04.009> to<00:05:04.159> 10

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
it's negative can't change it back to 10

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.629 
it's negative can't change it back to 10
and<00:05:04.970> if<00:05:05.090> you'll<00:05:05.240> notice<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:06.680> apps<00:05:06.830> going<00:05:07.310> back

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
and if you'll notice the apps going back

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.540 
and if you'll notice the apps going back
and<00:05:07.849> forth<00:05:08.150> now<00:05:08.389> because<00:05:09.020> of<00:05:09.710> my<00:05:09.889> complexity

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
and forth now because of my complexity

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.730 
and forth now because of my complexity
here<00:05:10.789> so<00:05:11.630> essentially<00:05:12.080> every<00:05:12.229> time<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.530> reach

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
here so essentially every time I reach

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.730 
here so essentially every time I reach
an<00:05:12.889> edge<00:05:13.069> flip-flop<00:05:14.030> this<00:05:14.990> variable<00:05:15.500> distance

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
an edge flip-flop this variable distance

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.620 
an edge flip-flop this variable distance
to<00:05:16.130> 10<00:05:16.370> or<00:05:16.490> negative<00:05:16.610> 10<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.389> all<00:05:18.289> it's<00:05:18.440> good
