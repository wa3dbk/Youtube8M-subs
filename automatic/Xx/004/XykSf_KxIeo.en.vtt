into smaller sections so you can put

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.940 
into smaller sections so you can put
your<00:01:49.570> hair<00:01:49.810> into<00:01:49.930> small<00:01:50.290> Platts<00:01:50.620> if<00:01:50.830> you

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.040 
your hair into small Platts if you
prefer<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:52.030> if<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.390> feel<00:01:52.660> like<00:01:52.810> you're<00:01:52.930> not

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
prefer and if you feel like you're not

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.140 
prefer and if you feel like you're not
that<00:01:53.170> good<00:01:53.380> at<00:01:53.560> doing<00:01:54.130> twists<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.790> your<00:01:54.940> hair

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
but to be honest it really doesn't

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.290 
but to be honest it really doesn't
matter<00:01:57.100> as<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.460> lot<00:01:57.670> with<00:01:57.790> your<00:01:57.940> hair<00:01:58.120> is<00:01:58.270> in

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
matter as a lot with your hair is in

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.570 
matter as a lot with your hair is in
smaller<00:01:58.840> sections<00:01:59.380> then<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.220> just<00:02:00.430> really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
smaller sections then it just really

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.710 
smaller sections then it just really
helps<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.950> at<00:02:06.220> this<00:02:06.400> point<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.850> realized<00:02:07.540> that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
helps now at this point I realized that

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.169 
helps now at this point I realized that
even<00:02:08.110> though<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.470> put<00:02:08.770> my<00:02:08.920> hair<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.310> twists<00:02:09.820> for

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
even though I put my hair in twists for

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.240 
even though I put my hair in twists for
me<00:02:10.420> personally<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.050> twists<00:02:11.380> were<00:02:11.500> too<00:02:11.770> big<00:02:12.010> I

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
me personally the twists were too big I

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.070 
me personally the twists were too big I
didn't<00:02:12.910> feel<00:02:13.060> like<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.360> will<00:02:13.510> be<00:02:13.600> able<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.840> trim

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
didn't feel like I will be able to trim

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.810 
didn't feel like I will be able to trim
my<00:02:14.110> hair<00:02:14.230> properly<00:02:14.620> with<00:02:15.100> those<00:02:15.400> larger

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
my hair properly with those larger

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.060 
my hair properly with those larger
twists<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.230> decided<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.680> put<00:02:17.890> them

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
twists so I just decided to put them

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.370 
twists so I just decided to put them
into<00:02:18.340> smaller<00:02:18.970> twists<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.960> I'd<00:02:20.110> be<00:02:20.290> able

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
into smaller twists so that I'd be able

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.740 
into smaller twists so that I'd be able
to<00:02:20.560> control<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.730> amount<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.120> hair<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.600> was

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
to control the amount of hair that I was

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.770 
to control the amount of hair that I was
cutting<00:02:22.960> off<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:24.670> remember<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.570> can

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
cutting off just remember that you can

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.020 
cutting off just remember that you can
part<00:02:26.050> your<00:02:26.260> hair<00:02:26.290> into<00:02:26.890> as<00:02:27.100> large<00:02:27.520> or<00:02:27.820> as<00:02:28.000> small

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
part your hair into as large or as small

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.900 
part your hair into as large or as small
sections<00:02:28.750> as<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:28.960> personally<00:02:29.560> prefer<00:02:29.950> but<00:02:30.670> I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
sections as you personally prefer but I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.430 
sections as you personally prefer but I
think<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.420> order<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.840> make<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.350> as

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
think that in order to make it as

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.380 
think that in order to make it as
accurate<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:33.070> possible<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.730> better<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.210> have

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
accurate as possible it's better to have

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.500 
accurate as possible it's better to have
smaller<00:02:34.750> sections<00:02:35.350> than<00:02:35.680> large<00:02:35.950> sections

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.729 

it's<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.720> little<00:02:41.080> bit<00:02:41.170> difficult<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.620> explain

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
it's a little bit difficult to explain

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.170 
it's a little bit difficult to explain
how<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:42.550> did<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:43.480> basically<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.410> slide<00:02:44.950> my

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
how I did this but basically I slide my

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.170 
how I did this but basically I slide my
fingers<00:02:46.180> down<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:47.530> twists<00:02:48.190> individually

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
fingers down the twists individually

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.870 
fingers down the twists individually
until<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.780> feel<00:02:50.200> like<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:50.860> maybe<00:02:51.340> only

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
until I feel like I have maybe only

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.210 
until I feel like I have maybe only
about<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> centimeter<00:02:52.930> left<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.590> my<00:02:53.739> fingers

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
about a centimeter left in my fingers

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.970 
about a centimeter left in my fingers
and<00:02:54.400> then<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.390> cut

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.860 

as<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.190> see<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.700> didn't<00:03:04.120> really<00:03:04.240> call<00:03:04.510> very

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
as you can see I didn't really call very

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.020 
as you can see I didn't really call very
much<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.590> ends<00:03:05.860> up<00:03:05.950> as<00:03:06.100> being<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.580> little

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
much it just ends up as being a little

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.140 
much it just ends up as being a little
curl<00:03:07.300> left<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.870> my<00:03:08.050> hand<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.760> just<00:03:10.000> keep

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
curl left in my hand and I just keep

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.440 
curl left in my hand and I just keep
going

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
going

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.840 
going
so<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.780> did<00:03:14.140> for<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> backward<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.130> usually<00:03:15.670> do

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
so I did for the backward I usually do

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.290 
so I did for the backward I usually do
one<00:03:16.000> undoing<00:03:16.300> any<00:03:16.480> style<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.710> I<00:03:17.950> basically

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
one undoing any style and I basically

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.300 
one undoing any style and I basically
separated<00:03:19.300> out<00:03:19.540> my<00:03:19.810> hair<00:03:20.140> in<00:03:20.410> two<00:03:20.620> rows<00:03:20.920> and

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
separated out my hair in two rows and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.450 
separated out my hair in two rows and
then<00:03:21.840> decided<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.870> twist<00:03:23.260> them<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.740> then<00:03:24.160> pop

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
then decided to twist them and then pop

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:32.400 
then decided to twist them and then pop
them<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.490> decided<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.060> trim<00:03:31.510> each<00:03:31.870> small

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
them so I decided to trim each small

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.620 
them so I decided to trim each small
section<00:03:32.980> straight<00:03:33.400> off<00:03:33.580> twisting<00:03:34.270> just<00:03:34.300> to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
section straight off twisting just to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.690 
section straight off twisting just to
make<00:03:34.780> sure<00:03:35.020> that<00:03:35.290> there<00:03:35.950> was<00:03:36.100> no<00:03:36.250> confusion

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
make sure that there was no confusion

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.370 
make sure that there was no confusion
between<00:03:37.120> bits<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:37.990> been<00:03:38.140> trimmed

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
between bits that have been trimmed

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.650 
between bits that have been trimmed
already<00:03:38.740> and<00:03:39.070> bits<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.460> happen<00:03:39.820> because<00:03:40.420> of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
already and bits that happen because of

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.000 
already and bits that happen because of
course<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.050> can't<00:03:41.290> see<00:03:41.500> at<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.680> back<00:03:41.800> of<00:03:41.830> your

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
course you can't see at the back of your

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.590 
course you can't see at the back of your
head<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.980> now<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.150> part<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.510> the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
head and now this is that part of the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.020 
head and now this is that part of the
video<00:03:46.720> where<00:03:47.200> everything<00:03:47.770> goes<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.250> bit<00:03:48.490> faster

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
video where everything goes a bit faster

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.880 
video where everything goes a bit faster
just<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.900> can<00:03:50.020> see<00:03:50.260> everything<00:03:50.740> I

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
just so that you can see everything I

00:03:50.890 --> 00:04:08.540 
just so that you can see everything I
did<00:03:51.480> buy<00:03:52.480> in<00:03:52.630> less<00:03:52.750> time

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.339 

now<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.670> definitely<00:04:10.209> pays<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.690> be<00:04:10.720> extra

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
now it definitely pays to be extra

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.170 
now it definitely pays to be extra
careful<00:04:11.530> when<00:04:11.980> you're<00:04:12.040> using<00:04:12.220> this<00:04:12.730> method

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
careful when you're using this method

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.030 
careful when you're using this method
because<00:04:14.340> look<00:04:15.340> at<00:04:15.430> my<00:04:15.580> face<00:04:15.819> yep<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.840> nicked<00:04:17.650> off

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
because look at my face yep I nicked off

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.190 
because look at my face yep I nicked off
a<00:04:18.220> little<00:04:18.370> bit<00:04:18.519> too<00:04:18.700> much<00:04:18.850> but<00:04:19.209> it<00:04:19.479> was<00:04:19.750> not<00:04:19.989> the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
a little bit too much but it was not the

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.140 
a little bit too much but it was not the
end<00:04:20.350> of<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.560> world<00:04:20.739> it's<00:04:21.190> fine<00:04:21.430> it'll<00:04:21.940> grow

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
end of the world it's fine it'll grow

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.060 
end of the world it's fine it'll grow
back<00:04:27.389> now<00:04:28.389> for<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.930> middle<00:04:29.169> section<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.710> just

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
back now for the middle section I just

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.219 
back now for the middle section I just
take<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> little<00:04:30.729> bit<00:04:30.880> of<00:04:30.970> extra<00:04:31.330> care<00:04:31.750> because

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
take a little bit of extra care because

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.230 
take a little bit of extra care because
I<00:04:32.530> know<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.979> that<00:04:33.190> hair<00:04:33.490> in<00:04:33.639> that<00:04:33.760> section

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
I know that that hair in that section

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240 
I know that that hair in that section
doesn't<00:04:34.540> really<00:04:34.960> twist<00:04:35.229> up<00:04:35.440> as<00:04:35.710> well

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
doesn't really twist up as well

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.640 
doesn't really twist up as well
and<00:04:36.450> tends<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.540> come<00:04:37.780> apart<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.320> little<00:04:38.440> bit

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
and tends to come apart a little bit

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.530 
and tends to come apart a little bit
more<00:04:38.830> easily<00:04:39.100> so<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.610> just<00:04:39.940> take<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.150> bit<00:04:40.360> more

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
more easily so I just take a bit more

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:58.280 
more easily so I just take a bit more
time<00:04:40.720> with<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:41.080> section

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.910 

and<00:05:00.240> finally<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.480> get<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.870> clearly<00:05:02.260> see<00:05:02.620> how

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
and finally you get to clearly see how

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.560 
and finally you get to clearly see how
much<00:05:03.160> hair<00:05:03.430> has<00:05:03.670> been<00:05:03.910> cut<00:05:04.150> off<00:05:04.180> which<00:05:04.540> is

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
much hair has been cut off which is

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.010 
much hair has been cut off which is
really<00:05:04.750> not<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.170> much<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:06.240> this<00:05:07.240> is<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.840> end

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
really not that much and this is the end

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.250 
really not that much and this is the end
result<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.310> ended<00:05:09.790> up<00:05:09.940> using<00:05:10.420> this<00:05:10.930> as<00:05:11.230> a

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
result so I ended up using this as a

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.580 
result so I ended up using this as a
basis<00:05:11.800> for<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:12.250> chunky<00:05:12.850> twist<00:05:13.150> out<00:05:13.360> as<00:05:13.720> you<00:05:14.410> will
