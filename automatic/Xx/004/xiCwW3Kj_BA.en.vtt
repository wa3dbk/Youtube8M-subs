00:00:00.326 --> 00:00:01.855
- Nice butt pads by the way.

00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:02.414
- Thank you.

00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:03.389
- [Derby Doll] Glad to
see you came prepared.

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.572
- Very Nicci Minaj of me.

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:09.038
(bass music)

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:13.862
(funky music)

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.633
- I don't know anything
about roller derby.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:19.470
I know that there was an
Ellen Page movie about it.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.725
But other than that, have no idea.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:24.975
I would imagine that
I'm gonna do the limbo,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.803
couple's skate, and the Hokey Pokey,

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:29.109
which I just kill every time.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.113
(rock music)

00:00:33.113 --> 00:00:35.318
(growling)

00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.467
(dainty music)

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:40.511
(rock music)

00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:43.989
- [Nicole] Whoa, oh, oh, whoa.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.839
(derby dolls laughing)

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.916
- Okay, okay, alright, I'm Nicole.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:50.976
- Hi, Suzy Snakeyes.

00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:51.586
- Cute.

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:52.525
- Shady Hawkins.

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:53.506
- Ooh.

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:54.734
- Purrfect.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.159
- Woohoohoo.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.095
- [Nicole] So this is
like a nickname thing.

00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:02.888
I should be like Slacey
Dash from Clueless.

00:01:02.888 --> 00:01:04.290
(grumbles)

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:06.296
- You gotta earn your
nickname around here.

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:08.310
- It's like getting jumped into a gang.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.561
- Little bit, you'll see.

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:11.938
- Roller skating has always
been a challenge for me,

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.316
but I can definitely just
like, groove my shoulders,

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:16.485
(funky music)

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:17.181
and it makes me look like
(Suzy laughs)

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:19.112
I'm moving more than I am.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.225
Switch it to one finger.

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:23.610
- [Purrfect] So have you
done any sports, anything?

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.469
- I was a dancer and a figure skater.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.871
- [Suzy] Played any contact sports or?

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:31.250
- No, I'm not very aggressive,
physically, ya know?

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.369
- That's gonna be a problem.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.544
- I'm just not like a ...

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:35.775
(Suzy laughs)
- [Nicole] Ya know?

00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:36.844
(Purrfect laughs)
- [Nicole] Now what's the point

00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:38.309
of this game, are we fighting?

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:39.639
- For each opposing player you

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.505
successfully lap, you get one point.

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:43.887
- [Suzy] The other team
doesn't want you to do that.

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:45.472
So they're going to try and stop you by

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.867
physically knocking you over.

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.821
- Oh, moving them out of your space.
- [Shady] Yeah.

00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:49.602
- Ready to try this out?

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:50.304
- Yeah.

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:50.969
- [Suzy] Alright.
- [Purrfect] Yeah!

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:51.942
- Let's get goin'.

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:54.631
(rock music)

00:01:54.692 --> 00:01:56.210
- [Shady] So, I'm gonna
teach you how to hit.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.310
You're gonna need a mouth guard.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.844
- [Shady] It protects your teeth but also

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.862
protects you from getting a concussion.

00:02:00.862 --> 00:02:02.948
- Is that happening to me?

00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:05.242
- We'll see what happens.

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:06.270
- Oh.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.882
- [Nicole] Plastic.

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:07.943
- Yep.

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:08.758
- Hmm.

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:10.776
(rock music)
- So, you get your foot in front,

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:12.289
and then you use your butt to hit them.

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:13.974
Like you're gonna slam the
car door shut with your butt.

00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:15.881
Like you have all the groceries,

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:17.356
and then you do one of those.

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:18.579
- Mmhmm.

00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:21.167
- Good.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:22.771
- [Nicole] You haven't
fallen at all though.

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:24.551
So I haven't really accomplished anything.

00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:27.514
- [Shady] You really hafta
channel that inner angry beast.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.999
- I am a 6 foot tall beast.

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.319
- Really get into it, come on.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.420
(Nicole growls)
(Shady laughs)

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.072
- There you go.

00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:36.505
- Oh, drool, coming down my fingers.

00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:39.268
(rock music)

00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:41.468
- So this is the fun stuff to derby.

00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:43.989
- [Purrfect] You are gonna
take a whip off of my assist.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.741
- Am I supposed to like, whip it, whip it?

00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:48.721
- After your release you could whip it.

00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.928
You can have fun, you can celebrate,

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:51.408
'cause you just got those points.

00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:53.248
- So it's release and then whip.

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:54.082
- Yeah.

00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:55.417
- Usually the other way around.

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:57.375
(funky music) - It is. Alright
so we're skating. I'm goin'.

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.738
- Okay a nice, a gentle, release.

00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:01.631
- Okay. And Imma just pull you.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.799
- Whoo.

00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:07.684
- Whoo, giddy on up cowgirl.

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:10.307
- Now, what kind of girls do roller derby?

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:12.976
- It's usually the black
sheeps of families.

00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:13.514
- The rebel.

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:14.992
- The underdogs, yeah.

00:03:14.992 --> 00:03:17.147
- I'm into it. Do you guys have groupies?

00:03:17.147 --> 00:03:19.065
- We do, there's a lot of fans.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:20.024
- Do you bone them?

00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:21.819
- Not yet (laughs).

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.515
- Are people more into the
bouts or the after parts?

00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:25.864
- Definitely into the bouts.

00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:28.283
- But then, what about
the after-after party?

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.199
- Oh, honey, you don't
wanna know about that.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.775
(Purrfect laughs)
- Shh.

00:03:31.775 --> 00:03:34.581
(funky music)

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.462
- Whoo, okay.

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:38.575
- [Suzy] Yay!

00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:39.710
- Alright.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.410
- Alright so you learned the skills.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.165
Are you ready to put it
all together in a jam?

00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:44.136
- Hell yeah.

00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:47.718
- Alright, so, it's
gonna be us against them.

00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:51.286
- Alright Nicole, every time
you lap, you get a point.

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:53.475
So, I want you to skate
as fast as you can,

00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:55.477
as many times around, I got you.

00:03:55.477 --> 00:03:56.853
- (grunts) And I got you.

00:03:56.853 --> 00:03:58.229
- Alright.

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.565
(funky music)

00:04:01.803 --> 00:04:04.010
- [Shady] Come on Suzy, there ya go.

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:07.349
(grunting)

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:10.418
- [Purrfect] Whip. Grab. You go.

00:04:10.418 --> 00:04:11.827
(grunts)

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.780
(squeals)

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.372
(whimpering)

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:22.629
- How are we doing?

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.340
- Um (groans).

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.078
- I have an idea.

00:04:27.078 --> 00:04:30.401
(rock music)
- [Nicole] Yes! Boom! Yes!

00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:31.677
- [Purrfect] There ya go!

00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:36.677
- Yes, yes, yes, yes! Whoo!

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:42.117
- [Nicole] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:43.186
How'd I do?

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:44.185
- Pretty good.
- Not bad.

00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:45.709
- High five worthy.
(all laugh)

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:46.256
- Yeah.

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:47.282
- Had heart, the heart was there.

00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:49.572
- Alright, do I get my nickname?

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:51.023
- No Skates Nicci?

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:55.060
- How about Skateless in Seattle?

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.871
- It, it applies.

00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:57.948
- Yes!
(derby dolls laugh)

00:04:57.948 --> 00:05:00.697
- Roller derby really
just, it's not my vibe.

00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:03.680
If this was on ice
skates, I would kill it.
