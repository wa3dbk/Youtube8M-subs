00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.940
 shown a new graphics interface in the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.890
 google chrome webbrowser to show 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.939
 which content will be included in the future 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.680
 can create 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.290
 He showed that by the possibility 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.619
 with lego bricks any objects on 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.329
 to create the pc 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.590
 handy minecraft for poor or for 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.050
 all those Germans everything 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.950
 have built 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.989
 link of course in the description 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.489
 once the possibility either yourself 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.079
 to become an expert skipping 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.780
 We come directly to all of us 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.769
 Buildings explore what others do 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.789
 have built or the third option 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.320
 to build something myself 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.129
 just start now 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.129
 just click on it here 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.540
 takes moment we get ours 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.520
 platform here are our stones can 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.900
 choose to come dropping again 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.340
 and there we can do something incredible 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.350
 creative we build our kind of 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.769
 instructions so what an arrow button 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.769
 to turn 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.490
 and with the spacebar and the dragged 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:20.259
 I can mouse everything here too 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.539
 Once again, everything is terribly creative 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.850
 or just in case of cases 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.240
 you want to be creative just like that 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.979
 we build two more steps back 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.399
 yes, we do not even have a look 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.079
 otherwise others have built 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.869
 that's the reason we get maps 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.110
 So google maps and we can just 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.939
 zoom in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.219
 if I someone in cologne exactly the 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.709
 Cologne Cathedral he is in fact already 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.239
 you can try to copy 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.729
 click on it and get that 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:52.989
 look at everything or just 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.069
 I'll go back for a moment 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:57.759
 we see that here also the 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:01.989
 a little bit out of popular buildings 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:08.310
 At that time, among other things, the sum was the 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.310
 eiffel tower klinkhammer a double click 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.840
 we can build ourselves up 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.940
 to look at this here 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.630
 yes I did not know that two 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.630
 stood side by side 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.150
 and who must be a new 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.210
 otherwise it looks like it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.440
 would have made two years old 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.830
 well, but that can be even better 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.830
 become 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:49.260
 So let's hope you will be creative or 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.260
 look at others ok too
