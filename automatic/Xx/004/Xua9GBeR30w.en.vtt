00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.730 

Scalise<00:01:12.320> mom's<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> actually

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
Scalise mom's here and if this actually

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
Scalise mom's here and if this actually
works<00:01:19.980> really<00:01:20.250> well<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.640> single<00:01:21.180> single

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
works really well on single single

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.470 
works really well on single single
player<00:01:22.080> simply<00:01:22.470> because<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:24.090> use<00:01:24.240> you

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
player simply because you can use you

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:47.660 
player simply because you can use you
could<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> timing<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.200> right

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.030 

okay<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.360> when<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> attack<00:01:49.500> him<00:01:49.680> he'll<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
okay so when you attack him he'll have a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
okay so when you attack him he'll have a
health<00:01:50.310> bar

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:04.380 

so<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.869> want<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.229> get<00:01:56.380> him<00:01:56.469> down<00:01:56.680> to<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:03.390> ten

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
so I want to get him down to about ten

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.870 
so I want to get him down to about ten
percent<00:02:04.570> health<00:02:05.079> or<00:02:06.039> enough<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.640> where<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:06.820> can

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
percent health or enough to where I can

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.580 
percent health or enough to where I can
figure<00:02:07.179> out<00:02:07.299> like<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.750> will<00:02:07.840> take<00:02:07.960> one<00:02:08.379> swing

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
figure out like it will take one swing

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.550 
figure out like it will take one swing
to<00:02:08.860> kill<00:02:09.039> them<00:02:09.929> these<00:02:10.929> guys<00:02:11.110> aren't<00:02:11.380> in<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
to kill them these guys aren't in the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.030 
to kill them these guys aren't in the
way<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.930> got<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.080> time<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.560> got<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.769> see<00:02:17.890> how

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
way just got a time you got to see how

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.600 
way just got a time you got to see how
much<00:02:18.220> damage<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.760> do<00:02:18.880> for<00:02:19.120> swing<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.599> guess

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
much damage you do for swing I guess

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.750 
much damage you do for swing I guess
before<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.880> do<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.060> last<00:02:22.269> 18<00:02:23.080> game<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:24.610> make

before you do the last 18 game you make

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.089 
before you do the last 18 game you make
sure<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.940> go<00:02:25.120> kill<00:02:25.390> them<00:02:25.510> if<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.959> all<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
sure you go kill them if you can all the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
recommend doing this exploit because you

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.789 
recommend doing this exploit because you
