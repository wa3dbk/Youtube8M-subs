00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.269 

this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.199> four<00:00:01.410> of<00:00:01.530> clubs<00:00:02.000> this<00:00:04.100> is<00:00:05.100> the

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
this is the four of clubs this is the

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.099 
this is the four of clubs this is the
King<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.549> Hearts<00:00:05.759> let's<00:00:06.450> learn<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.839> switch

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
King of Hearts let's learn that switch

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.259 
King of Hearts let's learn that switch
right<00:00:07.350> now<00:00:07.519> this<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> really<00:00:09.090> practical

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
right now this is a really practical

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.480 
right now this is a really practical
switch<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:10.710> very<00:00:10.920> hard<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.219> catch

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
switch and it's very hard to catch

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.370 
switch and it's very hard to catch
obviously<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.480> looks<00:00:12.599> better<00:00:12.809> from<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> front

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
obviously it looks better from the front

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.890 
obviously it looks better from the front
but<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.490> really<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> switch<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.780> can

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
but I really like the switch and it can

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.840 
but I really like the switch and it can
be<00:00:15.990> used<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.350> variety<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.859> routines<00:00:17.369> so

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
be used in a variety of routines so

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.720 
be used in a variety of routines so
let's<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.390> right<00:00:18.690> into<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:20.520> card

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
let's just get right into it so the card

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.820 
let's just get right into it so the card
you're<00:00:20.880> gonna<00:00:20.939> switch<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.350> top<00:00:22.529> card

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you're gonna switch is just the top card

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.620 
you're gonna switch is just the top card
or<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> card<00:00:23.490> you're<00:00:23.609> holding<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> card

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
or a card you're holding and the card

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.750 
or a card you're holding and the card
you're<00:00:24.720> gonna<00:00:24.810> switch<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.199> into<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.580> course

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you're gonna switch it into is of course

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.060 
you're gonna switch it into is of course
the<00:00:26.910> next<00:00:27.150> card<00:00:27.359> down<00:00:27.590> what<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> want<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.949> do

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the next card down what you want to do

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429 
the next card down what you want to do
is<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> break<00:00:30.300> under<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.750> next<00:00:30.960> card<00:00:31.260> down

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
is get a break under the next card down

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.690 
is get a break under the next card down
like<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.210> a<00:00:33.210> pretty<00:00:33.660> big<00:00:33.870> big<00:00:34.200> break<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.860> way<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
like so a pretty big big break a way to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
like so a pretty big big break a way to
tell<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.120> big<00:00:36.300> enough<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.960> left

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
tell if it's big enough is if you left

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
tell if it's big enough is if you left
leave<00:00:37.590> off<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:37.950> your<00:00:38.100> fingers<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.300> kind

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
leave off all your fingers here you kind

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
leave off all your fingers here you kind
of<00:00:39.540> shake<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> deck<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.860> card

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
of shake the deck if the the card

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
of shake the deck if the the card
bounces<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> little<00:00:42.090> bit<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.600> you'll<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
bounces a little bit then you'll have a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.410 
bounces a little bit then you'll have a
big<00:00:43.200> enough<00:00:43.410> break<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> you're<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> show

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
big enough break so you're going to show

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.020 
big enough break so you're going to show
the<00:00:45.570> card<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:47.789> you're<00:00:47.940> gonna

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the card right here and you're gonna

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.569 
the card right here and you're gonna
flip<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.420> over<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.690> place<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.430> it's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
flip it over and place it so it's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.350 
flip it over and place it so it's
balancing<00:00:51.149> sort<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:52.469> your<00:00:52.620> thumb<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
balancing sort of with your thumb to the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.029 
balancing sort of with your thumb to the
deck<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.199> play<00:00:55.379> around<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.800> how

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
deck and you can play around with how

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.000 
deck and you can play around with how
much<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.610> how<00:00:56.850> little<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.300> want<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:58.010> balance

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
much or how little you want to balance

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.180 
much or how little you want to balance
it<00:00:59.309> but<00:01:00.079> just<00:01:01.079> balance<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:01.829> angle<00:01:01.980> like

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it but just balance it at an angle like

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.070 
it but just balance it at an angle like
so<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.530> what<00:01:04.530> you're<00:01:04.619> gonna<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.900> drop<00:01:06.900> your

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so and what you're gonna do is drop your

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.490 
so and what you're gonna do is drop your
hand<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.400> you're<00:01:08.760> gonna<00:01:08.880> push<00:01:09.420> down

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
hand like so and you're gonna push down

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
hand like so and you're gonna push down
this<00:01:10.500> card<00:01:10.890> while<00:01:11.280> letting<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.299> next

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this card while letting go of the next

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.030 
this card while letting go of the next
card<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.790> that's<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> switch<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:16.110> again<00:01:16.950> I'll

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
card and that's the switch so again I'll

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.530 
card and that's the switch so again I'll
show<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.280> I'll<00:01:17.520> switch<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> two<00:01:18.299> diamonds

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
show you I'll switch the two diamonds

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.280 
show you I'll switch the two diamonds
into<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> six<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.200> clubs<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> flush

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
into the six of clubs you have it flush

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
into the six of clubs you have it flush
you<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:23.580> causes<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> card<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you go down which causes the card to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.520 
you go down which causes the card to
fall<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.909> push<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> card<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.229> so

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
fall out and you push the card down so

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.450 
fall out and you push the card down so
it's<00:01:28.829> flush<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.659> pretty<00:01:30.869> simple

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
it's flush it's really pretty simple

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's flush it's really pretty simple
a<00:01:32.460> good<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> practice<00:01:33.540> though<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
a good way to practice though is you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.520 
a good way to practice though is you
just<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.869> you're<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:36.960> pretending<00:01:37.320> like

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
just have you're just pretending like

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.980 
just have you're just pretending like
you're<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> card<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
you're you have the card here but you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.950 
you're you have the card here but you
actually<00:01:40.079> don't<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.189> that

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
actually don't and you just go like that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.100 
actually don't and you just go like that
so<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.970> need<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> big<00:01:45.329> enough<00:01:45.479> break<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
so you need a big enough break so that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
so you need a big enough break so that
the<00:01:46.200> air<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.409> actually<00:01:46.740> push<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> card<00:01:47.640> up

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the air can actually push the card up

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
the air can actually push the card up
and<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.630> helps<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> fall<00:01:49.380> down<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and that helps it fall down to the to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.780 
and that helps it fall down to the to
the<00:01:50.490> table<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:52.430> it<00:01:53.430> looks<00:01:53.579> pretty<00:01:53.909> good<00:01:55.790> one

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the table and it looks pretty good one
