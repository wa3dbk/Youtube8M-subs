00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.990

 that meet all your goals for this 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.879
 first video of 2015 I want to bring you 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.519
 a tutorial with one of my first 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.989
 videos of nail tutorials for 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.790
 start 2015 and I hope you like it for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.420
 this is going to need the following 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.479
 Elements these four colors of smart 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.449
 is in this case black white this is a 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:01.140
 kind of a turquoise turquoise and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.700
 one of mireia that is the same color 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.689
 of this green and also this brush 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.970
 delgadito that we are going to need 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.070
 practically to do the details 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.829
 what am I going to show you then we are going to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.280
 start to start then let's 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:20.939
 paint of the five nails we are going to paint 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.579
 these four of white color party 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.850
 black then let's start at the nail 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.570
 manikin 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.210
 let's take the lover of glances and 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.310
 with the thin brush 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.050
 let's do a blur as with 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 stripes 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.980
 from the beginning the nail up outside and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.980
 we will concentrate more on this side 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 ah 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.100
 and is that they remain as more beneficial in 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.600
 beginning on the nail towards the end and so 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.600
 we are going to repeat it in this nail 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.180
 and so 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.659
 for the next nail then 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.129
 remember that the base is black 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.599
 or the color that you prefer 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.640
 contrast it with the colors that 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.069
 we are playing here we are going to take 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.959
 again our thin brush and 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.030
 let's take white glaze and let's 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.190
 make a few strips of life 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.460
 shapes 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.420
 the idea is to draw a diagonal line of 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.420
 tip to tip 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.540
 what we are going to do next is to do 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.420
 some horizontal lines 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.859
 on this side of the nail of this half of 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.859
 the nail in the following way 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.910
 and it stays that way 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.330
 and for our last union that is 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.640
 on the white base let's take the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.170
 turquoise and with the brochita 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.750
 skinny which is the main element 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.510
 for this tutorial we are going to take the 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.620
 turquoise color and let's do other 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.530
 lowers as follows 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.239
 let's make two horizontal lines in 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.239
 the tip of the unne 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.380
 I really am not very polished for this 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.380
 but I try 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.970
 they left me as thicker here and 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.370
 more skinny than out then it's because of 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.410
 actually pulse but it does not look bad 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.270
 do not go down like that 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.460
 and for the other two lines we're going to 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.930
 make two vertical lines crossing the 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.699
 that we just did but with black 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.699
 and also on a little corner 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.379
 A) Yes 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.199
 so then our designs of 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:36.620
 nails in turquoise white colors and 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.689
 black turquoise mint green 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.879
 still in season 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.710
 bright never go out of style and what 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.810
 I wanted to contrast with the black that 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.509
 I say in form is very elegant are with 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.030
 line designs that are also 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.920
 thus marking a trend in this 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.550
 2015 beginning of 2015 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.460
 results I hope you liked it and what 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.890
 practice if they do they can show 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.010
 how they fit and we'll see each other 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.830
 opportunity subscribe, share what 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.020
 of like and see you soon in 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.020
