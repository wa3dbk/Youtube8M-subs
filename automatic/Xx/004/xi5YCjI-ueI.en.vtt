and you can navigate your way through
the<00:00:50.449> first<00:00:50.750> thing<00:00:50.960> on<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.170> list<00:00:51.199> is<00:00:51.530> modes<00:00:51.859> net

music is in reference to the music that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.049 
music is in reference to the music that
you'd<00:00:54.379> have<00:00:54.500> stored<00:00:54.859> on<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.100> on<00:00:55.250> an<00:00:55.460> hard<00:00:55.820> drive

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
you'd have stored on it on an hard drive

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.459 
you'd have stored on it on an hard drive
and<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:56.660> thing<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.870> connected<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:57.320> the

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
and so this thing is connected to the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
hard drive rack and how big is the hard

hard drive rack and how big is the hard
drive<00:00:58.969> 500<00:00:59.570> gigabytes<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:00.320> can<00:01:00.440> store

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
drive 500 gigabytes so you can store

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.049 
drive 500 gigabytes so you can store
thousands<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.160> lots<00:01:01.429> of<00:01:01.519> music<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:01.910> it's

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
ways to navigate through this is titles

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.910 
ways to navigate through this is titles
because<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.960> brings<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.290> cover<00:01:48.500> our<00:01:48.680> back

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
because it brings to cover our back

70 tracks that have been picked off of
that<00:01:59.660> one

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
that one

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
song how do you mean it's just going in

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.210 
song how do you mean it's just going in
and<00:02:03.110> figuring<00:02:03.350> out<00:02:03.440> what<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.620> like<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:04.100> know

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
and figuring out what you like you know

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.580 
and figuring out what you like you know
in<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.430> way<00:02:04.730> yes<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.660> taking<00:02:06.050> music<00:02:06.200> from

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
in a way yes it is taking music from

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.260 
in a way yes it is taking music from
your<00:02:06.800> own<00:02:06.920> personal<00:02:07.400> library<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.060> music

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
your own personal library so it is music

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.389 
your own personal library so it is music
that<00:02:08.509> you've<00:02:08.660> put<00:02:08.899> on<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.349> it's<00:02:09.979> using<00:02:10.340> an

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
that you've put on to this it's using an

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.520 
that you've put on to this it's using an
algorithm<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.180> refer<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.450> as<00:02:11.660> mods<00:02:11.959> this

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
algorithm that you refer to as mods this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.190 
algorithm that you refer to as mods this
algorithm<00:02:13.310> takes<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.760> sample<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.330> about<00:02:14.660> two

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
algorithm takes a sample of about two

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.290 
algorithm takes a sample of about two
minutes<00:02:15.379> of<00:02:15.620> each<00:02:15.769> song<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.340> we'll<00:02:17.000> take<00:02:17.239> a

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
minutes of each song and we'll take a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.000 
minutes of each song and we'll take a
look<00:02:17.540> at<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> dynamic<00:02:18.080> range<00:02:18.260> beats<00:02:18.800> per

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
look at the dynamic range beats per

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.100 
look at the dynamic range beats per
minute<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.459> instrumentation<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:20.960> does<00:02:21.080> a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
minute and instrumentation so it does a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.560 
minute and instrumentation so it does a
very<00:02:21.230> close<00:02:21.980> comparison<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.820> any<00:02:23.030> songs<00:02:23.360> that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
very close comparison of any songs that

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.390 
very close comparison of any songs that
are<00:02:23.780> similar<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.560> this

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
are similar to this

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.809 
are similar to this
and<00:02:25.730> now<00:02:26.330> you'll<00:02:26.569> see<00:02:26.659> in<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.530> queue<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.190> list

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
and now you'll see in this queue a list

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.670 
and now you'll see in this queue a list
of<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> songs<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:29.780> has<00:02:29.930> now<00:02:30.110> selected

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
of the songs that it has now selected

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.589 
of the songs that it has now selected
for<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.280> not<00:02:31.430> by<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:31.940> same<00:02:32.180> artists<00:02:32.480> it

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
for you so not by the same artists it

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.240 
for you so not by the same artists it
could<00:02:32.750> be<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.230> be<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:33.799> yeah<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.069> is

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
could be but can be but yeah this is

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.100 
could be but can be but yeah this is
it's<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.580> little<00:02:34.730> bit<00:02:34.819> more<00:02:35.000> random<00:02:35.450> than<00:02:35.720> just

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
it's a little bit more random than just

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.259 
it's a little bit more random than just
picking<00:02:36.319> songs<00:02:36.620> by<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.159> artist<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.670> it's

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
picking songs by that artist and it's

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.930 
picking songs by that artist and it's
it's<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.930> little<00:02:39.140> bit<00:02:39.260> more<00:02:39.409> random<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
it's a little bit more random in the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.780 
it's a little bit more random in the
sense<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.480> what<00:02:41.900> genre<00:02:42.530> even<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.579> going

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
sense of what genre even that it's going

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.729 
sense of what genre even that it's going
to<00:02:43.909> fit<00:02:44.090> within<00:02:44.269> as<00:02:44.870> long<00:02:45.079> as<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.440> similar

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
to fit within as long as it's a similar

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.020 
to fit within as long as it's a similar
track<00:02:45.980> see<00:02:46.250> it's<00:02:46.370> got<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.579> same<00:02:46.760> beat<00:02:46.940> and
