was such a nice request that I couldn't

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:29.960 
was such a nice request that I couldn't
resist

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
resist

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.059 
resist

took<00:02:32.160> me<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.340> long<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.819> review<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.290> I've

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
took me so long to review this and I've

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
took me so long to review this and I've
picked<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.950> second<00:02:35.370> trailer<00:02:35.700> because<00:02:35.849> I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
picked the second trailer because I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.190 
picked the second trailer because I
thought<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.239> first<00:02:36.390> trailer<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.900> came<00:02:37.049> out

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
thought the first trailer that came out

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.900 
thought the first trailer that came out
for<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.379> movie<00:02:37.709> didn't<00:02:38.340> look<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.670> good<00:02:38.879> I

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
for this movie didn't look so good I

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.089 
for this movie didn't look so good I
thought<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.750> made<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.959> look<00:02:40.049> like<00:02:40.319> World

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
thought that it made it look like World

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.860 
thought that it made it look like World
War<00:02:41.190> 2<00:02:41.519> Ocean's<00:02:41.879> eleven<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.569> think<00:02:42.780> that

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
War 2 Ocean's eleven and I think that

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.809 
War 2 Ocean's eleven and I think that
was<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.110> intention<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.890> trailer<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.790> I

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
was the intention of the trailer but I

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.160 
was the intention of the trailer but I
think<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.209> first<00:02:45.360> trailer<00:02:45.629> must<00:02:45.810> not<00:02:46.019> have

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
think that first trailer must not have

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.960 
think that first trailer must not have
gelled<00:02:46.440> because<00:02:46.799> they<00:02:46.980> changed<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.430> tone<00:02:47.610> so

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
gelled because they changed the tone so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.490 
gelled because they changed the tone so
much<00:02:48.299> with<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> second<00:02:49.049> trailer<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.379> also

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
much with the second trailer and also

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.259 
much with the second trailer and also
you<00:02:49.799> might<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.069> noticed<00:02:50.430> they<00:02:50.819> pushed<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
you might have noticed they pushed the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.729 
you might have noticed they pushed the
film<00:02:51.450> back<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.900> was<00:02:51.989> supposed<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.379> open<00:02:52.650> in

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
film back it was supposed to open in

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.490 
film back it was supposed to open in
December<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.940> they<00:02:54.090> decided<00:02:54.450> privately<00:02:55.379> that

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
December but they decided privately that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.530 
December but they decided privately that
it<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:55.709> just<00:02:55.950> too<00:02:56.160> crowded<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.700> movie<00:02:57.359> season

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
it was just too crowded a movie season

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.900 
it was just too crowded a movie season
which<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.019> turned<00:02:58.200> out<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.590> be<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.069> that<00:02:59.760> also

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
which it turned out to be and that also

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.369 
which it turned out to be and that also
I<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.359> they<00:03:00.540> felt<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.170> shame

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
I think that they felt that it's a shame

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.410 
I think that they felt that it's a shame
because<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.739> feel<00:03:01.950> Anna<00:03:02.609> less<00:03:02.819> competitive

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
because I feel Anna less competitive

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.420 
because I feel Anna less competitive
award<00:03:03.810> season<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.680> film<00:03:05.010> would<00:03:05.400> be

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
award season this film would be

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.960 
award season this film would be
competitive<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.390> think<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.319> has<00:03:07.500> a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
competitive but I think that it has a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.460 
competitive but I think that it has a
frivolous<00:03:08.970> 'no<00:03:09.180> stew<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.599> you<00:03:09.750> know<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> comedic

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
frivolous 'no stew it you know a comedic

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.800 
frivolous 'no stew it you know a comedic
aspect<00:03:10.739> which<00:03:11.579> i<00:03:11.700> think<00:03:11.760> makes<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.599> able

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
aspect which i think makes it not able

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.050 
aspect which i think makes it not able
to<00:03:12.930> compete<00:03:13.349> with<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.560> more<00:03:13.709> serious<00:03:14.060> oscar

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
to compete with the more serious oscar

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.430 
to compete with the more serious oscar
fair<00:03:15.269> that's<00:03:15.540> come<00:03:15.720> out<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:16.019> year<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.410> i

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
fair that's come out this year and i

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.720 
fair that's come out this year and i
think<00:03:16.470> that's<00:03:16.739> why<00:03:16.889> it's<00:03:17.040> been<00:03:17.130> relegated<00:03:17.400> to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
think that's why it's been relegated to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.849 
think that's why it's been relegated to
this<00:03:17.849> winter<00:03:18.150> release<00:03:18.480> date<00:03:18.750> instead<00:03:19.139> but<00:03:19.739> it

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
this winter release date instead but it

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.259 
this winter release date instead but it
still<00:03:20.040> looks<00:03:20.220> like<00:03:20.459> fun<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.970> think<00:03:21.030> that

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
still looks like fun and I think that

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.509 
still looks like fun and I think that
this<00:03:21.840> trailer<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.560> new<00:03:22.709> trailer<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.160> second

this trailer this new trailer the second

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.409 
this trailer this new trailer the second
trailer<00:03:23.669> strikes<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.239> right<00:03:24.359> balance

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
trailer strikes the right balance

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.409 
trailer strikes the right balance
between<00:03:24.840> Oh<00:03:25.290> fun<00:03:26.040> jokes<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.730> guys<00:03:26.910> and

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.729 
to concentration camps so I think it's a
story<00:03:54.510> it's<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.690> very<00:03:54.900> fascinating<00:03:55.169> part<00:03:55.709> of

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
story it's a very fascinating part of

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.309 
story it's a very fascinating part of
history<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.609> always<00:03:56.879> love<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.239> when<00:03:57.290> well<00:03:58.290> I

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
history and I always love it when well I

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.420 
history and I always love it when well I
mean<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:58.650> hard<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.859> just<00:03:59.099> say<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.250> love

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
mean it's hard to just say you love

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.220 
mean it's hard to just say you love
something<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.819> represents<00:04:00.810> something<00:04:01.079> so

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
something that represents something so

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.349 
something that represents something so
tragic<00:04:01.500> but<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:01.859> find<00:04:02.129> it<00:04:02.190> fascinating<00:04:02.489> when

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
tragic but I find it fascinating when

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.819 
tragic but I find it fascinating when
you<00:04:03.480> can<00:04:03.660> take<00:04:03.900> something<00:04:04.260> that's<00:04:04.349> so<00:04:04.590> well

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
you can take something that's so well

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.369 
you can take something that's so well
known<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.400> find<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.150> facet<00:04:06.629> of<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.230> is

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
known and find a facet of it that is

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.050 
known and find a facet of it that is
unique<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:07.949> makes<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.340> seem<00:04:08.489> fresh<00:04:08.790> because

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
unique and makes it seem fresh because

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.930 
unique and makes it seem fresh because
it's<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:09.720> new<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.010> undiscovered<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.669> I<00:04:11.730> think

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
it's so new and undiscovered and I think

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.069 
it's so new and undiscovered and I think
that's<00:04:12.090> kind<00:04:12.329> of<00:04:12.359> what<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.629> is<00:04:12.780> we've<00:04:12.930> all

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
that's kind of what this is we've all

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.110 
that's kind of what this is we've all
seen<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.290> lot<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.650> World<00:04:13.799> War<00:04:13.919> two<00:04:14.190> movies<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.819> a

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
seen a lot of World War two movies and a

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.759 
seen a lot of World War two movies and a
lot<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.299> really<00:04:15.599> good<00:04:15.780> World<00:04:16.019> War<00:04:16.229> two<00:04:16.410> movies

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
lot of really good World War two movies

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.620 
lot of really good World War two movies
so<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:17.400> it's<00:04:17.609> great<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.880> try<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.390> like

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
so I think it's great to try and like

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.750 
so I think it's great to try and like
look<00:04:19.109> at<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.320> through<00:04:19.469> this<00:04:19.650> light<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.219> these

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
look at it through this light and these

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.790 
look at it through this light and these
men<00:04:21.030> who<00:04:21.180> went<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.510> war<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.989> put<00:04:22.380> themselves

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
men who went to war and put themselves

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.710 
men who went to war and put themselves

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
in danger for a very noble cause and it

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.510 
in danger for a very noble cause and it
was<00:04:27.080> an<00:04:27.260> area<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.650> was<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.070> know<00:04:28.160> they<00:04:28.460> were

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
the battlefield but they understood the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.520 
the battlefield but they understood the
importance<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.630> what<00:04:32.690> was<00:04:32.900> on<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.080> line<00:04:33.230> here

see<00:05:18.830> this<00:05:18.980> I<00:05:19.100> think<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.310> looks<00:05:19.460> great<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.790> I

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
see this I think it looks great and I

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.040 
see this I think it looks great and I
think<00:05:19.910> unfortunately<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:20.690> was<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.840> right

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
think unfortunately it was the right

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.630 
think unfortunately it was the right
decision<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.470> push<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:21.890> but<00:05:22.040> this<00:05:22.160> is<00:05:22.340> a<00:05:22.370> very

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
decision to push it but this is a very

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.730 
decision to push it but this is a very
good<00:05:22.910> trailer<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.480> I<00:05:23.750> think<00:05:24.050> that<00:05:24.140> it<00:05:24.260> once

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
good trailer and I think that it once

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.260 
good trailer and I think that it once
again<00:05:25.040> underlines<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.610> importance<00:05:26.030> if<00:05:26.180> you

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
again underlines the importance if you

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.550 
again underlines the importance if you
have<00:05:26.419> to<00:05:26.540> have<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.750> right<00:05:26.900> trailer<00:05:27.230> out<00:05:27.440> of

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
have to have the right trailer out of

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.380 
have to have the right trailer out of
the<00:05:27.710> gate<00:05:27.890> because<00:05:28.400> it's<00:05:28.730> just<00:05:28.940> hard<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.240> get

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
the gate because it's just hard to get

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.820 
the gate because it's just hard to get
over<00:05:29.540> that<00:05:29.750> first<00:05:30.020> impression<00:05:30.590> so<00:05:30.710> I'm

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
over that first impression so I'm

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.230 
over that first impression so I'm
curious<00:05:31.010> for<00:05:31.370> those<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.669> you<00:05:31.760> who<00:05:31.910> saw<00:05:32.060> that

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
curious for those of you who saw that

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.090 
curious for those of you who saw that
other<00:05:32.360> trailer<00:05:32.780> first<00:05:33.110> which<00:05:33.650> was<00:05:33.830> more<00:05:34.010> of

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
other trailer first which was more of

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.350 
other trailer first which was more of
the<00:05:34.190> Ocean's<00:05:34.490> eleven<00:05:34.910> vibe

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
the Ocean's eleven vibe

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.760 
the Ocean's eleven vibe
have<00:05:35.630> you<00:05:35.750> gotten<00:05:35.930> over<00:05:36.140> it<00:05:36.320> are<00:05:36.470> you<00:05:36.530> excited

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
have you gotten over it are you excited

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.170 
have you gotten over it are you excited
about<00:05:36.980> this<00:05:37.220> movie<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.669> do<00:05:37.730> you<00:05:37.790> think<00:05:37.910> it<00:05:38.060> was

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
about this movie and do you think it was

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.510 
about this movie and do you think it was
the<00:05:38.270> right<00:05:38.390> choice<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.290> move<00:05:39.770> it<00:05:39.950> to<00:05:40.340> not

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
the right choice to move it to not

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.640 
the right choice to move it to not
compete<00:05:40.880> during<00:05:41.210> Oscar<00:05:41.390> season<00:05:41.630> in<00:05:42.470> December

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.260
