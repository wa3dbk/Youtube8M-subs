00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.100
 good youtube guys are you doing that 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.980
 video here with a friend here to try 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.660
 solve this year's problem the stone 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.190
 writing information on the internet as is 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.780
 It's difficult for us to find something. 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.239
 related to this I decided to make a 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.100
 video or in my attempt to resolve 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.040
 this problem in a way that every 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.960
 world can try to do so is 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.000
 basically a problem that happens 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.850
 of the nozzles that are failing 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.489
 then the question of who to seek 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.589
 this piece is the complete lack in 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.619
 concessionaire in the fiat network goes against 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.799
 this piece above 1,500 reais and that 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:09.310
 only one injector nozzle costs around 160 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:12.880
 r $ 190 there auto parts the original part 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.619
 understood the magnet then we will 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.210
 Try to do it here, I'll teach you 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.979
 a technique that has 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.119
 just so that people have described the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.470
 a very reasonable way to replant 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.000
 show you a video teaching 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.180
 to do good first thing that people 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.430
 you have to do it back in the cylinder and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.530
 close the valve 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.260
 good quiksilver valve in position 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.260
 I would close things like giraffe to the end 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.659
 well closed 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.000
 well, it's just missing here she's totally 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.310
 Armored some some discussions in 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.320
 Internet sends us these face the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.140
 two tips here and for later power 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.110
 drop this whole set here 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.490
 He then spoon made nozzle exchange 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.230
 what a problem then to do 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.230
 the cleaning then that I provided 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.790
 provides a drilling machine 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.260
 common household can be a semi 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.470
 and a drill bit 32 may be 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:30.410
 fast access and well-fashioned sharp 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:34.110
 to be able to climb these heads to kibon 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.470
 careful on the ball was already properly face 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.470
 to the dollar 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.209
 Good to repair early already loose 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:09.760
 basically the screw head 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.360
 We're going to drop those two now. 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.360
 to do so 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.610
 Good folks after you get this 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.580
 chat after watching a climb 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.730
 with a drill here doing a 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:48.690
 bit of force and only that piece 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:55.290
 that it comes out and then you have access to the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:57.150
 xii to beaks but he came in and managers 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.190
 to be able to perform maintenance 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.610
 So, what are we going to do now? 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:06.319
 is to take the shots here today 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.730
 to make the exchange of that second 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.260
 injected here that apparently is with 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.680
 a problem or else perform maintenance 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.870
 in what you wish you can 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.359
 ask beauty, you broke it 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.769
 there the street or that there with the 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.590
 then how do you do it 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.030
 putting this place is simple the agent p 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.820
 buy two superb threaded screws 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.030
 What taxis from here to there? 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.740
 piece in this plastic piece that was 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.210
 understood that then they will come back 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.630
 obviously we'll clean up 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.910
 here everything is fine and then we 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.750
 goes in such a hurry that this 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.320
 Screw we can make the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.240
 reconnection right here next 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.690
 Good, we'll choose who's here. 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.690
 now thousand 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.730
 as much as we closed it, I'll 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.160
 back there and here too 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.350
 the system is still under pressure then 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.880
 so do not be afraid to disconnect 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.190
 because when he disconnects he'll do 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.740
 a consultation on a burst that the gas 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.030
 obviously the big leaving is here 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.480
 probably because of the video 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:20.840
 agent previously shot neutron 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:27.240
 can see the be executed 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:29.010
 we buy morro economy from the law 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.820
 Talking maybe do not pay everything. 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:37.670
 spoiled service and now we will 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.670
 make the connection here from the part in place 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:46.950
 to be able to do after assembly that 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.720
 we made a drill here with a drill 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.860
 in this plastic piece here for us to be able to 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.680
 put a screw and we choose 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.800
 here a superb screw thread 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.440
 we had already done we had already 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.730
 made a hole here also has 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.250
 a button for the bums for me 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.780
 run the risk of breaking the 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.950
 Leandro armadillo with pretty hard plastic 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.980
 We're going to vote for an alley to 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.220
 expression're so well 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.990
 so for the neo but not indicated 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.270
 can have for the best me then 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.980
 chose to do good that they are not 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.630
 so large that it has a good thread and I have 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.100
 a gauge a screw that is not 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.920
 too thin for the risk of breaking the 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.890
 So now you want to come back here and 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.560
 Screw it, we'll give it a 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:40.160
 squeeze 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:42.230
 a key manually will pick up a 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.870
 screwdriver a philips key you 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.870
 find it better to give a squeeze 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.360
 it's a squeeze 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.440
 the manual is believing it will be fine 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:05.990
 sure this here made it to us 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:08.500
 will now give a final grip on that piece 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.500
 Here is 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.320
 ready 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.240
 basically this is here now for 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.550
 to finish 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.570
 You can not forget to put it alone. 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:50.729
 this lock that under the arrest 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.350
 body of this piece that we are finished 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:54.830
 forgetting but you can put it and only 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.830
 before
