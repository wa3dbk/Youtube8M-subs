00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.740
 I answered and became a true 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.050
 phenomenon is the second game of the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.870
 santa house most bought in portugal 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.420
 just after the salt mussels 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.350
 The beach is unemployed and try to get lucky. 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.850
 all taken for at least five years 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.029
 are human lives that they are 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 actually contains boxes per week 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.619
 four hours 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.289
 I got a scratch card trying my 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.090
 lucky to be nothing more annoying than 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.850
 next time between January and July 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.390
 this year the scratch card has already yielded to the saint 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.540
 of € 20 million and € 38 million with 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.879
 sale of 241 million tickets 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.690
 represents an increase of more than 80 per 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.550
 compared to the same period of 2012 is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.120
 a growth that has been felt since 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.539
 2010 when the scratch card sale turned 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.670
 105 points 6 million euros in 2011 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.629
 published this valuable and last year 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.610
 reached 236 million euros 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.010
 in times of crisis there are Portuguese who 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.320
 preferring to breathe is to the detriment of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.720
 Euromillions son responds mine because 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.600
 there is usually more chance of leaving 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.850
 even if they are now two, it was not 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.830
 time will be one thing we have a championship 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.290
 you earn so much that in time 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.799
 now there is no longer on all sides in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.710
 anytime is easy to judge the answers 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.790
 nor cafes that today that is in many 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.210
 outlets 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.960
 in fact this speed as 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.329
 forced joined in this role can 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.329
 to repeat yourself is one of the attractions is one of the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.460
 more mixed additive components I call 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.729
 collective pressure and hope 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.220
 had will exit this this 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.229
 text that is darker than the country and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 most people cross and I 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.079
 I think it combines with bacon these factors 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.659
 with these factors nothing responds today 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.659
 at least 15 ecards of scratch cards 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.329
 the market priced between five and 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.050
 pray the odds of earnings vary 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.880
 and the cakes in the prizes too 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.980
 I belong to this story that the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.410
 Portuguese bought most between January 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.900
 and this June the five heroes is 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.580
 possible to earn up to 2 thousand euros per month 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.710
 for 12 years 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.840
 the most expensive scratch card but also what 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.360
 who are more likely to 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.880
 be a building and this information is possible 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.190
 see on the back on three of the pebbles a 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.160
 can be awarded in return 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.020
 ordinary scratch card costs only one europe 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.510
 have a very low probability of 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.180
 always premium but this does not mean that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.760
 the cheaper are the worse because 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.340
 we have a scratch card from europe one of 1 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.350
 euro is more expensive in our 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.440
 probability to be premium and this more 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.060
 have a higher degree of being an 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.490
 odds and the premium on a 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.430
 certain scratch card can vary from 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.530
 according to the number of tickets issued 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.990
 so the best thing is to check 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.860
 this information on the back of the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.860
 waterfowl
