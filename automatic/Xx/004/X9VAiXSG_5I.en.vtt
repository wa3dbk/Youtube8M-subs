thing about beetles

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.670 
thing about beetles
I<00:00:28.910> feel<00:00:29.509> like<00:00:29.630> trout<00:00:29.840> are<00:00:29.960> programmed<00:00:30.469> to<00:00:30.590> eat

terrestrials the materials for this fly

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.200 
terrestrials the materials for this fly
are<00:00:34.510> black<00:00:35.510> 2<00:00:36.379> millimeter<00:00:36.829> epazote<00:00:37.730> foam<00:00:37.969> I

or a peacock color a lot of standard
foam<00:00:52.010> beetle<00:00:52.370> patterns<00:00:52.730> are<00:00:52.880> tied<00:00:53.120> with

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
foam beetle patterns are tied with

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.400 
foam beetle patterns are tied with
peacock<00:00:54.520> but<00:00:55.520> this<00:00:55.820> is<00:00:55.970> just<00:00:56.180> easier<00:00:56.570> it's<00:00:57.260> a

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
peacock but this is just easier it's a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.380 
peacock but this is just easier it's a
little<00:00:57.649> shinier<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:58.820> considerably

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
little shinier and it's considerably

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.150 
little shinier and it's considerably
more<00:00:59.630> durable<00:01:00.079> than<00:01:00.410> peacock<00:01:00.800> herl

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
more durable than peacock herl

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.520 
more durable than peacock herl
so<00:01:02.090> you<00:01:02.180> can<00:01:02.300> squeeze<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.600> few<00:01:02.899> more<00:01:03.110> fish<00:01:03.320> out

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
so you can squeeze a few more fish out

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.869 
so you can squeeze a few more fish out
of<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:03.739> beetle<00:01:04.040> if<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:04.339> it<00:01:04.430> with<00:01:04.549> dubbing

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
of that beetle if you do it with dubbing

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.420 
of that beetle if you do it with dubbing

we'll<00:01:41.990> begin<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:42.410> fly<00:01:42.650> by<00:01:43.540> starting<00:01:44.540> the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
we'll begin this fly by starting the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.360 
we'll begin this fly by starting the
thread<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.170> wrapping<00:01:45.530> towards<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.890> back<00:01:46.100> of

now I'm going to cut out the body for

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.990 
now I'm going to cut out the body for
the<00:01:59.980> beetle<00:02:01.650> cut<00:02:02.650> about<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.920> quarter<00:02:03.520> inch<00:02:03.700> wide

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
the beetle cut about a quarter inch wide

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.670 
the beetle cut about a quarter inch wide
strip<00:02:04.930> of<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.350> episode<00:02:05.740> foam

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.979 

and<00:02:15.190> then<00:02:15.310> I'm<00:02:15.400> going<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.580> trim<00:02:16.000> one<00:02:16.540> end<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.840> it

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
and then I'm going to trim one end of it

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:26.309 
and then I'm going to trim one end of it
into<00:02:17.379> a<00:02:17.409> little<00:02:18.190> v-shape<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.080> will<00:02:26.230> be

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
into a little v-shape and this will be

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:35.570 
into a little v-shape and this will be
where<00:02:26.500> tie<00:02:27.069> in<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.700> foam<00:02:27.909> on<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.810> V

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.010 

and<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.210> you're<00:02:36.330> tying<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.690> fly<00:02:36.870> you're

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
and if you're tying this fly you're

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.810 
and if you're tying this fly you're
gonna<00:02:37.110> want<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.350> do<00:02:37.500> several<00:02:37.890> raps<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.670> that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
gonna want to do several raps on that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.480 
gonna want to do several raps on that
phone<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.180> make<00:02:39.330> sure<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.780> holds<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:46.490> the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
phone to make sure that it holds on the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.700 
phone to make sure that it holds on the
reason<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.850> use<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.210> episode<00:02:48.660> foam<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.140> it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
reason I use this episode foam is it

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.630 
reason I use this episode foam is it
compresses<00:02:50.190> down<00:02:51.170> very<00:02:52.170> well<00:02:52.410> compared<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
compresses down very well compared to a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.670 
compresses down very well compared to a
closed<00:02:54.180> cell<00:02:54.480> foam<00:02:54.510> that's<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.350> harder

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
closed cell foam that's a little harder

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.580 
closed cell foam that's a little harder
a<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:56.070> more<00:02:56.310> dense<00:02:56.960> so<00:02:57.960> I<00:02:57.990> tied<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.440> in

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
a little more dense so I tied that in

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.140 
a little more dense so I tied that in
and<00:02:58.710> I'm<00:02:58.770> gonna<00:02:58.920> wrap<00:02:59.160> back<00:02:59.490> towards<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> very

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
and I'm gonna wrap back towards the very

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.140 
and I'm gonna wrap back towards the very
end<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.540> hook<00:03:01.100> tube<00:03:02.100> up<00:03:02.280> there<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.730> we're

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
end of the hook tube up there and we're

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.210 
end of the hook tube up there and we're
gonna<00:03:03.210> be<00:03:03.420> folding<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.050> foam<00:03:04.320> over<00:03:04.590> for<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
gonna be folding this foam over for the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.350 
gonna be folding this foam over for the
