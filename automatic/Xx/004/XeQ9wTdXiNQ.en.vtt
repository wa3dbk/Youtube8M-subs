main feature and I'd say that gold are
just<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:48.719> fun<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:50.250> silver<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.670> more

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
just more for fun the silver are more

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.430 
just more for fun the silver are more
powerful<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.719> adamantium<00:00:52.289> would

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
powerful kind of like adamantium would

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.189 
powerful kind of like adamantium would
be<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.039> gold<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.420 
be and the gold are just like if you
were<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:56.010> coated

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
were to be coated

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 
were to be coated
Wolverine<00:00:57.030> skeleton<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.570> gold<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.930> guess<00:00:58.820> see

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
Wolverine skeleton and gold I guess see

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.430

that<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.600> cool<00:01:00.780> feature<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:01.140> this

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that one really cool feature about this

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.979 
that one really cool feature about this
pod<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.090> must<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> pretty

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
pod is that you must have a pretty

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.570 
pod is that you must have a pretty
decent<00:01:04.439> amount<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.710> health<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.040> use<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> claws

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
decent amount of health to use the claws

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940 
decent amount of health to use the claws
because<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.260> lower<00:01:07.500> than<00:01:07.710> around

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
because if you have lower than around

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520 
because if you have lower than around
250<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.330> will<00:01:09.479> die<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:10.049> equipping

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
250 you will die just from equipping

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.330 
250 you will die just from equipping
them<00:01:11.990> this<00:01:12.990> mod<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.200> doesn't<00:01:13.920> feel<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
them this mod really doesn't feel that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060 
them this mod really doesn't feel that
out<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.700> place<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> Skyrim<00:01:15.930> universe<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
out of place in the Skyrim universe and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.249 
out of place in the Skyrim universe and
my<00:01:17.220> current<00:01:17.640> playthrough<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.270> mage<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.229> I

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
my current playthrough I'm a mage so I

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
my current playthrough I'm a mage so I
don't<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> claws<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:21.119> wanted

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
don't use the claws but I really wanted

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.090 
don't use the claws but I really wanted
them<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.840> my<00:01:21.960> playthrough<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.650> decided

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
them to be my playthrough so I decided

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.550 
them to be my playthrough so I decided
to<00:01:23.280> give<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> my<00:01:24.240> follower<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
to give them to my follower and that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
to give them to my follower and that
shows<00:01:25.710> been<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.549> he's<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
shows been or because he's kind of a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.160 
shows been or because he's kind of a
brute<00:01:27.990> fighting<00:01:28.350> style<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.890> he<00:01:29.610> sounds<00:01:30.390> well

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
brute fighting style and he sounds well

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.719 
brute fighting style and he sounds well
he<00:01:31.259> has<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.409> good<00:01:31.560> voice<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.770> Wolverine<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.700> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
he has a good voice for Wolverine so I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
he has a good voice for Wolverine so I
just<00:01:32.909> had<00:01:33.090> she's<00:01:33.270> been<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.350> worked

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
just had she's been on and it's worked

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
just had she's been on and it's worked
out<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.650> well<00:01:35.270> one<00:01:36.270> problem<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.750> had

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
out pretty well one problem that I had

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
out pretty well one problem that I had
actually<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.180> followers<00:01:39.180> don't

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
actually is that the followers don't

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.940 
actually is that the followers don't
seem<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.630> any<00:01:39.810> damage<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.590> give<00:01:40.770> them

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
seem to do any damage when you give them

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.520 
seem to do any damage when you give them
the<00:01:41.100> claws<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.970> though<00:01:42.229> they'll<00:01:43.229> take<00:01:43.409> out

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the claws like though they'll take out

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
the claws like though they'll take out
the<00:01:43.649> claws<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.159> when<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.670> hit<00:01:44.850> enemies<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the claws but when they hit enemies it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.010 
the claws but when they hit enemies it
seems<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.380> based<00:01:47.149> low<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.509> arm<00:01:48.659> damage

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
seems to just be based low on arm damage
