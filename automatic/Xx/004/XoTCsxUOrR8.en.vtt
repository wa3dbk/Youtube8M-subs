00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
hitting an opponent's checker can be

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.629 
hitting an opponent's checker can be
very<00:00:09.599> effective<00:00:10.099> sending<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> other<00:00:11.400> poem

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
very effective sending in the other poem

very effective sending in the other poem
to<00:00:11.759> check<00:00:11.940> out<00:00:12.120> nearly<00:00:12.330> all<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.809> way<00:00:12.900> back<00:00:13.170> to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
to check out nearly all the way back to

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.440 
to check out nearly all the way back to
the<00:00:13.590> beginning<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> board<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:15.150> be<00:00:15.240> very

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
the beginning of the board can be very

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.250 
the beginning of the board can be very
useful<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.560> game<00:00:17.090> but<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.390> be<00:00:18.539> maximized

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
useful in a game but it can be maximized

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.310 
useful in a game but it can be maximized
to<00:00:19.590> increase<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> effect<00:00:21.140> we're<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
to increase the effect we're going to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.490 
to increase the effect we're going to
see<00:00:22.470> how<00:00:22.619> that's<00:00:22.859> done<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:24.289> back<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
see how that's done now back in the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.439 
see how that's done now back in the
opening<00:00:25.859> position<00:00:26.250> again<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.210> we're<00:00:27.330> just

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
opening position again and we're just

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.630 
opening position again and we're just
going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> make<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> couple<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.890> moves<00:00:29.130> here

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
going to make a couple of moves here

imagine that black rat started the game
with<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.669> 6<00:00:32.969> 3<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.840> we're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.350> move

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
with a 6 3 and we're going to just move

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.020 
with a 6 3 and we're going to just move
a<00:00:34.680> checker<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> back<00:00:36.350> 6<00:00:37.350> and

a checker out here for on the back 6 and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.290 
a checker out here for on the back 6 and
3<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:41.070> we're<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> imagine<00:00:41.969> red

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
3 and then we're going to imagine red

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.220 
3 and then we're going to imagine red
reply<00:00:42.660> there's<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.649> 2/1<00:00:45.230> conveniently

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230

allowing<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.710> hit<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.570> we're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
allowing it to hit back we're going to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.650 
allowing it to hit back we're going to
say<00:00:48.960> 2<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.850> hitting<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> black

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
say 2 and the one hitting the black

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.500 
say 2 and the one hitting the black
checker<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:53.149> place<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.899> bar<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
checker here place it on the bar so it's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
checker here place it on the bar so it's
now<00:00:57.629> blacks<00:00:57.930> turn<00:00:58.940> black<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.149> roll<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.250> he

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
now blacks turn black will roll and he

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
now blacks turn black will roll and he
rolls<00:01:02.660> 6

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
rolls 6

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.840 
rolls 6
oh<00:01:04.549> now<00:01:06.350> black<00:01:07.350> has<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.530> checker<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> bar<00:01:08.340> as

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
oh now black has a checker on the bar as

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.539 
oh now black has a checker on the bar as
I<00:01:09.000> said<00:01:09.240> previously<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.110> must<00:01:10.860> enter<00:01:11.159> this

I said previously you must enter this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.210 
I said previously you must enter this
checker<00:01:12.140> before<00:01:13.140> he<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> play<00:01:13.710> any<00:01:14.040> other

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
checker before he can play any other

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.880 
checker before he can play any other
moves<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> must<00:01:15.900> enter<00:01:16.049> them<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
moves and you must enter them on the

moves and you must enter them on the
points<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.880> correspond<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.049> number<00:01:19.409> so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
points that correspond to the number so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
points that correspond to the number so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
can't enter on the 6 point because as we

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
can't enter on the 6 point because as we
discussed<00:01:32.700> when<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.270> mentioned<00:01:33.720> Prime's<00:01:34.049> and

it cannot land on that point similarly
it<00:01:44.100> can't<00:01:44.460> enter<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.329> point<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.590> black

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
it can't enter on this point so black

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.990 
it can't enter on this point so black
must<00:01:47.490> enter<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.390> four<00:01:48.630> he<00:01:49.020> has<00:01:49.170> no<00:01:49.409> choice

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
must enter on the four he has no choice

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.719 
must enter on the four he has no choice
so<00:01:51.000> he<00:01:51.119> goes<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> four<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:53.430> he

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
so he goes in at the four and then he

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.429 
so he goes in at the four and then he
must<00:01:53.909> play<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.360> six<00:01:54.659> somewhere<00:01:55.350> else<00:01:56.180> ok<00:01:57.439> now

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
must play the six somewhere else ok now

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.899 
must play the six somewhere else ok now
let's<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.740> back<00:01:58.979> there<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.250> would<00:01:59.430> back<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.790> the

because<00:02:14.880> both<00:02:14.910> numbers<00:02:15.510> are<00:02:15.540> six<00:02:15.870> he<00:02:15.990> has<00:02:16.110> no

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
because both numbers are six he has no

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.500 
because both numbers are six he has no
other<00:02:16.410> choice<00:02:16.740> but<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.670> six<00:02:17.940> point<00:02:18.240> is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
other choice but the six point is

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.050

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
only one of them is double six so 35

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
beginning position of the game and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.410 
beginning position of the game and
imagine<00:03:22.680> red<00:03:22.950> starts<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.580> game<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.300> you

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
imagine red starts the game and if you

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.740 
imagine red starts the game and if you
remember<00:03:24.690> back<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.110> part<00:03:26.040> three<00:03:26.490> and<00:03:26.750> we

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
remember back in part three and we

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.350 
remember back in part three and we
discussed<00:03:28.200> basic<00:03:28.860> moves<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:29.850> showed<00:03:30.120> how

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
discussed basic moves and we showed how

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.050 
discussed basic moves and we showed how
five<00:03:30.720> three<00:03:31.170> could<00:03:31.410> be<00:03:31.440> played<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.790> said

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
five three could be played and I said

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.660 
five three could be played and I said
then<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.540> correct<00:03:33.900> move<00:03:34.110> for<00:03:34.440> red<00:03:34.670> was

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
then that the correct move for red was

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.620 
then that the correct move for red was
to<00:03:35.850> move<00:03:36.060> here

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
to move here

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.270 
to move here
one<00:03:37.200> two<00:03:37.740> three<00:03:38.370> four<00:03:38.820> five<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.950> three

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
one two three four five and the three

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.620 
one two three four five and the three
from<00:03:41.790> here<00:03:41.850> two<00:03:42.690> three<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.270> said<00:03:45.450> at<00:03:45.540> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
from here two three and I said at the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.120 
from here two three and I said at the
time<00:03:45.810> we'd<00:03:46.050> come<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.290> why<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:46.620> was<00:03:46.830> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
time we'd come to why this was the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.360 
time we'd come to why this was the
correct<00:03:47.370> move<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> later<00:03:49.110> part<00:03:49.410> or<00:03:50.070> now<00:03:50.310> the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
correct move in a later part or now the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.020 
correct move in a later part or now the
done<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.830> now<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.310> we<00:03:53.340> play<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.850> scenario

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
done so now if we play the scenario

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.710 
done so now if we play the scenario
again<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.530> imagine<00:03:56.000> black<00:03:57.000> had<00:03:57.209> played<00:03:57.450> out

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
again and imagine black had played out

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.070 
again and imagine black had played out
here<00:03:57.750> with<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.800> six<00:03:59.040> three<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.730> red<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.810> hit

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
here with the six three and red it hit

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.250 
here with the six three and red it hit
here<00:04:01.770> with<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.520> two<00:04:02.730> one<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.270> black<00:04:03.930> was<00:04:04.140> on

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
here with the two one and black was on

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.940 
here with the two one and black was on
the<00:04:04.410> bar<00:04:05.000> well<00:04:06.000> when<00:04:06.270> black<00:04:06.510> rolls<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.800> can

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
the bar well when black rolls you can

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.949 
the bar well when black rolls you can
see<00:04:08.250> when<00:04:08.700> he<00:04:08.790> has<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.090> re-enter<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.630> checker

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
see when he has to re-enter the checker

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.560 
see when he has to re-enter the checker
from<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.470> bar<00:04:10.650> not<00:04:11.160> only<00:04:11.580> is<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.910> six<00:04:12.209> point

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
from the bar not only is the six point

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.680 
from the bar not only is the six point
blocked<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.100> three<00:04:14.400> point<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:15.180> blocked

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
blocked but the three point is blocked

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.440 
blocked but the three point is blocked
as<00:04:15.900> well<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:17.220> shows<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.580> importance<00:04:18.209> of

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
as well and this shows the importance of

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.479 
as well and this shows the importance of
making<00:04:18.660> what's<00:04:19.049> called<00:04:19.109> inner<00:04:19.470> board<00:04:19.859> points

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
making what's called inner board points
