00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.809
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.400
 a new fashion review today shows you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.429
 the magic years offered the intervention 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.719
 version 1.2 yes and what you this thing 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.610
 I'll show you this after that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.790
 intro this is very cool so stay tuned 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.790
 tuned 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.480
 So the motto is just there 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 that you make important points to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.769
 Example of your way or so mark 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.180
 So could provide in such a line 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.170
 must first go before I call it me 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 man game mode so very realistic 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.110
 you have your penthouse and then you have 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.440
 you run through the desert and you are running 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.390
 so far away so it is very much now 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.660
 realistically adjusted and you run 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 her here long so you see a 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 surface quite a lot of diamonds is yes 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.129
 of course realistic and yes there you can 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.110
 you break down here, what do I know here? 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.880
 and the problem is only you do not know 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.490
 More where long because the house is like that now 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.550
 far away and yes that does not happen to you 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.660
 more with this magic i han and yes then 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.000
 we can right-click once 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.740
 press and then again 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.130
 right-click moment so so until that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.369
 Once again, do it again and again 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.310
 then he has such a nice line 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.690
 Made to many dust and then makes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.890
 its a right click then that is 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.179
 Missing times the standard right click 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.929
 it is there again and you have the 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.849
 new point marked then you go here 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.009
 and then you can recognize and here 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:43.530
 now marked here is so very green 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.690
 useful and yes I'll tell you how to do it 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 it strong and true to the center 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.670
 a compass like a compass 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.039
 personnel 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.500
 that must actually be clear if 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.270
 I look to the viking oh so then 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.420
 Let's take it either eight times 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.340
 So red wool or we take 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.830
 a little of this a little bit of this 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.369
 a blue sheep or route sheep or 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.599
 goat comes but a few more green and 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.670
 yes, it would be easy and yes 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.770
 if the job or something works 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.990
 still and as I said once 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.130
 right click again right 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.470
 new point laws can also be found here 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.060
 again is as crisscross so 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.640
 pretty cool and you can do it your way 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.520
 no longer so the way home 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.010
 lose more or if you were cool 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.290

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.510

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.570

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.330

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.230

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.990

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.400
 she learns a lot and shows me 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.790
 this on the basis of download here and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.560
 then download it again and so on 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.810
 I reject that now because I have that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.730
 already have such an opposite look 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.020
 minecraft watch installer if you have the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.330

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.590
 you press ok here and then again 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.540
 okay, if that is successful 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.490

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.710

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.230
 you come to the window executions heads 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.840

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.540
 ok then you go point minecraft folder 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.030

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.700
 Now the magic takes a whine and pull 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.380

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:03.120
 now we can close that and then 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:05.670
 We open the lounge so we do 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.340
 Let's call ourselves a new profile, yes, now 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.650

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.359
 select and still play and were short 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.359
 from 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.500
 jaja minecraft sometimes needs 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.500
 long to start 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.310
