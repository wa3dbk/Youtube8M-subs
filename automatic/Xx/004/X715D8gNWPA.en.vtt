00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello my friends are with you Vavan and u 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.589
 Today we will have a review on this 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.300
 japanese kids game honestly guys 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 Originally when I ordered this 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.150
 A bag on ebay I thought it was 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 set for Japanese children's cooking well, 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.199
 those who watch my channel have long known 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 what are these for a set and in general I already 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.590
 did on them before reviews 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.140
 but as it turned out guys is normal 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.269
 some kind of japanese kids game like this 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.800
 here are some monkeys flying 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.170
 everything is written in Japanese like this 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.390
 beautiful package guide here are bunnies 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.940
 here we are present from the firm and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.160
 cress for generally such a bag all 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.170
 Japanese means nothing 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.290
 I ordered on ebay he stands there 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.960
 about 200 rubles and 300 that is here 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.930
 so in Japan itself it is sold 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.910
 if in rubles for about 80 rubles 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.340
 there is cheat four times well plus 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.500
 Delivery sat there in general so here 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.329
 guys no longer know what to show 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.579
 so the bag is so Japanese 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.059
 the game let's open i will show you now 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 what is there to do at all like this 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:11.030
 schoolboy cut off means that we have here 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.939
 There we've got here so that all empty at 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.130
 we have two positions here so to speak 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.630
 monkeys themselves are present here in this 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.799
 a bag and here we are 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 palmistry 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.750
 so we need guys here 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 to make such a thing to begin with 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.700
 we need to tear these things off 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:40.260
 there is now see what it is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:44.580
 in general, so you tear off 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.090
 ok so not bad I'll tear off so 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.090
 now the second 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.280
 all so these things tore us now 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.010
 you need to make a long story somehow like this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.850
 Now that we have something like 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:04.440
 house now I'll show you all shorter 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:08.790
 the show will be all in general here here such 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:13.170
 little thing you need to do it like this 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:17.220
 and this is where such a thing is 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.970
 connect so well like that here and so yes 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.900
 that's connected in general so we 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.110
 it turned out now what do we do 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.320
 now now now now 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.140
 I forgot to keep the dolphin a little further 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.730
 so guys now everything will be shorter 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.400
 Now this is what you need to bend 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:46.730
 now these now 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 and here these things need to be inserted here 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.640
 In principle, there is nothing difficult though 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.730
 even seemingly out of the blue 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.330
 can this 40 asshole well i usually love 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:05.100
 rukozhop you know so now I will gather 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.880
 first here it is here the whole family so yes 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.180
 what will you do does not want to suvatsya 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.230
 here so one side seems to be collected 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.800
 only but for some reason I became stronger from INDICATES 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.800
 okay let's do the second one now 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.439
 effect and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.900
 honestly thought that I was faster all this 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:34.310
 did collect and the video will be short but 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.200
 report seems to me that this one now 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:46.829
 I'll just need to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.480
 getting about well something around 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.549
 Here is such a thing should get 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.560
 fuel here that falls off well as if 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:02.090
 yes, let's all have ours 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.209
 that's all and so sort of collected found 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.780
 piece 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.310
 such a thing turned out like that 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.670
 equal falls off okay now you 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:17.609
 there are some types of agitators here 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:22.740
 they need to be torn off 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.840
 all two sides though of course 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.080
 initially needed these glasses here 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.720
 do and then glue do not glue here 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.750
 tinkering these sides because 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:40.289
 I see all this 5 fell off not 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:45.479
 ok so don't be so screaming i'm all 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:47.300
 will be generally as I understood the meaning of this 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.699
 games is you know what 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:55.919
 this game requires two children 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:58.979
 Japanese means and they should play 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:05.240
 this game the point is to 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:09.930
 hang monkeys on these hangers and who 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.330
 damn and who this garbage will drop that type 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:18.120
 and game over 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:20.419
 then lost that you will I watched 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.169
 In the instruction, everything was fine there 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:27.650
 why can't i get you 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.650
 will you 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.989
 well here are my dear friends i like 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.129
 assembled our design and here is such 

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:36.169
 we got it 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.360
 let's now open the bag with our 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:44.599
 monkeys so i'm neat now 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:48.169
 I will move it so that it does not break 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.739
 just tear the monkeys so guys u 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.719
 me but 

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:52.369
 monkey flew away on the floor okay i right now 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.729
 I will not lift the bottom line principle, 

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:55.189
 affairs 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.729
 one monkey we are more she monkey 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:00.979
 less in general attack we have monkeys 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.809
 the camera focus they smell 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:09.079
 somehow marmalade ie they 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:11.809
 edible well meaning so taken two 

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:14.059
 baby they figure out there type who 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:17.689
 should 1 start and go-go then 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:21.799
 there is now hang by the tail and he's already 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:25.339
 falls starts then another hangs up 

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:27.619
 monkey and who will fall faster and 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:29.599
 shorter lost here is such, in principle, 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.569
 the usual game is nothing super straight 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:37.249
 there is nothing interesting here but nevertheless 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:40.219
 so we lost everything in general 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:42.919
 such is the meaning of this game all these volts 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.929
 monkeys are edible someone there constantly 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.909
 in the comments bombs that there it is all 

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:49.009
 chemistry is not allowed i will tell you guys 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.860
 but the fact that Japanese goods are very 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:55.099
 quality and you can not even be afraid 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.959
 there is all this chiromancy that is all 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.759
 at the highest level there is nothing 

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:00.979
 poison nothing will be bad there 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.349
 Japan knows a lot about production 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.059
 products of this for you just say so 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:13.939
 well let's try on finally 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:17.089
 monkey how it tastes monkey with 

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:20.809
 Pineapple taste to feel so 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:22.669
 rich taste of pineapple is normal 

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:26.329
 pineapple flavored marmalade 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:28.009
 such things, my friends, I hope you 

00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:30.769
 I liked this video 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:33.309
 happiness love health to new meetings 

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:33.309
 until
