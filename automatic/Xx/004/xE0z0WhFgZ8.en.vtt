eight<00:00:36.510> hundred<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.829> more<00:00:38.489> newer<00:00:39.239> functions

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
and the better heart rate monitoring I

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.900 
and the better heart rate monitoring I
think<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> garmin<00:00:45.480> 910xt<00:00:46.430> but<00:00:47.430> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
think then the garmin 910xt but this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.450 
think then the garmin 910xt but this
garment<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.379> good<00:00:49.500> watch<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.219> like

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
garment is a very good watch and I like

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.380 
garment is a very good watch and I like
it<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.789> lot<00:00:50.899> because<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.140> don't<00:00:52.860> only<00:00:53.489> run<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
it a lot because I don't only run and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.260 
it a lot because I don't only run and
bike<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> watch<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.980> also<00:00:56.270> skate

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
bike with the watch and but also skate

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.549 
bike with the watch and but also skate
on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> ice<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.760> swim<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> water<00:01:00.690> but

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
on the ice and and swim in the water but

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.799 
on the ice and and swim in the water but
the<00:01:02.010> heart<00:01:02.219> rate<00:01:02.460> monitoring<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.629> world

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the heart rate monitoring in the world

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
the heart rate monitoring in the world
is<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.470> very<00:01:05.010> good<00:01:05.100> from<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> garmin<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
is not a very good from the garmin and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
is not a very good from the garmin and
also<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> measurement<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.650> distance<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
also the measurement of the distance is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.000 
also the measurement of the distance is
not<00:01:08.760> very<00:01:09.090> good<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.570> water<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.770> new

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
not very good in the water so this new

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.330 
not very good in the water so this new
polar<00:01:11.369> v<00:01:11.729> eight<00:01:11.970> hundred<00:01:12.479> i<00:01:12.979> think<00:01:13.979> will<00:01:14.220> be

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
polar v eight hundred i think will be

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
polar v eight hundred i think will be
better<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.820> those<00:01:15.119> terms<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
better on those terms it's really a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.179 
better on those terms it's really a
multi-sport<00:01:17.220> watch<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.720> try<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.350> least<00:01:19.590> but

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
multi-sport watch for a try at least but

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.929 
multi-sport watch for a try at least but
also<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.850> people<00:01:20.880> who<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:22.430> nice<00:01:23.430> good

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
also for people who like nice good

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.330 
also for people who like nice good
watches<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> budget

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
watches and have a little bit of budget

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
watches and have a little bit of budget
to<00:01:26.640> buy<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:28.049> be

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to buy this one because it will be

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.950 
to buy this one because it will be
expensive<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.810> new

expensive and you see it here the new

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.990 
expensive and you see it here the new
design

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.690 

let<00:01:37.210> me<00:01:37.330> see<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:44.310> dare<00:01:45.310> think<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:45.670> see<00:01:45.880> it

let me see this dare think you see it
your<00:01:48.700> design<00:01:49.180> indeed<00:01:49.540> still<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.080> best<00:01:50.850> views

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
your design indeed still the best views

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.160 
your design indeed still the best views
that<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:53.290> now<00:01:53.530> find<00:01:53.979> on<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.310> internet<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
that I can now find on the internet you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.130 
that I can now find on the internet you
see<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.619> as<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.400> nice<00:01:57.670> rubber<00:01:58.000> band<00:01:58.330> with<00:01:58.960> the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
see it as a nice rubber band with the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.000 
see it as a nice rubber band with the
good<00:01:59.700> design<00:02:00.700> around<00:02:01.690> your<00:02:01.930> arm<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.320> don't<00:02:02.800> hope

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
good design around your arm I don't hope

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.480 
good design around your arm I don't hope
it's<00:02:03.250> very<00:02:03.810> how<00:02:04.810> do<00:02:04.869> you<00:02:05.020> call<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.290> very<00:02:05.770> solid

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
it's very how do you call it very solid

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.030 
it's very how do you call it very solid
so<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.180> can<00:02:07.479> really<00:02:07.780> adjust<00:02:08.020> rearm<00:02:08.679> show<00:02:08.860> you

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
so it can really adjust rearm show you

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.620 
so it can really adjust rearm show you
when<00:02:09.369> you're<00:02:09.520> using<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.239> couple<00:02:10.450> of

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
when you're using it for a couple of

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.699 
when you're using it for a couple of
hours<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:11.850> 8<00:02:12.850> hours<00:02:12.910> or<00:02:13.450> something<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.230> will<00:02:14.500> be

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
hours to 8 hours or something it will be

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.580 
hours to 8 hours or something it will be
comfortable<00:02:15.310> but<00:02:15.520> it's<00:02:16.030> very<00:02:16.540> white<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.320> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
comfortable but it's very white so I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.180 
comfortable but it's very white so I
think<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.070> will<00:02:18.310> be<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.700> good<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:20.130> yeah<00:02:21.130> you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
think that will be a good and yeah you

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.350 
think that will be a good and yeah you
see<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.320> beautiful<00:02:23.500> watch<00:02:23.950> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.660 
see it it's just a beautiful watch and
that's<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:25.510> very<00:02:25.680> important<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:26.709> yeah<00:02:27.370> if<00:02:27.580> it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
that's not very important but yeah if it

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.840 
that's not very important but yeah if it
can<00:02:27.850> be<00:02:27.880> beautiful<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.810> also<00:02:29.290> good<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:30.640> the

910xt<00:02:31.690> from<00:02:32.410> garmin<00:02:32.800> because<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.160> government

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
910xt from garmin because the government

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.750 
910xt from garmin because the government
is<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:34.810> dead<00:02:35.230> beautiful<00:02:35.440> as<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.190> v<00:02:36.580> eight

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
is not dead beautiful as the v eight

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.350 
is not dead beautiful as the v eight
hundred<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:38.500> think<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.640> v8<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.209> has

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
hundred and I think the v8 on it has

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.960 
hundred and I think the v8 on it has
better<00:02:40.660> option<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.350> i<00:02:41.380> will<00:02:41.739> switch<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.400> this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
better option so i will switch to this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.670 
better option so i will switch to this
one<00:02:43.269> if<00:02:44.610> night<00:02:45.610> assumptions<00:02:46.269> are<00:02:46.540> correct<00:02:46.750> now

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
one if night assumptions are correct now

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.590 
one if night assumptions are correct now
