00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.410
 anatomy of the raÃ¯s the rascism protects the 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.930
 marrow and its roots a role of 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.730
 mobility and support the spine 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.570
 lumbar lordosis this is at 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.400
 to say a curvature with posterior concavity 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.230
 the lumbar vertebrae are massive the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.660
 vertebral body was tense in the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.000
 frontal sense it is larger than 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.860
 that of the other vertebrae and takes on 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.340
 a superior life a rennie aspect 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.890
 shape ie a form of bean 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.739
 is surrounded by cartilage the neural arch 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.589
 limits back the vertebral foramen 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.080
 small and triangular it is formed by 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.470
 a pedicure and pays a short blade and 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.490
 massive the joint processes are at 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.100
 the junction of dandruff and blades 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.470
 superior joint processes 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.659
 indicate here in two are fragments 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.570
 of hollow cylinders located in the plane 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.369
 sagittal they are concave and look in 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.310
 back in water and inside 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.509
 they are surrounded by the granny tuber 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.210
 air joint processes 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.580
 lower here indicated in three are 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.759
 full convex cylinder fragments and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.799
 look outside down and forward 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.720
 superior joint processes and 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:42.280
 inferior is articulated between them by a 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:46.119
 type articulation too much like the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.299
 thorny and massive process flattens and 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.190
 horizontal transverse processes 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.929
 also called costi form ie 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.090
 that it comes from the ribs are arranged 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.909
 in a frontal plane they are and son 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.049
 and sharp and they headed back 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.179
 can present at their base 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.890
 insertion a tubercle pen id of 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.810
 variable shapes 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.610
 the superposition of true lumbar 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.259
 understands the articulation between the bodies 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.660
 vertebral discs separated by discs 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.579
 very large intervertebral as well 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.010
 that the articulation between the processes 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.109
 upper and lower joints 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.630
 so there is sixth articular phase 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:22.269
 on a lumbar vertebra the muscles 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.880
 lumbar muscle along his muses 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.970
 thorax born from the dorsal side of the sacrum 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.820
 thorny process processes 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.959
 transverse and tuberous accessories 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.810
 lumbar vertebrae 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.519
 he is heading up and ends 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.799
 on the transversal processes of 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.900
 thoracic vertebrae and the surface 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.620
 between the English tuber 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.690
 coastal tenths lower side the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.660
 thorn muscle of the thorax born 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.450
 thorny process of the vertebrae and 11 to 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.700
 they both have a tooth accents path and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.389
 ends on the thorny processes of 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.120
 vertebrae t3 to t9 when it contracts 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.459
 it allows the station erected by driving 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.280
 the extension of the rascism the balance of 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.049
 the whole trunk the muscle there is at 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.750
 costa lombers being part of 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.989
 posterior of the iliac crest or six 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.449
 or seventh lower side the muscles 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.890
 transverse thorny air are extended 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:21.130
 transversal processes 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.620
 and articular to the thorny process they 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.230
 knew me divided into three groups 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.110
 semi thorny muscles muscles 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.060
 multifilous that are born from the tuber granny 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.940
 the era of transversal processes in the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.450
 lumbar region and rotator muscles 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.640
 of the spine the interspinous muscles his 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.980
 little father is symmetrical 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.260
 they unite two thorny processes 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.380
 neighbors they are separated by 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.489
 interpinous ligaments finally we have 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.780
 intertrans muscles poured 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.970
 the installation the patient is in 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.610
 ventral decubitus with supports 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.910
 thoracic and and diac the surgeon actually 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.370
 locating in l3 l4 as well as in l4 l5 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.040
 with a sterile marker before 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.769
 realize two radios one of face then 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.720
 another in profile the operated area is 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.459
 then cleaned on a wide field in 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.370
 starting with the center and going 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.370
 to the periphery then we do not have the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.410
 operative fields complications 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.479
 are rare you have to be careful that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.100
 the ulnar nerve is not compressed 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.630
 as well as compression too 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.940
 important eyeball 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.740
 you must not exert too much pressure 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.880
 important on the stomach otherwise it 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.310
 prevents venous return 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.270
 we must also avoid bedsores 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.270
 on the points of support 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.599
 like any surgery there 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:44.839
 there are general operating risks 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.459
 and specific the general risks are 

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:47.919
 common to all operations and 

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:49.759
 mainly concern the system 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.649
 cardiovascular system 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.209
 respiratory 

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:55.489
 the specific risks are related to 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:58.129
 the operation itself and are those of a 

00:04:55.489 --> 00:05:00.769
 bleeding from an infection or risk 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.689
 nerve damage at the lumbar level 

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:05.179
 down the nerve roots have already 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.979
 left the column the paralysis are 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:09.379
 so still quite rare with 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.279
 minor consequences in cases 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.409
 exceptional 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:15.969
 Lehner innervating the bladder are affected 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:19.519
 causing problems with urination 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.169
 explanations and example of operation the 

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.609
 most frequent operations on the 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.679
 lumbar spine are those of 

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:26.509
 decompression of the nerves they have for 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:28.729
 purpose of decreasing symptoms at the level 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.889
 lower limbs and not improve 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.209
 lower back pain when this 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.929
 decompression is accompanied by a 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:34.669
 instability 

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:36.679
 we carry out an operation of 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.779
 stabilization called this islet bridge 

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:41.269
 days in addition to that of decompression 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.219
 most lumbar operations are 

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:44.659
 performed afterwards 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.599
 nevertheless for specific cases one can 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.249
 to be brought to make an interior 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.969
 will take here the example of a 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:54.860
 arthrodesis l3 l4 and l4 l5 arthrodesis 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.989
 is an operation consisting of the 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.610
 fixing a joint for 

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:01.519
 allow the dissipation of pain 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.349
 or a correction of a deformation a 

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:05.119
 arthrodesis at the level of the spine consists 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.639
 therefore in fixing one or more 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:09.589
 intervertebral joints indeed 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.569
 the intervertebral discs are charged 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:14.289
 and the nerves coming out at this level can 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.289
 to be pinched 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.760
 after installing the patient 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.000
 incises the skin next to thorny 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.830
 here in pink then we cut the dermis 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.170
 as well as the hypodermis with its tissue 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.810
 greasy cell then we come to 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:31.000
 deep fascia level at this level it 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.210
 is called fassia al doves tower here 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.400
 in green we incise then be done ya 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.790
 fitting in on the thorny processes of 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.790
 vertebrae 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.670
 we then fall directly on 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.620
 thorny process 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.260
 then just push back the muscles 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.330
 surrounding the thorny we can see the 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.100
 slides the articular processes and 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.170
 possibly further the apophysis 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.060
 transverse 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.590
 after this type of operation the patient 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.210
 can normally mobilize in 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.180
 24 to 48 hours after surgery 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.920
 surgical in some cases a 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.900
 external support must be worn during 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.820
 a few weeks the time spent 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.550
 the hospital will depend on the type of operation 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.420
 as a general rule for operations 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.370
 less important 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.650
 it can vary between two days until 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.510
 a week and in heavier holds 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.840
 the residence time can go up to 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.840
 two weeks
