Aksum<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.850> must<00:00:18.660> admit<00:00:18.810> where<00:00:19.470> before<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
Aksum now I must admit where before I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.910 
Aksum now I must admit where before I
start<00:00:20.220> looking<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.670> guy<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.619> never<00:00:22.619> heard

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
start looking this guy up I never heard

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.580 
start looking this guy up I never heard
of<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.220> guy<00:00:23.490> before<00:00:23.990> but<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.080> turns<00:00:25.289> out<00:00:25.439> he

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
of this guy before but it turns out he

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.500 
of this guy before but it turns out he
is<00:00:25.650> actually<00:00:26.010> from<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> Ice<00:00:26.460> Age<00:00:26.789> rather<00:00:27.240> than

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
is actually from the Ice Age rather than

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.410 
is actually from the Ice Age rather than
you<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> dinosaur<00:00:28.740> ages<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.760> that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
you know the dinosaur ages so that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.269 
you know the dinosaur ages so that
explains<00:00:30.779> why<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.140> haven't<00:00:31.380> heard<00:00:31.529> too<00:00:31.710> much<00:00:32.130> of

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
explains why I haven't heard too much of

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
explains why I haven't heard too much of
them<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.489> don't<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.910> study<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.480> much<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
them I don't really study that much of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.459 
them I don't really study that much of
that<00:00:34.350> time<00:00:35.070> period<00:00:35.270> but<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.510> did<00:00:36.809> look<00:00:36.989> into<00:00:37.230> it

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
that time period but I did look into it

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.170 
that time period but I did look into it
and<00:00:37.620> he's<00:00:37.739> actually<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> dinosaur<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.030> all

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and he's actually not a dinosaur at all

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.360 
and he's actually not a dinosaur at all
he<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> mammal<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.290> he's<00:00:40.829> definitely<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
he is a mammal and he's definitely a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.150 
he is a mammal and he's definitely a
relative<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.750> common<00:00:43.230> day<00:00:43.379> armadillo

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
relative of the common day armadillo

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
relative of the common day armadillo
which<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.300> looking<00:00:45.600> back<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.960> him<00:00:46.050> after

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
which you know looking back at him after

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
which you know looking back at him after
that<00:00:46.320> definitely<00:00:46.920> easy<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.610> he<00:00:47.789> got<00:00:47.910> kind

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that definitely easy to see he got kind

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.490 
that definitely easy to see he got kind
of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> same<00:00:48.510> shell<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:49.079> has<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> same

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
of the same shell he has the same

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.770 
of the same shell he has the same
activities<00:00:50.100> even<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> picture<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
activities even in the picture here it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.330 
activities even in the picture here it
looks<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.079> he<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> fur<00:00:53.010> on

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
looks like he has a little bit of fur on

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
looks like he has a little bit of fur on
his<00:00:53.640> face<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.570> definitely<00:00:55.230> closely

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
his face there so definitely closely

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.910 
his face there so definitely closely
related<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> armadillo<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.809> cool<00:00:58.170> thing<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
related to armadillo and a cool thing to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
related to armadillo and a cool thing to
see<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.670> we're<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:00:59.940> read<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.570> dossier

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the dangers of the island perhaps even

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.929 
the dangers of the island perhaps even
better<00:01:21.570> than<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> ankylosaurus<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> there

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
better than the ankylosaurus so there

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.100 
better than the ankylosaurus so there
goes<00:01:24.210> its<00:01:24.450> referring<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
goes its referring it to the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.690 
goes its referring it to the
ankylosaurus<00:01:25.590> even<00:01:26.130> saying<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.549> may

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
ankylosaurus even saying that it may

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.789 
ankylosaurus even saying that it may
have<00:01:26.820> adapted<00:01:27.240> even<00:01:27.479> better<00:01:27.780> than<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.229> but

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
have adapted even better than it but

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.890 
have adapted even better than it but
that<00:01:28.979> large<00:01:29.220> shell<00:01:29.549> has<00:01:29.820> fat<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> such<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that large shell has fat on it such as a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.140 
that large shell has fat on it such as a
camel's<00:01:31.140> hump<00:01:31.470> wood<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.979> keep<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.520> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
camel's hump wood to keep it you know to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
camel's hump wood to keep it you know to
help<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.479> temperature<00:01:33.900> regulation<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
help with temperature regulation and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
help with temperature regulation and
therefore<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.880> dinosaur<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.360> able<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> live

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
therefore this dinosaur is able to live

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.200 
therefore this dinosaur is able to live
high<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> mountains<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.490> grasslands

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
high in the mountains in the grasslands

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.880 
high in the mountains in the grasslands
but<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.509> believe<00:01:39.840> it'll<00:01:40.170> mostly<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.530> found

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
but I do believe it'll mostly be found

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.550 
but I do believe it'll mostly be found
in<00:01:41.130> land<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> island

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
in land on the island

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.100 
in land on the island
now<00:01:43.070> over<00:01:43.430> on<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.670> other<00:01:43.850> page<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.510> says<00:01:44.780> dota

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
now over on the other page it says dota

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
very tough to kill mount so this is

very tough to kill mount so this is

feel very safe on when you're riding it

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.930 
feel very safe on when you're riding it
because<00:02:50.690> probably<00:02:51.650> not<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> lot<00:02:52.130> can<00:02:52.549> take<00:02:52.790> it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
because probably not a lot can take it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.270 
because probably not a lot can take it
down<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.019> it's<00:02:54.290> probably<00:02:54.890> gonna<00:02:55.010> be<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> lot

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
down so it's probably gonna be a lot

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.150 
down so it's probably gonna be a lot
slower<00:02:55.760> but<00:02:56.209> definitely<00:02:56.900> very<00:02:57.200> safe<00:02:57.620> it's

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
slower but definitely very safe it's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.830 
slower but definitely very safe it's
gonna<00:02:58.310> be<00:02:58.489> able<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.790> harvest<00:02:59.000> rocks<00:02:59.450> in<00:02:59.720> the

gonna be able to harvest rocks in the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
game it's gonna be really tough to kill

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.150 
game it's gonna be really tough to kill
in<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.239> game<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:03.560> gonna<00:03:03.680> be<00:03:03.860> nearly

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
in the game and it's gonna be nearly

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.430 
in the game and it's gonna be nearly
impossible<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.970> kill<00:03:05.120> for<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.079> large

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
impossible to kill for the large

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.170 
impossible to kill for the large
predators<00:03:06.950> such<00:03:07.160> as<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.430> t-rex<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
predators such as the t-rex and the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.240 
predators such as the t-rex and the
Spinosaurus<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:09.739> think<00:03:09.950> it'll<00:03:10.100> definitely

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
Spinosaurus so I think it'll definitely

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.920 
Spinosaurus so I think it'll definitely
be<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.549> great<00:03:10.730> addition<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.359> game<00:03:11.450> as<00:03:11.810> you
