00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.970
 good my friends how are we 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.439
 I want to see a little sharp abdomen 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.240
 obstructive see the causes how it 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.219
 clinically manifests that of our 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.499
 differentials we have to do then 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 let's see that the grade side 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.420
 destructive is one of the different 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.769
 types of abdomen is acute then before 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.769
 to start talking we have to define 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.080
 what we mean by acute abdomen a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.390
 acute abdomen is a clinical picture that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 It is located in the abdomen of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.800
 we start from that base that is 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.410
 usually represented by pain and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.910
 we usually say and not always because 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.020
 there are pictures of acute abdomen as is the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.550
 case of the name acute vascular in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 vascular reality not the hemorrhagic in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 hemorrhagic forgiveness where the pain is not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 the most important component but that is 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.219
 a lipotymic name would be is the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.370
 most important component the pain would be 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.519
 secondary then we say that a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.180
 acute femur is represented by pain 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.770
 generally although there are exceptions 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.650
 where the pain is not of your present 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.940
 it is of abrupt installation that is short 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.970
 in time it is not a picture that 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.750
 It is brewing in days or weeks 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.020
 set up on the same day 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 and not roll but advances and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.390
 aggravates 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 can even put at stake the life of the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.310
 patient and what we have here in green 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.229
 It is important 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.630
 and make it clear to differentiate it from 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.979
 Other abdominal pain pictures 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.720
 usually when we enjoy them that 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.939
 is the acute abdomen they say is a picture 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.320
 of abdominal pain yes it is true but that 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.630
 it is not enough to define what is a 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.579
 acute stress because an expense spasm is 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.530
 a picture of abdominal pain and it's not a 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.259
 acute abdomen then we have to 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.009
 emphasize that it is of abrupt installation 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.289
 cuts in time that is not backward 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.270
 it does not recede but advances and leaves 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.190
 aggravating and not mediating a treatment 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.860
 puts the patient's life at stake 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.270
 and good as any pathology that puts in 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.800
 I play the patient's way and impose a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.780
 rapid diagnosis and a therapeutic 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.330
 timely 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.049
 still somewhat destructive is the arrest of 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.340
 intestinal transit in mechanical form 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.890
 obstructive acute abdomen we define it 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.690
 as an acute abdominal picture that courses 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.840
 with the arrest of intestinal transit 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.700
 mechanically and here we have to 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.550
 talk a bit about videos the book itself 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.440
 is the arrest of intestinal transit 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.150
 that can be given by two things for 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.400
 mechanical causes or causes 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.980
 functional in what is called and what 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.020
 reflected today I read paralytic things 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.790
 mechanics of intestinal occlusion or 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.010
 stopping intestinal transit is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.320
 can divide at a luminal level 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.560
 extrinsic with respect to the visor or 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.480
 parietal level the cilia reflexes as 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.730
 paralytic or functional arise from 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.140
 diverse ideologies the most common is the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.209
 postoperative whenever we make a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.610
 laparotomy for one or two days we have 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.709
 an intestinal transit attention 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.810
 it can be the polio pharmacological 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.730
 Peritonial avoidance due to trauma 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.220
 spinal cord syndrome or called syndrome 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.140
 ogilvy that later we will see then 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.400
 when we talk about an abdominal 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.750
 destructive we have to talk about a 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.750
 mechanical nimio 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.900
 and the causes are always at the luminal level 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.970
 aesthetically and at the parietal level 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.390
 then how do we divide the causes of 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.159
 acute obstructive abdomen here we have 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.790
 a visor let's see what we have 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:23.730
 those causes that affect from the light 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.769
 for example foreign bodies any 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.290
 element that is ingested tri kobe 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.000
 envelopes that is the accumulation of hairs 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.390
 phyto sensors that the communication of 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.040
 parasitic plant fibers or a calculus 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.659
 biliary a gallstone also 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.269
 cases of the fight afterwards we're going to 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.099
 see the famous and read biliary after 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.019
 we have causes that act extrinsically 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.490
 mind is to say that compresses in the light 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.130
 from outside 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.990
 examples the solution by flanges that is 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.580
 the first cause of destructive 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.470
 remember this and put it with with 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.870
 colorado first cause of has bent 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.030
 destructive obstruction pro flanges 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.010
 parietal hernias eventrations volvulus 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.840
 even section in is internal and the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.610
 wilkie syndrome we can know that 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.440
 are each of these and then we have 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.450
 parietal causes 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.280
 where there is a thickening of the wall to 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.840
 level training of the wall 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.170
 obstructs the light for example a 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.790
 bowel neoplasia a polyp a 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.730
 duplication or a disease 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.920
 chronic inflammatory 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.660
 and for a little bridle to start 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.310
 talk about each of these causes let's 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.230
 to say that it is the first cause of 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.060
 obstructive acute abdomen we define it 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.150
 as fibrous adhesions scar is 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.720
 between viscera and viscera or viscera and 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.120
 wall or wall and wall that emerge after 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.000
 surgeries if after surgery 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.760
 these adhesions will appear 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.860
 fibrous scarring is almost 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.110
 unlikely to produce a flange without 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.140
 middle street a surgical act here we see 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.380
 as there is an adherence between loop and there 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.180
 and how another handle is caught between that 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.950
 adhesion to fibers and reed here 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.020
 we also see it all gobs and 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.390
 adhesions and there we have some 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.760
 obstructed what are the causes for 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.260
 that a flange occurs first a 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.360
 constitutional factor is to say 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.980
 personal characteristics there are people 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.720
 that are quoted in a certain way there 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.670
 people who make bridles after their 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.410
 surgeries other cousins ​​are the 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.640
 inflammation to repetition when the 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.890
 abdomen is subject to pictures 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.550
 inflammatory repeats for example 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.880
 recurrent diverticulitis 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.310
 efe consist and tease go doing 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.440
 fibro scar adhesions is a 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.540
 emergency surgery because I do not know 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.610
 would respect the dissection plans of the 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.880
 peritoneum then in the synthesis of the 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.300
 tissues could this be produced this 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.140
 goop gynecological surgery 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.440
 precisely because of the same thing because I do not know 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.060
 respect the peritoneal planes and well 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.570
 for the structure material that is 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.370
 use there are material structures that are 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.860
 more likely to produce reactions 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.370
 scar is that others 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.979
 to almost keep the flange as it is 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.370
 clogging and this up as is 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.310
 dilated the sense would come like this and as 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.960
 you were inflamed 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.960
 obstruction for lives 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.770
 and good until here we come today we are going to 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.110
 see later we continue with the rest of the 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.110
 causes people until then a fondness
