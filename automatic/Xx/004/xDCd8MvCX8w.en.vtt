yarrow and I love using yarrow in
drought<00:00:20.340> tolerant<00:00:21.060> gardens<00:00:21.660> because<00:00:21.930> it's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
drought tolerant gardens because it's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.730 
drought tolerant gardens because it's
first<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.490> very<00:00:23.760> Hardy<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:25.350> great

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
first it's very Hardy it's a great

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.589 
first it's very Hardy it's a great
perennial<00:00:26.460> which<00:00:26.699> means<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> will<00:00:27.150> comeback

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
perennial which means it will comeback

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.769 
perennial which means it will comeback
and<00:00:27.810> bloom<00:00:28.080> year<00:00:28.380> after<00:00:28.800> year<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.599> it<00:00:30.599> will

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and bloom year after year and it will

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.330 
and bloom year after year and it will
tolerate<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.800> poor<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.940> dry<00:00:33.329> soil<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.800> once<00:00:35.130> it's

are<00:00:58.680> also<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.399> great<00:00:59.940> dried<00:01:00.420> or<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.020> use

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
are also a great dried or you can use

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.579 
are also a great dried or you can use
them<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.530> cut<00:01:01.800> fresh<00:01:02.100> flowers<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.589> yarrow

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
them as cut fresh flowers to yarrow

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.570 
them as cut fresh flowers to yarrow
doesn't<00:01:05.100> need<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> whole<00:01:05.790> lot<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.510> pruning<00:01:07.580> but

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
doesn't need a whole lot of pruning but

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.250 
doesn't need a whole lot of pruning but
if<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> prune<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.930> there's<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
if you do want to prune it there's a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.920 
if you do want to prune it there's a
couple<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.710> things<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.820> first<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.869> all

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
couple of things you can do first of all

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
couple of things you can do first of all
you<00:01:13.080> want<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.740> any<00:01:13.890> broken<00:01:14.549> branches

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
you want to look for any broken branches

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.410 
you want to look for any broken branches
and<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:16.020> I've<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.759> an<00:01:17.759> area<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.299> got

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and like here I've got an area that got

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.719 
and like here I've got an area that got
banged<00:01:18.720> into<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.680> you'll<00:01:19.860> probably<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
banged into so you'll probably want to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.810 
banged into so you'll probably want to
pull<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.409> prune<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> fairly

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
pull this off here and prune it fairly

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.020 
pull this off here and prune it fairly
close<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.570> base<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.729> off

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
close to the base and take that off

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.420 
close to the base and take that off
there's<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:27.960> another<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
there's also another one here in the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
there's also another one here in the
middle<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.680> also<00:01:31.890> prune<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.850> thin<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.299> out

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
middle you can also prune to thin it out

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.190 
middle you can also prune to thin it out
a<00:01:33.509> bit<00:01:33.720> yarrow<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.799> tend<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.420> grow<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
a bit yarrow will tend to grow out and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.730 
a bit yarrow will tend to grow out and
up<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.400> spread<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.170> starts<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.560> get

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
up and spread out so if it starts to get

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.219 
up and spread out so if it starts to get
too<00:01:40.979> clustered<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> start<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.990> see

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
too clustered or if you start to see

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.910 
too clustered or if you start to see
that<00:01:43.500> there<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.579> woody<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.450> dead<00:01:46.229> growth<00:01:46.619> in

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that there is a woody or dead growth in

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.069 
that there is a woody or dead growth in
the<00:01:47.009> center<00:01:47.490> definitely<00:01:48.479> get<00:01:48.659> into<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the center definitely get into the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
the center definitely get into the
center<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.950> plant<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.640> prune<00:01:51.180> some<00:01:51.479> of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
center of the plant and prune some of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.810 
center of the plant and prune some of
that<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.040> way<00:01:53.189> there'll<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.430> more

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that out so that way there'll be more

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.139 
that out so that way there'll be more
air<00:01:54.090> circulation<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.439> it'll<00:01:56.250> encourage<00:01:56.670> more

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
air circulation and it'll encourage more

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.990 
air circulation and it'll encourage more
growth<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.619> also<00:01:58.979> prune<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.670> shape

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
growth you can also prune it for shape

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.810 
growth you can also prune it for shape
as<00:02:00.329> well<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.770> rather<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
as well so if you would rather have a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.390 
as well so if you would rather have a
more<00:02:03.390> rounded<00:02:04.020> shape<00:02:04.049> something<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:05.040> is

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
more rounded shape something that is

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.999 
more rounded shape something that is
more<00:02:05.580> formal<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:06.690> can<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.320> although<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
more formal you can do that although I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.940 
more formal you can do that although I
think<00:02:08.160> yarrow<00:02:08.640> works<00:02:08.940> best<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:10.170> garden<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
think yarrow works best in a garden that

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.540 
think yarrow works best in a garden that
is<00:02:11.400> less<00:02:11.790> formal<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.750> has<00:02:13.590> grasses<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:16.550> more

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
is less formal and has grasses and more

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.480 
is less formal and has grasses and more
drought<00:02:17.820> tolerant<00:02:18.480> plants<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:19.380> have<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.190> more

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
drought tolerant plants that have a more
