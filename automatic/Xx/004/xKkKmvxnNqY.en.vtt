00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.449
 thief threw 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.449
 We know that 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.809
 your first job was like this 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.189

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.700
 new still this week at school in a mall 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.649
 but today I'm good and with sales 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:03.390
 But suddenly I've always been fond of technology. 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.990
 is my grandfather was from the ciferal who was one of the first of the body bitrem 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.139
 brazil bus 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.760
 and was one of the first companies also here in Brazil has worked with a 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:17.020
 computer so I had access to it very soon my passion arose 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.470
 just that access to that fascinating thing, not even for me is very 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.220
 Yummy to see a lot of the revolution computers that occupied it is a room 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.590
 whole of him and suddenly we have nowadays phones that have 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.500
 level of interactivity 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.930
 bigger than the first computers and if we stop to think nowadays 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.030
 the worst the computer on the market is more sophisticated than I was for years 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.320
 used to send the first man by the other, this is 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.330
 speed of the revolution in technology is not that we have access to be 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.080
 frontally this fascinates me a lot 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.460
 but then I wonder there is no computer outdated there is more to the owner 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.590
 computer has to be always updating with the parts 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.489
 first semester 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.679
 the road is true you are a very interesting thing because 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:10.620
 As this evolution arises, new needs arise from the 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:12.540
 physics this computer 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.440
 so the problems they are more advanced 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.890
 but they also require more 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.380
 the computer as a whole and for this it is necessary for people to be 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.600
 is the attitude that they are updating to be able to accompany said market 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.640
 and all the advantages and all these technologies can propose is to provide 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.640
 to the general public caught 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.029
 the internet is a dream is a reality or she 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.059
 from now on it can end or 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.020
 so the internet gave them 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.940
 dream and reality will not end up on the internet, I'm not in the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.940
 as far as 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.680
 you see very small people as suddenly the case on Saturday the two 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.190
 boys of the buscapé 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.460
 which indicated companies the equivalent of 100 reais 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.110
 and that suddenly sold is always are the years after 2 the young has passed 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.909
 very new 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:19.270
 the equivalent of R $ 7,6 million 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.009
 then what is a dream is a reality and I will be here changed the way 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.690
 of people marketing will dream come brought as you see the prospects to 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.330
 people who previously would not have visibility but hamsik names that have 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.490
 through the Internet 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.090
 I'll just ask for a little commercial break. 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.009
 and right after I go back to 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.009
 continue for almost three months 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:44.139
