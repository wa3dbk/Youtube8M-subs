00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello that such a greeting to all the people 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.890
 from youtube my name is omar castañeda and 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.410
 today I bring you a video 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.019
 quite pretty good where I'm going 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.990
 to show a functionality of this 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.080
 system that is hidden known as 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.510
 get mode or in Spanish it would be god mode 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.270
 I want to mention that although this one does not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.670
 it's a new option because in previous 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.010
 systems could be made many 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.439
 we thought that in windows 10 there was no 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.170
 the possibility of activating it and until this 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.660
 good time is working at the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.239
 perfection if you do not know what the mode is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:44.399
 god or gat mode below you what 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:47.399
 I present therefore good it turns out that for 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.559
 many people find configurations in 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.649
 windows 10 or in any other system 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.660
 operative is really something complicated and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.289
 I up to this point do not understand why 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.420
 Microsoft makes things so difficult 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.670
 being able to put everything in one place 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 Clear example are the configurations 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.940
 that brings windows 10 that like us 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.120
 we know enter 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.370
 on this side we have them here but if you 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.140
 you observe well and you are looking for 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.390
 a specific option so that the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.120
 find is a real problem to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.100
 unless you know what it's called and 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.410
 that way you can locate it in this 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
 section in addition to this window 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.790
 configurations we can also enter 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.950
 to what is control panel where 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.050
 effectively in this section we could 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.910
 locate some other options that do not 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.670
 are in this back window 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.410
 but exactly the same happens 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.030
 of us we have not gotten into this 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.610
 section we are looking for a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.980
 specific configuration and suddenly not 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.190
 we found nothing so good for that 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.740
 there is god mode or also known 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 like cat mode in english i want 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.570
 mention that this is a window 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.540
 common and current which is going to 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.810
 present all the options of your 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.140
 operating system in one place for 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.450
 that you can customize your system to 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.820
 your taste and in this way you find 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.030
 the options much faster if you 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.990
 account and here we have divided by 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.840
 categories 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.460
 for example administrative tools 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.380
 from this side we can find some 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.170
 options like the fragment for 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.880
 optimize our hard drives if 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.560
 we give a click to anyone 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.680
 of them will open us immediately 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.230
 the window where we easily 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.770
 we could make changes to our 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.420
 system or maybe optimize it with taking 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.790
 some tool in this section 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.730
 we also have the auto play section 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.860
 or automatic playback of this side 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.690
 you will be allowed to move some 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.460
 configurations with respect to the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.440
 playback of disks on this side 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.750
 we also have the backup section 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.150
 how many times have we not wanted to create a 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.090
 backup etc and we 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.400
 we have not found the option maybe in 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.830
 our system I repeat that every time 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.230
 that we give a click or double click 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.120
 to each of these options 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.680
 automatically brings us to the section 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.080
 indicated and so we could continue 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.050
 surfing for example we have 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.760
 credentials color configurations 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.890
 the date programs by default or default 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.680
 that work in our 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.080
 and printers we also have aspects 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.950
 the display on the screen here you 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.709
 you can change or adjust the resolution 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.709
 of your monitor among other things of this 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.770
 side we have the access center equal with 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.830
 a lot more functions we have from this side 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.440
 options of the folders with their 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.510
 respective options in this case you can 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.760
 find all the options that from 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.010
 this side we also have the file 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.590
 history I do not know if you know about 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.260
 of that but that's being able to restore your 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.230
 system to previous dates types of 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.560
 letter groups internet options and so 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.230
 we could continue browsing but if you 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.840
 you see everything is in a way 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.450
 ordered and everything you will locate in 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.209
 this same section in this same window 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.730
 that we have created in the manner of 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.340
 we can access these options 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.459
 a pretty but pretty fast way 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.070
 then I think all of us 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.410
 It would be convenient to have this window activated 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.460
 that is activated in a second and this 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.949
 way 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.509
 and it's going to be much easier to control your 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.090
 operating system 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.830
 now as we can create this 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.900
 window so good the process is 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.310
 pretty but pretty easy what 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.759
 I want you to do is to come to your 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.310
 desktop and you create a new folder already 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.830
 I want this folder to place the 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.590
 name or the code that you are seeing in 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.690
 screen at this time that code what 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.389
 I'm going to leave below the video in the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.930
 description so you can copy it 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.610
 and that way you can create your folder 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.380
 in god mode when I give it entrance 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.930
 it automatically creates a folder and 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.880
 with that name as you realize 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.699
 and the only thing that remains is to give double 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.820
 click to open it and then 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.210
 you have all the options that I just 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.159
 to present a moment ago then 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.889
 that's how easy we created it, I really hope 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.020
 it is very useful I invite you to 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.520
 Share this video with your friends in 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.050
 social networks so that they 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.919
 also be aware of this 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.750

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.540
 they are subscribed and I invite you to give them
