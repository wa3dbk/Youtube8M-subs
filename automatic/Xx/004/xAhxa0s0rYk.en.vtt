Saturn<00:00:59.190> when<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.559> get<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.770> wobble

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
Saturn when we don't get to wobble

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
Saturn when we don't get to wobble
wherever<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:02.940> without<00:01:03.449> having<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> be

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
wherever we go without having to be

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.450 
wherever we go without having to be
accountable<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.890> words<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> actions

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
accountable for our words and actions

accountable for our words and actions
yeah<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.330> fact<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.840> think<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.409> sometimes

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
yeah and in fact I think that sometimes

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.070 
yeah and in fact I think that sometimes
with<00:01:08.100> mercury<00:01:08.520> opposite<00:01:09.060> saturn<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.900> an

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
with mercury opposite saturn there's an

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440 
with mercury opposite saturn there's an
over<00:01:10.560> accountability<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.430> oh<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.090> I'm

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
over accountability I oh I know I'm

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.719 
over accountability I oh I know I'm
wrong<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.500> gonna<00:01:13.680> go<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> extra<00:01:14.250> mile

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
wrong and so I'm gonna go the extra mile

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.130 
wrong and so I'm gonna go the extra mile
and<00:01:14.939> make<00:01:15.420> sure<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.110> everything

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and make sure that I have everything

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.920 
and make sure that I have everything
together<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.070> show<00:01:17.460> how<00:01:17.729> right<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.780> am

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
together to show how right I really am

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
together to show how right I really am
when<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> fact<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.950> may<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.340> know<00:01:20.400> what

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
when the fact is I may not know what

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
when the fact is I may not know what
can't<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.840> mercury<00:01:22.290> opposite

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
can't be right with mercury opposite

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
can't be right with mercury opposite
saturn<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.220> scorpio<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> no<00:01:24.180> right<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
saturn in scorpio there is no right and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.859 
saturn in scorpio there is no right and
that's<00:01:25.020> partly<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:26.340> bump<00:01:26.759> into<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
that's partly because we bump into the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.620 
that's partly because we bump into the
ultimate<00:01:28.320> reality<00:01:28.710> check<00:01:29.460> ur<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.119> time<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
ultimate reality check ur all the time I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.200 
ultimate reality check ur all the time I
mean<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.369> environment<00:01:32.369> gives<00:01:32.670> us<00:01:32.880> feedback

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
mean the environment gives us feedback

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.600 
mean the environment gives us feedback
and<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.110> points<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.619> whatever<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.400> that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and it points out whatever it is that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.880 
and it points out whatever it is that
isn't<00:01:36.000> sufficient<00:01:36.509> isn't<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.140> whatever<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
isn't sufficient isn't right whatever is

isn't sufficient isn't right whatever is
whatever<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.460> running<00:01:39.210> into<00:01:39.479> problems<00:01:39.630> we're

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
whatever is running into problems we're

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.990 
whatever is running into problems we're
told<00:01:40.619> immediately<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> deal

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
told immediately and we have to deal

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
told immediately and we have to deal
with<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.329> there's<00:01:42.570> no<00:01:42.750> room<00:01:43.079> there's<00:01:43.560> very

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
with it there's no room there's very

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.580 
with it there's no room there's very
little<00:01:44.009> margin<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.610> error<00:01:45.590> fortunately

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
little margin for error fortunately

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.960 
little margin for error fortunately
though<00:01:46.799> there's<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> lot<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.399> space<00:01:47.759> for

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
though there's a lot of space for

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.969 
though there's a lot of space for
imagination<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.990> hope<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> smooth
