00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and half stuff added it's not that hard

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.719 
and half stuff added it's not that hard
to<00:01:35.880> remake<00:01:36.509> another<00:01:36.869> game<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
to remake another game it's really a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.780 
to remake another game it's really a
matter<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.270> money<00:01:40.140> versus<00:01:40.710> time<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.610> would

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
matter of money versus time and it would

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.550 
matter of money versus time and it would
have<00:01:41.909> been<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.240> great<00:01:42.390> idea<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.079> an<00:01:43.170> intended

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
have been a great idea for an intended

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.149 
have been a great idea for an intended
to<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> they<00:01:44.399> did<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.979> knew<00:01:46.979> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159

then i'm not the developing had captain
here<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.550> don't<00:03:47.790> know<00:03:47.910> how<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.090> stuff<00:03:48.480> will

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
here so I don't know how that stuff will

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.840 
here so I don't know how that stuff will
work<00:03:48.840> but<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.800> thrown<00:03:50.310> out<00:03:50.489> some<00:03:50.730> ideas

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850
