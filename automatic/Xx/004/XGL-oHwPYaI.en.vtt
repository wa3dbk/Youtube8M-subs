 people like last year's test 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.880
 was chosen by several pilots as the 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.800

 an event like the test should be this year 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.320
 special events such as last year will be 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.390
 strong heat is the greatest enemy of this 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.940
 time of the year in the race will now be day 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.619

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.060
 probably will be a differential 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.060
 this year in the race 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.740

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.640
 how weak local totally bampi act 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.430
 like a track but this one will have climbs 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.560
 very curved descents with total vision 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.619
 accessible to the public. 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.270

 where we will be locked up with climbs 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.390
 descending stones dies musician possible 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.970
 so you can have more difficulty 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.190
 also having alternatives to the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.290
 to contain this difficulty of flow. 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.070
 as in some places we have already seen 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.530

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.370
 downhill curves with some 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.680
 passages but it will be a 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.959

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.700
