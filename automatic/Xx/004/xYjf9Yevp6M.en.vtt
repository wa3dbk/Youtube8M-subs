think napkins could be a part of your
design<00:02:17.510> not<00:02:17.990> just<00:02:18.320> an<00:02:18.530> accessory<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.160> you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.760 
design not just an accessory that you
need<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.700> have<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.120> necessity<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:21.170> actually
