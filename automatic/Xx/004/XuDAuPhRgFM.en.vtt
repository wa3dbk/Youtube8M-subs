about<00:02:04.909> $35<00:02:05.630> some<00:02:06.409> mercury<00:02:06.770> broke<00:02:07.009> they<00:02:07.250> have

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
about $35 some mercury broke they have

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.570 
about $35 some mercury broke they have
another<00:02:07.670> one<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:07.909> think<00:02:08.769> zoo<00:02:09.769> med<00:02:10.009> makes<00:02:10.310> it

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
another one I think zoo med makes it

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.580 
another one I think zoo med makes it
it's<00:02:10.879> fifty<00:02:11.360> dollars<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.780> goes<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:12.019> 100

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it's fifty dollars it goes on 100

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.710 
it's fifty dollars it goes on 100
wattage<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.000> know<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.360> might<00:02:14.599> as<00:02:14.660> well

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
wattage so you know you might as well
