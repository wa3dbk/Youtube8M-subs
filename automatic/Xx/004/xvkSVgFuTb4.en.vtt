00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.590
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.880
 video of the dual psa albert lv back 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.519
 and today I bring you the most information 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.440
 recent of black ops 2 the one that has to 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.290
 see with the patch that has been applied today 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.060
 January 26 , 2013 there are many 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.100
 news there are many changes but we 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.980
 let's basically focus on what 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.170
 It affects competition in LVBP let 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.869
 to set aside what has to do with 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.640
 errors with books exploits and changes 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.010
 minors especially that affect the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.690
 public and we will go to the changes that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.030
 there has been basically in arms and in 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.370
 some advantage that may have to do 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.760
 with competition the first thing is 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.670
 the change in the resistance advantage 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.770
 electronics nobody used this advantage that 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.899
 advantage is not prohibited in the elite 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.000
 basically because it was totally useless 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.149
 and to make it a little more subtle they have 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.820
 removed the effect of retention or 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.390
 decreased effect of the grenades 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.210
 mp 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.309
 in tactical mask and they have put it on 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.140
 this advantage to electronic resistance 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.720
 so now we will be immune to those 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.240
 grenades pm that some players are 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.960
 now starting to use seen they have 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.090
 the second utility the second 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.070
 novelty is a change in the utility of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.900
 the silencers in all 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.720
 sub-machine guns have basically reduced it 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.610
 the range this means that you no longer 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.530
 we will be able to traverse so easily 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.320
 walls with a silenced weapon with a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.750
 smg with a silenced rifle nor will we kill 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.970
 so quickly in more distances or 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.190
 less long weapons like the double pdv or 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.229
 the ms mc with silencer had ranges 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.300
 really ridiculous so now it 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.039
 will see a little diminished does not specify 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.110
 what is the amount exactly in 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:50.250
 meters but we can pretty much 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.750
 consider a reduction of 10 20% as well 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.660
 that we could be talking about about 2 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.940
 meters approximately about your range 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.500
 maximum that you believe it or does not affect 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.690
 quite at the time of using it of all 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.340
 forms are weapons that at least in 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.140
 competition are not usually used 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.720
 silenced now sure we'll leave 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.360
 to see it more changes changes that have 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.729
 to do with 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.220
 assault rifles things that people 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.950
 I was waiting for the first of them 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.440
 has reduced the rolling woe of the sway 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.510
 how good do you see it here, basically what 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.860
 which is that the weapon moves from one side 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.230
 to the other slightly when we are 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.300
 aiming with the aim this happened before 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.670
 in a bit more exaggerated way now 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.680
 directly the guns the rifles 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.600
 jump practically do not move that in 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.820
 that influences because basically it's more 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.110
 easy to kill from afar 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.820
 the jump mergers do not have 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.260
 a lot of recoil in this game yes that 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.700
 it has a little damage and we will see that they have 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.200
 also increased the damage in some of 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.000
 them but the main reason for the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.670
 which was missing bullets was this there from 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.980
 sway that as I say has been reduced let's 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.260
 to those changes in the damage of weapons 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.000
 the first one is the 27 is a weapon 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.670
 that previously killed or has always killed 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.410
 four to five bullets 4 in its best range 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.209
 5 at its worst 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.030
 basically the change they have made is 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.830
 increase that range of 4 bullets a little bit 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.239
 to kill so he has something over 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.220
 utility but mostly a very change 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.570
 important is that we will need a bullet 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.220
 least to kill in the head in 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.320
 any distance that will be noticed much 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.090
 especially for people who are accurate 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.230
 with her whenever we give in the head 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.000
 we will kill a lot 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.739
 fast what we did so far what 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.159
 same with the type 25 have reduced it 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.290
 now the damage has increased in fact 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:27.489
 does on the head at any distance 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.110
 also jumps and 25 have reduced the 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.519
 dispersion from the hip is to say that 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.560
 now it's more accurate since the hip is 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.019
 a weapon with a lot of cadence that is not 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.670
 use in long distance shootings but 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.879
 up close so they 're trying 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.040
 improve the strength point of this weapon 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.190
 of type 25 the next one that has been seen 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.260
 is retouched is the scan another rifle 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.150
 assault that does not look too much is a 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.069
 assault rifle of a lot of damage they have 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.720
 also increased the damage it does in the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.250
 head so again one less bullet 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.870
 to kill in this case we would still be 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.730
 talking about even a weapon that he killed from 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.620
 a shot to the head of another the body in 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.290
 short distances so it could be 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.810
 quite interesting besides also you 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.379
 have reduced the dispersion from the 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.769
 hip the same with the law 25 we're going 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:15.069
 now with the swat 556 a gun of bursts 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.510
 that was not used was used lm 8 and I think 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.039
 that is going to start using this this 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.959
 swat because they have increased the 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.010
 penetration of the walls with which 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.770
 happens to be the rifle 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.640
 with the best penetration of all 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.410
 and they have also increased the number of 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.400
 bullets needed to kill from afar 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.500
 but they have reduced the delay there 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.360
 the difference between bursts like that 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.490
 that make a weapon more similar to the m 8 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160
 it's a three-burst weapon of no 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.990
 four that kills three in distances 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.340
 quite considerable we would be 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.680
 talking about about 15 meters to 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.930
 kill from a single rage 15 even up 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.450
 20 meters and now we can also 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.520
 shoot the bursts more often with what 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.190
 what will we see if you start using this 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.530
 swap 556 the next assault rifle 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.350
 retouched is the metal that I think is a 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.930
 thing that I needed and imminently and 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.390
 is to increase the range in which it kills 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.710
 three bullets is one of the few to rifles 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.780
 of assault that kills three bullets 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.130
 metal and they have increased a little bit that 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.410
 rank basically I think that it 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.030
 will get closer to the rms mc and the double pdv 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.590
 that are their rifles that kill three 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.420
 bullets up to 13 and 15 meters 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.920
 respectively quite ridiculous 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.260
 taking into account that the tar killed 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.940
 three bullets up to 8 meters like that 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.350
 that have increased that range will be a 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.650
 little bit more subtle 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.120
 of jump the next lmr have increased 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.490
 a little bit the damage is slightly so that 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.500
 when we shoot through walls 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.720
 let's say narrow not too 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.850
 consistent not very strong is the 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.260
 penetration does not reduce the damage so that 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.180
 we need too many bullets to kill 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.890
 so we can kill two bullets and 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.470
 we cross walls that are rather 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.860
 little thing they have also increased 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.620
 the 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.509
 the damage to the head over long distances 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.280
 only in this case to be able to kill 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.259
 from one shot to another's head to the body 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.289
 that has not happened either and the last 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:03.860
 You have retouched the fall or sw in 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.090
 this case is the only one that they have lowered and 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.770
 I think what I really needed was 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.080
 possibly the best possible assault with 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.150
 difference they have lowered him they have 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.740
 increased the recoil if we use it with 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.750
 shot selector in this case does not affect 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.409
 because the boat is not allowed 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.969
 although maybe now it could be reached 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.259
 to allow more ederson a speculation 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:24.110
 is taking into account that the fall now 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.699
 It is less useful with the shooting selector 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.520
 we will have to see to what extent it is less 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.779
 useful and have increased the dispersion 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.240
 from the hip in this case they have 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.219
 increased instead of decreasing the well 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.629
 which will be less useful from the hip 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.680
 there are people who killed two staves so 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.960
 only from the hip was quite 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.400
 ridiculous the last change that I believe 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.770
 that will not affect too much is 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.860
 that have increased the utility a little 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.840
 to the resource in the to the gun that is a 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.729
 shotgun actually short-range what 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.039
 have increased the range a little 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.839
 little power in medium range no 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.310
 I do not think it's a weapon too much 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.290
 open and much less I think so 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.470
 can be used so far 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.000
 he played it alone his high 45 good these 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.680
 are the balance changes that have been 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.050
 in the game I hope you enjoyed 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.300
 of the video and do not hesitate to try all 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.210
 these weapons all these retouched weapons 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.020
 because some could start to like you 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.020
 See you goodbye
