00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
around the circle's but the main point

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.859 
around the circle's but the main point
is<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.960> would<00:01:19.110> keep<00:01:19.290> my<00:01:19.320> body<00:01:19.909> straight<00:01:20.909> my<00:01:21.659> body

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
wouldn't turn or when twisted we just

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
wouldn't turn or when twisted we just
stay<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.439> baby<00:01:25.830> steps<00:01:25.950> all

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
stay like this now just baby steps all

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.929 
stay like this now just baby steps all
the<00:01:26.400> way<00:01:26.520> around<00:01:27.380> doing<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.729> helps<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the way around doing this helps you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
helps you expect the feet that are

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.499 
helps you expect the feet that are
coming<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> met<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> other<00:01:35.130> hand<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
coming so you met the other hand if you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.219 
coming so you met the other hand if you
do<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.750> long<00:01:36.990> enough<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.430> eventually

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
do this long enough it will eventually

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
do this long enough it will eventually
look<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.439> this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.050 

and<00:01:42.990> you'll<00:01:43.230> be<00:01:43.350> quicker<00:01:43.620> with<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.910> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and you'll be quicker with it and you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.240 
and you'll be quicker with it and you
can<00:01:45.240> roll<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.510> your<00:01:45.630> knees<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.800> can<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.040> back

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
can roll on your knees you can go back

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.270 
can roll on your knees you can go back
there<00:01:48.410> and<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.830> whatever<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.220> like

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
there and you can do whatever you like

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.970 
there and you can do whatever you like
so<00:01:51.060> that's<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.570> six<00:01:51.810> step<00:01:52.020> take<00:01:52.650> it<00:01:52.860> it's

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
so that's just a six step take it it's

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.930 
so that's just a six step take it it's
very<00:01:53.190> fundamental<00:01:55.400> knowing<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:56.490> steak<00:01:56.700> tip

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
very fundamental knowing the steak tip

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.630 
very fundamental knowing the steak tip
will<00:01:57.540> help<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:57.780> branch<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.230> and<00:01:58.530> learn<00:01:59.430> other

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
will help you branch out and learn other
