00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.310
 Good day dear friends 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.319
 maybe even in the evening because 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.260
 I write this regular podcast 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.610
 of course in the evening and something I have to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.380
 notice that I cleaned out with these 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.540
 podcasts are too many 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.310
 it became but the fact is that they are constantly 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.830
 practically there is something to tell you dear 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.490
 friends today specifically I would like to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.500
 say about the group in contact in general 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.570
 not always can i know your opinion no 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.910
 I can always find out what you want 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 if we are all friends we will be in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.530
 group there we can we can we 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.469
 we can arrange a vote 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.600
 to vote for this or that thing 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.640
 which I should add 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.469
 implement and something in this spirit is something 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.829
 change because in the comments 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.980
 let's say the same vote do 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.870
 impossible 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.690
 it's hard to know what people are interested in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.949
 that people will look in general so in 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.110
 the group is now in this 400 people 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
 is on full govnesche she 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.609
 really terrible she is ugly but 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.769
 it is and think friends with you we 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:09.119
 can it somehow have the wind blowing right 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.130
 whistles so miraculously somehow not 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 scary somehow miraculously we can 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.470
 and we will be able to ennoble them there 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.240
 talk talk see what 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.070
 new we can do what we can not 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.290
 Overall, I will be really very happy 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.000
 guys if you help me and join 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 this group also you can add 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.450
 me as a friend that would also be very 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.570
 cool there I do something sometimes too 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.060
 I'll probably still in this sense 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.820
 so friends are like that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 my car we laid out 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 honestly yes i agree i did 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.049
 made a lot of shoals but just me 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.450
 Now I will make excuses again, okay, but 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.600
 what can you do in general I have had it 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.310
 spontaneous recordings I think I sit at three o'clock 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.750
 Nights three o'clock in the morning I think damn necessary 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.399
 write down quickly ran recorded 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.009
 mounted dock sleep in the morning woke up 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.689
 laid out all machinima ready no friends 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.560
 Of course it was given to shoot everything with 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.540
 multiple takes 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.310
 I have dealt with this all once again 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.920
 much more serious will house 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.299
 you should get a lot better to connect 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.829
 a few more people I won't be yet 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.429
 say who is it so again not 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.370
 broke loose 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.230
 and many have asked this ali one of mine 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.750
 cool projects there is no project this at all 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.310
 not planned machinima but I kind of 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.959
 liked interesting really 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.519
 nice new experience but it is not 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.170
 planned to say it again spontaneously 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.569
 that's not what i wanted to do so 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.760
 friends don't worry it's just one 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.440
 of which chips I constantly try 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.420
 I love constantly trying myself in something 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.810
 new after all just sit still not 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.909
 interesting in general, here and so guys 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.640
 actually about the group I just wanted 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.620
 talk so far no events 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.909
 important wanted to talk about the group so 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.160
 that the guys join there will be 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.230
 appear vote in which we and 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.879
 we will decide what we should do 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.489
 which direction is worth moving on 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.890
 because it is not always clear that is what 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.170
 can say viewers want to see 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.599
 so it will be collaboration 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.280
 I think everyone will be from this well in general 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.750
 that 's all my friends wanted to say 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.760
 podcasts and will do the time from 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.190
 thanks for listening to me 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.299
 very grateful and perhaps up to the new 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.299
 meetings yet
