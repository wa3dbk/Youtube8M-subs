00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.100 
so we're at the odds right now hopefully
we<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.800> bump<00:04:34.800> ourselves<00:04:35.220> over<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.850> odds<00:04:36.110> with

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
we can bump ourselves over the odds with

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.110 
we can bump ourselves over the odds with
one<00:04:37.380> more<00:04:37.590> hollow<00:04:37.860> or<00:04:38.250> something<00:04:38.790> even<00:04:39.030> better

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
one more hollow or something even better

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.210 
one more hollow or something even better
than<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.390> hollow<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.590> we<00:04:40.710> have<00:04:40.800> scatterbug

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
than a hollow so we have scatterbug

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.350 
than a hollow so we have scatterbug
