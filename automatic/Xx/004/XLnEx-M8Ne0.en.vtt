00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.029
 fall in love with my last 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:11.440
 and yes because the last years but it is not 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.849
 so pure I also have witnesses that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.519
 TV channels are latores 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:20.340
 so in that sense he is the 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.340
 commercial director of america is true 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.300
 everyone saw how it started as clear 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.300
 I have witnesses besides I have 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.940
 celestine that attests to the dates that 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:46.210
 was Rodrigo aspects former producer of 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:56.199
 current infama legally intruders never 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:58.960
 I was married to my dad . I was 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.500
 from 2007 until we parted ways 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.500
 two years 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.200
 He is the father of my relationship with 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 panelist 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.360
 we do not know how he hit you because that day 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.360
 you travel to new york or you operate 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:48.850
 and the entire knowledge but the list 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:50.320
 of 2004 but it seems that he sees a luck 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.090
 of conspiracy as if we all 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.710
 we would agree to talk things 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.049
 that will disqualify him or what 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.670
 They compromised to insult 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.890
 ghosts where there are not 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.060
 first because it is not a corporation the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.979
 panel is not we are individuals 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.619
 two in different channels some 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.290
 we compete some of us are friends others 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.480
 we know each other's faces and it seems to me that 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.500
 those generalizations in all 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.500
 areas are inaccurate common 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.620
 director 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.950
 know yourself not only with the matter of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.950
 intruders 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.159
 over time 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:49.470
 they are like that 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.690
 and besides it's horrible these are all 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.850
 illiterate first that if we left 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.550
 it seems that there is talk of a deficit 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.910
 of the system in any case and a 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.650
 bill to pass to the state or to those 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.769
 should deal with these issues but 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.610
 we would not be victims and on the other hand there are 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.690
 ultra-qualified people who study not 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.690
 can you say said 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:42.610
 how did you become the queens of the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:46.170
 politics she studied at university 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.170
 you will not go either 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:03.550
 but I do not know how many five years a 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.550
 mastery in economics eseade 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.240
 I should give because if I have a 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.650
 mastery of economics and it was also 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.840
 professor of economic analysis and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.489
 financially five years if it was 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.960
 my friend from bank 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.960
 capitanich no 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.009
 of my history notes history 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.440
 contemporary what it cost me 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.449
 I returned the notes I needed to 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:40.789
 go to surrender and I have them confiscated in 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:42.560
 the office a very smart note that 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.690
 I did not share anything at that time and I still 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.300
 without sharing anything at the level let's say 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.389
 ideas and concepts but but I always 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.910
 its brilliance attracted attention 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.370
 classes was a teacher or in this body and 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.560
 those breasts or less 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.030
 maybe I had a little less but not 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.030
 more not much 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.710
 and it was what would be first and second year 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.720
 a materialist that you could study 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.300
 also here it happened to me that you feel that 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.060
 all types of 40 types you know 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.229
 that 38 are you are being seen by your 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.349
 lomo feels something but I do not have that 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.349
 perception 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:46.580
 I do not have that heavy because they do not have 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:48.830
 clear that all his life that beauty and 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.990
 that is a slap and it is that hard 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.810
 because time passes and because the 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:58.250
 cheeks 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:00.409
 they are no longer exhibited obviously that 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.560
 that face and another thing is to be an exponent 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.860
 very is dressed with women and should 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.659
 To be at the same time 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.509
 says he does not want to age any 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.719
 because you did not dedicate yourself to some program 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:16.569
 something like that 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:20.219
 panelist to talk cell phone so 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.219
 They called you and here they are telling me 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:27.030
 It is true that they are telling me here 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.030
 all games true 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.729
 journalism let's say earlier invent a 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.659
 show and also because later they come 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:43.569
 interest lies 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:45.659
 nothing more horrible but bible than 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:50.199
 denial 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:52.479
 yes what you have to apologize and 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.939
 dress the years that it has ever worn me 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.580
 it happened that you give yourself while you spend because 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.560
 although it is true is this they deny 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.169
 information is of type separation is 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.240
 Animal roman is another one of mind in equal 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:07.199
 even if it's true and it's unfriendly 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.199
 the forget your words 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.129
 lie 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:18.090
 for example the feudal had its moment 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:22.919
 the moments of boom or glory when 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.919
 put nervous muhlberger analyzed
