00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
escaped so make sure you don't hit

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.030 
escaped so make sure you don't hit
escape<00:01:58.820> rozilla<00:01:59.820> safe<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.530> we

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
escape rozilla safe so as you can see we

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
escape rozilla safe so as you can see we
have<00:02:02.070> doubled<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.579> items<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.750> I'm<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.229> to

works in 1.5 and it still works at one

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.490 
works in 1.5 and it still works at one
point<00:03:12.590> five<00:03:12.739> point<00:03:12.799> one<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:14.000> they<00:03:14.959> knew

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
point five point one that they knew

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.319 
point five point one that they knew
about<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.920> either<00:03:16.280> they<00:03:16.819> didn't<00:03:17.090> know<00:03:17.209> about

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
about it either they didn't know about

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.270 
about it either they didn't know about
the<00:03:17.600> glitch<00:03:17.810> or<00:03:18.019> they<00:03:18.530> knew<00:03:18.829> about<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.220> and

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
the glitch or they knew about it and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.879 
the glitch or they knew about it and
were<00:03:19.670> unable<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:20.030> patch<00:03:20.389> it<00:03:20.690> we<00:03:21.500> hope<00:03:21.859> that

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
were unable to patch it we hope that

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.250 
were unable to patch it we hope that
they<00:03:22.220> were<00:03:22.549> just<00:03:22.819> unable<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.420> patch<00:03:23.599> it<00:03:23.870> which

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
they were just unable to patch it which

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.280 
they were just unable to patch it which
means<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:25.010> could<00:03:25.160> work<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.209> any<00:03:26.389> future<00:03:26.750> update

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
means it could work in any future update

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.289 
means it could work in any future update
with<00:03:27.530> 1.5<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.480> some<00:03:29.480> way<00:03:29.769> because<00:03:30.769> then<00:03:31.400> it's

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
with 1.5 in some way because then it's

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.420 
with 1.5 in some way because then it's
obviously<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.930> serious<00:03:33.139> problem<00:03:33.590> but<00:03:33.859> if<00:03:33.980> they

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
obviously a serious problem but if they

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.370 
obviously a serious problem but if they
just<00:03:34.609> don't<00:03:34.819> know<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.269> there<00:03:35.329> then<00:03:36.200> it

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
just don't know that it's there then it

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.420 
just don't know that it's there then it
should<00:03:36.620> be<00:03:36.680> easy<00:03:36.769> from<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.220> patch

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
should be easy from the patch

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.690 
should be easy from the patch
unfortunately<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:39.049> just<00:03:39.680> hoping<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.040> they

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
unfortunately so just hoping that they

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.849 
unfortunately so just hoping that they
are<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.630> they<00:03:41.959> were<00:03:42.139> aware<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.650> glitch

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
are that they were aware of the glitch

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.000 
are that they were aware of the glitch
and<00:03:43.040> just<00:03:43.190> weren't<00:03:43.489> unable<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.209> patch<00:03:44.389> it<00:03:45.010> ok

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
and just weren't unable to patch it ok

fault you know to the ground then do the

glitch of double whatever you had in
your<00:04:41.930> chest<00:04:42.729> you<00:04:43.729> see<00:04:43.940> we<00:04:44.030> have<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.180> ton<00:04:44.389> of

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
your chest you see we have a ton of

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.360 
your chest you see we have a ton of
diamond<00:04:44.780> pickaxes<00:04:45.290> now<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.770> bunch<00:04:45.979> of<00:04:46.130> smaller

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
diamond pickaxes now a bunch of smaller

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.540 
diamond pickaxes now a bunch of smaller
as<00:04:46.520> much<00:04:46.729> done<00:04:47.030> in<00:04:47.150> blocks<00:04:47.590> it's<00:04:48.590> really

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
as much done in blocks it's really

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.909 
as much done in blocks it's really
really<00:04:50.150> really<00:04:50.300> sweet<00:04:50.690> which<00:04:51.110> probably<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
really really sweet which probably the

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.710 
really really sweet which probably the
best<00:04:52.100> glitch<00:04:52.340> we've<00:04:53.120> ever<00:04:53.330> had<00:04:53.510> for

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
best glitch we've ever had for

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.600 
best glitch we've ever had for
duplication<00:04:54.200> because<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.160> other<00:04:55.280> ones<00:04:55.490> are

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
duplication because the other ones are

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.740 
duplication because the other ones are
usually<00:04:56.240> limited<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.900> blocks<00:04:57.410> or<00:04:58.310> they<00:04:58.610> not<00:04:59.479> or

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
usually limited to blocks or they not or

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.420 
usually limited to blocks or they not or
they're<00:05:00.020> not<00:05:00.050> as<00:05:00.320> efficient<00:05:00.860> as<00:05:00.919> this<00:05:01.190> one

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
they're not as efficient as this one

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.520 
they're not as efficient as this one
this<00:05:01.669> is<00:05:01.729> by<00:05:02.180> far<00:05:02.389> the<00:05:02.450> most<00:05:02.630> efficient<00:05:03.139> one<00:05:03.470> of

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
this is by far the most efficient one of

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.879 
this is by far the most efficient one of
these<00:05:03.650> duplication<00:05:04.310> glitches<00:05:04.930> so<00:05:05.930> make<00:05:06.860> sure

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
these duplication glitches so make sure
