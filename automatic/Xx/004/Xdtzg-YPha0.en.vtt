00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Hello, thanks for watching my channel!

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.060
You might already know, but...

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.380
...I just came back from a trip to Barcelona

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.760
My first time in Europe for a while

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.180
And one of the differences to Japan especially stayed in my mind

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.320
Giving tips!

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.680
In most European countries...

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.300
...it is normal to give tips to waiters in restaurants or e.g. taxi drivers

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.140
Japanese travel guides always say how much percent is usual in the country you go

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.640
But I don't go by these numbers

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.240
I think a tip is a way to tell somebody about the quality of their service

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.180
Or also the taste of the food if it's a restaurant

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.140
So I choose the size of the tip case by case

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.000
To give a simple example

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.160
Let's say I eat Ramen for 5$

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:20.080
And it tasted awesome and the staff at the place was really friendly too

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.480
In that case it might happen that I pay 6$, so a 1$ tip at a price of 5$

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.400
In relation that might sound much, but I do that a lot

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.140
And if the service was really bad, it also happens I give no tip at all

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.500
That way the other side knows I was absolutely not happy with their service

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.120
But that's a really rare case

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.180
Japan is comfortable because it's not common to give tips

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.100
So you don't need to worry about how much you give and stuff

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.600
But I realized in Spain that service is really different depending on the person

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.360
Starts with the way they welcome you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:22.060
Some people always smile and explain stuff, others just do what's ultimately necessary

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.100
So it's nice to be able to honor the ones who really try to be nice

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.480
But how do you think about this in Japan?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.860
Do you think service in Japan would change if there were tips?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.920
Actually service in Japan is awesome

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.160
So there might be no need for tips at all?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.400
But how do you feel about that?

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.760
Have you ever had troubles related to giving tips?

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.860
E.g. worrying how much you should give?

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.440
Tell me your thoughts on that!

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.080
I never worked as a restaurant so I never was in the situation to get a tip

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:28.820
but if you have working experience in that field, tell me about your opinion regarding tips!

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.600
It's not a big cultural difference...

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.860
...but it's one thing that I noticed being back in Europe after a while

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.900
Now I need to go to work, have a nice weekend all of you!

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.980
Tune in again if you like!
