see there's it's just a regular cork and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.769 
see there's it's just a regular cork and
I<00:00:15.289> drew<00:00:16.609> each<00:00:17.609> letter<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> alphabet<00:00:18.240> on

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.560 
I drew each letter of the alphabet on
here<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.230> then<00:00:19.380> cut<00:00:19.619> away<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.939> parts<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
here and then cut away the parts that I

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.970 
here and then cut away the parts that I
didn't<00:00:22.500> want<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:23.039> order<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.420> know<00:00:24.980> make

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.950 
didn't want in order to you know make
this<00:00:26.250> raised<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.150> use<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> regular

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
this raised and use it as a regular

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
this raised and use it as a regular
stamp<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> thought<00:00:29.609> I'd<00:00:29.730> go<00:00:29.910> ahead<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:31.730> just

stamp so I thought I'd go ahead and just
make<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.210> I've<00:00:33.300> got<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> couple<00:00:33.690> extra<00:00:33.840> corks

wine - to do this project and this is

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.490 
wine - to do this project and this is
the<00:00:46.289> side<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.190> cork<00:00:47.750> where<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> corkscrew

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the side of the cork where the corkscrew

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.439 
the side of the cork where the corkscrew
went<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.579> we're<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> use<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> other

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
get into the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:39.900 
get into the
the<00:02:24.970> part<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.600> it

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.330 

and<00:02:40.090> yeah<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.140> one's<00:02:41.380> not<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.620> hard<00:02:42.100> because

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
and yeah this one's not so hard because

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.320 
and yeah this one's not so hard because
you<00:02:43.030> don't<00:02:43.180> have<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.690> do<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:46.180> know<00:02:46.300> I

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
you don't have to do it you know I

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.550 
you don't have to do it you know I
didn't<00:02:46.720> have<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.930> draw<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.170> on<00:02:47.260> here<00:02:47.500> backwards

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
didn't have to draw it on here backwards

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.960 
didn't have to draw it on here backwards
that's<00:02:50.560> probably<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.980> most<00:02:51.100> difficult<00:02:51.250> thing

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
that's probably the most difficult thing

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.340 
that's probably the most difficult thing
about<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.020> rest<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.980> know

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
about it the rest is just you know

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:05.760 
about it the rest is just you know
sitting<00:02:56.350> here<00:02:56.470> cutting<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:58.200> therapeutic

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.900 

onto<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:02.770> harder<00:05:03.190> surface<00:05:03.670> here<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:06.220> it's

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
onto a harder surface here and it's

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.250 
onto a harder surface here and it's
slowly<00:05:07.150> going<00:05:07.450> to<00:05:07.510> work<00:05:07.690> up<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.020> it's<00:05:08.110> going

slowly going to work up and it's going

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.720 
slowly going to work up and it's going
to<00:05:08.320> get<00:05:08.440> better<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:09.010> like<00:05:09.160> I<00:05:09.310> said<00:05:09.370> I<00:05:09.520> would

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
to get better and like I said I would

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.310 
to get better and like I said I would
fuss<00:05:10.000> with<00:05:10.210> this<00:05:10.330> more<00:05:10.600> and<00:05:10.750> probably<00:05:10.840> make<00:05:11.140> it

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
fuss with this more and probably make it

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.680 
fuss with this more and probably make it
little<00:05:11.620> point<00:05:11.890> here<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.640> know<00:05:12.760> down<00:05:13.120> here<00:05:13.150> and

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
little point here you know down here and

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.530 
little point here you know down here and
stuff<00:05:13.930> but<00:05:14.500> as<00:05:14.650> you<00:05:14.920> build<00:05:15.220> up<00:05:15.610> you<00:05:16.270> know<00:05:16.390> as

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
stuff but as you build up you know as

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:24.230 
stuff but as you build up you know as
you<00:05:18.000> use<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.270> stamp<00:05:19.570> more<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:22.420> image<00:05:22.810> will

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
you use the stamp more the image will

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.020 
you use the stamp more the image will
stamp<00:05:25.240> better<00:05:25.890> so<00:05:26.890> there's<00:05:27.250> like<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.630> three<00:05:28.630> and

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
stamp better so there's like a three and

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
to have graininess and lines but it's

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.770 
to have graininess and lines but it's
really<00:05:54.220> cool<00:05:54.550> it<00:05:54.820> really<00:05:55.060> gives<00:05:55.270> it's<00:05:55.450> great
