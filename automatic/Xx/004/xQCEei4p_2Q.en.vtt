you<00:05:52.110> start<00:05:52.410> with<00:05:52.530> more<00:05:52.860> or<00:05:53.190> if<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.400> honey

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
you start with more or if the honey

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.580 
you start with more or if the honey
badger<00:05:53.880> it<00:05:54.240> really<00:05:54.540> does<00:05:54.810> just<00:05:55.050> kill<00:05:55.320> faster

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
but honey badger I could probably throw

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.610
