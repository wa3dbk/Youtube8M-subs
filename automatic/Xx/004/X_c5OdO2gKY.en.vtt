00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 draw me a bike to draw a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:14.389
 bike is very easy starts first 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.389
 by signs to a triangle upside down 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.050
 on the left tip of your triangle 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.940
 draw a small rectangle draws a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.829
 line above the top of the triangle you 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.719
 start to see your bike dial 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.980
 form double by strokes the two 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.420
 other sides of your triangle thanks a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.620
 circle and signs of in a kind 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.620
 of l upside down 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.079
 draws under the circle a rectangle 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.970
 horizontal you now have to 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.519
 pedals now draws another 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:12.300
 double triangle also by lines 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.550
 inside the eyelashes a circle of the 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.320
 same size as that of the pedal 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.170
 should avoid the contours of your 2nd 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.210
 triangle you can now drawn 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.070
 the front of your bike by drawing a bar 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 who starts from the first act angles and who 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.899
 ends with the left draws 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.899
 now a circle around the bar 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.310
 from the front of your bike 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 draw a big circle 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.580
 and still a bigger one around for 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.580
 make the wheels of your bike 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.590
 it's the same around the little one 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.069
 right circle to draw the second 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.069
 bike wheel 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.570
 now draw a small rectangle to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.570
 right to do the saddle support 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.100
 draw to that of your bike by forming 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:28.610
 an elongated triangle it is necessary that the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.170
 form be passed to rolls says draws 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 above the bar before falling 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:40.460
 water a small square of the trace the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:42.140
 handlebars of his bike shaped c draws 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.880
 now the spokes of your bike in 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.090
 each of the two wheels by making 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.090
 features 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.210
 color fell local on the drawing or 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.210
 with even brighter colors
