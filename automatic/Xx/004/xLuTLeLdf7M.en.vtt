00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and yes mercury completes its retrograde

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.830 
and yes mercury completes its retrograde
cycle<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:28.019> phase<00:00:28.289> today<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.609> apparently<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
cycle or phase today it apparently it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.319 
cycle or phase today it apparently it
looks<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.560> stops<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.099> his<00:00:32.130> tracks<00:00:32.329> ready

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
looks like it stops in his tracks ready

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.410 
looks like it stops in his tracks ready
to<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.690> forward<00:00:34.200> again<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.739> Scorpio<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.700> yes

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
to go forward again in Scorpio and yes

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
to go forward again in Scorpio and yes
this<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> time<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.260> us<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> begin<00:00:37.890> thinking

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this is a time for us to begin thinking

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.819 
this is a time for us to begin thinking
about<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.420> we've<00:00:39.570> been<00:00:39.719> holding<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.530> what

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
about what we've been holding on to what

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
about what we've been holding on to what
we've<00:00:40.860> been<00:00:41.160> waiting<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.059> moving<00:00:42.450> ahead

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
we've been waiting for and moving ahead

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200 
we've been waiting for and moving ahead
but<00:00:43.320> remember<00:00:43.770> mercury<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.370> forming<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> trying

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
but remember mercury is forming a trying

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.139 
but remember mercury is forming a trying
with<00:00:45.600> Neptune<00:00:46.260> today<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.010> actually<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.579> exact

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
with Neptune today it actually was exact

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.569 
with Neptune today it actually was exact
list<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:48.930> early<00:00:49.440> early<00:00:49.469> let<00:00:50.010> last<00:00:50.250> night

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
list you know early early let last night

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.959 
list you know early early let last night
but<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.960> still<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.129> confuses<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
but it's still there and it confuses the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
but it's still there and it confuses the
issue<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> think<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.170> agree<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.980> think

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
issue of it I think I agree and I think

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
issue of it I think I agree and I think
would<00:00:56.340> also<00:00:56.520> confuses<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.170> we

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
would also confuses it is that when we

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
would also confuses it is that when we
think<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.649> mercury<00:00:59.219> normally<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
think of mercury normally we think of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.319 
think of mercury normally we think of
the<00:01:00.449> intellect<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:02.070> moon<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.850> much<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the intellect the moon for much of the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
the intellect the moon for much of the
day<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.809> Aquarius<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.589> air<00:01:04.860> sign<00:01:05.189> which<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
day is in Aquarius an air sign which is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.130 
day is in Aquarius an air sign which is
also<00:01:06.470> intellectual<00:01:07.470> however<00:01:08.630> mercury<00:01:09.630> itself

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
also intellectual however mercury itself

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.410 
also intellectual however mercury itself
is<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.470> Scorpio<00:01:10.979> will<00:01:11.159> wet<00:01:11.400> water<00:01:11.790> sign<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
is in Scorpio will wet water sign of

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.780 
is in Scorpio will wet water sign of
feeling<00:01:12.930> mercurius<00:01:13.619> hooking<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:14.610> with

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
feeling mercurius hooking up with

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.240 
feeling mercurius hooking up with
Neptune<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.570> pointed<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.049> later<00:01:16.890> tonight

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
Neptune as you pointed out later tonight

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
Neptune as you pointed out later tonight
the<00:01:17.610> moon<00:01:17.759> moves<00:01:18.090> into<00:01:18.390> Neptune's<00:01:18.930> emotional

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the moon moves into Neptune's emotional

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
the moon moves into Neptune's emotional
sensitive<00:01:20.130> sign<00:01:20.400> Pisces<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.720> an

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
sensitive sign Pisces so this an

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960 
sensitive sign Pisces so this an
interesting<00:01:22.380> sort<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> back<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> forth<00:01:23.369> or

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
interesting sort of back and forth or

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.960 
interesting sort of back and forth or
overlapping<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:25.049> logic<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.189> emotion<00:01:26.670> today

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
overlapping of logic and emotion today

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.080 
overlapping of logic and emotion today
yeah<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> actually<00:01:27.680> between<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.130> mercury<00:01:29.790> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
yeah and actually between the mercury in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
yeah and actually between the mercury in
watery<00:01:30.840> Scorpio<00:01:31.530> we<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.860> saturn<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
watery Scorpio we have saturn and the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.450 
watery Scorpio we have saturn and the
Sun<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.820> Scorpio<00:01:33.479> moons<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.770> into<00:01:35.070> Pisces

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
Sun and Scorpio moons going into Pisces

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.399 
Sun and Scorpio moons going into Pisces
as<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> said<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.299> Neptune<00:01:36.750> their<00:01:36.990> watery

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
as you said with Neptune their watery

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.510 
as you said with Neptune their watery
Pisces<00:01:37.979> even<00:01:38.579> Jupiter's<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.420> watery<00:01:39.750> cancer

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
Pisces even Jupiter's and watery cancer

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.819 
Pisces even Jupiter's and watery cancer
it's<00:01:41.520> very<00:01:42.110> emotionally<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.649> an

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it's very emotionally it's an

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.490 
it's very emotionally it's an
emotionally<00:01:44.610> rich<00:01:44.850> environment<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.110> think

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
emotionally rich environment to think

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.780 
emotionally rich environment to think
that<00:01:46.829> we're<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.310> intellectual

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
that we're going to have intellectual

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.300 
that we're going to have intellectual
clarity<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.530> part<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> key

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
clarity and so I think part of the key

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.999 
clarity and so I think part of the key
today<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.630> remember<00:01:51.869> even<00:01:52.500> though<00:01:52.680> our

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
today is to remember even though our

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.620 
today is to remember even though our
minds<00:01:53.520> might<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.939> spinning<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.600> thoughts

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
minds might be spinning with thoughts

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.170 
minds might be spinning with thoughts
the<00:01:55.500> fact<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.009> they're<00:01:56.369> being<00:01:56.490> informed

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the fact is that they're being informed

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.660 
the fact is that they're being informed
by<00:01:57.299> cymatics<00:01:57.990> by<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.439> we're<00:01:58.590> feeling<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.189> our

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
by cymatics by what we're feeling in our

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
by cymatics by what we're feeling in our
