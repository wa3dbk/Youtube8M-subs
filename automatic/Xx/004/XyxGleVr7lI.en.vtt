00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.359 
Zenon with a Z and I have a fly gun
which<00:00:24.840> would<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.289> been<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.070> bad<00:00:26.310> but

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
which would have been that bad but

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.820 
which would have been that bad but
unfortunately<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.570> my<00:00:27.689> Mixit<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.800> I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
unfortunately that was my Mixit one so I

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.009 
unfortunately that was my Mixit one so I
just<00:00:29.189> switch<00:00:29.490> immediately<00:00:29.760> fearing<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.750> ice

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
just switch immediately fearing the ice

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.840 
just switch immediately fearing the ice
beam<00:00:31.320> ends<00:00:31.740> up<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> dark<00:00:32.579> pulse

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
beam ends up going for a dark pulse

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.750 
beam ends up going for a dark pulse
which<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.630> random<00:00:33.809> arm<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:35.160> guess<00:00:35.520> he

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
which is kind of random arm I guess he

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
which is kind of random arm I guess he
was<00:00:35.940> hoping<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.600> I'd<00:00:36.690> switch<00:00:36.930> into<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> ghost

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
was hoping that I'd switch into a ghost

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.790 
was hoping that I'd switch into a ghost
maybe<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.250> something<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.230> anyway<00:00:40.230> he

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
maybe or something like that anyway he

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560 
maybe or something like that anyway he
goes<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> nasty<00:00:41.550> plot<00:00:41.730> now<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.210> go<00:00:42.360> for

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
goes for the nasty plot now as I go for

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.139 
goes for the nasty plot now as I go for
a<00:00:42.600> wish<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.920> thinking<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.879> i<00:00:45.090> see

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
a wish and I'm thinking now that i see

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.760 
a wish and I'm thinking now that i see
that<00:00:45.480> nasty<00:00:45.840> plot<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.200> thinking<00:00:46.500> he's<00:00:46.590> going

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
that nasty plot I'm thinking he's going

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.680 
that nasty plot I'm thinking he's going
to<00:00:46.860> go<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.250> triac<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.300> stab

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
to go for the triac because I would stab

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.200 
to go for the triac because I would stab
so<00:00:49.170> make<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.190> bad<00:00:50.399> /<00:00:50.730> prediction

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
so make a kind of a bad / prediction

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.700 
so make a kind of a bad / prediction
they're<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.750> into<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> gengar<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.559> was

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
they're going into the gengar I was

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.049 
they're going into the gengar I was
hoping<00:00:52.949> I'd<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.190> able<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.370> switch<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.910> be

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
hoping I'd be able to switch and be

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.270 
hoping I'd be able to switch and be
immune<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> take<00:00:54.780> him<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.020> Focus<00:00:55.680> Blast<00:00:55.710> being

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
immune to take him out Focus Blast being

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.970 
immune to take him out Focus Blast being
faster<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.420> blew<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.140> my<00:00:58.289> face<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.829> that

switched would have taken anything that
he<00:01:13.830> switched<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.420> pretty<00:01:15.420> goddamn<00:01:15.930> hard

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

he switched into pretty goddamn hard
goes<00:01:16.799> into<00:01:17.100> gara<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.729> very<00:01:18.150> good<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.479> him<00:01:18.570> he

has a very good check for my infernape
gonna<00:01:20.790> switch<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> my<00:01:21.299> rachi<00:01:21.600> um<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
gonna switch to my rachi um really I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
gonna switch to my rachi um really I
guess<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.580> main<00:01:23.790> thing<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.479> actually

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
guess the main thing that I can actually

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.770 
guess the main thing that I can actually
do<00:01:25.290> damage<00:01:25.830> against<00:01:26.189> us<00:01:26.310> Gareth<00:01:26.600> he's<00:01:27.600> going

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
do damage against us Gareth he's going

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.030 
do damage against us Gareth he's going
to<00:01:27.840> probably<00:01:28.200> think<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.619> I'm<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> call

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
to probably think that I'm a call

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.740 
to probably think that I'm a call
minding<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.090> kind<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.479> weird

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
minding one but this is kind of a weird

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
minding one but this is kind of a weird
set<00:01:31.020> actually<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> cosmic<00:01:32.400> power<00:01:32.880> one

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
set actually it is a cosmic power one

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880 
set actually it is a cosmic power one
with<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> charge<00:01:33.840> beam<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.470> boost<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
with the charge beam to boost the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.130 
with the charge beam to boost the
special<00:01:35.280> attack<00:01:35.780> don't<00:01:36.780> think<00:01:36.990> I've<00:01:37.110> ever

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
special attack don't think I've ever

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289 
special attack don't think I've ever
really<00:01:37.530> used<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> before<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.520> too<00:01:38.880> big<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
really used it before not too big of a

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:00.290 
however being the jolly nature I believe
you<00:04:58.620> need<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.009> to<00:04:59.340> outspeed<00:04:59.729> things<00:05:00.060> like

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
you need that to outspeed things like

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.709 
you need that to outspeed things like
jolteon<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.259> other<00:05:01.650> crap<00:05:02.490> whatever<00:05:02.969> it's

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
jolteon and other crap whatever it's

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.379 
jolteon and other crap whatever it's
kind<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:03.930> an<00:05:04.080> old<00:05:04.229> set<00:05:04.819> anyway<00:05:05.819> go<00:05:06.210> for<00:05:06.360> the

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
kind of an old set anyway go for the

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.029 
kind of an old set anyway go for the
u-turn<00:05:06.659> there<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.139> i<00:05:07.169> did<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.409> damaged<00:05:07.830> calc

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
u-turn there and i did a damaged calc

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.950 
u-turn there and i did a damaged calc
and<00:05:08.279> I<00:05:08.340> was<00:05:08.550> positive<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.389> it<00:05:09.629> would<00:05:09.750> take

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
and I was positive that it would take

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.320 
and I was positive that it would take
him<00:05:10.169> out<00:05:10.349> on<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:11.219> that's<00:05:11.490> when<00:05:11.699> I<00:05:11.729> realized

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
him out on and that's when I realized

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.490 
him out on and that's when I realized
that's<00:05:12.569> actually<00:05:13.050> my<00:05:13.259> jolly<00:05:13.770> scarfed<00:05:14.580> on

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
that's actually my jolly scarfed on

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.950 
that's actually my jolly scarfed on
scizor<00:05:16.500> so<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:18.029> kind<00:05:18.300> of<00:05:18.360> sucked<00:05:18.599> again<00:05:18.779> I

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
scizor so it kind of sucked again I

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.809 
scizor so it kind of sucked again I
would<00:05:19.529> ended<00:05:19.860> up<00:05:19.979> once<00:05:20.189> it<00:05:20.339> didn't<00:05:20.580> take<00:05:20.729> him

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
would ended up once it didn't take him

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.279 
would ended up once it didn't take him
out<00:05:20.939> going<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.449> ape<00:05:21.599> hoping<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.259> a

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
out going to the ape hoping for a

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.839 
out going to the ape hoping for a
fire-type<00:05:22.710> move<00:05:23.009> but<00:05:23.250> I'm<00:05:23.339> seeing<00:05:23.580> now<00:05:23.789> he

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
fire-type move but I'm seeing now he

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.839 
fire-type move but I'm seeing now he
probably<00:05:24.419> doesn't<00:05:25.259> have<00:05:25.379> one<00:05:25.710> being<00:05:26.430> if<00:05:26.639> he<00:05:26.759> is

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
probably doesn't have one being if he is

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.700 
probably doesn't have one being if he is
a<00:05:26.879> standard<00:05:27.419> DD<00:05:27.749> set<00:05:27.960> he<00:05:28.139> can<00:05:28.289> never<00:05:28.349> be<00:05:28.560> too

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
a standard DD set he can never be too

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.739 
a standard DD set he can never be too
careful<00:05:28.889> so<00:05:29.639> anyway<00:05:29.909> now<00:05:30.089> that<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.360> know<00:05:30.419> I<00:05:30.569> have
