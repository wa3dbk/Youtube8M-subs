chamber which not to get too technical

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.699 
chamber which not to get too technical
basically<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:59.509> glass<00:01:59.750> is<00:02:00.050> inside<00:02:00.530> the

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
basically the glass is inside the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.370 
basically the glass is inside the
chamber<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.459> has<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.330> chemical<00:02:02.539> reaction

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
chamber and it has the chemical reaction

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.160 
chamber and it has the chemical reaction
with<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.619> code

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
with the code

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.770 
with the code
in<00:02:04.290> inside<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.310> chamber<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.119> happens<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
in inside the chamber and it happens to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.930 
in inside the chamber and it happens to
all<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.080> glass<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.619> all<00:02:08.069> sides<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> glass

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
all the glass so all sides of the glass

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.790 
all the glass so all sides of the glass
recovered<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:11.580> glass<00:02:12.150> coating<00:02:12.720> itself<00:02:12.930> what

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
recovered the glass coating itself what

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.760 
recovered the glass coating itself what
it<00:02:13.950> does<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.580> three<00:02:15.000> major<00:02:15.450> things<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:16.530> it

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
it does is three major things one it

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.280 
it does is three major things one it
protects<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> glass<00:02:17.970> both<00:02:18.420> through<00:02:18.810> impact

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
protects the glass both through impact

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.510 
protects the glass both through impact
resistance<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:21.230> also<00:02:22.230> protects<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.190> from<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
resistance and also protects it from the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.290 
resistance and also protects it from the
elements<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:25.080> second<00:02:25.470> thing<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.860> does<00:02:26.069> is

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
elements the second thing it does is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.750 
elements the second thing it does is
well<00:02:27.500> naturally<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.980> think<00:02:29.220> glass<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
well naturally we think glass is a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.000 
well naturally we think glass is a
smooth<00:02:30.120> product<00:02:30.660> when<00:02:31.019> it's<00:02:31.200> viewed<00:02:31.500> actually

smooth product when it's viewed actually
microscopically<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.030> isn't<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.900> has<00:02:34.200> peaks

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
microscopically it isn't it has peaks

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.449 
microscopically it isn't it has peaks

becomes<00:02:45.120> less<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.480> less<00:02:45.720> clear<00:02:46.350> and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
becomes less and less clear and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.650 
becomes less and less clear and
sometimes<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.130> can't<00:02:47.370> clean<00:02:47.670> even<00:02:48.030> when<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
sometimes you can't clean even when you

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.250 
sometimes you can't clean even when you
use<00:02:48.900> very<00:02:49.170> harsh<00:02:49.470> chemicals<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:51.780> coating

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
use very harsh chemicals this coating

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.860 
use very harsh chemicals this coating
makes<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.340> super<00:02:53.760> smooth<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.360> covers<00:02:54.750> all

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
makes it super smooth it covers all

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.270 
makes it super smooth it covers all
these<00:02:55.110> peeps<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.180> values<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.630> makes<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.110> a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
these peeps and values and it makes it a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.720 
these peeps and values and it makes it a
close<00:02:59.280> sort<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.120> smooth<00:03:00.569> surface<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:02.549> also

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
close sort of smooth surface it also

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.350 
close sort of smooth surface it also
makes<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.360> water-repellent<00:03:03.900> surface<00:03:04.769> and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
makes it a water-repellent surface and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.580 
makes it a water-repellent surface and
when<00:03:06.360> water<00:03:06.660> comes<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.410> contact<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.579> it

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
when water comes in contact with it it

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.970 
when water comes in contact with it it
grows<00:03:10.590> all<00:03:11.070> balls<00:03:11.940> up<00:03:12.299> as<00:03:12.540> such<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.140> wants<00:03:13.829> to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
grows all balls up as such and wants to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.430 
grows all balls up as such and wants to
roll<00:03:14.190> away<00:03:14.370> from<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.000> glass<00:03:15.209> that's<00:03:16.140> why<00:03:16.410> we

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
roll away from the glass that's why we

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.370 
roll away from the glass that's why we
call<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:16.920> self<00:03:17.340> clean<00:03:17.640> there's<00:03:18.000> no<00:03:18.120> real<00:03:18.380> glass

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
call it self clean there's no real glass

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.680 
call it self clean there's no real glass
that<00:03:19.650> cleans<00:03:20.010> itself<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:21.480> when<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:22.260> arrive<00:03:22.650> at

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
that cleans itself but when we arrive at

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.090 
that cleans itself but when we arrive at
situations<00:03:24.690> where<00:03:24.900> rain<00:03:25.200> falls<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.920> it

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
situations where rain falls on it it

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.120 
situations where rain falls on it it
goes<00:03:26.310> away<00:03:26.519> quickly<00:03:26.970> from<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.650> why<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:28.890> it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
goes away quickly from it so why is it

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.490 
goes away quickly from it so why is it
important<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.910> reduce<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.630> kingdom<00:03:31.019> cycle

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
important to reduce the kingdom cycle

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.390 
important to reduce the kingdom cycle
other<00:03:31.709> than<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.130> obvious<00:03:34.100> burden<00:03:35.100> of<00:03:35.250> having

other than the obvious burden of having
to<00:03:35.609> clean<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.269> much<00:03:36.829> cleaning<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.190> usually

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
to clean so much cleaning is usually

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.819 
to clean so much cleaning is usually
done<00:03:38.880> especially<00:03:39.150> glass<00:03:39.720> using<00:03:40.140> chemicals

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
done especially glass using chemicals

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.069 
done especially glass using chemicals
these<00:03:41.100> chemicals<00:03:41.670> obviously<00:03:42.180> contaminate

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
these chemicals obviously contaminate

cleaning is required all that's needed

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.370
