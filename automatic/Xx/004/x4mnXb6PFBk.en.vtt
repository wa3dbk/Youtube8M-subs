00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.120
 to all that so welcome once more 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.709
 to the channel today I bring you the staple by 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.019
 summarizing readings for the month of December 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.789
 with josh mention in the serial of the month of 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.080
 December did not plan to do many 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.119
 readings during the last month of the year 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.500
 because he will be tremendously busy 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.460
 he believed that the recount of readings that 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.949
 had done during the month of December 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.080
 it was going to be quite shameful shameful 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.880
 but it really has not been so bad 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.320
 December there are a total of nine 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.579
 books that have been normal these 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.960
 first readings that I did during the 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.120
 December although in moments 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.710
 different were volume number 5 and the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.330
 Volume 6 of the cinema hall 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.160
 written by this pair and laurence if 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.540
 I'm not mistaken they are dawn house and 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.800
 all about the award-winning love of the 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.450
 feeling that this saga is being 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.330
 doing quite long since I can not 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.680
 believe how many cousins ​​brothers and friends 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.780
 of the Cistercian family are appearing 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.460
 in the saga because I always say this is going to 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.380
 be the last one though I think there's 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.690
 a lot of books about this saga and 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.610
 although there are 12 13 14 volumes I'm going to 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.290
 read all so I 'm currently 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.030
 reading the tome number 7 that is all 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.500
 about passion or something like that is 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.689
 quite liking and as always the saga 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.160
 of the cisterns is highly recommended if 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.140
 like the romantic romantic novel 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.549
 you can always give one 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.259
 the next book I read was jane eyre 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.850
 in English version but this is where 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.560
 I'm cheating this month because 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.000
 is an oxford version adapted by 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.439
 levels the book by jane eyre adapted 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.240
 I rated him with three stars on 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.710
 five was quite afraid to read the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.210
 story of jane eyre because he felt that 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.979
 I was going to compare him at all times with the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.149
 history of pride and prejudice of jane 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.829
 austen of gender history has 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.719
 seemed pretty pretty although very 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.459
 Tragic I know if the way 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.619
 that oxford has summarized the story or if 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.539
 really the full story of jane 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.829
 eyre is this tragic and this does not want 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.229
 say not to read the story 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.549
 whole in Spanish I want to tell you that 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.319
 one of the objectives that I have during 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.750
 this year 2015 will be read history 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.890
 de jane eyre complete and in Spanish it 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.659
 that in English I'm not going to get 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.700
 least I will do it in Spanish because I want 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.289
 see really if it 's as good as everything 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.030
 the world is saying the following 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.500
 book that I read was the fallen angel the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.030
 first volume of the hunters' guild 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.229
 written by daily shine 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.239
 this book I rated it with three 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.649
 stars over five had known the 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.360
 How to write this author thanks 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.679
 to the saga of bear and the shifting me 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.149
 really liked the kind of novel that 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.280
 created from the whole supernatural world that 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.539
 surrounds the story of romantic but 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.950
 I also wanted to know the history of 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.450
 the fallen angels because you already know that 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.579
 he sat devotion for this kind of 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.120
 mythological characters so I had to 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.709
 start 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.090
 the guild of the hunters although the 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.440
 I really liked the story 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.299
 great part because of the personality of the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.640
 main character I think he missed 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.080
 something spark some emotion has 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.700
 action but not as much as I expected 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.379
 he has romance although not as much as me 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.180
 I hope I think he needs a little bit of 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.440
 everything to be perfect but that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.970
 It does not mean that I will not continue 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.739
 with this saga the next reading of the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.209
 month was moving some of hopes 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.440
 I wanted to read this story because I had 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.659
 seen the trailer of adaptation 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.709
 cinematic through youtube and the 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.360
 really struck me quite the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.890
 history although the novelty is written 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.780
 within the youth landscape that what 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.190
 has a great social criticism that counts 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.959
 a quite heartbreaking story and 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.910
 hard if we see it from a point of view 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.530
 of social analysis and leaving it to a 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.349
 side what is the social criticism highlights 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.940
 friendship is given by courage 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.170
 survival the sacrifice has a 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.700
 a lot of values ​​that they have done 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.260
 that this story is quite special 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.120
 finally during the month of December I 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.590
 I dared with I learned the second part of 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.450
 guild of the magicians written by trudy 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.069
 canavan this book scores with four 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.540
 stars about 5 something that has called me 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.370
 powerfully the attention of this 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.870
 second volume of the trilogy is that it has 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.459
 including the issue of bullying that has 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.480
 pretty hard and painful result of 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.000
 read the fact that the protagonist 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.650
 will suffer harassment from the first moment in 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.480
 the one who ascends within what is the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.170
 guild of the magicians until the last 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.790
 moment 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.410
 also that has partly made him grow 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.690
 as a person and has made him become 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.370
 in what will be from now on 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.440
 I liked it enough to see how little to 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.450
 little are coming together the plots to give 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.060
 place to what I already read in the second 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.590
 trilogy of this author who is still 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.060
 like I was missing a step very very 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.440
 great that I hope it's done in the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.360
 third story because there are still 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.770
 pieces that do not fit me that I know that 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.630
 they have to happen but not yet 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.459
 have happened we arrived without any doubt to 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.019
 one of the worst readings he made 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.880
 during the month of December I want 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.040
 talk about making a thousand pieces of anna 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.480
 all this the second part of the saga of 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.250
 books I wrote the author 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.989
 I started reading the first volume as I already 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.580
 I said in europe of the previous month because 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.380
 I was quite impressed by the whole 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.330
 boom I was having a quad theme 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.739
 of advertising this author that the first 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.480
 half of the first novel called me 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.860
 much attention and I thought it was that 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.110
 tug-of-war typical of two 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.640
 university students that to give rise to a 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.049
 beautiful love story I stayed 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.730
 quite disappointed with the rest of the 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.010
 first tome and I do not want to say anything of 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.120
 how I feel after reading the second volume 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.549
 I really feel pretty 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.109
 disappointed and angry that this guy 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.310
 of novels that is a relationship 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.770
 very little healthy among teenagers 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.790
 is getting a very boom and also 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.500
 I found out what they are going to do 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.350
 the film adaptation of the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.490
 first novel which leaves me quite 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.140
 I think this novel is not a good one 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.270
 example of a healthy relationship that should 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.650
 occur between two young people I think plasma 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.080
 a character too possessive 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.580
 manipulator controller and that really 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.530
 It has the whole profile of being a 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.570
 potential abuser if he is not going to 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.680
 be within a couple of tomes really 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.510
 is the novel that would have worked 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.070
 very much I can not describe exactly 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.480
 how I felt when I finished reading 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.160
 this second novel I can not believe 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.890
 that the author could take to such 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.300
 extreme a relationship so so harmful and 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.080
 I will confirm that I will not continue 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.160
 with this saga 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.600
 obviously how everything is going to be 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.700
 opinions for and against what 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.320
 I just said but without any doubt it is 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.210
 my opinion the penultimate novel of this 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.130
 dad ride in the dark the second 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.660
 part of the trilogy of marian curl and not 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.640
 I remember exactly in what month I read the 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.170
 first part of this trilogy but I 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.670
 The book attracted a lot of attention 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.380
 truth is that I wanted to recognize how 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.240
 I was following the story this book what point 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.440
 of against stars over 5 and although I 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.810
 like history I think they are followed 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.160
 missing ingredients or pages maybe 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.930
 I think it's a pack but it's missing 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.970
 time is missing pages to be able 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.560
 devote more time to the story I'm going 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.030
 to confirm that read in part three 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.950
 that if I'm not mistaken it's called the key 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.190
 during the next month or during the month 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.840
 February why 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.070
 how to end this story once and for all 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.810
 the last book I read during the month 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.770
 December was khyber or the giver of 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.850
 memories 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.440
 this book the point that with three 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.120
 stars over five I want to tell you that 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.320
 It was a small disappointment they wanted in 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.550
 this book because willy had me 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.230
 commented that it had been a great 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.030
 reading everyone talked about him and 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.440
 see that it had been a very good read 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.240
 he told me that the world he had created 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.860
 the author was very good that was original 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.000
 and that it was worthwhile to read this 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.650
 book although I will not deny that I 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.480
 the world seemed quite original 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.310
 raises the author I missed many 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.570
 pages to develop the story the 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.220
 photo update is very good 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.560
 characters are fine but in the end 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.000
 it stayed very very short is like all 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.950
 the novel I develop it in a way 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.960
 quite intense me and yet I 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.460
 accounts the end in two pages I 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.870
 many pages were missing for 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.910
 develop the end I think that that 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.160
 history would have been very very good if 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.480
 would have been told in more pages dark 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.860
 well this has been the summary of the 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.940
 nine readings that I did during the month 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.190
