00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
basically the way this works is if you

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.639 
basically the way this works is if you
have<00:00:04.370> your<00:00:05.300> focal<00:00:05.809> laundry<00:00:06.139> in<00:00:06.319> the<00:00:06.470> middle

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
have your focal laundry in the middle

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
to build a dish around that so typically

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.040 
to build a dish around that so typically
how<00:00:16.699> I<00:00:16.789> start<00:00:17.119> is<00:00:17.240> I'll<00:00:17.359> say<00:00:17.539> the<00:00:17.659> first<00:00:17.869> thing

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
how I start is I'll say the first thing

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.679 
how I start is I'll say the first thing
that<00:00:18.079> comes<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.499> mind<00:00:18.939> I'll<00:00:19.939> say<00:00:20.269> something

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
that comes to mind I'll say something

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.769 
that comes to mind I'll say something
like<00:00:20.839> bacon<00:00:22.539> right

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779

I hope bacon or any type of pork product

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:35.020 
I hope bacon or any type of pork product
pancetta<00:00:30.669> ham<00:00:32.230> they<00:00:33.230> all<00:00:33.440> go<00:00:33.820> with<00:00:34.820> white

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
pancetta ham they all go with white

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.229 
pancetta ham they all go with white
beans<00:00:35.239> right<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:37.070> then<00:00:37.219> I'll<00:00:37.370> go<00:00:37.550> okay<00:00:37.910> well

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
beans right so then I'll go okay well

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.619 
beans right so then I'll go okay well
what<00:00:38.359> goes<00:00:38.510> with<00:00:38.690> bacon<00:00:39.940> that<00:00:40.940> also<00:00:41.149> goes<00:00:41.449> with

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
what goes with bacon that also goes with

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.420 
what goes with bacon that also goes with
white<00:00:41.809> beans<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:43.190> maybe<00:00:43.399> I'll<00:00:43.550> say<00:00:43.760> Apple

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.030 

so<00:00:49.000> apple<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.600> peridot<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:50.080> bacon<00:00:50.530> they<00:00:50.770> also

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
so apple and peridot is bacon they also

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.790 
so apple and peridot is bacon they also
goes<00:00:51.250> white<00:00:51.520> penis<00:00:52.200> so<00:00:53.200> now<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.410> next<00:00:53.590> one

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
goes white penis so now the next one

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.650 
goes white penis so now the next one
that<00:00:53.830> enters<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.310> equation<00:00:55.140> say<00:00:56.140> it's<00:00:57.660> maple

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
that enters the equation say it's maple

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.950 
that enters the equation say it's maple
syrup<00:01:01.620> now<00:01:02.620> maple<00:01:02.950> syrup<00:01:03.600> needs<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:04.720> go<00:01:04.840> with

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
syrup now maple syrup needs to go with

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.230 
syrup now maple syrup needs to go with
white<00:01:05.140> beans<00:01:05.350> which<00:01:05.680> it<00:01:05.830> does<00:01:06.010> needs<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.060> go

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
white beans which it does needs to go

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.570 
white beans which it does needs to go
with<00:01:07.360> Apple's<00:01:07.750> which<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.440> does<00:01:08.620> it<00:01:09.220> needs<00:01:09.460> to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
with Apple's which it does it needs to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.850 
with Apple's which it does it needs to
go<00:01:09.700> with<00:01:09.880> bacon<00:01:10.510> or<00:01:10.660> pancetta<00:01:10.930> ham<00:01:11.380> which<00:01:11.710> it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
go with bacon or pancetta ham which it

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.660 
go with bacon or pancetta ham which it
does<00:01:12.010> so<00:01:12.910> you<00:01:13.000> keep<00:01:13.210> building<00:01:13.660> this<00:01:14.520> kind<00:01:15.520> of

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
does so you keep building this kind of

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.560 
does so you keep building this kind of
system<00:01:16.540> what<00:01:17.080> we<00:01:17.200> call<00:01:17.410> bouncing<00:01:18.070> flavors<00:01:18.570> so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
system what we call bouncing flavors so

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.310 
system what we call bouncing flavors so
basically<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:21.010> just<00:01:21.190> keep<00:01:21.400> going

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
basically you just keep going

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.420 
basically you just keep going
let's<00:01:23.890> throw<00:01:24.010> an<00:01:24.190> oddball<00:01:24.340> one<00:01:24.850> in<00:01:24.940> there<00:01:26.430> beer

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
let's throw an oddball one in there beer

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.030 
let's throw an oddball one in there beer
right<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.740> this<00:01:30.420> Guinness<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:32.500> with<00:01:32.830> white

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
put in the puzzle has to go with every

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.890 
put in the puzzle has to go with every
other<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:18.550> let's<00:02:18.850> say<00:02:18.970> instead<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.420> beer<00:02:19.690> we

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
other one let's say instead of beer we

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.750 
other one let's say instead of beer we
would<00:02:20.050> have<00:02:20.140> went<00:02:20.320> with<00:02:20.410> red<00:02:21.160> wine

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.590 
I can't really see red wine going with
maple<00:02:30.320> syrup<00:02:30.820> red<00:02:31.820> wine<00:02:32.000> could<00:02:32.270> go<00:02:32.420> with

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
maple syrup red wine could go with

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.330 
maple syrup red wine could go with
Apple's<00:02:33.020> red<00:02:33.350> wine<00:02:33.500> certainly<00:02:33.950> goes<00:02:34.130> with

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
Apple's red wine certainly goes with

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.070 
Apple's red wine certainly goes with
pork<00:02:34.580> products<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.180> red<00:02:35.330> wine<00:02:35.480> could<00:02:35.780> go<00:02:35.930> with

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
pork products and red wine could go with

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.810 
pork products and red wine could go with
almonds<00:02:36.500> but<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.950> doesn't<00:02:37.220> go<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.520> maple

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
almonds but it doesn't go with the maple

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.570 
almonds but it doesn't go with the maple
syrup<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.390> can't<00:02:38.600> be<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.870> Croatian<00:02:39.580> and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
syrup so it can't be in the Croatian and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.820 
syrup so it can't be in the Croatian and
that's<00:02:40.760> why<00:02:40.880> we<00:02:41.060> went<00:02:41.210> with<00:02:41.270> beer<00:02:41.630> as<00:02:42.470> long<00:02:42.650> as

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
that's why we went with beer as long as

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.610 
that's why we went with beer as long as
they<00:02:42.980> follow<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.430> rule
