00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.580
 hello everyone in this video I come to bring 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.320
 the review of a very funny cube and the 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.230
 true that it looks like 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.650
 pretty pretty eye-catching which is the 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.019
 dry cake this is although it may not seem 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.869
 one cube and more is a three by three 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.890
 we can make three thin layers 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.910
 Independent 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.910
 other 3 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.990
 2 and 3 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 it's a three by three but the truth is that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.390
 this cubes today for the first time that you 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.420
 I was going to see and then it was May day and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.610
 it's a very interesting cube, very funny 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.860
 the truth is that it seems very simple but 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.739
 has several details that make them 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.899
 cube a little harder a bit though 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.730
 in some ways much easier with 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.370
 transport but put a small 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
 nuances that if you do not realize then 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.879
 can and if you do not know how to do it can 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.190
 that is a cube something complicated for 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.160
 novices 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.190
 as you can see it turns perfectly 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.190
 although I think it 's from janssen but I do not know 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.080
 exactly 7 that mark this cluster I asked 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.780
 by light and they gave it to me for my 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.950
 birthday although it seems a little weird 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.870
 but if they gave us for my birthday 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.210
 in form d 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.450
 of a grace or whatever it was because it is 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.159
 pretty pretty funny 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.520
 and I was not expecting a surprise gift 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.049
 say they brought me some cubes a 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.630
 order of light and this cube appeared 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.429
 I did not expect it and the truth is that it is 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.270
 very entertaining as you see here the pattern 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.430
 of 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.890
 on the cross 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.040
 A) Yes 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.690
 quite fun 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.370
 what I'm going to do has given several 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.730
 friends of mine who are beginners and the 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.400
 truth is that they can not find the 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.590
 way to solve what I'm going to do 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.790
 a little bit so you can see how it turns 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.180
 I am commenting then 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.610
 the cube is like I said it 's pretty 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.370
 funny and more for when you give it to 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.030
 a novice person because they do not know 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.799
 when they give you this waste 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.899
 and I know you do not have to do the days in 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.930
 cake shape because he does not know where 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.959
 start something that with clear deforms 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.959
 asks for its shape of small cylinders and the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.560
 true that is a bit weird to simple 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.880
 view but it's pretty simple and 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.180
 we can see that the cross does 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.920
 perfectly at a moment it is worth 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.020
 do it also solve it by efe the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.780
 genes 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.800
 well , we already have the first two 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.420
 levels made apparently made and 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.950
 now we have a case that has not 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.060
 exists in three by three in the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.060
 transportation when we have 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.569
 with everything 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.130
 in transportation there can only be one 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.180
 point 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:02.170
 a tiny candle 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.170
 it's a cross there are no more cases 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.770
 but here as we can see we have been 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.620
 only one piece left to what is due 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.959
 so that this piece not to have 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.730
 a pattern of defined colors ie 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.250
 it can be as well as turn 180 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.250
 degrees, of course, if in a rubik's cube 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.220
 we take and put 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.860
 an edge because given 180 the cube of 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.370
 happens is that we have a piece once 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.370
 that we take it out 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.319
 and let's put it well already we have this 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.819
 well then we will have to do 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.360
 exactly the same 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.360
 we take out 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.020
 and we put it back 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.150
 it rotates 180 degrees and now we have one 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.060
 case that runs we know perfectly 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.120
 in 3 by 3 that is the starting point 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.360
 there we can do 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.330
 the age was tiny and from there 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.680
 we make the cross 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.680
 and then 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.000
 and we solve it without any problem but 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.159
 what happens the cube apparently seems 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.689
 which it is solved but this detail me 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.239
 I realized when I saw the review since May 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.370
 villa 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.639
 and the truth is that it is not, because if 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.879
 we see it like this 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:29.289
 from looking at that axis we can see that 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:32.110
 all this forms two circles but here 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.810
 not here this is flat and this is 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.440
 flat because 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.540
 because these pieces the covers for 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.710
 remove to make it go better 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.520
 if we have it like that 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.640
 and so it changes like that in a straight line like that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.970
 is the circumference that happens that 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.640
 are rotated 90 degrees, it's very 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.040
 simple so if we do not realize 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.740
 of that little detail for the truth 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.950
 that we can have as I do not have it 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.960
 but we have not resolved it but if 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.720
 we turn this to 90 degrees we will stay 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.200
 as I do to turn 90 degrees these 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.610
 pieces 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.610
 what I use is 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.590
 I use this algorithm 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.940
 they exchange three pieces 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.940
 It is here is here 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.560
 Y 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.919
 ok and this one changes me just like the 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.220
 transport what happens that we do not give 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.190
 account when we do it 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.270
 but of course because the center does not influence 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.340
 it does not matter whether the center is 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.870
 and is just a sticker and we are not 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.250
 giving accounts to the center but here not 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.370
 here the center as is a cover 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.830
 has a way is not equal to have 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.360
 so the truth is that it is a very 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.040
 entertaining that if you give it to a 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.140
 beginner person can confuse you 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.480
 pretty and more if you say this little 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.180
 detail that is not well composed if 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.100
 you turn these 90 degrees very entertaining 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.409
 very cheap I think it costs less than 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.089
 five euros about 4 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:13.699
 It's very good what you can ask for 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:16.339
 chicana or this you can ask for light 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.110
 I recommend it because its price 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:19.699
 quite cheap and can be a gift 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.709
 very original for a birthday like me 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.239
 they did it to me so well I hope 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:26.409
 that you liked the review and see you 

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:26.409
 in another video then
