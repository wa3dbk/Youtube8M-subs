00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
he's not gonna break you don't worry

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.570 
he's not gonna break you don't worry
about<00:04:47.199> that<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:47.650> he's<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:48.130> something<00:04:48.490> that

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
about that so he's is something that

we're trying to move into with all of
our<00:04:50.970> big<00:04:51.970> models<00:04:52.330> like<00:04:52.449> this<00:04:52.570> that<00:04:52.690> we're

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
our big models like this that we're

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.270 
our big models like this that we're
using<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.169> this<00:04:53.289> game<00:04:53.470> in<00:04:53.620> future<00:04:53.889> games<00:04:53.919> is

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
using in this game in future games is

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.560 
using in this game in future games is
having<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.729> kind<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.180> plastic<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.960> uh<00:04:57.570> yeah

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
having that kind of plastic that uh yeah

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.900 
having that kind of plastic that uh yeah
it<00:04:58.630> can<00:04:58.750> be<00:04:58.780> dropped<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.560> be<00:04:59.680> even<00:05:00.490> stepped<00:05:00.760> on

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
it can be dropped can be even stepped on

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.580 
it can be dropped can be even stepped on
it<00:05:00.940> won't<00:05:01.360> feel<00:05:01.539> good<00:05:01.780> I'll<00:05:02.080> be<00:05:02.169> like<00:05:02.289> stepping

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
it won't feel good I'll be like stepping

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.140 
it won't feel good I'll be like stepping
on<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.710> Lego<00:05:02.830> block<00:05:03.160> it's<00:05:03.430> nice<00:05:03.729> that<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:04.030> can

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
on a Lego block it's nice that you can

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.730 
on a Lego block it's nice that you can
still<00:05:04.389> be<00:05:04.479> your<00:05:04.570> favorite<00:05:04.750> player<00:05:05.110> color<00:05:05.410> too

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
yep so with the basis that's how you

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.439 
yep so with the basis that's how you
yeah<00:05:08.650> that's<00:05:08.919> how<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.190> organize<00:05:09.550> which<00:05:10.240> guy

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
yeah that's how you organize which guy

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
huge difference right each age by the

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.870 
huge difference right each age by the
way<00:06:15.940> is<00:06:16.150> a<00:06:16.860> ways<00:06:17.860> to<00:06:17.949> be<00:06:18.039> one<00:06:18.220> round<00:06:18.550> and

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
way is a ways to be one round and

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
there's three of them the game so

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.529 
there's three of them the game so
there's<00:06:20.139> kind<00:06:20.320> of<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.560> definitive<00:06:21.250> ending<00:06:21.669> when

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
there's kind of a definitive ending when
