then didn't get enough there so you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
then didn't get enough there so you
doing<00:01:52.009> number<00:01:52.219> three<00:01:55.000> all<00:01:56.000> right

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
doing number three all right

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.819 
doing number three all right
you've<00:01:58.530> got<00:01:58.710> three<00:01:58.979> values<00:01:59.220> here<00:01:59.579> which<00:01:59.880> solid

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
you've got three values here which solid

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.289 
you've got three values here which solid
I<00:02:03.140> think<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.229> saw<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.409> will<00:02:04.680> change<00:02:04.860> anyway

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
I think I saw that will change anyway

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.789 
I think I saw that will change anyway
right<00:02:06.299> your<00:02:06.479> honor

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
right your honor

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.870 
right your honor
go<00:02:07.799> through<00:02:08.009> these<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.569> edit<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.520> one<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
go through these and edit it to one and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.690 
go through these and edit it to one and
the<00:02:12.000> value<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:13.170> will<00:02:13.380> hopefully<00:02:13.680> change<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
the value this will hopefully change the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.390 
the value this will hopefully change the
Layton's<00:02:15.360> level<00:02:15.920> when<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.010> find<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> one

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400

okay<00:02:27.819> fatso

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.710 

okay<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:33.410> probably<00:02:33.560> one<00:02:34.000> right<00:02:35.000> delete

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
okay that's probably one right delete

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.490 
okay that's probably one right delete
them<00:02:36.730> then<00:02:37.730> with<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.239> address<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.319> want<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
them then with this address you want to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.490 
them then with this address you want to
do<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.709> new<00:02:40.640> scan<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.569> set<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.140> unknown

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
do a new scan and you set it to unknown

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.570 
do a new scan and you set it to unknown
initial<00:02:46.010> value

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.589 

it<00:02:51.580> will<00:02:51.760> change<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.360> back<00:02:53.400> by<00:02:54.400> one<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.209> then

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599
