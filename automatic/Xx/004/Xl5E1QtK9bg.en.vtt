here on MMO FTW this week it's all about

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.199 
here on MMO FTW this week it's all about
the<00:04:18.410> downstate<00:04:19.010> mechanic<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:19.669> Guild<00:04:19.910> Wars<00:04:20.000> 2

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
the downstate mechanic in Guild Wars 2

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.930 
the downstate mechanic in Guild Wars 2
and<00:04:20.660> whether<00:04:20.900> or<00:04:21.109> not<00:04:21.140> it<00:04:21.560> adds<00:04:21.859> or<00:04:22.250> detracts

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
and whether or not it adds or detracts

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.580 
and whether or not it adds or detracts
from<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.510> games<00:04:23.810> player<00:04:24.169> versus<00:04:24.560> player

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590

for<00:04:26.479> me<00:04:26.599> while<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:26.960> suck<00:04:27.409> at<00:04:27.710> PvP<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.460> answer<00:04:28.759> is

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
for me while I suck at PvP the answer is

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.189 
for me while I suck at PvP the answer is
still<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.389> no-brainer

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
still a no-brainer

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.869 
still a no-brainer
I<00:04:30.229> believe<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:30.949> really<00:04:31.039> adds<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.550> whole<00:04:31.699> new

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:31.879 
I believe it really adds a whole new

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.059 
I believe it really adds a whole new
layer<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.539> action<00:04:32.900> coordinated<00:04:33.800> groups

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
layer to the action coordinated groups

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.339 
layer to the action coordinated groups
can<00:04:34.340> revive<00:04:34.699> down<00:04:35.060> friends<00:04:35.599> and<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.900> player<00:04:36.110> who

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
can revive down friends and a player who

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.439 
can revive down friends and a player who
was<00:04:36.500> this<00:04:36.860> close<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.550> killing<00:04:37.759> his<00:04:38.000> opponent

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
was this close to killing his opponent

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.450 
was this close to killing his opponent
can<00:04:38.870> still<00:04:39.080> do<00:04:39.319> so<00:04:39.590> if<00:04:39.830> he's<00:04:39.979> quick<00:04:40.250> with<00:04:40.430> his

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
can still do so if he's quick with his

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.640 
can still do so if he's quick with his
hot<00:04:40.729> keys<00:04:41.000> while<00:04:41.569> downed<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.229> clinging<00:04:42.560> to

completely killing him and had giving

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.779 
completely killing him and had giving
him<00:04:53.719> no<00:04:53.900> chance<00:04:54.169> of<00:04:54.530> getting<00:04:54.979> back<00:04:55.280> up<00:04:55.490> again

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.390 
him no chance of getting back up again
to<00:04:56.479> me<00:04:56.659> it<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.169> adds<00:04:57.379> a<00:04:57.530> whole<00:04:57.710> new<00:04:57.889> layer<00:04:58.099> to

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
to me it just adds a whole new layer to

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.159 
to me it just adds a whole new layer to
combat<00:04:58.819> instead<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.270> just<00:04:59.419> killing<00:04:59.599> somebody

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
combat instead of just killing somebody

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.050 
combat instead of just killing somebody
having<00:05:00.770> them<00:05:00.979> respawn<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.669> rinsing<00:05:02.000> and

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
having them respawn and rinsing and

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.159 
having them respawn and rinsing and
repeating<00:05:02.150> this<00:05:02.659> adds<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:02.960> lot<00:05:03.110> more

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
repeating this adds a lot more

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.860 
repeating this adds a lot more
coordination<00:05:03.650> and<00:05:04.250> a<00:05:04.669> lot<00:05:04.909> more<00:05:05.150> thinking<00:05:05.509> to

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
coordination and a lot more thinking to

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.779 
coordination and a lot more thinking to
the<00:05:05.960> process<00:05:06.409> of<00:05:06.560> PvP<00:05:06.919> if<00:05:07.340> you're<00:05:07.759> a
