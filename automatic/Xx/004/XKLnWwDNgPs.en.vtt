00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.290
 well in this video we are going to see the 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.840
 powers the power of numbers 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.940
 relative then we call powers of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.880
 a number relative to the product of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.930
 take it as a factor as many times as 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.250
 want 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:26.580
 we have that if there is a relative number 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.490
 anyone and n is a positive number 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.400
 number 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.129
 rather natural if a natural whole 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.610
 let's say it like that 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.630
 so 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.630
 to the n 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.969
 has been raised to the n will be equal to 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.969
 that the number of times that is n 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.280
 factors of a 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.280
 so 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.710
 to make more graphic for example 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.340
 we have n be the number 3 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.820
 then let's multiply 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.820
 sometimes 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.999
 the number to which is the base number and 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:16.590
 then to explain a little then nothing 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:20.640
 the name of each element of this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.540
 formula of at n equal to ax 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.190
 then what is said is that we call 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.040
 power to the bone x product 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.740
 to the n when we solve it is called 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.600
 power and ready 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.600
 the basis of the number we take 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.770
 this variable is called base and n is called 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.179
 exponent 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.009
 ok and then well we can we can 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.200
 make some examples 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.679
 in general what you do is multiply 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.530
 so many times the base whatever the 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:04.250
 power here is 3 multiplied 3 times 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.380
 the base by itself 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.429
 then we can have an example 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.429
 numeric let's say 5 raised to the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 whatever 3 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 OK 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.010
 then the power is going to be 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.680
 for 5 for 5 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.310
 OK 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.060
 5 x 5 25 and that still touches 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.159
 multiply it again true now 25 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.159
 for 5 gives us 125 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:46.450
 the base of 5 the exponent is 3i 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.590
 the power is 125 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.840
 good but there is a small rule 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.760
 a rule 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.630
 because it turns out that sometimes 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.610
 we have 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.960
 at the base 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.960
 a negative number 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.829
 when at the base 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.020
 we raise it to a 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.610
 to a power n 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.680
 then we will have a number 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.060
 positive because then as we see it in 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.620
 this example d 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.739
 the positive device base x positive 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.480
 it keeps giving us positive and positive x 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.490
 as many times as it is we will be left 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.880
 positive vale 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.770
 then it's going 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.890
 when we have a positive base we are going 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.060
 to stay positive when we have a 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.060
 negative base is 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.010
 the small 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.960
 let say 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.150
 and esque 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.150
 when this is less 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.480
 the sign is also going to multiply 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.480
 as follows 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.210
 suppose that in this case n is going to be 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.110
 number 2 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:18.970
 it's less squared but then this 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.970
 it would be represented differently 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.660
 would be as follows - a 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.290
 explained by less 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.290
 OK 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.900
 in the case of number 2 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:48.310
 exponent number 2 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.960
 with a negative base is going to throw a 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.220
 result 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.280
 special and esque 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.320
 Bah 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.320
 multiply the negative sign 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.130
 negative x negative gives us positive 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.460
 it gives us positive so less to 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:14.689
 square 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.999
 I could also 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.729
 turn out to be telling yourself that it is the value 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:22.169
 Absolute au 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.770
 squared 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.770
 OK 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.230
 and in the same way 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.950
 with all the exponents 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.950
 Paris 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.280
 to a negative advance 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.260
 but with the odd exponents is 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.880
 negative for example if we have the 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.120
 exponent 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.790
 3 now we would multiply this once 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.670
 more for less' and what would be the result 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:56.470
 less for less gives us more but more for 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.470
 less would give us less 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.500
 squared 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.130
 OK 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.210
 and that's basically the rule then 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:15.320
 in simple and textual words when 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:19.840
 we have an exponent 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.840
 parc with a negative base 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:28.030
 basically we eliminate the negative 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.740
 because it gives absolute value and is already 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.580
 in the number that we will be the 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.910
 positive number but when we raise to 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.670
 an exponent imparts a negative base 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.000
 the number that will result is a 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:46.160
 negative number 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.160
 and that good is an important rule 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:51.870
 this issue of the power of numbers 

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:53.849
 relative 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:58.529
 there is good 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:07:02.330
 if there is any restlessness like that 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.330
 this is a video and if they can 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.509
 to go back as many times as 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:12.040
 necessary to be able to look or otherwise 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:15.009
 then in the comments suddenly 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.510
 I will be a little attentive to 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:21.590
 to concerns good 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.590
 that's all
