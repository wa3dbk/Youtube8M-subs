00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the metal make it a bit smoother and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.880 
the metal make it a bit smoother and
hopefully<00:01:39.000> less<00:01:40.110> stuff<00:01:41.110> will<00:01:41.320> stick<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.590> it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
hopefully less stuff will stick to it

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.700 
hopefully less stuff will stick to it
every<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:42.910> often<00:01:43.090> it's<00:01:43.630> good<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.960> do<00:01:44.110> this

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
every so often it's good to do this

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.430 
every so often it's good to do this
your<00:01:46.400> various<00:01:47.000> detergents<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:47.869> soaps<00:01:48.200> and

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
your various detergents and soaps and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.859 
your various detergents and soaps and
stuff<00:01:48.680> will<00:01:48.979> will<00:01:49.760> eventually<00:01:50.210> leach<00:01:50.450> some<00:01:50.750> of

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
stuff will will eventually leach some of

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.490 
stuff will will eventually leach some of
the<00:01:50.930> oil<00:01:50.960> back<00:01:51.470> out<00:01:51.680> of<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.890> pan<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.380> there<00:01:54.380> you

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
the oil back out of the pan so there you

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:04.120 
the oil back out of the pan so there you
don't<00:01:54.619> have<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.830> do<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.040> every<00:01:55.130> time<00:01:56.440> sometimes

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.169 

so<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.869> we've<00:02:06.869> got<00:02:07.200> some<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
so as you can see we've got some of that

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.580 
so as you can see we've got some of that
stuff<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.420> stuck<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.050> off<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.410> there

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
stuff that's stuck to it off of there

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.270 
stuff that's stuck to it off of there
and<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.130> pan<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.550> shinier<00:02:12.060> cleaner<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.860> just

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and the pan is shinier cleaner so just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.360 
and the pan is shinier cleaner so just
collect<00:02:14.610> up<00:02:14.760> all<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.120> salt<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.130> wash<00:02:17.130> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
collect up all that salt and wash the
