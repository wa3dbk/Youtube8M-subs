you're a careful listener you move three
feet<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.929> you<00:02:04.139> can<00:02:04.319> hear<00:02:04.499> a<00:02:04.560> slight

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

which<00:02:15.850> is<00:02:16.090> accurate<00:02:17.970> they're<00:02:18.970> both<00:02:19.150> accurate

which is accurate they're both accurate

they're both real music of the same hall
if<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.560> were<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.890> record<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:25.780> sound<00:02:26.670> with<00:02:27.670> a

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
if you were to record that sound with a

if you were to record that sound with a
set<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.090> microphones<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.170> then<00:02:29.530> move<00:02:29.770> all

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
set of microphones and then move all

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.390 
set of microphones and then move all
those<00:02:30.190> microphones<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:31.240> foot<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.950> sound<00:02:33.250> would

those microphones a foot the sound would
be<00:02:33.550> utterly<00:02:33.760> different<00:02:34.770> which<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.800> accurate

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
be utterly different which is accurate

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.870 
be utterly different which is accurate
so<00:02:38.050> we<00:02:38.290> get<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.800> subject<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.460> what

so we get to the subject of what

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.570 
so we get to the subject of what
constitutes<00:02:40.680> perfection<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.800> accuracy<00:02:42.460> and

constitutes perfection and accuracy and

constitutes perfection and accuracy and

technically<00:02:49.180> just<00:02:49.540> say<00:02:49.690> look<00:02:49.900> it's<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.650> linear

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
technically just say look it's a linear

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.140 
technically just say look it's a linear
transfer<00:02:51.640> function<00:02:52.800> whatever<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.220> input<00:02:54.820> is

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
transfer function whatever the input is

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.440 
transfer function whatever the input is
it<00:02:55.540> reproduces<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.560> exactly<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
it reproduces it exactly in the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.160 
it reproduces it exactly in the
frequency<00:02:59.110> domain<00:02:59.380> in<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:01.270> time<00:03:01.540> domain<00:03:01.780> it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
frequency domain in the time domain it

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.970

has<00:03:02.320> perfect<00:03:02.920> pulse<00:03:03.430> response<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:04.360> give<00:03:04.630> it<00:03:04.750> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
has perfect pulse response you give it a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.410 
has perfect pulse response you give it a
square<00:03:05.980> wave<00:03:06.190> input<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.060> gives<00:03:07.270> you<00:03:07.390> a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
square wave input and it gives you a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.550 
square wave input and it gives you a
square<00:03:07.810> wave<00:03:08.020> output<00:03:09.720> okay<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.990> the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
square wave output okay and the

you could name 200 parameters a hundred

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.420 
you could name 200 parameters a hundred

to take an early solid-state amplifier
you<00:03:56.290> know<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.650> earliest<00:03:57.220> crown<00:03:57.610> DC<00:03:58.120> 300<00:03:58.930> or

you know the earliest crown DC 300 or

you know the earliest crown DC 300 or
something<00:03:59.410> like<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.620> then<00:04:00.630> compare<00:04:01.630> it<00:04:01.810> with

something like that then compare it with

their<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.870> know<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.109> mean<00:04:20.350> that's<00:04:20.500> way<00:04:20.859> out

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
their you know I mean that's way out

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.960 
their you know I mean that's way out
there<00:04:22.140> but<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.289> fact<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.860> they<00:04:24.130> don't<00:04:24.430> sound

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
there but the fact is they don't sound

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.340 
there but the fact is they don't sound
the<00:04:25.180> same<00:04:26.010> the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
the same the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.410 
the same the
the<00:04:27.860> crown<00:04:28.540> sounds<00:04:29.540> thin<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.320> bright<00:04:31.420> you'd

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
the crown sounds thin and bright you'd

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.660 
the crown sounds thin and bright you'd
almost<00:04:32.750> expect<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.650> have<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.830> rising<00:04:34.490> high

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
almost expect it to have a rising high

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.460 
almost expect it to have a rising high
frequency<00:04:35.240> response<00:04:35.660> but<00:04:35.900> that's<00:04:36.110> not<00:04:36.320> the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
frequency response but that's not the

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.680 
frequency response but that's not the
way<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.620> measures<00:04:37.160> its<00:04:37.700> frequency<00:04:38.240> response

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
way it measures its frequency response

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.240 
way it measures its frequency response
is<00:04:38.870> flat<00:04:39.170> whereas<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.100> mxr<00:04:40.640> is<00:04:40.880> sweet<00:04:41.480> and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
is flat whereas the mxr is sweet and

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.370 
is flat whereas the mxr is sweet and
it's<00:04:43.250> very<00:04:43.490> very<00:04:43.580> linear<00:04:44.390> but<00:04:44.570> it's<00:04:44.720> sweet

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
it's very very linear but it's sweet

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.920 
it's very very linear but it's sweet
sounding<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.640> doesn't<00:04:47.180> sound<00:04:47.480> like<00:04:47.720> there's

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
sounding it doesn't sound like there's

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.160 
sounding it doesn't sound like there's
any<00:04:48.260> high<00:04:48.890> frequency<00:04:49.460> peak<00:04:49.760> at<00:04:50.510> all<00:04:50.840> in<00:04:51.110> fact

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
any high frequency peak at all in fact

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.310 
any high frequency peak at all in fact
you<00:04:52.070> might<00:04:52.220> say<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:53.300> may<00:04:53.540> actually<00:04:53.840> be<00:04:54.290> a

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
you might say it may actually be a

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.650 
you might say it may actually be a
little<00:04:54.650> rolled<00:04:55.010> off<00:04:55.310> above<00:04:55.700> 20<00:04:56.090> killer<00:04:56.330> but

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
little rolled off above 20 killer but

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.700 
little rolled off above 20 killer but
it's<00:04:56.810> not<00:04:57.010> it's<00:04:58.010> not<00:04:58.480> so<00:04:59.480> the<00:05:00.350> way<00:05:00.650> you

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
it's not it's not so the way you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.610 
it's not it's not so the way you
perceive<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.700> sound<00:05:02.090> is<00:05:02.420> what<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:02.810> call<00:05:03.110> tonal

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
perceive the sound is what I call tonal

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.420 
perceive the sound is what I call tonal
balance<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:05.630> it's<00:05:05.990> not<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.770> same<00:05:07.070> as

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
balance so it's not the same as

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.680 
balance so it's not the same as
frequency<00:05:08.090> response<00:05:08.690> I<00:05:09.220> think<00:05:10.220> that<00:05:10.540> what<00:05:11.540> we

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
frequency response I think that what we

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.770 
frequency response I think that what we
have<00:05:11.960> now<00:05:12.260> we<00:05:12.800> have<00:05:13.130> a<00:05:13.810> group<00:05:14.810> a<00:05:15.140> community<00:05:16.040> a
