00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
outside the window and this is what I

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.550 
outside the window and this is what I

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
think is actually one of the funnier

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.050 
think is actually one of the funnier
scenes<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.130> don't<00:02:17.310> think<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.580> was<00:02:17.670> meant<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
scenes and I don't think it was meant to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.180 
scenes and I don't think it was meant to
be<00:02:18.150> funny<00:02:18.480> apparently<00:02:19.380> madura<00:02:19.680> was<00:02:19.800> listening

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
be funny apparently madura was listening

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.650 
be funny apparently madura was listening
the<00:02:20.310> entire<00:02:20.580> time<00:02:20.819> he's<00:02:21.090> dropping<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.540> this

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the entire time he's dropping on this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.850 
conversation and he sort of just runs
away<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.240> guess<00:02:24.420> he's<00:02:24.569> just<00:02:24.630> upset<00:02:25.350> over

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860

because the fucking Bank I ain't doing

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.710 
because the fucking Bank I ain't doing
shit<00:02:59.790> anymore<00:03:03.440> anyway<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:05.010> after<00:03:05.489> that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
shit anymore anyway so after that

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.460 
shit anymore anyway so after that
they're<00:03:06.720> looking<00:03:06.870> at<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.230> they're<00:03:07.350> saying

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
they're looking at it and they're saying

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.340 
they're looking at it and they're saying
you<00:03:07.830> need<00:03:08.010> yin<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.519> yang<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:10.200> my

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
you need yin and yang you know in my

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.900 
you need yin and yang you know in my
interpretation<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.100> looks<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.580> six

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
interpretation it looks like the six

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.030 
interpretation it looks like the six
pass<00:03:12.150> his<00:03:12.780> two<00:03:12.930> sons<00:03:13.140> like<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.680> need<00:03:13.830> both

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
pass his two sons like you need both

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.170 
pass his two sons like you need both
yeah<00:03:14.280> they're<00:03:14.430> talking<00:03:14.640> about<00:03:14.760> how<00:03:14.880> like<00:03:15.030> it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
yeah they're talking about how like it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.390 
yeah they're talking about how like it
was<00:03:15.299> split<00:03:15.690> into<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.170> yin<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.410> yang<00:03:16.799> chakras

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
was split into the yin and yang chakras

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.430 
was split into the yin and yang chakras
yeah<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.000> obviously<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:19.110> into

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
yeah and obviously this is going into

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440 
yeah and obviously this is going into
the<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.950> story<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.549> ten<00:03:20.790> tails<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the the story of the ten tails and the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.000 
the the story of the ten tails and the
sage<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.810> six<00:03:21.870> paths<00:03:22.260> all<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.769> stuff

sage of the six paths all that stuff

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.800 
sage of the six paths all that stuff
went<00:03:23.220> down<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.640> everything<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:24.630> pretty

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
went down and everything and it's pretty

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.240 
went down and everything and it's pretty
clear<00:03:25.079> like<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.530> said<00:03:25.709> they're<00:03:25.860> both<00:03:26.040> looking

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
at this with two different

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.690 
at this with two different
interpretations<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.769> First<00:03:28.980> Hokage<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.489> like

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
interpretations the First Hokage is like

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.460 
interpretations the First Hokage is like
we<00:03:29.820> can<00:03:30.030> use<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.870> know<00:03:30.989> better<00:03:31.320> than

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
we can use this to you know better than

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.500 
we can use this to you know better than
inja<00:03:31.739> world<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.100> probably<00:03:32.489> some<00:03:32.730> way<00:03:32.880> but

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
inja world in probably some way but

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.940 
inja world in probably some way but
mudarra<00:03:33.870> season<00:03:34.230> obviously<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.799> much

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
mudarra season obviously in a much

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.650 
mudarra season obviously in a much
darker<00:03:35.250> fashion<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.269> course<00:03:36.299> where

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
darker fashion this is of course where

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.380 
darker fashion this is of course where
he<00:03:36.780> turns<00:03:37.560> evil<00:03:38.549> which<00:03:39.030> I'm<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:39.239> really

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
he turns evil which I'm not really

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.390 
he turns evil which I'm not really
liking<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.320> text<00:03:40.680> at<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.799> end<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.160> don't<00:03:41.310> like

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
liking that text at the end I don't like

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.069 
liking that text at the end I don't like
that<00:03:41.430> he<00:03:41.610> turns<00:03:41.970> ey<00:03:42.360> like<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.660> think<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:42.900> he's

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
that he turns ey like to think that he's

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.050 
that he turns ey like to think that he's
always<00:03:43.410> sort<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.769> kind<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.310> fucked<00:03:44.670> up<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
always sort of kind of fucked up in the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.440 
always sort of kind of fucked up in the
back<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.420> his<00:03:45.540> mind<00:03:45.680> um<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:47.190> still<00:03:47.820> this<00:03:48.390> is

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
back of his mind um but still this is

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.150 
back of his mind um but still this is
leaning<00:03:48.930> into<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.140> sense<00:03:49.440> where<00:03:49.739> madara's

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
leaning into the sense where madara's

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.650 
leaning into the sense where madara's
gonna<00:03:50.340> leave<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.640> village<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.120> why<00:03:51.269> probably

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
gonna leave the village and why probably

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.479 
gonna leave the village and why probably
because<00:03:51.930> he<00:03:52.019> learned<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:52.739> take<00:03:53.100> control<00:03:53.250> of

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
because he learned I can take control of

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.819 
because he learned I can take control of
the<00:03:53.579> ten<00:03:53.760> tails<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.180> rule<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> world<00:03:54.769> ok<00:03:55.769> so

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
the ten tails and rule the world ok so

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.880 
the ten tails and rule the world ok so
what<00:03:56.130> did<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.310> think<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.579> naruto<00:03:56.970> 625<00:03:57.840> well<00:03:58.650> in

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
what did we think of naruto 625 well in

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.360 
what did we think of naruto 625 well in
my<00:03:58.920> opinion<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.670> was<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.790> very<00:04:00.180> rushed<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.370> i

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
my opinion it was a very rushed and i

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.800 
my opinion it was a very rushed and i
thought<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.060> was<00:04:03.180> going<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.329> be<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> little<00:04:03.660> more

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
thought it was going to be a little more

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.560 
thought it was going to be a little more
dramatic<00:04:03.989> now<00:04:04.860> i<00:04:05.130> have<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.880> honest<00:04:06.150> term<00:04:06.390> at

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
dramatic now i have to be honest term at

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.300 
dramatic now i have to be honest term at
it<00:04:06.870> what<00:04:07.109> well<00:04:07.320> dramatic<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.160> wrong

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
it what well dramatic in the wrong

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.030 
it what well dramatic in the wrong
direction<00:04:09.140> but<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.200> real<00:04:10.530> thing<00:04:10.739> is<00:04:10.859> i<00:04:10.890> think

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
direction but the real thing is i think

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.500 
direction but the real thing is i think
last<00:04:11.370> week<00:04:11.519> we<00:04:11.730> were<00:04:11.820> complaining<00:04:12.180> about<00:04:12.329> the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
last week we were complaining about the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.330 
last week we were complaining about the
flashlight<00:04:12.930> flashbacks<00:04:13.650> taking<00:04:14.040> too<00:04:14.160> long

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
flashlight flashbacks taking too long

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.150 
flashlight flashbacks taking too long
but<00:04:14.790> if<00:04:14.880> there<00:04:15.030> was<00:04:15.150> ever<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:16.140> flashback<00:04:16.709> to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
but if there was ever the flashback to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.800 
but if there was ever the flashback to
stretch<00:04:17.549> out<00:04:17.789> and<00:04:18.000> really<00:04:18.269> take<00:04:18.450> your<00:04:18.599> time

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
stretch out and really take your time

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.690 
stretch out and really take your time
with<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.049> was<00:04:19.289> this

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
with it was this

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.760 
with it was this
it<00:04:20.120> was<00:04:20.300> the<00:04:20.420> foundation<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:21.020> the<00:04:21.140> village<00:04:21.410> and

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
it was the foundation of the village and

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.100 
it was the foundation of the village and
I<00:04:21.830> felt<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.640> was<00:04:22.730> rushed<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.660> my<00:04:23.840> opinion

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
I felt that it was rushed in my opinion

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.440 
I felt that it was rushed in my opinion
I<00:04:24.410> do<00:04:24.740> agree<00:04:25.250> there<00:04:25.640> were<00:04:25.910> a<00:04:25.940> lot<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.120> things<00:04:26.330> in

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
I do agree there were a lot of things in

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.210 
I do agree there were a lot of things in
this<00:04:26.540> chapter<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:26.930> felt<00:04:27.260> entirely<00:04:27.770> rushed

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
this chapter that felt entirely rushed

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.430 
this chapter that felt entirely rushed
in<00:04:28.490> particular<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.630> whole<00:04:29.810> thing<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.140> mudarra

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
in particular the whole thing of mudarra

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.590 
in particular the whole thing of mudarra
just<00:04:30.710> becoming<00:04:31.100> evil<00:04:31.760> like<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.180> said<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.450> whole

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
sound like that but so this wasn't a

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.149 
sound like that but so this wasn't a
complete<00:06:36.960> waste<00:06:37.020> there<00:06:37.469> was<00:06:37.589> still<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.800> lot<00:06:38.069> of

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
complete waste there was still a lot of

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.619 
complete waste there was still a lot of
things<00:06:38.309> here<00:06:38.490> we<00:06:38.580> like<00:06:38.789> the<00:06:38.999> artwork<00:06:39.240> was<00:06:39.509> all

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:39.629 
things here we like the artwork was all

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:41.359 
things here we like the artwork was all
still<00:06:39.839> pretty<00:06:40.020> good<00:06:40.319> there<00:06:41.129> were<00:06:41.189> a<00:06:41.219> lot<00:06:41.279> of

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:41.369 
still pretty good there were a lot of

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:43.070 
still pretty good there were a lot of
necessary<00:06:41.879> evils<00:06:42.240> for<00:06:42.419> this<00:06:42.539> chapters<00:06:42.869> such

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
necessary evils for this chapters such

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.290 
necessary evils for this chapters such
as<00:06:43.259> getting<00:06:43.710> to<00:06:43.889> see<00:06:44.069> Madera<00:06:44.430> go<00:06:44.999> to<00:06:45.059> that

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
as getting to see Madera go to that

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.820 
as getting to see Madera go to that
turning<00:06:45.659> point<00:06:45.689> ray<00:06:46.020> decides<00:06:46.349> to<00:06:46.349> leave<00:06:46.680> the

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
turning point ray decides to leave the

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.170 
turning point ray decides to leave the
village<00:06:47.009> and<00:06:47.309> everything<00:06:47.639> but<00:06:47.879> there's

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
village and everything but there's

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.790 
village and everything but there's
probably<00:06:48.539> going<00:06:48.659> to<00:06:48.719> be<00:06:48.779> more<00:06:49.020> elaboration

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
probably going to be more elaboration

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.519 
probably going to be more elaboration
later<00:06:50.189> so<00:06:50.849> that's<00:06:51.569> just<00:06:51.779> the<00:06:51.899> way<00:06:52.020> it<00:06:52.139> is<00:06:52.169> so<00:06:52.499> I

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:52.529 
later so that's just the way it is so I

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:54.019 
later so that's just the way it is so I
think<00:06:52.740> we're<00:06:53.039> going<00:06:53.129> to<00:06:53.219> give<00:06:53.339> this<00:06:53.430> one<00:06:53.580> a<00:06:53.610> 7

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:54.029 
think we're going to give this one a 7

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:55.879 
think we're going to give this one a 7
