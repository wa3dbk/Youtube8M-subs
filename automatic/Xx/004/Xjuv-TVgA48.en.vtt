 For another video today, I'll give you tips. 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.400
 simple quick tips even things 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.980
 that everyone who plays the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 constructions must know however in the meantime 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.810
 always have some in case they do not know 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.210
 some little thing there maybe well but with 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.029
 some tips 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 so let's start then without fine is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 wrapping 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.020
 when you press 0 vera 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.180
 if you have an index will buy the item 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.510
 If you want to know the maximum value you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.730
 You can buy that inter is only you. 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.559
 put them type 100 and then it goes 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.950
 automatically to the maximum number that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.809
 should buy customers for example human 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.610
 I do not know, I can buy 700 mothers 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 I do not know that I can buy all this 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.590
 I'll just go there one click to buy 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 and there I felt only 10 more in the last 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.539
 result side 100 00 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.820
 and there appears maximum result of Indian 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.129
 that you can buy and this is valid 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 both to sell to buy also 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.820
 company 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.050
 and another very fast here is the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.390
 click once on your character right in 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.140
 above him is to take an action 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.940
 different just like laughing cry or 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.490
 other actions that he also does in 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.190
 venice - the sit on the case after madrid 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.080
 always so it is much easier than 60 and 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.870
 quickly or do not know how to do something 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.820
 fun while playing before 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.520
 did not have this feature now has 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.140
 It's very simple, it's really easy. 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.140
 one more tip and in case you do not know 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.550
 on the way the bar on the way the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.190
 Father, we have two options there. 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.770
 which is the famous dungeon and the field 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.740
 also with the two excellent excellent 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.479
 forms of opaque I think will give 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.290
 shape of your playing style 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.300
 some I know that anyway it is is to use the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.250
 for your character there are people who use 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.050
 both dungeon and field for the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.280
 There are people who prefer to use only 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.260
 dungeons and there are people who 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.729
 field station so that these personnel who 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.679
 use the field they go cables to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.690
 complete the mission of this total, but 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.940
 most of the time of his hugo 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.830
 he occupies in the parts of the field 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.040
 is a tip I can give in relation to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.920
 that's always look at your missions 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.780
 the quests are the essentials for the street to 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.850
 you pair because they who give 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.280
 essential expenses for you and 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.800
 of beyond the bugs that you already kill 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.020
 she does those xp bonuses which is great 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.800
 Your father is a quest and a quest. 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.070
 So you always after making a 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.110
 dungeon always look is the screen of 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.880
 notices the Billboard el ojo that 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.680
 in any city because that is how 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.209
 you buy a dungeon can free 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.340
 a new mission that in this case will not 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.080
 automatically to your list of 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.360
 quest then you have to get her then 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.340
 You going there on the warning screen will 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.959
 install a zygo mission other times 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.790
 mission may be entered even if it is not 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.350
 if a dungeon or else it may be 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.380
 written field that in the case should be in the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.720
 these field missions they do not 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.209
 are those repeated people 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.580
 omissions that do not start work title 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.110
 an example you have to field and kill 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.630
 ten total bugs 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.360
 You go there but these ten bugs after 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.530
 Do you do this mass quest lvt da xp? 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.410
 cool little 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.150
 your character from your ego and after you 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.630
 do this kindergarten there yes it will come a 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.550
 repetitive repetitive thing in case you 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.830
 have killed ten bugs when 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.290
 she turned it over she goes to 20 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.370
 so it changes beauty in case you want to seal 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.110
 the father in the field 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.910
 highly recommend to anyone who opts in the field 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.560
 pick up these repeated missions because 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.330
 You're killing the beast in the field and beyond. 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.940
 you 'll earn the xp of the quest 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.130
 you kill the animals in general and 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.709
 for whom the dungeon pick up the missions 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.989
 resignation is even written there 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.850
 because these also help a lot there 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.850
 For you who like a pair of beauty. 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.930
 another super quick tip here is 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.030
 those animals that beat their mana and 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.890
 also raised their hp euros to the players 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.870
 of hand on ap 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.720
 without them more or less leads 40 and 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.030
 one thing out there in a light 40 and 50 in the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.830
 weldon city ​​it looks good 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.290
 too tiny to chatinhos 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.150
 Peruvian subjuga where it was very simple 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.130
 this is that if you have to make a 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.830
 dungeon or even field where you have 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.750
 these animals do not know if there is a 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.280
 just a front there you 're with 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.680
 very little hp 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.430
 It is recommended that you leave the bug 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.500
 suck chp soon after killing them after 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.090
 you kill it it will give more hp than 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.240
 they're the goal of you which is great 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.330
 this is valid for both the mp and 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.650
 by hp 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.150
 Here's another thing to finish well. 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.310
 quick as a video did 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.330
 very simple with quick tips here I know 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.970
 there ne 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.850
 is the choice of class galera choice of 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:59.490
 characters in relation to the person to speak 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.220
 for personal use only likes to play with a 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.919
 character who is the character who gives it 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.870
 the beauty face the person has the right to 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.979
 choose a character she finds 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.570
 right 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.910
 plays with the character she finds the 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.180
 character and picasa damage that is 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.830
 It was dora time, she leaves it, this is normal. 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.450
 only advice when the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.940
 personal who likes to play with 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.910
 characters that are birdseed cua I do not 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.220
 I like to go and see more is avoided. 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.870
 Good, and my personal tv is taking what I do. 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.120
 I 'll play with her with her 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.220
 even you do not like that very much 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.910
 people are that when the characters 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.490
 take it honestly or something like that goes 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.260
 be kind of a shit you create a 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.070
 character you do not like to play 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.440
 with him op 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.120
 he's going to take the nerf or else in case 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.040
 There's another character you like. 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.020
 very lonely that he is and if there a 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.420
 backpack type did not have as much strength 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.760
 compared to this character he goes there and 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.850
 It takes to seal a very merit bonus one 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.680
 bonuses will get stronger just like you 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.420
 will you see this character going to kate puma? 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.860
 that I did not create a character says 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.290
 so it's very variable was what I 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.100
 I advise you to create a class that 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:10.590
 you really like both the style 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.140
 story is way skills fighting all in 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.600
 not only see a 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.310
 character is strong is the pp is not looks 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.230
 only on this side also look at the 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.250
 side the style and all the faces of the 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.930
 characters 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.760
 I, for example, have an area of days 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.340
 because that 's the cult come back because 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.750
 many days some stories are kind of 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.340
 I used to think so 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.560
 enough of the presence of darkness, which 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.410
 did I create it practically too 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.700
 now bumping into a tv that's the one 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.920
 architect I ended up enjoying it a lot 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.440
 simple style it my genius the 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.870
 clubs more foras skills that clean 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.060
 maps very quickly 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.070
 the style of the character itself I just 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.510
 enjoying it so I decided too 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.520
 give him spared 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.980
 So I think you guys have to review 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.540
 all while creating a character a class 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.090
 of course you can create only one 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.120
 character because he is the one who 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.920
 strong because also in the staff usually 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.780
 only play with characters are several 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.120
 characters and show various characters 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.570
 but it is always good to give a 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.340
 around that beauty 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.500
 so this is a good simple video 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.240
 very fast even with quick tips here 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.830
 very 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.590
 I know that most know these tips and 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.540
 but there is always a staff that 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.760
 Sometimes you do not know one thing 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.160
 so it's always good if there you do something 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.710
 different but even then that's it from there I 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.330
 I hope you have enjoyed it and even 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.330
