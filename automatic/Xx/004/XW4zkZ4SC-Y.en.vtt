00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
that's possible for us it's good because

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.500 
that's possible for us it's good because
we<00:01:42.230> can<00:01:42.260> design<00:01:43.130> some<00:01:43.400> additional<00:01:44.150> colors

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
we can design some additional colors

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.020 
we can design some additional colors
that<00:01:44.720> we<00:01:44.990> can<00:01:45.170> sell<00:01:45.380> later<00:01:45.530> on<00:01:45.790> with<00:01:46.790> different

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
that we can sell later on with different

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.840 
that we can sell later on with different
designs<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:48.320> that's<00:01:48.500> kind<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.340> nice<00:01:49.520> way<00:01:49.670> to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.980 

the<00:01:52.300> device<00:01:52.570> has<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:53.130> control<00:01:54.130> unit

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the device has a control unit

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.870 
the device has a control unit
which

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.010 

which<00:02:01.450> allows<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.080> select<00:02:02.260> each<00:02:02.590> channel

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
which allows you to select each channel

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.730 
which allows you to select each channel
individually<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.710> turn<00:02:06.250> down<00:02:07.180> birth<00:02:07.740> volume

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
individually and turn down birth volume

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.800 
individually and turn down birth volume
of<00:02:09.130> you've<00:02:09.340> sorted<00:02:09.700> channels<00:02:10.509> for<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
of you've sorted channels for the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.199 
of you've sorted channels for the
surround<00:02:11.080> sound<00:02:11.290> system<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.040> that's<00:02:13.000> kind<00:02:13.180> of

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
surround sound system so that's kind of

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.650 
surround sound system so that's kind of
like<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.420> fine<00:02:13.720> tuning<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:15.190> want<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.459> have<00:02:15.660> more

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
like a fine tuning you want to have more

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.690 
like a fine tuning you want to have more
base<00:02:16.989> or

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.810 

sound<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:21.260> if<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:21.650> want<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.890> turn<00:02:22.610> up

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
sound but if you just want to turn up

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.280 
sound but if you just want to turn up
and<00:02:22.970> down<00:02:23.060> all<00:02:23.330> channels<00:02:23.630> at<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.900> same<00:02:24.140> time

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and down all channels at the same time

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.690 
and down all channels at the same time
you<00:02:24.380> can<00:02:24.530> do<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.770> well<00:02:25.010> before<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.490> main

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
you can do this well before the main

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.940 
you can do this well before the main
volume<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:29.090> deactivate<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.840> 7.1<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
volume so you can deactivate the 7.1 and

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.370 
volume so you can deactivate the 7.1 and
then<00:02:31.190> actually<00:02:32.060> if<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.240> do<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.540> it'll<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.350> a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
then actually if you do that it'll be a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.220 
then actually if you do that it'll be a
stereo<00:02:33.830> that's<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:35.230> subwoofer

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
stereo that's it and the subwoofer

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.440 
stereo that's it and the subwoofer
driver<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:37.070> going<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.340> turn<00:02:37.550> into<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.030> regular

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
driver is going to turn into the regular

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.840 
driver is going to turn into the regular
left<00:02:38.660> or<00:02:38.840> right<00:02:39.020> front<00:02:39.710> speaker<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:40.670> kind

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
left or right front speaker so it's kind

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.200 
left or right front speaker so it's kind
of<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:41.260> combined<00:02:42.260> with<00:02:42.560> using<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.340> biggest

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
of a combined with using the biggest

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.320 
of a combined with using the biggest
speaker<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.230> pizza

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.480 

what's<00:02:49.900> also<00:02:50.170> possible<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.860> if<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.280> already

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
what's also possible is if you already

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.540 
what's also possible is if you already
have<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:52.150> speaker<00:02:52.690> system<00:02:53.050> for<00:02:53.890> 7.1<00:02:54.520> and

you don't always have to crawl that many

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.650 
you don't always have to crawl that many
computers<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.320> change<00:03:17.560> all<00:03:17.710> that<00:03:17.740> for<00:03:18.190> the

drivers<00:04:34.690> in<00:04:35.320> total<00:04:36.120> in<00:04:37.120> there<00:04:37.420> lying<00:04:38.140> on<00:04:38.350> top

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
drivers in total in there lying on top

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.190 
drivers in total in there lying on top
of<00:04:38.650> each<00:04:38.770> other<00:04:38.980> so<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.550> in<00:04:39.910> this<00:04:40.060> 2.2<00:04:40.870> version

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
of each other so so in this 2.2 version

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.800 
of each other so so in this 2.2 version
is<00:04:41.350> 140<00:04:42.010> millimeter<00:04:42.400> driver<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:43.090> another<00:04:43.300> 40

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
is 140 millimeter driver and another 40

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.060 
is 140 millimeter driver and another 40
millimeters<00:04:44.260> are<00:04:44.410> great<00:04:44.710> on<00:04:44.830> some<00:04:46.320> networks

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.090 

that's<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.640> main<00:04:51.850> points<00:04:52.810> for<00:04:52.960> this

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
that's the main points for this

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.490 
that's the main points for this
we<00:04:54.610> maintain<00:04:54.880> have<00:04:55.390> a<00:04:55.480> relatively<00:04:55.990> low<00:04:56.230> weight

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
we maintain have a relatively low weight

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.870 
we maintain have a relatively low weight
and<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.520> it's<00:04:57.670> kind<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:59.190> popped<00:05:00.190> up<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.820> a

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
and so it's kind of popped up in a

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.550 
and so it's kind of popped up in a
couple<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.240> forums<00:05:02.020> all<00:05:02.260> over<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.500> place<00:05:02.790> that

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
couple of forums all over the place that

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.830 
couple of forums all over the place that
mean<00:05:05.560> true<00:05:06.040> 5.1<00:05:06.790> surround<00:05:06.970> slats<00:05:07.600> that<00:05:07.690> are

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
mean true 5.1 surround slats that are

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.890 
mean true 5.1 surround slats that are
very<00:05:08.350> heavy<00:05:08.620> most<00:05:09.220> of<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.460> time<00:05:09.700> so<00:05:10.360> people

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
very heavy most of the time so people

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.990 
very heavy most of the time so people
always<00:05:11.050> get<00:05:11.260> tired<00:05:11.530> wearing<00:05:11.980> it<00:05:12.100> for<00:05:12.370> 120

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
always get tired wearing it for 120

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.480 
always get tired wearing it for 120
minutes<00:05:13.030> or<00:05:13.420> so<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:14.010> we've<00:05:15.010> actually<00:05:15.160> tried<00:05:15.460> to

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
minutes or so so we've actually tried to

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.650 
minutes or so so we've actually tried to
maintain<00:05:15.700> that<00:05:16.770> kind<00:05:17.770> of<00:05:17.800> light<00:05:18.010> weight<00:05:18.660> for

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
maintain that kind of light weight for

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.370 
maintain that kind of light weight for
people<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.050> play<00:05:20.140> for<00:05:20.410> over<00:05:20.680> periods<00:05:21.430> of<00:05:21.550> time

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
people to play for over periods of time

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.020 
people to play for over periods of time
the<00:05:23.380> microphone<00:05:23.950> hits<00:05:24.520> that's<00:05:24.700> actually

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
the microphone hits that's actually

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.690 
the microphone hits that's actually
coming<00:05:25.270> out<00:05:25.330> of<00:05:25.450> this<00:05:25.570> left<00:05:26.200> ear<00:05:26.410> cup<00:05:26.620> just<00:05:27.520> by

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
coming out of this left ear cup just by

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.850 
coming out of this left ear cup just by
pulling<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.090> out<00:05:28.210> I<00:05:28.450> can't<00:05:29.320> pull<00:05:29.470> it<00:05:29.500> out<00:05:29.680> too

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
pulling it out I can't pull it out too

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.880 
pulling it out I can't pull it out too
far<00:05:30.130> because<00:05:31.890> it'll<00:05:32.890> break<00:05:33.070> but<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:35.740> nice

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
far because it'll break but the nice

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.760 
far because it'll break but the nice
thing<00:05:35.920> is<00:05:36.220> that<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.520> stores<00:05:36.850> away<00:05:37.180> in<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.840> ear

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
thing is that it stores away in the ear

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.770 
thing is that it stores away in the ear
cup<00:05:39.010> so<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.280> don't<00:05:39.520> have<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:39.760> I<00:05:40.060> mean

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780
