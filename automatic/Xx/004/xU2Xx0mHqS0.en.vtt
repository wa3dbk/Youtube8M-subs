00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 and now again youtube friends 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 welcome to another video more of this 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.680
 series of learn to manage from scratch my 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.200
 name is isaac I am an instructor in the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.590
 school manages a topless mexico in this 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 I'll show you what it's going for 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.930
 to serve using the brakes and it's important 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.130
 since it is only going to be used in two 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.190
 situations and the ones that I will explain 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.190
 [Music] 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.559
 another way to have the car is using 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.040
 clutch or by pressing thoroughly and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.379
 pressing the brake we're just going to 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.070
 use and twice clutch and brake 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.080
 one of them is when we go first 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 in the first speed we did the 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.940
 normal progress sequence we go in 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.949
 first and we have to stop by 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.559
 any circumstance or reason to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.830
 suppose that what we do is traffic 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.710
 we clutch and brake gently that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 is one of the uses of clutch and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.530
 brake in the sequence to advance not 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.990
 there is the braking sequence only 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.700
 there is block and brake that is a way 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.640
 the second way or the second way of 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.119
 use clutch and brake is when we have 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.729
 an emergency situation or by 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.450
 example right now I come in fifth and 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.060
 I come at a speed of 50 55 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.659
 kilometers let's suppose there are 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.659
 ahead 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.520
 something happens that someone closes me or that 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.310
 I was going through something a vehicle a 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.660
 motorcycle a person then there the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.460
 urgency or the need is to stop us 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.500
 but stop with the purpose of 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.890
 neither damage our vehicle or 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.110
 we will do our best to avoid the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.510
 accident but not to avoid the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.990
 accident we damage or damage our 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.750
 vehicle 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.030
 If I just step on the brakes in this 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.940
 situation that I'm going in fifth the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.040
 speed is connected to the engine and I 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.580
 stepped on the brake and stop by 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.400
 completely completely the car and the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.000
 engine can be damaged or the car can be 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.150
 damage because I'm going to make the car that 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.030
 the engine goes off suddenly and this 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.340
 will cause a failure or not by 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.500
 avoid the accident situation 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.740
 danny me my vehicle if I can do 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.170
 both then what do I do here I got it 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.990
 here brake meter and tied me or brake me 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.780
 suddenly to avoid the accident 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.470
 then when putting clutch we do 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.540
 we deploy engine and boxes and when 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.390
 we brake we stop the car of this 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.360
 way to separate that the girl forgive the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.240
 separate motor and box we are avoiding 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.980
 the engine shuts off suddenly and 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.990
 when putting the brake, we have the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.190
 vehicle then those are the only ones 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.230
 two reasons to use watch and brake and 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.450
 be when we go first and 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.300
 normally we are going to stop by 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.680
 some traffic reason or something else or 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.710
 when we go at the speed that 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.440
 let's go and have the need to 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.600
 stop us to avoid an accident that 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.520
 it is in the crossing of someone who happens 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.430
 something then there if we also use 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.980
 hairy brake but quickly and 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.710
 also in order to avoid damaging 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.510
 our mechanically to our vehicle 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.220
 but only only two ways to use 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.410
 classic press 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.110
 Well friends, thank you very much for 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.730
 see us on this occasion to learn to 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.830
 handle from scratch my name is that that 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.110
 I wait for you in the next video of this 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.730
