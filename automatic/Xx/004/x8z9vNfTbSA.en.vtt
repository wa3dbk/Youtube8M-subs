00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
not got any batteries in it at the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.299 
not got any batteries in it at the
minute<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:59.090> it<00:01:00.090> takes<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.410> slide<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.039> piece

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
minute but it takes you slide this piece

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.109 
minute but it takes you slide this piece
up<00:01:02.600> under<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> bottom<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> car<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.760> it

up under the bottom of the car and it
takes<00:01:08.299> four<00:01:09.380> triple-a<00:01:10.380> batteries<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:12.360> can

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
takes four triple-a batteries you can

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.830 
takes four triple-a batteries you can
just<00:01:12.840> pop<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.450> there's<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.540> switch

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
just pop that back on there's a switch

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.350 
just pop that back on there's a switch
here<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> flick<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
here on not then you flick it on the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
here on not then you flick it on the
lights<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.840> come<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:23.130> front<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
lights will come on and front in the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.830 
lights will come on and front in the
back<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.909> nice<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.630> the

back and that's really nice now is the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.460 
back and that's really nice now is the
superfast<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.920> fine<00:01:29.670> chemistry<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.229> just

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
superfast a fine chemistry so it just

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.090 
superfast a fine chemistry so it just
come<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.060> nice<00:01:33.060> case<00:01:35.210> but<00:01:36.210> she'll<00:01:37.100> show

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
come in this nice case but she'll show

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.819 
come in this nice case but she'll show
you<00:01:39.110> these<00:01:40.110> flash<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> dash<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:42.200> made<00:01:43.200> by<00:01:43.470> dum

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you these flash and dash are made by dum

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.149 
you these flash and dash are made by dum
ba<00:01:44.070> dum<00:01:44.899> bar<00:01:45.899> toys<00:01:47.630> suit<00:01:48.630> their<00:01:48.899> flash<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
ba dum bar toys suit their flash and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.270 
ba dum bar toys suit their flash and
dash<00:01:51.439> tip<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.320> controller<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.250> on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
dash tip and and the controller is on

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.810 
dash tip and and the controller is on
the<00:01:56.579> side<00:01:57.079> you<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.110> flick<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.310> out<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the side you just flick that out and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.950 
the side you just flick that out and
bring<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.320> as<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> controller<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.960> then

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
bring it up as the controller and then

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.800 
bring it up as the controller and then
does<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.189> aerial<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.240> isn't<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.659> actual

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
does the aerial this isn't the actual

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
does the aerial this isn't the actual
aerial<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.590> comes<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.459> one<00:02:08.640> of

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
aerial that comes with it it's one of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.420 
aerial that comes with it it's one of
the<00:02:08.879> metal<00:02:09.270> aerials<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.959> pull<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:11.190> I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the metal aerials that you pull up but I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.520 
the metal aerials that you pull up but I
swapped<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
swapped it for one of the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.280 
swapped it for one of the
Ruba<00:02:14.220> aerials<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.600> can<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:15.960> with<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
Ruba aerials that you can get with the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.680 
Ruba aerials that you can get with the
regular<00:02:16.740> one<00:02:16.980> such<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.850> scaled<00:02:18.210> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
regular one such that you scaled and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.290 
regular one such that you scaled and
cause<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.540> goes<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.590> hole<00:02:22.650> here

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
cause that just goes in this hole here

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.810 
cause that just goes in this hole here
and<00:02:24.300> screw<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.990> there<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.640> I'm<00:02:29.640> not

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
and screw that in there and I'm not

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.520 
and screw that in there and I'm not
quite<00:02:30.030> sure<00:02:30.090> how<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.570> works<00:02:30.810> I've<00:02:31.260> not<00:02:31.410> been

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
quite sure how this works I've not been

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.190 
quite sure how this works I've not been
able<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.800> do<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.340> somehow<00:02:33.080> changing<00:02:34.080> this

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
able to do it but somehow changing this

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.560 
able to do it but somehow changing this
to<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.580> C<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.150> change<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
to be a and C you can change the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.920 
to be a and C you can change the
frequency<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.500> with<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.450> remote<00:02:39.450> something

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
frequency and with the remote something

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.360 
frequency and with the remote something
like<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.230> anyway<00:02:40.350> but<00:02:40.620> I'm<00:02:40.920> not<00:02:41.100> quite<00:02:41.280> sure

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
like that anyway but I'm not quite sure

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.550 
like that anyway but I'm not quite sure
how<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.790> works<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:43.190> forward<00:02:44.190> back<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.560> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
how that works and forward back and it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.440 
how that works and forward back and it
right<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:49.070> knit<00:02:50.070> that's<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.910> unscrew

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
right in like knit that's it unscrew

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.720 
right in like knit that's it unscrew
that<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.959> take<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.830> panel<00:02:53.100> off<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.580> that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
that and take the panel off and that

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.550 
that and take the panel off and that
takes<00:02:54.000> two<00:02:54.660> triple<00:02:55.650> A<00:02:55.739> batteries<00:02:57.560> that's
