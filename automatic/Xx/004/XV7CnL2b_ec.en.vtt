00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
to deal with their locks so but there's

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.280 
to deal with their locks so but there's
different<00:01:22.920> handles<00:01:23.430> I've<00:01:24.000> seen<00:01:24.360> online<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
different handles I've seen online this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.770 
different handles I've seen online this
is<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> basic<00:01:26.070> quick<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:27.270> quarter<00:01:27.570> turn

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
is the basic quick little quarter turn

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.770 
is the basic quick little quarter turn
so<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> six<00:01:29.220> digit<00:01:29.600> entry<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.750> can

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so it's like a six digit entry you can

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.180 
so it's like a six digit entry you can
change<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.350> haven't<00:01:31.530> changed<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:31.890> yet<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
change it I haven't changed it yet but I

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.700 
change it I haven't changed it yet but I
will<00:01:32.280> after<00:01:32.640> we're<00:01:33.000> done<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.170> once<00:01:34.650> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
will after we're done here so once you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.300 
will after we're done here so once you
punch<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.700> hit<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.940> pound<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:38.190> then

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310

when<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.490> open<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.790> what's<00:01:39.000> cool<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
when you open up what's cool about the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.780 
tactical 24s which I really like a lot
