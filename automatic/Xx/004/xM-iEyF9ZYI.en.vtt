 Ozaki Yutaka OH MY LITTLE GIRL Lyrics: Yu Ozaki Composition: Yu Ozaki 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:30.160
 You can not stand in such a noisy city 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:43.760
 Very small, very cold and crying girl 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:59.160
 While I smile with a little bit of love song on the street corner 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:12.720
 I'll freeze you so softly you'll kiss me 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.320
 Oh My Little Girl Let's warm up 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.960
 Oh My Little Girl I love you so much 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.240
 Oh My Little Girl 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.640
 While walking with my shoulders 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 I can not leave forever forever 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:14.600
 I'm looking at you dimly while brushing your hair 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:27.960
 I laugh innocently in a sweet voice, you wrapped in my arms 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.480
 Oh My Little Girl 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.080
 Oh My Little Girl I love you so much 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.200
 Oh My Little Girl 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.720
 The cold wind is the surpassing of two people 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:14.840
 I will never let you go away forever 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.720
 Oh My Little Girl Let's warm up 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.560
 Oh My Little Girl I love you so much 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.720
 Oh My Little Girl 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.400
 While walking with my shoulders 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:17.440
 I swear I will never leave forever 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.600
 Thank you for watching until the end
