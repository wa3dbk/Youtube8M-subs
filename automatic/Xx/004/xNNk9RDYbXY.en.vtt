00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello and welcome to the video 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.859
 tutorial for the successful playstation 4 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
 Egger and sharing is my name 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.670
 Christian and I accompany you today 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.380
 looking through the complete guide 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.920
 also sometimes on ours 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.020
 website after www.psi.de first wants 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.900
 I'll go into it and explain what is 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.180
 actually this egger and sharing 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.859
 It's actually easy to take explained 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.230
 we have a friend of yours one 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.460
 Playstation 4 and you certainly have 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.710
 a playstation 4 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.620
 All this is the basic requirement 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.649
 In any case must be fulfilled then 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.969
 he stops in the playstation store and 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.610
 buy yourself a game as it does 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.020
 would do again 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.719
 but now it is yours 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.600
 Friend also that one and the same 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.250
 game can also download the must 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.230
 do not pay anything extra 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.820
 Personally, I always do it like that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.260
 with my colleague that we are 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.359
 deny which game we have 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.440
 and then we will share 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.840
 just the cost 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.299
 We have this for fifa 14 the other day 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.119
 made and instead of 70 euros we have 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.710
 both 35 euros paid so I find 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.630
 it could not have been better 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.670
 the good thing is that here too 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.619
 continue with this game online 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.119
 you can even play in parallel 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.430
 simultaneously online against each other 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.400
 play even though you had us 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.439
 once you have acquired this game so the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.229
 very first question we ask now 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 Must be worth on all accounts use 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.000
 in this example I have now 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.619
 just two people invented 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 called anton and friedrich the im 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.640
 South Sudan now the main protagonists 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.430
 now that would be in your case, now you 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.780
 myself and a friend or relative ever 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.000
 after whom he stops the games 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 we just want to share now 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.549
 let's say that anton has two more 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.600
 siblings has named berta and emil 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.200
 Friedrich, on the other hand, has only one brother 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.360
 called gustav so now it is so we 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.570
 just take the em- 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.689
 Antony can use all accounts then 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.299
 it would be so now if it is berta 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.270
 She could log in without any problems 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.700
 all games that were shared play 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.890
 also e-mail had this 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.500
 slip and is expected to meet on their can 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.260
 play the game on his account 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.200
 However, gustav would log in 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.930
 he would have read a message that 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.690
 the game would not be playable so how 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.090
 said the account sharing is just 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.890
 one at a disadvantage and one, so to speak 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.130
 Preferably you have to stop in front 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.930
 excellent ford also decide with 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.310
 your friend with your relatives ever 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.459
 after who you stop this game with 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.470
 Shares in our example it stops 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.420
 something more logical to prefer the person 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.260
 she also has to have more siblings 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.000
 but not really 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.819
 basically also apply to you 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.620
 it can be for example that here because 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.319
 Do not take two siblings, for example 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.870
 but that somehow never play and 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.150
 Suppose your friend has as well 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.970
 only a brother but who cares every day 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.370
 and the change much more frequently 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.980
 the accounts for it just for him 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.530
 it would be better if he had this 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.030
 would have privilege 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.750
 so as I said speak with yours 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.739
 friend from one who just so to speak the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.049
 preferred that would be in this now 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.970
 Anton, for example, would be one of them 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.970
 disadvantaged that would be friedrich 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.810
 Let's start with the steps for 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.459
 to Friedrich 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.319
 So the first water has to do is 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.780
 turn on a console and get in 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.739
 log in his account 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.590
 there is then just touch Settings 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.909
 playstation network as its primary 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.680
 Activate ps4 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.459
 and most importantly, he clicks 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.140
 disable so now is a console 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.010
 no longer set as primary control 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.450
 but as a matter of seconds your console 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.030
 okay the last step the friedrich 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.250
 still has to do is the account data 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.500
 so his playstation network address 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.629
 and his password to the anton 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.609
 present 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:11.030
 Sun had done it's it 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.950
 go on with the steps for anton anton 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.349
 created now on his playstation 4 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.600
 a new user in the 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.030
 users now just from the data 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.370
 he just got peacefully 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.310
 he is now a as a new user 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.070
 and most important is that now 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.729
 anton this user as primary ps4 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.650
 activated and that's it 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.050
 actually with the complete tutorial 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.180
 it is so we just look at each other now 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.870
 how does it work ? 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.099
 to buy 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.800
 Let's just take a look at her 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:50.419
 be anton so what do you want now 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.669
 pay attention when you buy a game so you 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.310
 first you have to go into the account of yours 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.840
 friend log in 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.419
 and then you can from this account 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.289
 from play from the playstation store 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.780
 to buy 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.490
 after you downloaded the game 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.530
 and have it completely on the 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.510
 hard disk is you too again 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.930
 your account changes and you can do it 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.849
 synonymous play easily 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.340
 your friend, however, if he is now 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.960
 on his playstation 4 1 believes 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.440
 not even the account anymore 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.120
 switch 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.190
 he can easily come to his mac 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.780
 stay on it and playstation 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.300
 but simply the desired game 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.440
 to buy 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.660
 yes that's just now the 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.250
 basic as you both stop 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.310
 if you have a game , you have to proceed 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.729
 suppose your friend buys us 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.750
 now christened as friedrich 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.370
 has now become a game from the 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.710
 bought a playstation store 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.710
 then it would be so now you have to 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.930
 now on your playstation 4 in the 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.759
 log in your friend's account 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.419
 there he goes then into the playstation 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.910
 store and go to library you will 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.250
 see all the games he has bought 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.810
 will only be listed is yes too 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.220
 actually quite clear it's 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.770
 finally his account the nidda 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.440
 just downloads loads all the games 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.600
 down he wants to have and let 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.889
 Just load them 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.080
 as soon as you are done you can 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.699
 back on your account changes and their 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.500
 you can easily play 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.210
 have you bought a game so now 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.130
 on your playstation 4 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.300
 in friedrich's account for how it is 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.419
 is predetermined 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.979
 then i just had to be friend in 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.389
 log in his account 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.510
 ie that he was actually 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.220
 Anyway , he goes in the playstation anyway 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.810
 store and also finished in his 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.139
 library will be the whole 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.610
 Games are the ones you bought there 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.000
 then put her down and she can 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.169
 finish again without problems 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.699
 yes it was already with the 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.539
 tutorial I hope you have everything 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.610
 Roger that 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.770
 but you should still the one or 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.720
 you have no other question 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.360
 shy and just set them free 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.280
 out and I will definitely be there 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.320
 look at all the questions and try each one 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.740
 to answer as soon as it happens 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.860
 yes, that was christian von
