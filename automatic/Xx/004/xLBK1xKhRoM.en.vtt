00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.370
 and even he apologized because it happens that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 and even this claim goes up in volume to 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.119
 the fifa for not wanting to not accept that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.730
 the shooting of the plays are part 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.050
 of arbitration now I rescue are worth 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.240
 much what it says 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.730
 rigoberto good habits always 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.679
 they are wrong but they are always wrong and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.360
 we are going to have pretexts to say and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.090
 to blame whoever it is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.370
 permission we recognize our 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 own mistakes and understand what it is that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.090
 is failing us to embrace the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.860
 current we will always be in 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 eighth finals there will never be fifth 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.340
 good for more souls and we're always going to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.260
 say good the same the last one was the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.120
 referee today was the piggy players 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.100
 because I was bitten by anything always 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 it's good to say I lost when 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 we were in the early morning that we arrived 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.579
 here excélsior tb I listened to rigo a 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.700
 rigoberto placencia and I said I like 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.399
 How much are you giving us? 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.159
 to be able to understand what has happened and 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.340
 I really get in the field of 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.969
 watering obviously as neophyte as 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.759
 villamelón the one that I am but in attention to 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:23.549
 the heads that today share a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.009
 general reading with these dark clearings 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.710
 vianney that we're finally going to face 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.560
 the next hours they fell on their feet 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.469
 says excélsior but they fell but they fell 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.500
 but good, this part of it stands out 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:41.459
 they played it that there was an intention one 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.860
 fight but finally if they fell as 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:47.490
 thorns signs we stole the match 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.429
 is the vision that Mexicans have of 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.009
 according to the ulises survey 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.579
 beltrán and stands out in this 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.849
 cover that the boys reach the fifth 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.799
 Costa Ricans achieve it because they do not 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.689
 impressive the party of the 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.479
 Costa Ricans in the end to overcome in a 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.660
 line was a robben tell us holland 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.079
 eliminates mexico and this way of reading what 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.079
 We're seeing 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.120
 and because I think that this head of 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.490
 Super Arena line would then 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.620
 highlighting stressing the mood as 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.830
 you want to live and how you want to read 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.710
 that we were robbed and here would be the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.950
 they fell on their feet the tri kept the illusion 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.540
 of a whole country for 88 minutes up 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.050
 that Dutch pressure yielded its 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.910
 first fruit and then a dubious penalty 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.070
 caused by ro alive in the cartwheel 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.790
 with a level of the game that made you forget 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.620
 the disastrous stage of the tie 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.650
 Mexico concluded with dignity its 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.650
 participation in the world cup is today 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.950
 the reading now gives us extension now 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.570
 would also say those who know what 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.150
 understand what the first one was 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.560
 penalty that did not mark us clear and some 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.260
 sometimes they did not steal they were a penalty 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.290
 from the beginning marked very doubtful 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.970
 platinum marked also very doubtful is not 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.880
 ask then what 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.920
 we are very sensitive very sensitive way 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.900
 it's very important as I said you are the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.200
 defeat to me happens to me very personally 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.140
 Of course I've lived a lot of years and that's 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.960
 help but and I always tell them to my 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.270
 children it is very important to listen as 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.850
 someone is aware of himself 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.760
 his story and I feel very sad 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.310
 when I hear is that now the truck 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.380
 left is that now and is that so-and-so is 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.960
 that my boss did not want me and is that the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.720
 teacher looked at me badly when you 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.540
 you listen to those stories of all I do not 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.560
 they want or I'm the ugly duckling because 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.110
 they look ugly but I'm pretty 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.200
 there are problems now the serious problem if 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.989
 this was not enough to prove this 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.140
 theme of sensitivity that such yesterday the 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.480
 scandal scandal of klm of the 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.989
 airline where burial 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.450
 gael Garcia because they put a 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.790
 exit with a hat and a mustache and 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.650
 then that unworthy us as Mexicans 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.540
 because the only ones we can say 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.700
 charros ourselves and all Vigo 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.250
 we are we who nobody else 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.740
 Say and Gil Garcia sending a tweet from 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.990
 never again will I go back up whole 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.300
 and there are god that there are links we are 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.060
 able to approach you know that this 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.180
 hypersensitivity also hinders us 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.100
 but well that does not go much there is that 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.320
 ability to laugh that we have of 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.770
 ironize we also have to apply it 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.419
 with us it is not that we are offended 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.720
 we stop making sense we should 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:54.229
 comes much more and accept when we 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.660
 We were wrong to ask for forgiveness to ask for permission and 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.450
 thank you I think there are three big 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.770
 things that many times you observe and I 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.800
 I observe it in the new generals 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.099
 They have a hard time asking for permission 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.370
 sorry and give thanks when what 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:13.520
 you build also has to do with the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.860
 help solidarity or participation 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.020
 of the others if you say that mexico does not 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.930
 We know how to lose if we do not lose ourselves 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.849
 very bad even though we are very 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.090
 used to losing and we have that 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.099
 We always feel in eighths 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.639
 we always have are the very sensitive 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.530
 very very sensitive and how to assimilate 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.349
 I think they make you stronger 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.169
 When you say I was good and bad 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.889
 this I regué sorry 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.720
 diane and I was late I fell asleep I do not know 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:49.419
 learn to recognize in brno are the 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.669
 alarm clock are people your polo polo is 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:56.000
 very very interesting to see how we build 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:59.569
 our own story and we are taking 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.849
 the lessons of defeat forward 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.429
 or not 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.919
 and remember that news is always going to see 

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:08.379
 what is important is how is it reported 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.860
 by excélsior television news that 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:10.860
 they say more
