other and he's like he's a rock star and

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.640 
other and he's like he's a rock star and
he<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.500> does<00:03:37.739> he<00:03:38.010> really<00:03:38.130> was<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:40.560> know

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
he just does he really was and you know

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.350 
he just does he really was and you know
I<00:03:40.680> think<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.489> don't<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.150> he<00:03:42.239> would<00:03:42.329> have

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
I think that I don't think he would have

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.240 
I think that I don't think he would have
been<00:03:42.540> comfortable<00:03:42.930> with<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.530> think<00:03:44.130> he'd

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
been comfortable with that I think he'd

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.759 
been comfortable with that I think he'd
be<00:03:44.400> more<00:03:44.430> comfortable<00:03:44.910> with<00:03:45.030> whether<00:03:45.299> geek<00:03:45.769> as

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
be more comfortable with whether geek as

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.140 
be more comfortable with whether geek as
funny<00:03:47.069> as<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.250> sounds<00:03:47.730> because<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.940> think

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
funny as it sounds because I think

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.250 
funny as it sounds because I think
that's<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.390> kind<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.599> person<00:03:48.930> he<00:03:49.019> was

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
that's the kind of person he was

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.350 
that's the kind of person he was
and<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:50.700> know<00:03:50.760> he<00:03:50.849> was<00:03:50.970> very<00:03:51.090> passionate
