00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.870 
but as for 60fps I mean first you can't
really<00:00:59.649> I<00:00:59.710> don't<00:00:59.800> think<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.070> can<00:01:00.190> see<00:01:00.430> 60<00:01:00.850> FPS

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.259 
really I don't think you can see 60 FPS
on<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.360> mobile<00:01:01.660> device<00:01:01.840> yet<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.700> need<00:01:03.700> to<00:01:03.880> buy<00:01:04.210> it

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269

60fps yet but I think in the future I'll
have<00:01:10.180> it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080
