00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.020 
pounds and this is a Les Paul Studio and
so<00:02:32.409> it<00:02:32.530> doesn't<00:02:32.829> quite<00:02:33.010> have<00:02:33.310> all<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.730> frills

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
so it doesn't quite have all the frills

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.059 
so it doesn't quite have all the frills
and<00:02:34.269> standard<00:02:34.840> Les<00:02:34.989> Paul<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.650> can<00:02:35.769> see<00:02:35.920> it's

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
and standard Les Paul you can see it's

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.190 
and standard Les Paul you can see it's
pretty<00:02:36.220> basic<00:02:36.549> dot<00:02:37.060> inlays<00:02:37.329> rather<00:02:37.900> than<00:02:38.079> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
pretty basic dot inlays rather than the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.399 
pretty basic dot inlays rather than the
fancier<00:02:38.680> trapezoidal<00:02:39.489> inlays<00:02:40.230> pickups<00:02:41.230> are

fancier trapezoidal inlays pickups are

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.860 
fancier trapezoidal inlays pickups are
uncovered<00:02:42.069> it's<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.670> classic<00:02:42.909> dual

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
uncovered it's the classic dual

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.830 
uncovered it's the classic dual
humbucker<00:02:44.439> style<00:02:45.129> which<00:02:45.879> i<00:02:46.030> think<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.420> gives

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
humbucker style which i think is gives

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.460 
humbucker style which i think is gives

you know it's a pretty basic

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.809 
you know it's a pretty basic
stripped-down<00:02:52.180> finish<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.400> for<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
stripped-down finish but for the for the

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.149 
stripped-down finish but for the for the
price<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.480> think<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.230> really<00:02:56.500> can't<00:02:56.799> go<00:02:56.950> wrong

set neck the way that's created but you

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.530 
set neck the way that's created but you
can<00:03:23.379> do<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:23.919> as<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.909> said<00:03:24.970> it's<00:03:25.299> got<00:03:25.479> a

can do it and as I said it's got a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.869 
can do it and as I said it's got a
pretty<00:03:25.870> nice<00:03:26.049> overall<00:03:26.889> construction<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.729> it

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
pretty nice overall construction to it

pretty nice overall construction to it
the<00:03:28.419> only<00:03:28.690> thing<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:29.019> don't<00:03:29.079> like<00:03:29.409> about<00:03:29.560> this

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979 
the only thing I don't like about this

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.030 
the only thing I don't like about this
guitar<00:03:30.129> is<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.669> tuners<00:03:31.329> there<00:03:32.229> Grover<00:03:32.769> tuners

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
guitar is the tuners there Grover tuners

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.800 
guitar is the tuners there Grover tuners
but<00:03:33.970> they're<00:03:34.150> not<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.449> highest<00:03:34.629> quality

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
but they're not the highest quality

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.469 
but they're not the highest quality
Grover<00:03:35.379> tuners<00:03:35.590> I've<00:03:35.919> ever<00:03:36.129> seen<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.090> find

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:37.479 
Grover tuners I've ever seen so I find

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.330 
Grover tuners I've ever seen so I find
that<00:03:37.569> this<00:03:37.750> guitar<00:03:37.959> does<00:03:38.349> go<00:03:38.500> out<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.799> tune

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
that this guitar does go out of tune

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.649 
that this guitar does go out of tune
you<00:03:39.430> know<00:03:39.549> today<00:03:39.909> how<00:03:40.090> much<00:03:40.239> you<00:03:40.419> playing

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
you know today how much you playing

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.349 
you know today how much you playing
every<00:03:40.989> few<00:03:41.169> days<00:03:41.349> few<00:03:41.799> weeks<00:03:42.099> you<00:03:43.060> have<00:03:43.209> to

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
every few days few weeks you have to

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.379 
every few days few weeks you have to
readjust<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.019> tuners<00:03:44.349> it's<00:03:44.739> not<00:03:44.919> awful<00:03:45.579> but

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
readjust the tuners it's not awful but

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.089 
readjust the tuners it's not awful but
it's<00:03:46.510> something<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.870> keep<00:03:47.019> in<00:03:47.169> mind<00:03:47.229> you<00:03:47.859> could

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
it's something to keep in mind you could

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.830 
it's something to keep in mind you could
obviously<00:03:48.250> upgrade<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> tuners<00:03:49.479> and<00:03:49.720> other

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
obviously upgrade the tuners and other

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.020 
obviously upgrade the tuners and other
people<00:03:50.199> have<00:03:50.290> upgraded<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.949> pickups<00:03:51.340> but

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
people have upgraded the pickups but

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.729 
people have upgraded the pickups but
frankly<00:03:52.389> I<00:03:52.449> think<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.720> pickups<00:03:53.109> sound<00:03:53.409> just

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
frankly I think the pickups sound just

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.250 
frankly I think the pickups sound just
terrific<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:54.609> there's<00:03:54.790> really<00:03:55.000> no<00:03:55.959> need<00:03:56.109> to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
terrific so there's really no need to

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.530 
terrific so there's really no need to
upgrade<00:03:56.349> pickups<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.819> let's<00:03:57.970> take<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:58.389> out

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
upgrade pickups so let's take it out

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.439 
upgrade pickups so let's take it out
with<00:03:58.750> one<00:03:59.260> last<00:03:59.560> Steve<00:04:00.459> Jones<00:04:00.760> lick<00:04:01.090> and

with one last Steve Jones lick and

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.960
