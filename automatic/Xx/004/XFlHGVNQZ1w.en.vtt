go ahead and pause it right here so one

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
go ahead and pause it right here so one
of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> difficult<00:01:19.560> things<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.830> discern<00:01:20.250> was

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
of the difficult things to discern was

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.290 
of the difficult things to discern was
enemy<00:01:21.119> players<00:01:21.710> from<00:01:22.710> enemy<00:01:23.100> BOTS<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
enemy players from enemy BOTS and the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.120 
enemy players from enemy BOTS and the
perfect<00:01:24.539> way<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.899> do<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.500> look<00:01:25.979> at

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
perfect way to do that is to look at

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100 
perfect way to do that is to look at
your<00:01:26.250> killfeed<00:01:26.789> because<00:01:27.599> you<00:01:27.720> notice<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
your killfeed because you notice the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
your killfeed because you notice the
difference<00:01:28.410> in<00:01:28.560> points<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.160> well<00:01:29.190> as<00:01:29.520> the
