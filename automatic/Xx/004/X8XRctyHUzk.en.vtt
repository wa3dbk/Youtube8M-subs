00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.650
 Everyone is a lucky boy 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.970
 It is this time Well 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.580
 before 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.360
 I did the opening video of this 3 ds sound software, but I said that among them 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.480
 but 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.840
 Ah 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.440
 Impressions that went a bit 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.700
 I think I can tell everyone 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.060
 See that play video 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:32.559
 It is the best to upload 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.370
 I think that the best thing to actually upload is it is easy to understand from the people you are watching 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.320
 Oh 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.610
 Basically, you have videos that you get stuck in your affiliation right 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.610
 I try not to make it 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:52.850
 I say that human touch on human nature 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.450
 Murda ok say the video sound up of I Well can I was that ok 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.760
 But most of the time 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.120
 is no out ok 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.370
 I will explain this time orally 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.730
 think 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:15.710
 I think this game is quite different like it is not like it 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:19.190
 I already say that that mall 9 is quite monotonous 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:24.880
 It is possible to do do anymore but I was working 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.870
 Since become feeling that eats How did things like pretty much was like 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.180
 Oh 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 Monotonous 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:37.130
 There is no change in work, either. Well there is no such thing 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.870
 I think it is not suitable for people who say it is a room 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.860
 Well if you say that well 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.110
 Do complex things 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.880
 It's not because I have to 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.590
 I No I say not proceed in that machine I is difficult 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.930
 The thing is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.140
 If there is almost nothing 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:02.909
 I think so I 'm pretty wide 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.180
 Age Soma Target Broad Ranged Well 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.000
 Children Tachine 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.700
 I wonder if I could do it well 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.050
 It's like a song 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.190
 That 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.010
 Because you can proceed with simple operation 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.430
 Ah 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.430
 That side is that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.240
 I wonder if the smaller your child like 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.240
 I think that I think we great wish I was I home are 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.269
 Di moon 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.490
 Well, I'd have been doing quite a splash Pokemon series 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.940
 It is different from these ordinary Pokemon 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.470
 Another also do I'd started doing another Sotto 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.940
 Oh 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.720
 I think I will tell you what's different 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.890
 I think I'm going to raise it, but first let me say that 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.510
 Oh dear 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:01.750
 Because this game has no concept of level 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.030
 So it looks like the usual usual Pokemon 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.150
 Ne 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:16.010
 I went up the Well steadily level I Pokemo with attachment attachment to the end 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.010
 It feels like you can't use 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.560
 Well that 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.670
 The game is going to keep going 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.670
 Enemy of heat elsewhere 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.690
 Topple it by using it the first Pokemon that went into the mind got the better Well Nde will become stronger 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.070
 As well 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.070
 Hey Nde there is a difference between the 2 of 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.970
 So I think it will be quite difficult to defeat, so naturally 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:53.120
 Your Pokemon also Well 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:55.810
 You do not even not want to use defect so that we use in favor of the other strong Byun 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.810
 With the kana 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.550
 It is not in the wish of the level but 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.550
 Technician 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.180
 I want to remember a variety of techniques I can change a lot 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.810
 Oh dear 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.810
 Is it good ? 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.739
 The rest is 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:25.550
 Ordinary Pokemon Well 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.729
 I think it feels like throwing a monster ball and using it, but this time 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.729
 Well 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:40.040
 Well, because also it is and defeat the enemy feel I mean not or become a friend to the random 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:44.800
 Well to say many times also it is If we had been want Pokemon repeat the same dungeon 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:50.099
 You can kill something and get it 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.099
 It feels like you have to keep doing it until you 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:05:00.910
 Even if I get a Pokemon that has entered the sun, I guess that's why 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:04.440
 As you move forward, the blur will be weaker again 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:10.310
 I always unless we changed it more and more 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.310
 I think the pattern is a feeling that Pokemon is changing 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:20.820
 I also have a story 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:23.360
 I wonder if this is a relatively deep story 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.360
 I think 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.380
 Because 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.600
 children 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.600
 Pretty cine was a small child 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.250
 That 's why you look 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.510
 Sichuan 2 targets small children 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.020
 I wonder if I 'm focusing 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.020
 I think I 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.340
 That's right 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:59.620
 I am 23 now but I am 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:03.360
 Well, since it is not apart from hate to say much to do to continue Rutte the same work 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.360
 Is this interesting? 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.940
 I think it is a friend, so I can play a match, so in that sense too 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.129
 I think it's interesting 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:21.050
 Like it is also possible to say to advance the story You can also play against annual income and your friends now 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.050
 Because 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.500
 In that sense, hey 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.040
 I guess it 's interesting 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.040
 think 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:38.910
 Is that the side 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.300
 So if you don't like simple tasks then this game won't fit well 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.270
 Naa am 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:48.330
 Sound of lemon also looks 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:50.289
 It feels pretty cute, so I say so I like cute people 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.600
 Is it OK to try? 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:55.780
 It will'm not difficult to see 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.650
 In I think it's a game that can be easily 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:03.940
 If it is good 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:05.330
 How about trying it? I think that I want to conclude with this side this time 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.710
 everyone 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.710
 Thank you very much
