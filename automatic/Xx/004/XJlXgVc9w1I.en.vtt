 on the work surface 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.900
 we make our own folds 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.150
 bread we give the desired shape e 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.030

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.140
 always covered with the oven off 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.950
 directly on the pan where we are going 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.950

 of water with regard to cooking 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.739
 it took fifteen in my oven 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.430
 minutes but once it is golden brown 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.919
