all<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:02.090> here's<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.179> shot<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.659> head<00:00:03.990> at

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
all right here's a shot of the head at

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.050 
all right here's a shot of the head at
the<00:00:04.799> top<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.160> piston<00:00:05.520> in<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.670> head<00:00:05.850> I'll

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
the top of the piston in the head I'll

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.670 
the top of the piston in the head I'll
get<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.330> head<00:00:06.450> here<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.750> second<00:00:07.049> after

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
get to the head here in a second after

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.290 
get to the head here in a second after
running<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:10.370> HHO<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.700> about<00:00:11.880> five<00:00:12.269> hours

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
running it on HHO for about five hours

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.210 
running it on HHO for about five hours
see<00:00:13.200> if<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.380> can<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:15.350> little<00:00:16.350> granulated<00:00:16.740> forget

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
see if I can a little granulated forget

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.689 
see if I can a little granulated forget
to<00:00:17.460> close<00:00:22.970> there<00:00:23.970> don't<00:00:24.150> let<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.420> sit<00:00:25.699> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
to close there don't let that sit the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.640 
to close there don't let that sit the
edges<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.119> starting<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.510> clean<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.510> before

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
edges are starting to clean up so before

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.990 
edges are starting to clean up so before
the<00:00:31.650> entire<00:00:31.890> piston<00:00:32.309> was<00:00:32.399> coated<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the entire piston was coated in a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.440 
the entire piston was coated in a
coating<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> lacquer<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:36.000> edges<00:00:36.300> are<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
coating like a lacquer the edges are a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.840 
coating like a lacquer the edges are a
lot<00:00:36.719> cleaner<00:00:36.989> now<00:00:37.399> it's<00:00:38.399> starting<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> clean

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
lot cleaner now it's starting to clean

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
lot cleaner now it's starting to clean
up<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.090> area<00:00:39.450> I'm<00:00:39.660> gonna<00:00:39.809> look<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> other

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
up this area I'm gonna look at the other

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.330 
up this area I'm gonna look at the other
video<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.309> confirm<00:00:42.950> but<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.100> looking

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
video just to confirm but it's looking

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
video just to confirm but it's looking
like<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.730> lot<00:00:44.969> lighter<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:46.050> still<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.620> it's

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
like a lot lighter it's still there it's

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.690 
like a lot lighter it's still there it's
a<00:00:47.219> pretty<00:00:47.399> heavy<00:00:47.610> layer<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:50.190> seems<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.610> be

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
a pretty heavy layer but it seems to be

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.910 
a pretty heavy layer but it seems to be
dissipating<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.449> burning<00:00:51.780> off<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.289> think

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
dissipating and burning off I think

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.850 
dissipating and burning off I think
you'll<00:00:53.070> probably<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.489> run<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
you'll probably have to run it for a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.590 
you'll probably have to run it for a
good<00:00:55.860> length<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.250> time<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.059> crud

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
good length of time to get all that crud

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:12.140 
good length of time to get all that crud
out<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.190> see<00:01:00.800> in<00:01:01.800> there

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.550 

okay<00:01:12.750> there's<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.230> head<00:01:13.910> zoom<00:01:14.910> in<00:01:15.120> I'm<00:01:15.210> good

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.860 

you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.980> right<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> edge<00:01:24.510> of<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
you can see right on the edge of the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.280 
you can see right on the edge of the
exhaust<00:01:25.260> valve<00:01:25.590> there<00:01:26.390> it's<00:01:27.390> real<00:01:27.750> clean

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
exhaust valve there it's real clean

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.550 
exhaust valve there it's real clean
so<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.190> gases<00:01:29.550> race<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.380> cleans<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so as the gases race out it cleans it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.070 
so as the gases race out it cleans it
out<00:01:33.710> around<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.950> intake<00:01:35.400> valve<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.840> side

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
out around the intake valve on this side

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.830 
out around the intake valve on this side
seems<00:01:37.410> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.650> clearing<00:01:37.980> up<00:01:38.190> right<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.300> there

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
seems to be clearing up right in there

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.900 
seems to be clearing up right in there
in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.050> corner<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:41.670> spark<00:01:42.120> plug

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
in the corner the spark plug

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.640 
in the corner the spark plug
still<00:01:44.910> looks<00:01:45.180> pristine<00:01:48.350> looks<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
still looks pristine looks like it's

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.730 
still looks pristine looks like it's
dusty<00:01:50.010> from<00:01:50.100> sitting<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> shelf<00:01:50.850> anything

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
dusty from sitting on a shelf anything

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.780 
dusty from sitting on a shelf anything
so<00:01:52.820> that's<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.150> got<00:01:54.330> right<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.700> I'm

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
so that's what we got right there so I'm

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.860 
so that's what we got right there so I'm
gonna<00:01:56.910> take<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> look<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.360> both<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> videos

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
gonna take a look at both the videos

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.929 
gonna take a look at both the videos
side<00:01:58.110> by<00:01:58.260> side<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.160> see<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.790> get

curiosity really it is what it is so
probably<00:02:13.900> continue<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.349> running<00:02:14.590> tomorrow

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
probably continue the running tomorrow

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.440 
probably continue the running tomorrow
I'm<00:02:15.160> gonna<00:02:15.310> do<00:02:15.459> an<00:02:15.550> oil<00:02:15.670> change<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.269> I'll<00:02:16.330> get

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
I'm gonna do an oil change and I'll get

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.059 
I'm gonna do an oil change and I'll get
that<00:02:16.569> on<00:02:16.720> video<00:02:16.870> too<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.530> guys<00:02:17.590> can<00:02:17.860> see
