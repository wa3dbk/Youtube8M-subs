00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello to all this goes clear beaulac 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.590
 guitar and guitar teacher 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.420
 for the deviation curves but you have me 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.279
 the air known a quick swipe 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
 rock'n'roll I did not even plug my 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.730
 baby in the bazaar of my preparations 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600
 for my departure on a summer vacation tomorrow 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.150
 to explain the concepts 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.460
 indispensable that are the binary and the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590
 ternary in battery and you give a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.780
 an exercise that will be extremely useful 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.309
 a binary rhythm it's a risk in 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.910
 which the pulsation some his name 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.430
 tempo is subdivided by 2 by 4 or among 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.260
 16 basically, it never happens when 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.000
 it is for sure halved they are 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.950
 eighths by four they are doubles 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.489
 eighths by eight they are triples 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.770
 eighths in opposition we have and 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.829
 ternary rhythms in which the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.379
 pulsation and sub divided by 3 in this 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.660
 case there are triplets or by six 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.890
 these are sextos them and for 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.329
 the exercise that comes I myself 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.730
 stolen by 12 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.860
 but I do not 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.750
 it's not how it's called I believe 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.020
 not that it bears a particular name to 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.330
 you find for this exercise 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.220
 we will ideally play the metronome 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.840
 if you have one use it we will 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.170
 alternate right-hand and 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.620
 left 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:30.110
 and we will go with a tempo and range 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:36.860
 two shots per pulse a3 a4 a6 a8 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.600
 at 12 then we will go down 12 8 6-4 3-2 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.940
 if you get to do that you'll be 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.530
 much more comfortable in all 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:52.610
 rhythms that you do and you will 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:54.410
 well progressed well 2 2 1 2 3 i you 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.850
 stop right now I stop everything from 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.010
 next when doing triplets 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.270
 that is 3 coubard pulsations seen 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.800
 alternating right left right 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.370
 left 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.590
 it will do 1 2 3 1 2 3 so the first 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.820
 1 will fall on the right hand 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.820
 the second will fall on the left hand 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:11.320
 you take care of you 3 3 3 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:54.810
 a good holiday
