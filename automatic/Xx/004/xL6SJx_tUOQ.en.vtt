hammers<00:00:07.200> are<00:00:07.559> extremely<00:00:08.069> important<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
hammers are extremely important to a

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.779 
hammers are extremely important to a
good<00:00:09.330> piano<00:00:09.660> there<00:00:10.469> are<00:00:10.709> variable<00:00:11.219> qualities

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:11.789 
good piano there are variable qualities

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.410 
good piano there are variable qualities
of<00:00:11.820> felts<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.930> are<00:00:13.049> used<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:14.100> then<00:00:14.789> in

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
of felts that are used and then in

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.320 
of felts that are used and then in
addition<00:00:15.600> there<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.379> different<00:00:17.340> degrees<00:00:17.730> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
addition there is different degrees of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.630 
addition there is different degrees of
hardness<00:00:18.869> they<00:00:19.380> all<00:00:19.560> usually<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.340> lacquer

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
hardness they all usually have lacquer

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.610 
hardness they all usually have lacquer
in<00:00:20.970> them<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.170> most

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
in them not all but most

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.950 
in them not all but most
and<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.250> more<00:00:23.430> lacquer<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.820> treat<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:24.900> with

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
and the more lacquer you treat them with

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.050 
and the more lacquer you treat them with
the<00:00:25.110> heart<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> hammer<00:00:26.100> becomes<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the heart of the hammer becomes and the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.750 
the heart of the hammer becomes and the
less<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.720> softer<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.530> we<00:00:28.980> want<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.520> less

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
less the softer if we want to have less

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.760 
less the softer if we want to have less
we<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.030> needle<00:00:30.600> them<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.020> various<00:00:31.500> places

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
we can needle them in various places

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.220 
we can needle them in various places
depending<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:33.059> resulting<00:00:33.660> type<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.989> tone

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
depending on the resulting type of tone

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
depending on the resulting type of tone
we<00:00:34.469> want<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.859> of<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.129> hammer<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:36.120> really

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
we want out of that hammer it's really

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.800 
we want out of that hammer it's really
quite<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.629> art<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:38.760> would<00:00:39.000> loosen<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
quite an art and that would loosen the

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.990 
quite an art and that would loosen the
fibers<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.560> little<00:00:40.620> bit<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.579> lacquer

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
fibers a little bit and the lacquer

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.229 
fibers a little bit and the lacquer
between<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> fibers<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.610> necessary<00:00:44.790> if

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
between the fibers and if necessary if

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.240 
between the fibers and if necessary if
you<00:00:45.300> wanted<00:00:45.540> harder<00:00:45.960> or<00:00:46.200> brighter<00:00:46.620> sounding

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you wanted harder or brighter sounding

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.430 
you wanted harder or brighter sounding
loud<00:00:47.910> or<00:00:48.149> -<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.440> add<00:00:49.649> more<00:00:49.890> lacquer<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
loud or - we can add more lacquer to it

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.020 
loud or - we can add more lacquer to it
but<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.040> voice<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.520> instrument

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
but that is the voice of the instrument

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.000 
but that is the voice of the instrument
and<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.300> good<00:00:54.510> piano<00:00:55.110> has<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.800> good

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and a good piano has to have good

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
and a good piano has to have good
hammers<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.030> take<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> best<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.750> panels

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
hammers if you take the best of panels

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229 
hammers if you take the best of panels
and<00:00:58.230> put<00:00:58.440> crummy<00:00:58.770> hammers<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.790> them<00:01:00.059> it's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and put crummy hammers on them it's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.830 
and put crummy hammers on them it's
gonna<00:01:00.420> sound<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:00.870> before<00:01:02.300> besides<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.719> have

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
gonna sound very before besides we have

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.029 
gonna sound very before besides we have
a<00:01:03.870> good<00:01:04.110> hammer<00:01:04.320> though<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> has<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> be

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
a good hammer though it has to be

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.850 
a good hammer though it has to be
adjusted<00:01:05.159> very<00:01:05.759> closely<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.899> that<00:01:07.259> each

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
adjusted very closely so that each

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
adjusted very closely so that each
hammer<00:01:08.280> hits<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.030> two<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.450> three<00:01:09.690> strings

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
hammer hits the one two or three strings

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
hammer hits the one two or three strings
properly<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:11.940> three<00:01:12.060> strings<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
properly if there are three strings that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 
properly if there are three strings that
they're<00:01:12.780> leveled<00:01:13.310> because<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.520> could<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
they're leveled because one could be a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.219 
they're leveled because one could be a
little<00:01:14.820> higher<00:01:15.180> than<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.540> other<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
little higher than the other we have to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
little higher than the other we have to
level<00:01:16.440> those<00:01:16.650> first<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.909> hammer

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
level those first so that the hammer

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.450 
level those first so that the hammer
hits<00:01:18.510> all<00:01:18.780> three<00:01:19.260> equally<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.190> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
hits all three equally or all to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.690 
hits all three equally or all to
whichever<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:22.070> we<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.250> want<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.549> any

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
whichever and we don't want to have any

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
whichever and we don't want to have any
dips<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> felt<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> might<00:01:25.380> not

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
dips in the felt because it might not

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.250 
dips in the felt because it might not
hit<00:01:25.770> squarely<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.760> three<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.840> once<00:01:28.020> that's

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
hit squarely on all three so once that's

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.460 
hit squarely on all three so once that's
all<00:01:28.500> leveled<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> accurately<00:01:30.240> placed<00:01:31.080> left

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
all leveled and accurately placed left

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
all leveled and accurately placed left
to<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> they're<00:01:32.400> hitting

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to right so that they're hitting

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.840 
to right so that they're hitting
squarely<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.670> you've

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
squarely on then you know that you've

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.690 
squarely on then you know that you've
gotten<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.570> ultimate<00:01:37.369> out<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
gotten the ultimate out of the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.240 
gotten the ultimate out of the
instrument<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.630> then<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> need<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.100> go

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
instrument and then if you need to go

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.789 
instrument and then if you need to go
brighter<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.759> less<00:01:41.909> bright<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.799> affect

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
brighter or less bright you can affect

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.100 
brighter or less bright you can affect
that<00:01:44.009> by<00:01:44.310> changing<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.390> hardness<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
that by changing the hardness of the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
that by changing the hardness of the
hammer<00:01:47.659> this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> fulcrum<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.729> lever

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
hammer this is the fulcrum of the lever

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.340 
hammer this is the fulcrum of the lever
so<00:01:51.420> there's<00:01:52.200> another<00:01:52.409> pin<00:01:52.829> inside<00:01:54.079> that<00:01:55.610> goes

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
so there's another pin inside that goes

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.920 
so there's another pin inside that goes
through<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> hole<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.130> middle<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.930> tried

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
through the hole in the middle I tried

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.630 
through the hole in the middle I tried
to<00:02:01.049> strategically<00:02:01.649> place<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> right

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
to strategically place that on the right

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.330 
to strategically place that on the right
spot<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> right<00:02:03.930> balance<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.649> in

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
spot so you get the right balance and in

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.270 
spot so you get the right balance and in
between<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:06.210> hole<00:02:07.489> is<00:02:08.489> lined<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.569> felt<00:02:10.280> you

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
between this hole is lined with felt you

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.740 
between this hole is lined with felt you
want<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.579> to<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.790> tight<00:02:12.360> enough<00:02:12.689> so

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
want that to be just tight enough so

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.589 
want that to be just tight enough so
there's<00:02:13.110> not<00:02:13.319> side<00:02:13.680> play<00:02:14.069> but<00:02:14.819> not<00:02:14.969> so<00:02:15.239> tight

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
there's not side play but not so tight

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.780 
there's not side play but not so tight
that<00:02:15.659> it<00:02:15.959> binds<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.680> sometimes<00:02:17.069> they<00:02:17.579> can

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
that it binds and sometimes they can

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.640 
that it binds and sometimes they can
little<00:02:18.000> too<00:02:18.150> tight<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.659> newer<00:02:18.900> pianos<00:02:19.379> or<00:02:19.530> if

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
little too tight on newer pianos or if

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.910 
little too tight on newer pianos or if
it<00:02:19.739> swells<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.219> with<00:02:20.719> moisture<00:02:21.719> in<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.709> air

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
it swells up with moisture in the air

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.890 
it swells up with moisture in the air
you<00:02:23.670> might<00:02:23.819> get<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> little<00:02:24.209> binding<00:02:24.629> there<00:02:24.780> but

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
you might get a little binding there but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.380 
you might get a little binding there but
it's<00:02:24.989> much<00:02:25.140> easier<00:02:25.829> to<00:02:26.250> open<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:27.000> hole<00:02:27.329> a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
it's much easier to open that hole a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.679 
it's much easier to open that hole a
little<00:02:27.689> bit<00:02:27.810> by<00:02:27.989> compressing<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:30.209> size<00:02:30.480> of

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
little bit by compressing it the size of

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.949 
little bit by compressing it the size of
the<00:02:30.870> key<00:02:31.170> or<00:02:31.909> actually<00:02:32.909> taking<00:02:33.659> a<00:02:33.750> little

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the key or actually taking a little

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.800 
the key or actually taking a little

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
higher in the metal iron we have in side

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.699 
higher in the metal iron we have in side
there<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.290> will<00:02:38.000> then<00:02:39.000> flatten<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.319> phelps

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
there that will then flatten the phelps

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.759 
there that will then flatten the phelps
a<00:02:40.829> little<00:02:41.069> bit<00:02:41.220> after<00:02:41.879> while<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.269> get<00:02:42.420> worn

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
a little bit after while they get worn

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.530 
a little bit after while they get worn
and<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.920> need<00:02:44.099> your<00:02:44.280> keys<00:02:44.519> reached<00:02:45.060> these<00:02:45.389> are

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
and you need your keys reached these are

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.119 
and you need your keys reached these are
called<00:02:45.750> bushings<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.680> center<00:02:46.980> rail

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
called bushings this is the center rail

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.470 
called bushings this is the center rail
bushing<00:02:47.639> and<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:48.359> have<00:02:48.540> also<00:02:48.750> another<00:02:49.530> one

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
bushing and we have also another one

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.699 
bushing and we have also another one
under<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.689> front<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.230> key<00:02:52.409> there's

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
under the front of the key there's

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.979 
under the front of the key there's
another<00:02:52.920> pin<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:54.239> goes<00:02:54.269> through<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.810> hole

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
another pin that goes through the hole

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.559 
another pin that goes through the hole
at<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.260> bottom<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.919> help<00:02:56.129> line<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.669> key<00:02:56.939> and

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
at the bottom to help line the key and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.750 
at the bottom to help line the key and
again<00:02:57.689> it's<00:02:57.989> lined<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.319> felt<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.549> want

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
again it's lined with felt and we want

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.780 
again it's lined with felt and we want
to<00:02:59.879> minimize<00:03:00.060> side<00:03:00.900> play<00:03:01.290> or<00:03:02.159> pulley<00:03:02.489> keys

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
to minimize side play or pulley keys

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.050 
to minimize side play or pulley keys
going<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.480> way<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.760> have<00:03:05.849> just

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
going this way so you have to have just

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.729 
going this way so you have to have just
tight<00:03:06.359> enough<00:03:06.389> better<00:03:06.959> pianos<00:03:07.379> have<00:03:07.470> closer

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
tight enough better pianos have closer

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.640 
tight enough better pianos have closer
tolerances<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.819> actually<00:03:09.599> are<00:03:10.049> more<00:03:10.349> likely

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
tolerances and actually are more likely

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.890 
tolerances and actually are more likely
to<00:03:10.859> stick<00:03:11.340> because<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:12.209> being<00:03:12.419> a<00:03:12.599> little

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
to stick because of being a little

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.309 
to stick because of being a little
closer<00:03:13.700> but<00:03:14.700> that'd<00:03:14.849> be<00:03:15.030> much<00:03:15.209> easier<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.959> open

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
closer but that'd be much easier to open

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.319 
closer but that'd be much easier to open
that<00:03:16.680> space<00:03:16.950> than<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.459> close<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.970> because<00:03:18.180> then

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
that space than to close it because then

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.940 
that space than to close it because then
you<00:03:18.450> have<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.720> take<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.049> bushing<00:03:19.379> out<00:03:19.470> steam

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
you have to take the bushing out steam

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.759 
you have to take the bushing out steam
them<00:03:20.159> out<00:03:20.280> clean<00:03:20.879> them<00:03:21.209> out<00:03:21.299> shim<00:03:22.169> both<00:03:22.379> sides

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
them out clean them out shim both sides

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.069 
them out clean them out shim both sides
to<00:03:23.489> close<00:03:23.729> the<00:03:23.940> hole<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> little<00:03:24.359> bit<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.959> then

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
to close the hole a little bit and then

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.559 
to close the hole a little bit and then
re<00:03:25.290> Bush<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.769> with<00:03:25.949> more<00:03:26.190> felt<00:03:26.489> that's<00:03:27.000> really

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
re Bush it with more felt that's really

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.300 
re Bush it with more felt that's really
a<00:03:27.599> pain<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.409> prefer<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.829> have<00:03:28.949> them<00:03:29.220> a

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
a pain so we prefer to have them a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:38.710 
a pain so we prefer to have them a
little<00:03:29.549> tight

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.070 

this<00:03:39.440> is<00:03:39.770> what's<00:03:40.010> called<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.460> damper<00:03:40.940> most<00:03:41.810> of

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
this is what's called a damper most of

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.170 
this is what's called a damper most of
the<00:03:42.170> strings<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:43.160> represents<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.910> string

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
the strings this represents the string

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.130 
the strings this represents the string
in<00:03:44.300> this<00:03:44.450> case<00:03:44.690> have<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.770> damper<00:03:46.900> except<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.020> the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
in this case have a damper except in the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.340 
in this case have a damper except in the
upper<00:03:48.440> octave<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.520> half<00:03:49.730> or<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:50.350> variable

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
upper octave and a half or so variable

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.780 
upper octave and a half or so variable
on<00:03:51.500> different<00:03:51.830> instruments<00:03:52.070> different

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
on different instruments different

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.970 
on different instruments different
brands<00:03:53.750> actually<00:03:53.930> different<00:03:54.470> sizes

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
brands actually different sizes

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.060 
brands actually different sizes
different<00:03:55.370> models<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:55.970> I'm<00:03:56.600> pretty<00:03:57.560> close<00:03:57.800> in

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
different models but I'm pretty close in

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.000 
different models but I'm pretty close in
the<00:03:58.160> same<00:03:58.340> area<00:03:58.670> because<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.660> higher<00:04:00.010> the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
the same area because the higher the

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.070 
the same area because the higher the
notes<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.730> shorter<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.240> string<00:04:02.570> and<00:04:02.810> the

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
notes the shorter the string and the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.690 
notes the shorter the string and the
quicker<00:04:03.380> they<00:04:03.620> decay<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.310> sometimes<00:04:04.580> they

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
quicker they decay and sometimes they

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.140 
quicker they decay and sometimes they
decay<00:04:05.060> way<00:04:05.450> too<00:04:05.510> quickly<00:04:06.440> so<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:07.220> having<00:04:08.090> a

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
decay way too quickly so that having a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.840 
decay way too quickly so that having a
damper<00:04:08.450> doesn't<00:04:08.840> dedenne's<00:04:09.770> it<00:04:10.010> more<00:04:10.550> than<00:04:10.700> we

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
damper doesn't dedenne's it more than we

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.730 
damper doesn't dedenne's it more than we
would<00:04:10.970> like<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.780> will<00:04:11.990> find<00:04:12.170> an<00:04:12.320> absence

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
would like so you will find an absence

would like so you will find an absence
of<00:04:12.920> dampers<00:04:13.370> at<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:13.610> upper<00:04:13.880> end<00:04:14.060> but<00:04:15.050> as<00:04:15.650> soon

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
of dampers at the upper end but as soon

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.430 
of dampers at the upper end but as soon
as<00:04:15.950> they<00:04:16.070> get<00:04:16.220> low<00:04:16.459> enough<00:04:16.790> in<00:04:17.060> pitch<00:04:17.810> or<00:04:18.170> long

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
as they get low enough in pitch or long

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.720 
as they get low enough in pitch or long
enough<00:04:18.769> which<00:04:19.640> is<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.030> same<00:04:20.239> thing<00:04:21.400> they<00:04:22.400> will

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
enough which is the same thing they will

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.460 
enough which is the same thing they will
last<00:04:22.940> too<00:04:23.420> long<00:04:23.660> and<00:04:23.960> interfere<00:04:24.440> with

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
last too long and interfere with

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.980 
last too long and interfere with
subsequent<00:04:25.160> notes<00:04:25.670> if<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.000> had<00:04:26.330> no<00:04:26.540> dampers

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
subsequent notes if you had no dampers

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.070 
subsequent notes if you had no dampers
that<00:04:27.260> are<00:04:27.620> sitting<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.280> top<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.600> string<00:04:29.960> or

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
that are sitting on top of the string or

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.960 
that are sitting on top of the string or
string<00:04:30.350> sometimes<00:04:30.710> it's<00:04:31.160> sitting<00:04:31.520> on<00:04:31.610> three

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
string sometimes it's sitting on three

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.060 
string sometimes it's sitting on three
at<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.150> time<00:04:32.180> or<00:04:32.570> two<00:04:32.750> this<00:04:33.260> is<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> single<00:04:33.860> one

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
at a time or two this is a single one

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.630 
at a time or two this is a single one
and<00:04:34.730> those<00:04:35.000> felts<00:04:35.830> keep<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:37.100> string<00:04:37.400> from

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
and those felts keep that string from

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.360 
and those felts keep that string from
vibrating<00:04:38.120> when<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:38.480> don't<00:04:38.660> want<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.140> play

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
vibrating when you don't want it to play

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.870 
vibrating when you don't want it to play
when<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.490> play<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:41.120> note<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.780> damper<00:04:42.140> goes<00:04:42.320> up

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
when you play a note the damper goes up

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.060 
when you play a note the damper goes up
allowing<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.330> string<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.780> vibrate<00:04:44.830> as<00:04:45.830> long

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
allowing the string to vibrate as long

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.159 
allowing the string to vibrate as long
as<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.370> key<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:46.700> down<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.480> when<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:47.960> are

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
as the key is down and when you are

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.920 
as the key is down and when you are
finished<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:49.040> damper<00:04:49.460> returns<00:04:49.970> downwards

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
finished the damper returns downwards

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.380 
finished the damper returns downwards
and<00:04:51.880> dampens<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.030> sound<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.810> stops<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:55.390> so

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
and dampens the sound and stops it so

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.570 
and dampens the sound and stops it so
those<00:04:56.570> have<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:57.050> be<00:04:57.200> adjusted<00:04:57.919> just<00:04:57.950> right<00:04:58.190> so

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
those have to be adjusted just right so

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.090 
those have to be adjusted just right so
they<00:04:58.729> don't<00:04:58.940> dampen<00:04:59.450> too<00:04:59.780> quickly<00:05:00.200> because<00:05:00.979> it

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
they don't dampen too quickly because it

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.890 
they don't dampen too quickly because it
might<00:05:01.250> be<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.430> little<00:05:01.580> too<00:05:01.820> cold<00:05:02.120> sounding<00:05:02.750> if

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
might be a little too cold sounding if

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.070 
might be a little too cold sounding if
you<00:05:02.990> do<00:05:03.110> it<00:05:03.260> really<00:05:03.500> abruptly<00:05:04.630> but<00:05:05.630> these<00:05:05.930> are

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
you do it really abruptly but these are

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.320 
you do it really abruptly but these are
very<00:05:06.110> very<00:05:06.320> important<00:05:07.010> when<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.060> press<00:05:08.300> your

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
very very important when you press your

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.060 
very very important when you press your
right<00:05:08.690> pedal<00:05:08.990> down<00:05:09.260> on<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.530> piano<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:09.830> is

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
right pedal down on the piano that is

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.219 
right pedal down on the piano that is
called<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.430> damper<00:05:10.850> pedal<00:05:10.880> because<00:05:11.720> it<00:05:12.140> is

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
called the damper pedal because it is

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.140 
called the damper pedal because it is
controlling<00:05:12.890> these<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.340> actually<00:05:13.640> lifts<00:05:13.940> all

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
controlling these and actually lifts all

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.969 
controlling these and actually lifts all
the<00:05:14.210> dampers<00:05:14.930> up<00:05:15.110> at<00:05:15.260> once<00:05:15.440> when<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:15.710> press

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
the dampers up at once when you press

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.800 
the dampers up at once when you press
the<00:05:16.130> right<00:05:16.220> pedal<00:05:16.280> down<00:05:16.700> so<00:05:17.450> if<00:05:17.540> you<00:05:17.660> are

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
the right pedal down so if you are

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.230 
the right pedal down so if you are
playing<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.919> right<00:05:19.220> combination<00:05:19.970> of<00:05:20.090> notes

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
playing the right combination of notes

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.990 
playing the right combination of notes
they<00:05:20.600> sound<00:05:20.840> nice<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.410> blend<00:05:21.770> together<00:05:22.010> and

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
they sound nice to blend together and

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.440 
they sound nice to blend together and
insert<00:05:23.270> over<00:05:23.540> AB<00:05:23.720> Z<00:05:23.990> like<00:05:24.919> water<00:05:25.310> making<00:05:26.300> it

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
insert over AB Z like water making it

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.300 
insert over AB Z like water making it
very<00:05:26.630> liquidy<00:05:27.290> sounding<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:27.979> you<00:05:28.130> can

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
very liquidy sounding and you can

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.040 
very liquidy sounding and you can
connect<00:05:28.700> better<00:05:28.880> when<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.360> strings<00:05:29.810> are

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
connect better when the strings are

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.409 
connect better when the strings are
vibrating<00:05:30.680> together<00:05:30.910> but<00:05:31.910> of<00:05:32.030> course<00:05:32.210> if<00:05:32.390> you

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
vibrating together but of course if you

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.800 
vibrating together but of course if you
leave<00:05:32.630> it<00:05:32.750> down<00:05:32.870> too<00:05:33.050> long<00:05:33.290> or<00:05:33.650> have<00:05:34.280> too<00:05:34.550> many

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
leave it down too long or have too many

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.450 
leave it down too long or have too many
different<00:05:35.810> ones<00:05:36.140> at<00:05:36.350> the<00:05:36.440> same<00:05:36.620> time<00:05:36.890> you<00:05:37.340> will

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
different ones at the same time you will

00:05:37.460 --> 00:06:20.170 
different ones at the same time you will
create<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:38.960> muddy<00:05:39.530> sound

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:28.570 

I<00:06:20.240> play<00:06:21.110> something<00:06:21.500> that<00:06:21.530> disagrees

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.069 

I<00:06:29.560> get<00:06:30.560> a<00:06:30.590> little<00:06:30.830> money
