what's going on in Alaska well the big

what's going on in Alaska well the big
catalyst<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.330> kind<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> lifting

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
catalyst of this was kind of the lifting

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.200 
catalyst of this was kind of the lifting
of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> progressive<00:00:22.740> tax<00:00:23.519> scheme<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.029> was

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
of the progressive tax scheme that was

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.480 
of the progressive tax scheme that was
set<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.900> by<00:00:25.019> former<00:00:25.320> governor<00:00:25.650> Palin<00:00:25.949> under

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
set up by former governor Palin under

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.070 
set up by former governor Palin under
that<00:00:26.640> system<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.210> she<00:00:27.359> had<00:00:27.449> implemented<00:00:27.779> it

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that system that she had implemented it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.050 
that system that she had implemented it
was<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> progressive<00:00:28.890> tax<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.580> started<00:00:29.939> about

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
was a progressive tax that started about

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
was a progressive tax that started about
twenty<00:00:30.480> five<00:00:30.660> percent<00:00:30.689> tax<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.040> barrel<00:00:32.489> of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
twenty five percent tax on a barrel of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.850 
twenty five percent tax on a barrel of
oil<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.969> increased<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.290> price<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.590> oil

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
oil and increased with that price of oil

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
oil and increased with that price of oil
and<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.670> some<00:00:35.850> points<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.270> tax<00:00:36.719> cut<00:00:36.930> as

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and in some points is that tax cut as

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
and in some points is that tax cut as
high<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.290> 75<00:00:37.829> percent<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.730> price<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.090> oil

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
high as 75 percent of the price of oil

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.850 
high as 75 percent of the price of oil
which<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> pretty<00:00:39.899> steep<00:00:40.440> price<00:00:40.829> for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
which is a pretty steep price for

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
which is a pretty steep price for
anybody<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.640> paying<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.180> under<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
anybody to be paying on that under this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.810 
anybody to be paying on that under this
new<00:00:43.230> system<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.680> they've<00:00:43.950> implemented<00:00:44.399> it's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
new system that they've implemented it's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.610 
new system that they've implemented it's
a<00:00:45.059> 35-percent<00:00:45.899> flat<00:00:46.739> tax<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.700> some<00:00:47.730> expects

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
a 35-percent flat tax with some expects

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
a 35-percent flat tax with some expects
exemptions<00:00:49.620> excuse<00:00:50.010> me<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.219> encourage<00:00:51.180> more

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

production<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.410> new<00:00:52.590> production<00:00:52.980> coming

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
production and new production coming

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.580 
production and new production coming
online<00:00:53.340> now<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> rocket<00:00:54.870> scientist

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
online now I'm not a rocket scientist

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
online now I'm not a rocket scientist
but<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:56.010> guessing<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.000> new<00:00:57.270> tax

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
but I'm guessing that this new tax

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.080 
but I'm guessing that this new tax
scheme<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.170> leading<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.680> increased

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
scheme is leading to increased

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.700 
scheme is leading to increased
investment<00:01:00.090> dollars<00:01:00.359> from<00:01:00.899> oil<00:01:01.170> producers<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
investment dollars from oil producers I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.990 
investment dollars from oil producers I
think<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> nailed<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> head

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
think you kind of nailed it on the head

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.359 
think you kind of nailed it on the head
right<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.960> far<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.589> heard<00:01:04.890> some

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
right there so far we have heard some

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.010 
right there so far we have heard some
verbal<00:01:05.790> commitments<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.540> companies<00:01:06.990> like

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
verbal commitments from companies like

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.260 
verbal commitments from companies like
BP<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.560> ConocoPhillips<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.939> know<00:01:09.060> not

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
BP and ConocoPhillips but you know not

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
BP and ConocoPhillips but you know not
much<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.630> terms<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.990> actual<00:01:10.260> production<00:01:10.650> work

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
much in terms of actual production work

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.310 
much in terms of actual production work
conocophillips<00:01:12.030> has<00:01:12.150> added<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.630> single

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
you know the next year or two this

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.280 
you know the next year or two this
probably<00:02:30.480> means<00:02:30.660> absolutely<00:02:31.200> nothing

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
probably means absolutely nothing

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.660 
probably means absolutely nothing
because<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:31.950> still<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.310> take<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.459> few

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
because it's still going to take a few
