we're<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> demonstrate<00:00:16.859> how<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.550> can

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
we're going to demonstrate how you can

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.050 
we're going to demonstrate how you can
manipulate<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.510> light<00:00:18.630> bar<00:00:18.900> using<00:00:19.260> macros<00:00:20.060> so

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
manipulate the light bar using macros so

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730 
manipulate the light bar using macros so
a<00:00:21.330> lot<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.539> people<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.990> had<00:00:22.170> complaints

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
a lot of people have had complaints

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.650 
a lot of people have had complaints
about<00:00:22.800> how<00:00:23.250> bright<00:00:23.580> their<00:00:23.789> light<00:00:23.939> bar<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.210> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
about how bright their light bar is and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.330 
about how bright their light bar is and
how<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.050> reflect<00:00:25.320> off<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> screen<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
how it can reflect off the screen you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.189 
how it can reflect off the screen you
can<00:00:26.369> see<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> little<00:00:27.210> bit<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.750> I'm<00:00:27.990> in

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
can see it there a little bit and I'm in

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.959 
can see it there a little bit and I'm in
bright<00:00:28.910> I'm<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.179> break<00:00:30.359> lit<00:00:30.750> room<00:00:31.080> so

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
bright I'm going to break lit room so

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
bright I'm going to break lit room so
but<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.329> effect<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.690> even<00:00:33.809> more<00:00:34.050> pronounced

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
but the effect is even more pronounced

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.490 
but the effect is even more pronounced
dark<00:00:35.520> games<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:36.030> night<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.290> we're<00:00:37.410> going

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
dark games at night so what we're going

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.229 
dark games at night so what we're going
to<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.579> show<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.059> can

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
to do is we're going to show how we can

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.500 
to do is we're going to show how we can
still<00:00:39.899> use<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:41.239> functionality<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
still use the functionality that the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240 
still use the functionality that the
light<00:00:42.660> bar<00:00:42.899> offers<00:00:43.410> by<00:00:43.710> displaying<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
light bar offers by displaying the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.670 
light bar offers by displaying the
battery<00:00:44.670> level<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.719> keep<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.469> not

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
battery level but keep it so it's not

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.369 
battery level but keep it so it's not
disturbing<00:00:47.430> during<00:00:48.420> games<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.079> we're<00:00:49.230> going

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
disturbing during games and we're going

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.180 
disturbing during games and we're going
to<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.739> using<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.190> macros<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:52.190> what

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to do that using the macros so what

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.350 
to do that using the macros so what
we're<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.579> doing<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.270> going

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
we're going to be doing is we're going

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.689 
we're going to be doing is we're going
to<00:00:54.449> design<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.710> light<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.129> normally

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
to design it so the light is normally

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.389 
to design it so the light is normally
off<00:00:57.050> but<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.230> turns<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.129> show<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
off but then turns on to show the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
off but then turns on to show the
battery<00:00:59.730> level<00:00:59.879> when<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.480> tilt<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
battery level when we tilt the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.650 
battery level when we tilt the
controller<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> when<00:01:02.910> we're<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.210> in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
controller up so when we're actually in

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.060 
controller up so when we're actually in
normal<00:01:04.049> gaming<00:01:04.320> position<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.979> be

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
normal gaming position it's going to be

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.789 
normal gaming position it's going to be
off<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.299> decide<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.630> glance<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
off but if we decide to glance at it to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.679 
off but if we decide to glance at it to
look<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> battery<00:01:08.490> level<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.450> flick

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
look at the battery level we can flick

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
look at the battery level we can flick
it<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> will<00:01:10.950> turn<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
it up like this and it will turn on and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.850 
it up like this and it will turn on and
show<00:01:11.670> us<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> battery<00:01:12.210> level<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> we're<00:01:13.770> going

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
show us the battery level so we're going

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.010 
show us the battery level so we're going
to<00:01:13.950> start<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.369> by<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:15.000> head<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.659> going

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
to start off by going head and going

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.950 
to start off by going head and going
into<00:01:16.140> our<00:01:16.290> macro<00:01:16.740> builder<00:01:16.979> screen<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
into our macro builder screen and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.039 
into our macro builder screen and
creating<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> new<00:01:19.170> macro<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> we're<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
creating a new macro and we're going to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.969 
creating a new macro and we're going to
call<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.439> check<00:01:22.979> battery

here<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.659> we're<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> our<00:01:31.740> built

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
here is we're going to go to our built

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.410 
here is we're going to go to our built
in<00:01:32.130> functions<00:01:32.640> tab<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:34.100> for<00:01:35.100> since<00:01:35.850> we're

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
in functions tab and for since we're

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.790 
in functions tab and for since we're
going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.659> assuming<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.380> you're<00:01:37.650> not

before we're going to insert a wait for
macro<00:02:19.950> release<00:02:20.340> since<00:02:21.209> we<00:02:21.390> don't<00:02:21.570> want<00:02:21.720> to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
macro release since we don't want to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.140 
macro release since we don't want to
spam<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.680> wanted<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> do<00:02:23.280> those<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.790> then

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
spam that we wanted to do those and then

spam that we wanted to do those and then
wait<00:02:24.480> until<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.200> macro<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.830> released<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.550> this

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
wait until the macro is released in this

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.180 
wait until the macro is released in this
case<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.930> means<00:02:28.200> when<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.560> controller<00:02:28.920> goes

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
case that means when the controller goes

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.110 
case that means when the controller goes
back<00:02:29.489> into<00:02:29.700> normal<00:02:30.209> playing<00:02:30.480> position<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
back into normal playing position and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.910 
back into normal playing position and
then<00:02:33.120> we're<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> say<00:02:33.840> discharge<00:02:34.530> mode

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
then we're going to say discharge mode

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.620 
then we're going to say discharge mode
and<00:02:35.310> we're<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.790> set<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> color<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.360> off

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
and we're going to set the color to off

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.449 
and we're going to set the color to off
and<00:02:37.079> that<00:02:37.680> will<00:02:37.769> turn<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.070> back<00:02:38.220> off

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
and that will turn it back off

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.310 
and that will turn it back off
afterwards<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.250> save<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.910> controller

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
afterwards so we save that controller

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.460 
afterwards so we save that controller
close<00:02:43.320> out<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:45.079> alright<00:02:46.079> now<00:02:46.290> we're
