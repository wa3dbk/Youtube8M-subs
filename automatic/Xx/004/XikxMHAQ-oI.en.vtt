hello everyone today I'm going to be
showing<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.529> make<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.980> time<00:00:05.640> machine

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
showing you how to make a time machine

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.140 
showing you how to make a time machine
in<00:00:06.029> Minecraft<00:00:06.740> first<00:00:07.740> I'm<00:00:08.010> going<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.639> show<00:00:09.090> you

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
in Minecraft first I'm going to show you

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.669 
in Minecraft first I'm going to show you
mine<00:00:11.630> so<00:00:12.630> all<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.349> flip<00:00:13.650> this

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
mine so all you have to do is flip this

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.160 
mine so all you have to do is flip this
switch<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.330> see<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.509> clock<00:00:15.839> moving

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
switch and you can see the clock moving

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.269 
switch and you can see the clock moving
at<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.560> rapid<00:00:16.890> pace<00:00:18.410> then<00:00:19.410> if<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.890> up<00:00:20.010> here

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
at a rapid pace then if we go up here

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.390 
at a rapid pace then if we go up here
you<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.390> moon<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.800> moon<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.160> sun

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
you can see the moon the moon and sun

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.480 
you can see the moon the moon and sun
moving<00:00:23.789> very<00:00:24.000> quickly<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.779> basically

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
moving very quickly so this is basically

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.319 
moving very quickly so this is basically
the<00:00:29.490> time<00:00:29.760> machine<00:00:30.650> but<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.730> second<00:00:33.210> I'm

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the time machine but in a second I'm

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479 
the time machine but in a second I'm
going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.960> show<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.230> how<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.950> make<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.430> own

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
going to show you how to make your own

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.920 
going to show you how to make your own
time<00:00:35.910> machine<00:00:35.940> step<00:00:36.660> by<00:00:36.840> step<00:00:37.430> step<00:00:38.430> 1<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:39.719> this

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
time machine step by step step 1 do this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.850 
time machine step by step step 1 do this
make<00:00:40.800> sure<00:00:40.829> your<00:00:41.280> lover<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.879> down<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
make sure your lover is down not up the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.200 
make sure your lover is down not up the
light<00:00:44.070> should<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.700> off<00:00:46.219> step<00:00:47.219> down<00:00:47.489> take<00:00:48.030> your

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
light should be off step down take your

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.310 
light should be off step down take your
redstone<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> place<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:51.320> you're

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
redstone and place it as I do you're

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.189 
redstone and place it as I do you're
going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> need<00:00:52.770> your<00:00:52.890> repeater<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.079> make<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
going to need your repeater and make it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
going to need your repeater and make it
all<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.379> way<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:56.120> you're<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.360> need

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
all the way down you're going to need

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.619 
all the way down you're going to need
two<00:00:57.719> repeaters<00:00:59.480> that<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.809> step<00:01:01.289> two<00:01:02.629> step

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
two repeaters that is step two step

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.350 
two repeaters that is step two step
three<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> put<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> red<00:01:05.010> stone<00:01:05.339> above<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
three is to put the red stone above the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.210 
three is to put the red stone above the
repeaters<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:09.600> last<00:01:09.840> step<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
repeaters like this the last step is to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.890 
repeaters like this the last step is to
set<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> piece<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> redstone<00:01:12.740> right<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
set a piece of redstone right here and

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.749 
set a piece of redstone right here and
then<00:01:15.900> put<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> command<00:01:17.250> block<00:01:17.840> right<00:01:18.840> there<00:01:19.759> but

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
then put a command block right there but

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.170 
then put a command block right there but
the<00:01:21.150> time<00:01:21.360> machine<00:01:21.479> doesn't<00:01:21.869> fully<00:01:22.259> work<00:01:22.470> yet

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
the time machine doesn't fully work yet

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.460 
the time machine doesn't fully work yet
you<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> type<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:26.270> time<00:01:27.270> add<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you have to type in time add and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.710 
you have to type in time add and
whenever<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.670> whatever<00:01:29.909> number<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
whenever and whatever number you want to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160 
whenever and whatever number you want to
type<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:32.159> bigger<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> number<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.170> faster

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
type in the bigger the number the faster

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.990 
type in the bigger the number the faster
the<00:01:34.530> time<00:01:34.740> machine<00:01:34.860> will<00:01:35.159> go<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:36.530> always<00:01:37.530> think

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
the time machine will go I always think

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.660 
the time machine will go I always think
2,500<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.630> good<00:01:40.020> enough<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.490> go

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
2,500 is good enough but you can go

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.250 
2,500 is good enough but you can go
higher

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.370 

and<00:01:45.950> there<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.430> have<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.660> how<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:47.720> make<00:01:47.990> your

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
and there you have it how to make your

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.230 
and there you have it how to make your
own<00:01:48.580> time<00:01:49.580> machine<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:50.210> Minecraft<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:52.120> hope<00:01:53.120> I

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
own time machine in Minecraft I hope I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.500 
own time machine in Minecraft I hope I
