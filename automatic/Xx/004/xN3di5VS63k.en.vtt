light<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.440> an<00:02:24.530> LED<00:02:24.950> light<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.700> if

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
light is that it's an LED light and if

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.780 
light is that it's an LED light and if
you're<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:26.660> an<00:02:26.810> electrician<00:02:27.290> or<00:02:27.790> familiar

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
you're not an electrician or familiar

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.350 
you're not an electrician or familiar
with<00:02:28.940> technology<00:02:29.540> or<00:02:29.570> whatever<00:02:29.750> that's<00:02:30.440> fine

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
with technology or whatever that's fine

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.180 
with technology or whatever that's fine
LED<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.740> very<00:02:33.740> low<00:02:34.210> energy<00:02:35.210> consumption<00:02:35.630> so

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
LED is very low energy consumption so

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.500 
LED is very low energy consumption so
actually<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.340> solution<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:38.000> I've<00:02:38.180> rigged

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
actually the solution that I've rigged

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.180 
actually the solution that I've rigged
and<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.780> can<00:02:38.930> find<00:02:39.200> more<00:02:39.410> information<00:02:40.040> if<00:02:40.160> you

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
own channel and this is one of the

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.180 
own channel and this is one of the
coolest<00:03:32.510> toys<00:03:33.490> that<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.580> picked<00:03:34.850> up<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.240> while

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
you can be epic on the water not just go

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.940 
you can be epic on the water not just go
out<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.130> have<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.430> good<00:04:01.640> time<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.590> make
