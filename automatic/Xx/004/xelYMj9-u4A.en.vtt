00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.320 
now that I'm done it with high school
and<00:00:20.390> this<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> something<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.960> wanted<00:00:22.170> really<00:00:23.330> so

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and this is something I wanted really so

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.210 
and this is something I wanted really so
just<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.750> right<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.410> think<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
just going to get right to it I think a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.779 
just going to get right to it I think a
lot<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.430> people<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:27.680> heard<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.580> wear<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
lot of people have heard that I wear a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.720 
lot of people have heard that I wear a
wig<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.590> that<00:00:31.759> is<00:00:32.759> true<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:34.460> one<00:00:35.460> awake

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.080 
wig and that is true I have one awake
since<00:00:36.030> 7th<00:00:36.540> grade<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> lot<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
since 7th grade and I think a lot of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.209 
since 7th grade and I think a lot of
people<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.660> thought<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.530> knew<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:41.040> or

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
people have thought that or knew that or

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
people have thought that or knew that or
something<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.910> would<00:00:42.059> always<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.510> just

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
something and I would always I just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.590 
something and I would always I just
don't<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> talk<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> now

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
don't like to talk about it but so now

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.940 
don't like to talk about it but so now
you<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:45.960> true<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> lot

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you know that's true but I think a lot

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.580 
you know that's true but I think a lot
of<00:00:47.100> people<00:00:47.190> don't<00:00:47.930> don't<00:00:48.930> actually<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.350> why

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
of people don't don't actually know why

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
of people don't don't actually know why
so<00:00:50.489> that's<00:00:50.700> partially<00:00:50.969> why<00:00:51.210> I'm<00:00:51.360> making<00:00:51.570> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so that's partially why I'm making this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.049 
so that's partially why I'm making this
video<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.870> autoimmune<00:00:55.050> disorder

video I have an autoimmune disorder

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.049 
video I have an autoimmune disorder
which<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:58.620> causes<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.250> body<00:00:59.520> thinks<00:01:00.030> it's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
which it causes my body thinks it's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
which it causes my body thinks it's
allergic<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.020> hair<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.500> stinks<00:01:02.399> my<00:01:02.550> hair<00:01:02.789> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
like foreign and it like it makes it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.179 
like foreign and it like it makes it
cause<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> fall<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.409> when<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> cut<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
cause it to fall out so when I cut it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.830 
cause it to fall out so when I cut it
since<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.610> little<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> was

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
since I was really little and when I was

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.109 
since I was really little and when I was
young<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.350> would<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.130> spot<00:01:14.580> here

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
young it would just be like a spot here

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.719 
young it would just be like a spot here
the<00:01:15.840> spot<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.070> could<00:01:17.220> cover<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> up

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the spot there and I could cover it up

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.230 
the spot there and I could cover it up
by<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> way<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> wore<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.720> hair<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:20.180> get<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
by the way I wore my hair and get it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
by the way I wore my hair and get it
would<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.540> back<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> everything<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.680> be

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
would go back in and everything would be

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
would go back in and everything would be
fine<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.280> would<00:01:23.369> fall<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.210> another

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
fine but it would fall out in another

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
fine but it would fall out in another
little<00:01:24.810> place<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.280> went<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.549> like

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
little place and it just went on like
