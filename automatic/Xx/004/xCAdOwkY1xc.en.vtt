00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 well what's all this starting our school 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.640
 dedicated to the study of ear points 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.010
 shells 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.599
 but the school on a purely practical nature 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.480
 kick the height of the theory and let it all 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.330
 inspect from our ears cannon good 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.210
 us power the next moment which but 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.580
 also so purely organizational we 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.400
 we will take breaks 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.640
 video breaks and breaks 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.650
 technical and well let's 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.500
 we start now today we study 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.000
 auricle points opportunities 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.040
 diagnosis and treatment treatment using 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.770
 dynamic electroneurostimulation 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.690
 treatment with massage treatment with 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.980
 using moxibustion pulse color 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.079
 therapy or just color therapy to any 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.289
 Well, a writer who can 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.870
 leave the color that's what we have on in 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.270
 principle on our whole school school we 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 we remove for several visits that is 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.450
 We look at the feet while planning four days 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.869
 such basic workers before everyone is 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.700
 convenient and the first main task 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.770
 see where the ear points are and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.939
 evaluate how we can them on them 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.220
 impact healing and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.110
 diagnostic name called me 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.909
 volatile or Nikolaev I am a doctor 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.280
 accredited medical vector 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.810
 center from denas ms corporation a countries 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.409
 The Department of Restorative Medicine is 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.570
 Slave Medical Academy 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.880
 Well, so far everything is dynamic 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.659
 electroneurostimulation have been doing already 9 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.579
 years already the tenth year went and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.710
 site of our school to share those 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.590
 knowledge and skills that we have 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.049
 well then let's start from the very 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.770
 common man how old are you 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.570
 these ears have black interesting on 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.360
 ear ears here earrings can she not 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.979
 walk glasses on top put what else 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.290
 there is such an interesting thing on the ears 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.840
 for some reason 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.550
 in general, we have gathered today for their sake and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.470
 met same you know what to eat 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.810
 nerve endings before people didn't know 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.180
 what are the nerve endings on the ear but 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.990
 purely empirically back in 3 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.220
 in the 7th century BC came such 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.060
 tractor tractor gold tablets 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.840
 where was the mention of that for 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.450
 treatment of leg pain and headaches 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.530
 used cauterization on the ears that is 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.060
 in a specific place on the ears set 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.220
 all-in and always was not likely 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.640
 just coal or stick burned 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.480
 here is a partner later too 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.080
 mention 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.890
 and there children up till our mostly it 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.220
 the greeks and the chinese are mostly oriental 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.530
 knowledge that came to us and the first 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.140
 treatises that are exactly mentioned about 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.450
 treatment options for ear points 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.820
 shells this here east in the 19th century 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.570
 interested in the opportunity 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.220
 use of ears for treating Europeans 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.870
 I call him now names so Nari 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.820
 who is interested in historical information here 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.989
 read and only in the twentieth century 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.390
 first 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:29.989
 Oyun doctor knives describe similarities 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:33.440
 the pinna with the human embryo then 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.000
 there is this one here which 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.610
 it shows the relationship 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.739
 representation of ear organs 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.019
 human sink directly from 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.209
 the location of the embryo that's how little man 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.269
 the little fruit we have lies in the womb 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.519
 moms are exactly the same on our ears 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.750
 projected organs and systems that is 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.810
 this head is the place of the lobe 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.360
 the upper part is head further here it is 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.930
 back please here it is back 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.870
 ends with legs lower limb 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.000
 here they are lower limbs further here at 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.049
 us along the wall go handles that is here 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.989
 here we have a handle accordingly here on 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.049
 the babyâ€™s middle of the body is 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.370
 diaphragm and that's really to be divided 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.080
 certain education which we 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.910
 analyze our diaphragms 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.910
 accordingly, everything above 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.389
 the diaphragm is between the head and the diaphragm 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.120
 that the chest here is the same with 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.860
 internal organs below the diaphragm in 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.300
 us gastrointestinal tract 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.720
 that is, here is the relationship she was 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.320
 tracked and later 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.449
 anatomical and physiological studies 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:53.580
 showed that a clear interaction here 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:56.979
 the same nerves that regulate function 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.110
 our body specific organs are the same 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.169
 nerves have their representation on 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.449
 the level of the auricle is generally a question 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:14.409
 why pinna iron 2 on you on 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:15.669
 pancake closer you can let me forgive 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.070
 take a closer look 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.190
 actually we have long been interested 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.760
 why the ear which actually does not carry 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.510
 some 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.639
 bright functional loads did not fall out 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.580
 your ear canal does not perform 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.870
 animal locator function 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.150
 ultrasound we are also not particularly not 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.550
 catch yes yes there is a function here 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.830
 locator it is unacceptable ear we are all 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.400
 Equally do not move what you are doing yourself 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.080
 pinna at first I just long 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.020
 time was not considered and then when 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.199
 very active studied structure issues 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.780
 brain here drew attention to the ear 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.509
 and drew attention to why ear 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.020
 a shell organ that has a quirky 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:02.979
 in its form the cartilage and skin is covered 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:07.390
 very difficult and nervous support there 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:10.630
 there are 5 nerve endings that we have 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.960
 cervical plexus is a pharyngeal 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.740
 facial wandering trigeminal no then 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.380
 there are actually 5 nerve plexuses 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.400
 huge that in our body 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.310
 regulates all vital functions 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.370
 systems for some reason they are represented on the ear 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.580
 why and the second question which also 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.350
 worried anatomists they did not understand 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.970
 order which does not carry any 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.920
 functional load 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.630
 besides the fact that there are so many 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:43.170
 nerve endings and here are two more 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.320
 branches of their arteries that branch 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.140
 like 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.810
 branching blood supply our heart 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:55.450
 the heart has the same amount of nervous 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.880
 ensure just as well the blood supply 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.100
 similarly on our 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.440
 ears that actually does not perform 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.380
 no function and all this 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.310
 representation why and here then 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.450
 first 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.820
 already analyzing work on the same was 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:16.500
 A final statement has been made that 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:19.120
 ear is a powerful reflex gene zone 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.560
 why what can we get from this 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.360
 why do we need a lot of points for ears 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.950
 which you can click on you can 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.960
 compare with the remote control here we are 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:34.360
 actually but complex system to complex 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.570
 unit apparatus from a technical position 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.580
 So here is the ear is a remote control by clicking on the button 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:44.160
 we can always get a certain 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.780
 result so here before talking 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.510
 how are these reflex connections 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.700
 presented on the ear we will remember 

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.950
 well, or for those who first listen to our 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.850
 school we will talk like in our 

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:59.220
 in the body 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.220
 works such a thing as a reflex
