 delicious now if it will touch clear 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.610
 yes guys then let's start 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.720
 with whole wheat flour 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.400
 and regular flour 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.820
 we put baking powder 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.830
 and carbonate wheat germ already 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.710
 we have used on occasions that surely 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.420
 you already bought and if not in stores 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.940
 naturists you can find the germ 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.900
 of wheat is a wonder has a lot 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.520
 vegetable protein and it is good rich in everything 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.640
 you can use it in everything you can empathize 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.090
 with wheat germ then try 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 use it is very rich then we are going to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.830
 mix the dry add two eggs 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.010
 melted butter try to make it 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.890
 really butter and not margarine and 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.250
 whole milk to give you a lot 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.990
 creaminess to the hot cakes you are going to 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.070
 realize that whole milk 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.610
 it has more fat and that fat does not work 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.210
 then I do not know is quite useful and knows 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.610
 that cupcakes unlike those of 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.670
 the crepes that we did yesterday if they are left 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.130
 small groups of hard cake is well small 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.060
 in the mass there is no problem 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.780
 then we have here a pan 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.290
 hot very important that you pre 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.900
 hot about five minutes we take a 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.580
 little bit of paper and the color of the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.489
 butter is very characteristic 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.800
 Use yellow but pale color 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.380
 margarine is a more intense yellow 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.560
 true yellow more intense then 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.800
 we anoint 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.820
 our very important frying pan 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:46.520
 and we put the cupcake mix in the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:49.220
 center so tasty and with a spoon what 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.190
 we make redondito do not make it very big 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.890
 and when it makes it too big it runs 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.770
 the danger of it breaking when it comes to 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.270
 flip it then better tiny for 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.340
 that is easy to manipulate 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.530
 meanwhile we will make the pineapple that is going 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.550
 excellent to our hat cakes we are going to 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.030
 put pineapple butter was fine fresh 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.250
 or it can be tin pineapple like you 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.280
 prefer 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.670
 a little bit of muscovado sugar that's going 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.130
 to give a very special sweetness and extract 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.100
 of vanilla can also put you know 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.410

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.780

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.930
 vanilla as we will do as a compote 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.860

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.550
 look, we take the coconut 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.180
