 let's try to put all this that 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.450
 we have before us what the board would be 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.230
 for any other ultra long 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.230
 distance for example 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.269
 in this backpack the cream mounts in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.060
 5-liter or 5-liter 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.710
 let's try to put all this is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 very active and that will enter we will enter 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.030
 socks that we will have to carry in a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.520
 third bag and has given to take 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.520
 everything that we all among the 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:50.340
 summaries of the camera but I have here 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.379
 246 in these 4 6 bars two drums 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.140
 spare batteries to face two 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.190
 frontal the blanket cuts winds on 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.829
 shorts are affordable and hoods 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.589
 mobile oven gloves 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.659

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.659

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.659
 this part of the antenna and then for the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.799
 two courses of analysis and the part 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.259
 back then I removed the complaint 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.640
 to get it all right, so this is 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.610
 so you can see better what 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.049
 rushing into each bag is worth nothing for 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.180
 the gels as you see here I have those 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.490
 bags and also have the magic is the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.210
 sad if you really in a gel here and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.759

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.260
 and we put the other referral 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.260
 then 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 two 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 pedrosa life 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.730
 I will pass 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.790
 we have the courses down here below 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.410
 the videos is worth in this I'm going to sell 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.410

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.460
 to put things in the side bags 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.750
 ok this is why here to open a 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.930
 little distraction 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.940

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.710

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.320
 we should be zipper have another bag 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.630
 which is like a flexible mesh the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.810
 perfect space increased in gel like 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.280
 I said six gels and six suitcases would give me 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.500
 for six hours that is space 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.500
 Enough to fill training 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.810
 the accessible form 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.390
 we went to the other side bag and 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.150
 uses 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.110
 also the flexible plastic cup in 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.110
 this case is not flexible 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.980
 on the side as we did before 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.490
 in this space 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:11.550
 and we close open our backs with 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.020
 back again the windbreaker 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.180
 cuts with membrane and hood that in 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.680

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.880
 nothing is that you are seeing I have to 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.450
