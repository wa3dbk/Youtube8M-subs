so<00:01:34.950> that's<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.250> way<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.939> make

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so that's one way that you can make

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.130 
so that's one way that you can make
yourself<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:37.439> little<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.920> more<00:01:38.189> contemporary

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140

yourself a little bit more contemporary
another<00:01:40.140> example<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.070> through<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
another example of this is through the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
another example of this is through the
kinds<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.700> color<00:01:41.939> matching<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
kinds of color matching what you do so

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.490 
kinds of color matching what you do so
here<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.890> again<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:45.030> tan<00:01:45.479> colored<00:01:45.899> soft

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

here we have again the tan colored soft
leather<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.549> only<00:01:47.850> these<00:01:48.180> lashes<00:01:48.420> here

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
leather and then only these lashes here

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.730 
leather and then only these lashes here
we've<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.740> dull<00:01:49.979> silver<00:01:50.659> also<00:01:51.740> soft

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
we've got the dull silver also soft

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.720 
we've got the dull silver also soft
leather<00:01:52.950> sitting<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.460> underneath<00:01:53.670> there

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
leather sitting in underneath there

making<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.030> out<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.390> one<00:01:55.600> color

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
making this out of the one color

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.330 
making this out of the one color
material<00:01:56.140> would<00:01:56.560> have<00:01:56.590> kept<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:56.980> to<00:01:57.190> me<00:01:57.310> a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
material would have kept this to me a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.490 
material would have kept this to me a
very<00:01:57.850> classic<00:01:58.360> shoe<00:01:58.570> but<00:01:58.600> by<00:01:59.290> putting

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
something under here and something a

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.430 
something under here and something a
little<00:02:01.090> bit<00:02:01.210> shiny<00:02:01.450> it's<00:02:01.990> just<00:02:02.200> helped<00:02:02.410> to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
little bit shiny it's just helped to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.020 
little bit shiny it's just helped to
bring<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.770> new<00:02:02.950> aspect<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.400> these<00:02:03.550> shoes<00:02:03.820> and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
bring a new aspect to these shoes and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.190 
bring a new aspect to these shoes and
again<00:02:04.270> make<00:02:04.510> them<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.750> little<00:02:04.960> bit<00:02:05.050> more

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
again make them a little bit more

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.690 
again make them a little bit more
contemporary<00:02:05.530> but<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.040> really<00:02:06.280> hope<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.460> your

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
contemporary but I really hope that your
