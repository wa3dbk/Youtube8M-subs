thing<00:01:57.090> well<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:58.460> think<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.790> there's<00:02:00.060> probably

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
thing well I think that there's probably

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.300 
thing well I think that there's probably
a<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.409> go<00:02:01.469> wrong<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.100> keg<00:02:02.280> stand

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
a lot that can go wrong in a keg stand

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.080 
a lot that can go wrong in a keg stand
but<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.750> think

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
but I think

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.419 
but I think
I<00:02:05.149> think<00:02:05.840> what<00:02:06.049> we're<00:02:06.409> really<00:02:06.710> trying<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.219> do

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
I think what we're really trying to do

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.100 
I think what we're really trying to do
is<00:02:07.460> come<00:02:08.060> up<00:02:08.090> with<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.360> social<00:02:08.750> media<00:02:08.899> campaign

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
is come up with a social media campaign

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.740 
is come up with a social media campaign
that<00:02:09.860> was<00:02:09.979> going<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.280> have<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> bit<00:02:11.269> of<00:02:11.390> humor

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
that was going to have a bit of humor

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.130 
that was going to have a bit of humor
and<00:02:11.780> be<00:02:12.680> fun<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:14.180> really<00:02:14.450> attract<00:02:14.959> attention
