00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.780
 series questions answers where I answer 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.049
 to the questions that make me feel the most 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.599
 often asked the question of the day is to 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.529
 what should be composed the breakfast 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.599
 balanced 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.220
 so if you have not seen I you 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.869
 advise to go see the previous one 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.760
 video of the series questions answers where 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.990
 I'm just talking about the importance of 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.510
 breakfast I was answering the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.429
 question of should I take a little 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.059
 lunch so everything is explained in 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.710
 this video 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.360
 let's see what should be 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.430
 composed the balanced breakfast so 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.979
 breakfast should provide the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.690
 body all the essential nutrients 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:44.330
 the energy and water he needs to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.000
 start his day and he must also 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.760
 help maintain a sugar level in 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.309
 the normal area in order to avoid hunger and 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 so tired so that she has 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.629
 sustainably makes it breakfast 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.979
 should be composed of elements 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.930
 satiating so it should be composed 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.030
 of five elements that we will see 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.170
 together where first of all protein 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.970
 that you can find in the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.740
 dairy products such as yogurt or 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.210
 milk me I asked you personally 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.090
 if you can go instead 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.640
 to plant products so 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.680
 soy milk yogurts 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.030
 rice almond etc to you find some 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.620
 hand in different meanings 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.350
 now in the supermarkets to 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.730
 you to see what you have if you 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.960
 are a weight loss program I 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.730
 do not advise to pay attention to 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.770
 everything that is flavored so that has a 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.140
 taste simply thanks to the support 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.850
 still a lot of sugar routine 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.230
 can also come from the filling that 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.850
 you're going to use so you can 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.820
 take for example the same sausages 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.490
 like chicken turkey fillet or 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.770
 then light cheese but it can 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.720
 also eyes you go 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 not prepared according to what you 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.960
 like it's feast is also under 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.700
 so powder form from home 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.900
 nutritional that I thought you still 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.930
 once rather protein-based 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.010
 such as I personally use 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.660
 then the second month it's the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.580
 simple carbohydrates so-called 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.100
 sugars that comes to you 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.990
 immediate energy so that you 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.270
 just go find in the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.190
 fruits in a completely natural way 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.800
 so you can take a fresh fruit 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.440
 like kiwi mandarin banana actually this 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.500
 that you like and it can also be 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.580
 a fruit and vegetable juice so I 'll you 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.050
 always advises to buy back 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.100
 vegetables that makes you a contribution 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.530
 additional 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.010
 and all of this makes you invent some of 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.390
 vitamins minerals and fibers I 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.860
 have already made several videos 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.600
 about vegetable juices if you want in 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.610
 know more I will put you the links here 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.740
 below the sugar level in life 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.500
 you can also find some in the 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.600
 dried fruits or in a quality honey 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.490
 then the third time it's the 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.010
 complex carbohydrates so so-called 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.990
 slow sugars you can be 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.430
 found in cereal products 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.340
 that I have rather advise you 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.860
 complete or integral simply not 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.050
 if it is better to stall on the duration 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.830
 fifty the fibers needed to 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.600
 the digestion 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.980
 if you are a program of loss of 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.269
 weight I would not want to draw me your 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.739
 be careful about paying attention 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.019
 at the quantity level because that 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.280
 still remains sugars so this 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.220
 can be for example integral bread 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.459
 oat flakes of the month sli nature 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.739
 no added sugars and preferably organic 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.940
 it's even better 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.760
 personally I do not advise them 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.010
 kellogg's type cereals where these 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.690
 famous breakfast bars and that's 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.730
 simply because it is that the 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.950
 elect label you will see that that 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.420
 contains quite a lot of south and especially this 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.040
 is not a full breakfast 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.069
 so if you want from time to time 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.349
 use them 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.290
 but it pays your part as 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.999
 that's going to be part of your pam 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.389
 so completed their part else thing to 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.489
 side 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.079
 the fourth element these are actually the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.239
 hippies so the good fats that 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.879
 you will be able to find for example 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.489
 salmon time or also in 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.400
 some black the fines are 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.719
 especially really not bad and you 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.310
 so can the campaign be in your 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.620
 breakfast but also towards a 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.599
 time in case in your day the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.980
 fifth element is the drink so 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.540
 paul hydration you can take by 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.129
 example a hot drink be it at 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.950
 tea or coffee but preferably 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.290
 black and sugar free I take this opportunity to 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.939
 remember that the first thing that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.340
 you should give your body the 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.879
 morning it's a tempered glass of water so 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.769
 to rehydrate him after his young from the 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.329
 night I already did a video on 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.889
 the importance of water if you have not 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.440
 seen I really advise you to go the 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.729
 see it's also very important so 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.560
 I would also put the link under this 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.940
 video I know it's not always 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.919
 obvious to change your habits 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.539
 food but I assure you that this 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.610
 that your body needs these are 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.440
 nutrients to work well this 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.210
 often forgetting we eat more by 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.120
 pleasure by envy that really by 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.830
 need of our body our body is 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.300
 really a beautiful machine badly 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.039
 works much better from the 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.509
 moment him on board which she needs and 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.920
 it goes through nutrition I you 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.460
 ensures she does not need them 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.170
 madrid of chocolate cereals this is it 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.090
 are two lovers life I'm not saying that 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.530
 you can never get one but 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.520
 keep it rather so 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.290
 occasional 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.090
 I advise you to start by doing 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.410
 small change do you see 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.920
 by yourself what can you do 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.780
 to bring 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.010
 if the departure you find that this makes 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.290
 a lot why not start 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.760
 simply not incorporate a muzzling 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.260
 should see together 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.550
 then you only make a few 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.870
 days and then you incorporate the 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.420
 second does his part in a few days 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.790
 three mrc in a row it will be much more 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.840
 easy so do not be afraid of 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.660
 these two new things that she you 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.130
 could very pleasantly surprised so 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.560
 now I imagine you would like 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.240
 have some concrete examples of 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.010
 breakfast to see this so 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.570
 clearer so that's what we 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.150
 let's see in the next video of 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.800
 the questions and answers series by then at 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.780
 think about doing what's right for you 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.790
 may well be in your body in your 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.450
 skin and they are doing fit i you 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.450
 will make it strong
