00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
upfront money they didn't look at the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.430 
upfront money they didn't look at the
fact<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:58.350> only<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:59.760> about<00:01:00.120> seven<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.200> eight

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
fact that only like about seven or eight

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380

percent<00:01:02.040> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> money<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.910> given<00:01:02.940> him

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
percent of the money that was given him

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.960 
percent of the money that was given him
was<00:01:03.930> upfront<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.770> they<00:01:05.100> didn't<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.759> pay

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
was upfront that they didn't have to pay

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.350 
was upfront that they didn't have to pay
back<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:07.560> second<00:01:08.040> year<00:01:08.070> third<00:01:08.729> year<00:01:08.790> they

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
back in the second year third year they

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.469 
back in the second year third year they
had<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.690> pay<00:01:09.899> back<00:01:10.110> certain<00:01:10.560> expenses<00:01:11.479> they

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
had to pay back certain expenses they

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.190 
had to pay back certain expenses they
thought<00:01:12.750> everything<00:01:13.080> was<00:01:13.440> on<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.009> strength

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
thought everything was on the strength

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.609 
thought everything was on the strength
so<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:17.090> have<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.420> look<00:01:17.570> at<00:01:17.780> everything<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:18.530> a

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
so you have to look at everything in a

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.149 
so you have to look at everything in a
contract<00:01:19.189> before<00:01:19.399> you<00:01:19.759> sign<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:20.710> you<00:01:21.710> know<00:01:21.860> and

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
contract before you sign it you know and

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.639 
contract before you sign it you know and
that<00:01:22.340> here<00:01:22.789> is<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.060> fact<00:01:23.329> they<00:01:24.259> were<00:01:24.289> going<00:01:24.590> to

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
that here is the fact they were going to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.740 
that here is the fact they were going to
be<00:01:24.770> caught<00:01:24.979> in<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.250> very<00:01:25.490> liable<00:01:25.759> situation

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
be caught in a very liable situation

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.959 
be caught in a very liable situation
because<00:01:27.079> of<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.320> structure<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:28.159> how<00:01:28.909> the

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
because of the structure of how the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.929 
because of the structure of how the
contract<00:01:29.719> was<00:01:29.960> with<00:01:29.990> one<00:01:30.380> of<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.619> advisors<00:01:30.950> so

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
contract was with one of the advisors so

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.210 
contract was with one of the advisors so
they<00:01:32.119> couldn't<00:01:32.420> even<00:01:32.569> move<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.710> now<00:01:33.950> they're

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
they couldn't even move so now they're

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.050
