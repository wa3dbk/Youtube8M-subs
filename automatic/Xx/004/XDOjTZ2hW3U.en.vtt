00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
in season three I mean you thought the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.150 
in season three I mean you thought the
red<00:01:19.759> wedding<00:01:19.940> was<00:01:20.240> like<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.599> huge<00:01:21.470> event<00:01:21.740> so

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
red wedding was like a huge event so

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.919 
red wedding was like a huge event so
they<00:01:22.310> ended<00:01:22.610> with<00:01:22.759> that<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.209> third<00:01:23.479> book<00:01:23.720> was

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
they ended with that the third book was

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.859 
they ended with that the third book was
filled<00:01:24.200> with<00:01:24.289> so<00:01:24.740> many<00:01:25.520> big<00:01:25.880> events<00:01:26.330> not<00:01:26.810> just

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
filled with so many big events not just

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.510 
filled with so many big events not just
the<00:01:27.259> red<00:01:27.380> wedding<00:01:27.560> there<00:01:28.039> are<00:01:28.160> some<00:01:28.310> other

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
the red wedding there are some other

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.279 
the red wedding there are some other
huge<00:01:29.060> events<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:29.569> happen<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.929> book<00:01:30.080> three

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
huge events that happen to book three

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.219 
huge events that happen to book three
that<00:01:30.649> they<00:01:30.890> pushed<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.429> season<00:01:31.819> four<00:01:32.229> because

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
that they pushed to season four because

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.050 
that they pushed to season four because
obviously<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.099> red<00:01:34.250> wedding<00:01:34.429> was<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.700> big

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
obviously the red wedding was a big

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.960 
obviously the red wedding was a big
enough<00:01:35.330> ending<00:01:35.929> for<00:01:36.319> season<00:01:36.860> three<00:01:37.099> so<00:01:37.670> they

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
enough ending for season three so they

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.979 
enough ending for season three so they
kind<00:01:38.179> of<00:01:38.239> took<00:01:38.360> some<00:01:38.569> of<00:01:38.599> the<00:01:38.690> things<00:01:38.869> from
