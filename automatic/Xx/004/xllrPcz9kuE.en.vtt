00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
aware what I beacons are they're

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.910 
aware what I beacons are they're
basically<00:00:35.940> these<00:00:36.239> indoor<00:00:36.840> proximity<00:00:37.559> sensors

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
basically these indoor proximity sensors

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
basically these indoor proximity sensors
that<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.760> ability<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.180> send<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:40.140> iOS

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
that have the ability to send your iOS

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.130 
that have the ability to send your iOS
device<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.250> push<00:00:41.550> notification<00:00:41.870> when<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> get

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
device a push notification when you get

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.260 
device a push notification when you get
near<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> guess<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.640> way<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> look<00:00:45.090> at

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
near them so I guess the way I look at

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.080 
near them so I guess the way I look at
look<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.350> look<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> ibeacon<00:00:47.670> sensors

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
look at this look at the ibeacon sensors

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
look at this look at the ibeacon sensors
is<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:48.930> you're<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.230> an<00:00:49.350> apple<00:00:49.680> store<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
is that if you're in an apple store and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
is that if you're in an apple store and
you<00:00:50.250> walk<00:00:50.489> by<00:00:51.059> maybe<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.660> section<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
you walk by maybe the section with the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.869 
you walk by maybe the section with the
iphone<00:00:52.559> 5s<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.219> would<00:00:53.340> send<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> push

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
iphone 5s it would send you a push

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.600 
iphone 5s it would send you a push
notification<00:00:53.940> saying<00:00:54.840> maybe<00:00:55.530> ask<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.100> apple

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
notification saying maybe ask a apple

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.189 
notification saying maybe ask a apple
store<00:00:56.789> employee<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.300> more<00:00:57.480> information<00:00:58.020> or

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
store employee for more information or

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.680 
store employee for more information or
maybe<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> trade<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.489> iphone<00:00:59.760> 4s<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
maybe if you trade in your iphone 4s you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.160 
maybe if you trade in your iphone 4s you
can<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.219> $99<00:01:02.219> iphone<00:01:02.699> 5s<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.750> sort<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.080> a

there was actually an issue in iOS 7.1

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.539 
there was actually an issue in iOS 7.1
point<00:01:30.390> 1<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.750> below<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.799> far<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.310> I'm<00:01:32.520> aware

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
point 1 and below as far as I'm aware

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
point 1 and below as far as I'm aware
that<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> would<00:01:33.840> send<00:01:34.110> an<00:01:34.259> attachment

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that when you would send an attachment

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.859 
that when you would send an attachment
with<00:01:34.950> an<00:01:35.310> email<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> default<00:01:36.479> mail<00:01:36.630> app

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
with an email from the default mail app

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.560 
with an email from the default mail app
in<00:01:37.110> iowa's<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.189> attachment<00:01:38.850> would<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.329> be

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
in iowa's the attachment would not be

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.840 
in iowa's the attachment would not be
encrypted<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.650> very<00:01:40.950> good<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> see

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
encrypted so it's very good do you see

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.510 
encrypted so it's very good do you see
that<00:01:41.880> iOS<00:01:42.299> 7.1<00:01:43.020> point2<00:01:43.500> beefs<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.399> the
