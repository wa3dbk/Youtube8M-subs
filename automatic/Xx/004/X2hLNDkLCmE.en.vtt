this<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.269> Nelson<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.990> scent<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> muscle

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
this is Nelson that scent is the muscle

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.499 
this is Nelson that scent is the muscle
and<00:00:11.160> but<00:00:11.460> I've<00:00:11.550> got<00:00:11.700> free<00:00:11.849> date<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.179> something

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
and but I've got free date is something

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.810 
and but I've got free date is something
really<00:00:12.780> really<00:00:13.080> interesting<00:00:13.309> this<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.610> going

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
really really interesting this is going

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.330 
really really interesting this is going
to<00:00:14.940> take<00:00:15.120> advantage<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:16.340> contralateral

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
to take advantage of contralateral

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.090 
to take advantage of contralateral
muscle<00:00:18.000> activation<00:00:18.690> try<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.949> more

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
muscle activation try to be more

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.380 
muscle activation try to be more
specific<00:00:20.250> that's<00:00:20.789> contralateral

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
specific that's contralateral

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.660 
specific that's contralateral
antagonistic<00:00:22.140> muscle<00:00:22.439> activation<00:00:22.980> which

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
antagonistic muscle activation which

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.359 
antagonistic muscle activation which
basically<00:00:24.000> means<00:00:24.359> by<00:00:25.170> activating<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
basically means by activating the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.189 
basically means by activating the
opposing<00:00:26.910> muscle<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> other<00:00:27.750> side<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
opposing muscle on the other side of the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679 
opposing muscle on the other side of the
body<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.670> about<00:00:30.119> five<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
body you can actually be about five to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.930 
body you can actually be about five to
ten<00:00:30.869> percent<00:00:31.019> stronger<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> working<00:00:32.730> side

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
ten percent stronger on the working side

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.299 
ten percent stronger on the working side
of<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> body<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:34.140> example<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:35.130> going

of the body for example what I'm going

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
of the body for example what I'm going
to<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.149> arm<00:00:36.300> dumbbell<00:00:36.450> row<00:00:36.870> with

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to do here is one arm dumbbell row with

to do here is one arm dumbbell row with
the<00:00:37.770> other<00:00:37.920> hand<00:00:38.250> I'm<00:00:38.579> actually<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the other hand I'm actually going to be

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.869 
the other hand I'm actually going to be
pushing<00:00:39.450> down<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.469> high<00:00:40.649> pulley<00:00:40.980> arm

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
pushing down on a high pulley arm

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
pushing down on a high pulley arm
extended<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.809> though<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.410> finishing<00:00:43.739> up

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
extended as though I was finishing up

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.389 
extended as though I was finishing up
press<00:00:44.670> down<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.440> leaning<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> I'm

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
press down with that leaning on that I'm

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.920 
press down with that leaning on that I'm
gonna<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:47.760> actually<00:00:48.030> activating<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> chest

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
gonna be actually activating the chest

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.869 
gonna be actually activating the chest
as<00:00:49.260> I'm<00:00:49.920> doing<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> rope<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
as I'm doing the rope that's going to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.670 
as I'm doing the rope that's going to
give<00:00:51.030> me<00:00:51.059> some<00:00:51.239> great<00:00:51.390> core<00:00:51.629> work<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.440> also

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
give me some great core work it's also

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.639 
give me some great core work it's also
going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> ideally<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.300> theory<00:00:54.649> increase

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
going to ideally and in theory increase

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.799 
going to ideally and in theory increase
the<00:00:56.039> muscle<00:00:56.190> response<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> working<00:00:57.570> side

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the muscle response on the working side

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.979 
the muscle response on the working side
of<00:00:57.930> land<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.239> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.359> give<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> try

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
of land so you can give this one a try

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229 
of land so you can give this one a try
I've<00:01:01.890> tried<00:01:02.190> already<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.149> really

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I've tried already and I really really

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.460 
I've tried already and I really really
like<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.719> think<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> very<00:01:04.229> effective

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
like it I think it's a very effective

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.270 
like it I think it's a very effective
way<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.880> get<00:01:05.880> more<00:01:06.060> weak<00:01:06.380> use<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.650> weak<00:01:07.860> get

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
way to get more weak use more weak get

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
way to get more weak use more weak get
more<00:01:08.490> reps<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:10.140> some

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
more reps with it and get some

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320 
more reps with it and get some
additional<00:01:10.560> core<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.670> chest<00:01:12.000> work<00:01:12.180> while

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
additional core and the chest work while

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.580 
additional core and the chest work while
you're<00:01:12.450> doing<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:12.960> our<00:01:13.110> rope<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you're doing that when our rope so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.330 
you're doing that when our rope so
here's<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.310> looks<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:16.130> said<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
here's what it looks like said that I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
here's what it looks like said that I
pulley<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> single<00:01:18.270> cable<00:01:18.450> handle<00:01:18.900> put

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
pulley with a single cable handle put

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.500 
pulley with a single cable handle put
your<00:01:19.470> bench<00:01:19.650> right<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.549> against<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
your bench right up against it

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.780 
your bench right up against it
don't<00:01:21.690> go<00:01:23.810> now<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.950> won't<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.310> fairly

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
don't go now you won't have a fairly

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
don't go now you won't have a fairly
moderately<00:01:27.600> heavy<00:01:27.750> weight<00:01:28.050> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.650> cable

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
moderately heavy weight on the cable

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.980 
moderately heavy weight on the cable
waitstaff<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:30.210> something<00:01:30.480> that<00:01:30.600> basically

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
waitstaff it's something that basically

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
waitstaff it's something that basically
you'd<00:01:31.080> have<00:01:31.230> a<00:01:31.260> hard<00:01:31.410> time<00:01:31.680> keeping<00:01:32.370> down<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you'd have a hard time keeping down the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
you'd have a hard time keeping down the
place<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.480> were<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.780> using<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.350> for

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
place if you were just using that for

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
place if you were just using that for
the<00:01:34.770> exercise<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.910> grab<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.240> other

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the exercise when you grab the other

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.940 
the exercise when you grab the other
dumbbell<00:01:36.600> that's<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> increase<00:01:37.740> your

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
dumbbell that's going to increase your

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
dumbbell that's going to increase your
body<00:01:38.130> weight<00:01:38.340> load<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.870> help

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
body weight load and then really help

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.750 
body weight load and then really help
you<00:01:40.110> bear<00:01:40.260> down<00:01:40.440> on<00:01:40.620> exercise<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
you bear down on exercise with this

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.270 
you bear down on exercise with this
where<00:01:42.300> she's<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.570> waiting<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.200> once<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.920> didn't

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
where she's not waiting so once I didn't

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560 
where she's not waiting so once I didn't
see<00:01:44.400> exactly<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:44.940> talking<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.300> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
see exactly what I'm talking about in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.730 
see exactly what I'm talking about in
terms<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:45.930> contralateral<00:01:46.230> muscle

terms of the contralateral muscle
activation<00:01:49.310> right<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.550> it's<00:01:51.330> pretty<00:01:52.170> much

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
activation right here it's pretty much

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.530 
activation right here it's pretty much
the<00:01:52.500> weight<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.400> I'm<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.850> able<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.270> keep

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the weight that I'm just able to keep

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.830 
the weight that I'm just able to keep
down<00:01:55.040> when<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> grab<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> dumbbell<00:01:57.000> that's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
down when I grab the dumbbell that's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:30.890 
down when I grab the dumbbell that's
what<00:01:57.960> I'm<00:01:58.050> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.290> logged<00:01:58.500> in

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.289 

so<00:02:32.280> that's<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.370> be<00:02:33.519> exorcized<00:02:33.909> looks<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.180> an

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
so that's a be exorcized looks like an

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.720 
so that's a be exorcized looks like an
essay<00:02:34.629> I'm<00:02:35.470> gonna<00:02:35.650> switch<00:02:35.830> up<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.580> on<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
essay I'm gonna switch up do it on the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.059 
essay I'm gonna switch up do it on the
other<00:02:36.760> side

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.890 

and<00:02:45.549> it's<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:45.939> I<00:02:46.239> thought<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.689> gonna<00:02:46.810> be

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
and it's really I thought it's gonna be

00:02:46.900 --> 00:03:24.060 
and it's really I thought it's gonna be
some<00:02:47.079> great<00:02:47.170> for<00:02:47.530> work

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.980 

and<00:03:25.070> so<00:03:25.340> we<00:03:25.460> just<00:03:25.670> wouldn't<00:03:26.060> be<00:03:26.150> me<00:03:26.300> unless<00:03:26.780> I

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
and so we just wouldn't be me unless I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.140 
and so we just wouldn't be me unless I
tested<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.590> limits<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.700> equipment<00:03:29.120> that

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150
