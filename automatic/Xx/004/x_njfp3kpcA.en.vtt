00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
the game is fairly stable I've actually

the game is fairly stable I've actually
been<00:00:15.630> playing<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> little<00:00:16.139> bit<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> ps4

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
been playing it a little bit on the ps4

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.700 
been playing it a little bit on the ps4
and<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.430> works<00:00:17.609> fairly<00:00:17.850> well<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> pc<00:00:19.529> i

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and it works fairly well but on the pc i

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.099 
and it works fairly well but on the pc i
did<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> working<00:00:20.760> unfortunately<00:00:21.240> but

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
did get it working unfortunately but

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.109 
did get it working unfortunately but
it's<00:00:22.320> still<00:00:22.619> very<00:00:22.949> very<00:00:23.130> buggy<00:00:23.550> i'm<00:00:23.820> getting

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
it's still very very buggy i'm getting

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
it's still very very buggy i'm getting
kicked<00:00:24.359> out<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.539> many<00:00:24.900> games<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:25.500> at<00:00:25.920> least<00:00:26.070> i

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

it<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.260> here's<00:00:28.800> quote<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.519> quote<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.939> they

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it but here's quote for quote what they

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.209 
it but here's quote for quote what they

execute on multiple sources it's a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.350 
execute on multiple sources it's a
coincidence<00:00:34.469> if<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.219> works<00:00:35.489> or<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.030> crashes

coincidence if it works or if it crashes
all<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> codes<00:00:37.230> become<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.710> timing<00:00:38.160> dependent

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
to crash or other bugs now that's a lot

of mumbo jumbo some of you guys might
have<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.370> even<00:00:59.489> understand<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.149> meant

basically what it means is if you have

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070 
basically what it means is if you have

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
of battlefield 4 hey itunes may not work

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580 
of battlefield 4 hey itunes may not work
good<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.150> OS<00:01:18.540> combined<00:01:19.290> with

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
good with the OS combined with

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.310 
good with the OS combined with
battlefield<00:01:19.950> 4<00:01:20.340> combined<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:20.970> your<00:01:21.180> cpu<00:01:21.720> so

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
battlefield 4 combined with your cpu so

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.109 
battlefield 4 combined with your cpu so
it<00:01:22.500> makes<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> game<00:01:22.950> crash<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.700> i<00:01:23.939> don't

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it makes the game crash now i don't

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.810 
it makes the game crash now i don't
think<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.439> fairly

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
think this is a you know fairly

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.219 
think this is a you know fairly
justifiable<00:01:26.820> reason<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> game<00:01:27.750> crashing

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
justifiable reason for the game crashing

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.719 
justifiable reason for the game crashing
because<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:28.829> should<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> workaround

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
because they should have a workaround

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.060 
because they should have a workaround
for<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.390> mean<00:01:30.780> battlefield<00:01:31.530> 3<00:01:31.799> didn't

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
for that I mean battlefield 3 didn't

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.980 
for that I mean battlefield 3 didn't
crash<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.579> battlefield<00:01:33.090> 3<00:01:33.390> doesn't<00:01:33.659> crash<00:01:33.810> any

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
crash or battlefield 3 doesn't crash any

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
know how battlefield 3 was that launched

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.140 
know how battlefield 3 was that launched
because<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.040> wasn't<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.700> playing<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
because I wasn't really playing that

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.640 
because I wasn't really playing that
game<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.360> all<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> launch<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.170> wasn't<00:01:40.560> really

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
game at all that launch I wasn't really

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.039 
game at all that launch I wasn't really
that<00:01:41.189> big<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.909> hardcore<00:01:42.420> gamer<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that big of a hardcore gamer at that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.219 
that big of a hardcore gamer at that
time<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.680> don't<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.159> remember<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:45.229> uh

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
time so I don't really remember but uh

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.380 
time so I don't really remember but uh
you<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.329> as

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you know I don't really think of this as

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.660 
you know I don't really think of this as
an<00:01:48.630> excuse<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.229> he<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> correct<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.310> some

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
an excuse but he is correct in some

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
an excuse but he is correct in some
terms<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.180> mean<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> lot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> little

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
terms I mean there are a lot of little

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
terms I mean there are a lot of little
nooks<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.640> crannies<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> look

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
nooks and crannies that you have to look

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.569 
nooks and crannies that you have to look
through<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.770> combined<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
through you know this combined with this

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.789 
through you know this combined with this
combined<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.329> again<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> don't<00:01:58.619> think

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
combined with this again I don't think

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.709 
combined with this again I don't think
it's<00:01:58.920> an<00:01:59.009> excuse<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.729> hey<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.149> think<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it's an excuse but hey I think this is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.569 
it's an excuse but hey I think this is
fairly<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.140> fairly<00:02:01.530> self-explanatory<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
fairly a fairly self-explanatory but I

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.920 
fairly a fairly self-explanatory but I
think<00:02:02.790> he<00:02:02.909> definitely<00:02:03.149> needs<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.600> fix<00:02:03.780> this

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
think he definitely needs to fix this

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230 
think he definitely needs to fix this
it's<00:02:04.140> definitely<00:02:04.530> getting<00:02:04.590> better<00:02:04.820> hey<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> got

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it's definitely getting better hey I got

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
it's definitely getting better hey I got
the<00:02:06.329> game<00:02:06.479> morning<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.680> anything<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.720
