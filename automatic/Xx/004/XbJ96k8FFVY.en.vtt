00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
rest of the poster is it's just if you

the<00:01:50.820> poster<00:01:51.210> right<00:01:51.240> down<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.810> middle<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the poster right down the middle it

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
the poster right down the middle it
would<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> mirror<00:01:54.030> image<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:54.840> just

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
would be a mirror image but that's just

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.709 
would be a mirror image but that's just
the<00:01:55.200> beginning<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.450> tell<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the beginning of what I have to tell you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
the beginning of what I have to tell you
about<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.590> crazy<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.219> thought

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
about this it's just crazy the thought

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.889 
about this it's just crazy the thought
and<00:01:59.729> everything<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.180> went<00:02:00.360> into<00:02:00.570> this

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
and everything that went into this

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.230 
and everything that went into this
artwork<00:02:01.290> by<00:02:01.619> Griffin<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.759> things<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
people have realized about it over the

people have realized about it over the
years<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.420> later<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.810> everything<00:02:06.990> it's

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
years and later and everything it's

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.609 
years and later and everything it's
crazy<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.910> griffin<00:02:09.270> name<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.050> his

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
crazy the so griffin name this is his

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.200 
crazy the so griffin name this is his
artwork<00:02:11.009> Aqsa<00:02:11.430> moxa<00:02:11.819> which<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.569> palindrome

which<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.420> course<00:02:13.450> means<00:02:13.870> it's<00:02:14.170> spelled<00:02:14.440> the

above the rock group but this is

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.760 
above the rock group but this is
actually<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.600> double<00:02:20.020> palindrome<00:02:20.970> because<00:02:21.970> a

laksa moxa it's not on the poster by the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.080 
laksa moxa it's not on the poster by the
way<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:29.590> can<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:30.160> can<00:02:30.340> reverse<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.880> around

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
way you can you can reverse that around

hold<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.480> up<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.750> mirror<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.440> all<00:02:33.250> the

hold it up in a mirror and all the

same<00:02:35.710> forward<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.460> backwards<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.300> it's<00:02:37.480> a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
same forward and backwards so it's a

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.750

Rick<00:02:43.510> Griffin<00:02:43.630> devised<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.290> name<00:02:44.470> for<00:02:44.620> this

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
Rick Griffin devised that name for this

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.510 
Rick Griffin devised that name for this
artwork<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:47.020> it's<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.710> just<00:02:47.890> really<00:02:48.190> fits

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
artwork and and it's it just really fits

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.670 
artwork and and it's it just really fits
this<00:02:48.670> piece<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.210> just<00:02:49.300> it's<00:02:50.050> just<00:02:50.290> fantastic

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
this piece it's just it's just fantastic

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.590 
this piece it's just it's just fantastic
and<00:02:51.070> then<00:02:51.160> finally<00:02:52.200> hmm<00:02:53.200> it's<00:02:54.130> uh<00:02:54.480> well<00:02:55.480> not

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
and then finally hmm it's uh well not

and then finally hmm it's uh well not
finally<00:02:55.840> there's<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.170> couple<00:02:56.350> more<00:02:56.560> points<00:02:56.770> to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
finally there's a couple more points to

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.200 
finally there's a couple more points to
make<00:02:57.070> on<00:02:57.250> something<00:02:57.580> that's<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:57.820> great<00:02:58.060> like

elbows berm trying to get into it so

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.990 
elbows berm trying to get into it so
that's<00:03:24.190> pretty<00:03:24.340> cool

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
that's pretty cool

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.700 
that's pretty cool
lots<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.630> double<00:03:25.840> meanings<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.350> everything

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
lots of double meanings and everything

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.000 
lots of double meanings and everything
and<00:03:26.830> in<00:03:26.920> fact<00:03:27.750> there's<00:03:28.750> even<00:03:28.890> there's<00:03:29.890> a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
and in fact there's even there's a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.620 
and in fact there's even there's a
theory<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.640> think<00:03:30.850> it<00:03:30.970> actually<00:03:31.090> kind<00:03:31.540> of

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
theory and I think it actually kind of

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.650 
theory and I think it actually kind of
kind<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.290> holds<00:03:32.560> up<00:03:32.680> nicely<00:03:32.710> that<00:03:33.310> um<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:34.180> very

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
kind of holds up nicely that um the very

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.480 
kind of holds up nicely that um the very
term<00:03:34.870> Grateful<00:03:35.380> Dead<00:03:35.620> if<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:35.980> cover<00:03:36.280> the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
term Grateful Dead if you cover the

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.430 
term Grateful Dead if you cover the
bottom<00:03:36.850> two-thirds<00:03:37.390> of<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.720> letters<00:03:38.050> and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
bottom two-thirds of the letters and

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.860 
bottom two-thirds of the letters and
just<00:03:39.190> look<00:03:39.370> at<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.610> top<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.300> top<00:03:40.510> third

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
just look at the top the top third

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.240 
just look at the top the top third
across<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.410> top<00:03:41.590> there's<00:03:41.800> sort<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.040> yellow

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
across the top there's sort of yellow

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.050 
across the top there's sort of yellow
there<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.940> says<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.780> ate<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.350> acid<00:03:44.890> which<00:03:45.880> is

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
there it says we ate the acid which is

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.330 
there it says we ate the acid which is
pretty<00:03:46.510> if<00:03:47.020> Rick<00:03:47.260> intended<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.100> that's

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
pretty if Rick intended that that's

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.680 
pretty if Rick intended that that's
pretty<00:03:48.610> great<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:48.880> feel<00:03:49.120> like<00:03:49.300> we're<00:03:49.450> listening
