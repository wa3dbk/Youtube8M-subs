00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to do here is sprinkle some beads on now

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.749 
to do here is sprinkle some beads on now
I've<00:02:00.570> got<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> bowl<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.159> what<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.670> would

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
I've got a bowl here so what I would

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.569 
I've got a bowl here so what I would
normally<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> sprinkle<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.560> beads<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
normally do is sprinkle the beads on and

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.490 
normally do is sprinkle the beads on and
then<00:02:05.880> any<00:02:06.390> access<00:02:06.719> beads<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:07.380> them<00:02:07.469> back

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
then any access beads just put them back

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.940 
then any access beads just put them back
in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> bowl<00:02:08.429> right<00:02:09.679> normally<00:02:10.679> what

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
in the in the bowl right normally what

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.860 
in the in the bowl right normally what
I'd<00:02:11.099> use<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> little<00:02:11.910> camera<00:02:12.209> case

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
I'd use is a little camera case

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.900 
I'd use is a little camera case
apply<00:02:13.230> these<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:14.010> much<00:02:14.220> easier<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.849> you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
apply these it's much easier and you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.470 
apply these it's much easier and you
don't<00:02:14.970> lose<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:15.690> beads<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:17.970> see<00:02:18.209> there

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
don't lose your beads you can see there

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.910 
don't lose your beads you can see there
and<00:02:18.629> I'll<00:02:18.720> show<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:18.959> yeah<00:02:19.590> I'll<00:02:19.739> show<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
what it looks like when it's finished

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.479 
what it looks like when it's finished
it's<00:02:21.209> incredible<00:02:22.290> I've<00:02:22.769> really<00:02:23.069> never<00:02:23.190> seen

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.720 
it's incredible I've really never seen
this<00:02:23.610> technique<00:02:24.120> done<00:02:25.190> before<00:02:26.190> actually<00:02:26.640> in

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
this technique done before actually in

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.369 
this technique done before actually in
the<00:02:26.819> paints<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.569> punch<00:02:27.780> work<00:02:27.959> as<00:02:28.170> well

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
the paints with the punch work as well

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.619 
the paints with the punch work as well
it<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.250> looks<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.700> beautiful<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.360> multi

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
it just looks so beautiful and the multi

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.910 
it just looks so beautiful and the multi
so<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.049> make<00:02:31.230> absolutely<00:02:31.739> great

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
so that you can make absolutely great

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.369 
so that you can make absolutely great
but<00:02:32.180> once<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.420> dries<00:02:33.690> press<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.200> don't

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
but once that dries press that in don't

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.750 
but once that dries press that in don't
be<00:02:34.470> afraid<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.069> press<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.549> there

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
be afraid of it just press it in there

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.309 
be afraid of it just press it in there
once<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.690> dries

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
once it dries

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.750 
once it dries
can<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.530> see<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.709> reflective<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.610> don't

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
can you see a reflective there I don't

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.800 
can you see a reflective there I don't
know<00:02:38.910> if<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.030> could<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.239> camera<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.629> see

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
know if you could the camera can see

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.150 
know if you could the camera can see

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
too light yeah yeah because it looks

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.280 
too light yeah yeah because it looks
like<00:02:56.220> kind<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.660> textured<00:02:57.660> doesn't<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.200> in

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
like kind of textured doesn't it in

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.750 
like kind of textured doesn't it in
streaks<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.680> lights<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.069> way<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.280> catches<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
streaks of lights the way it catches the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.789 
streaks of lights the way it catches the
light<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:01.019> know<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.260> put<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> light

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
light you know if you put a light

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.440 
light you know if you put a light
directly<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.730> really<00:03:03.060> reflects

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
directly on that it really reflects

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.000 
directly on that it really reflects
actually<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:03.930> see<00:03:04.079> that<00:03:04.290> one<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.860> move

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
actually you can see that one as I move

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.920 
actually you can see that one as I move
it<00:03:05.129> around<00:03:05.250> there<00:03:05.640> how<00:03:06.180> much<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.540> reflects

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
it around there how much it reflects

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.330 
it around there how much it reflects

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.300 
like this that's kind of quite full on
that<00:03:14.940> isn't<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.870> certainly<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.349> once<00:03:17.130> again

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that isn't it certainly is once again

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.440 
that isn't it certainly is once again
just<00:03:17.489> let's<00:03:17.670> go<00:03:17.790> through<00:03:17.970> everything<00:03:18.180> that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
just let's go through everything that

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
just let's go through everything that
we're<00:03:18.569> getting<00:03:18.660> because<00:03:18.930> obviously<00:03:19.049> you're

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
we're getting because obviously you're

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.890 
we're getting because obviously you're
getting<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.280> hoop<00:03:20.459> itself<00:03:20.900> you're

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
getting the the hoop itself you're

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.750 
getting the the hoop itself you're
getting<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.290> hoop<00:03:22.410> itself<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.130> still

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
getting the hoop itself on you still

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.819 
getting the hoop itself on you still
yes<00:03:24.480> which<00:03:24.810> obviously<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.200> need<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.500> keep<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
yes which obviously you need to keep the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.370 
yes which obviously you need to keep the
the<00:03:26.519> fabric<00:03:26.790> tool<00:03:27.180> yes<00:03:27.359> now<00:03:27.959> I'm<00:03:28.109> getting<00:03:28.349> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
the fabric tool yes now I'm getting the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.550 
the fabric tool yes now I'm getting the
threads<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.639> yes<00:03:30.150> let's<00:03:30.870> there<00:03:31.440> are

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
threads that you can yes let's there are

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.890 
threads that you can yes let's there are
30<00:03:31.950> threads<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.700> circuit<00:03:33.420> that's<00:03:33.660> 30

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
30 threads in that circuit that's 30

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.530 
30 threads in that circuit that's 30
threads<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:34.530> it's<00:03:34.680> enough<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:36.510> whole

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
threads so it's enough to do the whole

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.240 
threads so it's enough to do the whole
Roman<00:03:37.049> design<00:03:37.500> if<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.680> were<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.980> do<00:03:38.220> that

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
Roman design if you were to do that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.680 
Roman design if you were to do that
design<00:03:38.760> because<00:03:39.030> they<00:03:39.150> don't<00:03:39.359> start<00:03:39.599> with

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
design because they don't start with

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.910 
design because they don't start with
that<00:03:39.810> one<00:03:39.900> first

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
that one first

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.470 
that one first
there's<00:03:41.310> certainly<00:03:41.639> enough<00:03:41.730> threads<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.359> do

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
there's certainly enough threads to do

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.180 
there's certainly enough threads to do
at<00:03:42.630> least<00:03:42.690> three<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.169> the<00:03:43.380> smaller<00:03:43.799> design

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
at least three of the smaller design

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.979 
at least three of the smaller design
okay<00:03:44.609> then<00:03:45.120> we're<00:03:45.239> getting<00:03:45.389> the<00:03:45.480> paints<00:03:45.840> as

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
you would use to apply motifs for at

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.589 
you would use to apply motifs for at
perhaps<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:56.069> a<00:03:56.099> sweater<00:03:56.430> now<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.180> want<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.389> show

outline there what I've done is go
around<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.479> outline<00:04:31.630> with<00:04:32.470> your<00:04:32.710> fill<00:04:32.919> your

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
around the outline with your fill your

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.150 
around the outline with your fill your
outliner<00:04:33.810> now<00:04:34.810> what<00:04:35.199> that<00:04:35.380> looks<00:04:35.949> very

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
outliner now what that looks very

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.770 
outliner now what that looks very
attractive<00:04:36.250> when<00:04:36.669> it's<00:04:36.820> finished<00:04:37.270> but<00:04:37.449> now<00:04:37.600> if

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
attractive when it's finished but now if

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.170 
attractive when it's finished but now if
that<00:04:37.960> was<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.139> motif<00:04:38.380> or<00:04:38.979> in<00:04:39.400> this<00:04:39.550> case<00:04:39.789> I<00:04:40.000> want

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180

back<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:47.650> I've<00:04:47.740> not<00:04:47.919> needed<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.550> because

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
back that I've not needed to because

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.909 
back that I've not needed to because
we've<00:04:49.030> got<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.330> black<00:04:49.539> outliner<00:04:50.020> there<00:04:50.320> so

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
we've got the black outliner there so

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.409 
we've got the black outliner there so
what<00:04:51.130> we're<00:04:51.220> going<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.430> do<00:04:51.639> is<00:04:51.759> just<00:04:51.940> cut<00:04:52.180> close

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
what we're going to do is just cut close

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.060 
what we're going to do is just cut close
to<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.660> edge<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.139> just<00:04:53.199> look<00:04:53.500> how<00:04:53.530> easy<00:04:53.830> that

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
to the edge and just look how easy that

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.670 
to the edge and just look how easy that
is<00:04:54.150> simply<00:04:55.150> because<00:04:55.539> it's<00:04:55.900> like<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.139> rubbery

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
is simply because it's like a rubbery

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.620 
is simply because it's like a rubbery
finish<00:04:57.190> that's<00:04:57.550> what<00:04:57.759> it's<00:04:57.910> left<00:04:58.090> or<00:04:58.330> rubbery

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
finish that's what it's left or rubbery

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.490 
finish that's what it's left or rubbery
finish<00:04:58.930> so<00:04:59.500> so<00:05:00.340> easy<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:01.750> cut<00:05:01.930> around<00:05:02.259> and<00:05:02.410> it's

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
finish so so easy to cut around and it's

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.710 
finish so so easy to cut around and it's
not<00:05:02.560> going<00:05:02.889> to<00:05:03.009> fray<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.849> it's<00:05:04.270> not<00:05:04.419> going<00:05:04.599> to

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
not going to fray and it's not going to

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.960 
not going to fray and it's not going to
come<00:05:04.900> away<00:05:05.020> from<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.860> fabric<00:05:06.070> so<00:05:06.460> you<00:05:06.490> left
