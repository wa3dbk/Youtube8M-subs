 I think it was 5 million pixels and 3.2 million pixels, but I think the camera is all over the road surface 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.220
 Because it is also on the way, it is a little 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.660
 I hope that they are editing with that free software 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.010
