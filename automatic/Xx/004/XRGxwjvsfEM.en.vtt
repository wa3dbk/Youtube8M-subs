exercise 3 I want to talk to you about
what<00:00:03.530> happens<00:00:03.949> when<00:00:04.010> we're<00:00:04.250> looking<00:00:04.370> at<00:00:04.610> 9th

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:04.940 
what happens when we're looking at 9th

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.320 
what happens when we're looking at 9th
chords<00:00:05.600> or<00:00:05.750> even<00:00:06.589> beyond<00:00:07.220> that<00:00:07.399> elevenths<00:00:08.149> or

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
chords or even beyond that elevenths or

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.150 
chords or even beyond that elevenths or
13<00:00:08.840> S<00:00:08.960> or<00:00:09.080> whatever<00:00:09.349> crazy<00:00:09.650> quarters<00:00:10.070> you

13 S or whatever crazy quarters you

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.160 
13 S or whatever crazy quarters you
might<00:00:10.309> come<00:00:10.519> across<00:00:10.550> and<00:00:11.389> just<00:00:11.719> simply<00:00:12.019> how<00:00:12.110> to

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
might come across and just simply how to

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.289 
might come across and just simply how to
understand<00:00:12.830> that<00:00:13.040> it<00:00:13.490> all<00:00:13.610> comes<00:00:13.849> back<00:00:13.969> again

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
understand that it all comes back again

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.740 
understand that it all comes back again
to<00:00:14.599> that<00:00:14.750> major<00:00:15.170> scale<00:00:15.589> each<00:00:16.369> scale<00:00:16.850> step<00:00:17.359> gets

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
to that major scale each scale step gets

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.980 
to that major scale each scale step gets
a<00:00:17.869> number<00:00:18.230> all<00:00:18.680> right<00:00:18.859> if<00:00:19.220> I<00:00:19.609> play<00:00:19.939> one<00:00:20.539> octave

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
a number all right if I play one octave

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.200 
a number all right if I play one octave
of<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:21.410> c-major<00:00:21.859> scale<00:00:22.070> and<00:00:22.580> this<00:00:22.939> time<00:00:23.090> I'm

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
of a c-major scale and this time I'm

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.900 
of a c-major scale and this time I'm
going<00:00:23.300> to<00:00:23.359> be<00:00:23.480> way<00:00:23.660> up<00:00:23.779> here<00:00:23.930> at<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:24.050> 8th<00:00:24.230> fret

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
going to be way up here at the 8th fret

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.919 
going to be way up here at the 8th fret
one<00:00:25.910> octave<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:26.510> start<00:00:27.199> on<00:00:27.289> C<00:00:27.619> c<00:00:28.519> d<00:00:28.760> e<00:00:28.789> f<00:00:29.119> g<00:00:29.359> a<00:00:29.869> b

one octave and start on C c d e f g a b
and<00:00:30.349> c<00:00:30.650> and<00:00:31.250> we<00:00:31.849> remember<00:00:32.239> those<00:00:32.330> numbers

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
and c and we remember those numbers

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.610 
and c and we remember those numbers
would<00:00:32.809> be<00:00:32.870> 1<00:00:33.230> 2<00:00:33.649> 3<00:00:34.010> 4<00:00:34.610> 5<00:00:35.540> 6<00:00:36.230> 7<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.610> my<00:00:38.149> c<00:00:38.480> is<00:00:38.780> one

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and my c is one

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.610 
would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and my c is one
again<00:00:40.219> all<00:00:40.760> right<00:00:40.940> I<00:00:41.180> didn't<00:00:41.899> get<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.020> nine<00:00:42.290> did

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
again all right I didn't get to nine did

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.150 
again all right I didn't get to nine did
I<00:00:42.739> if<00:00:43.700> I<00:00:43.879> continue<00:00:44.510> into<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:44.780> second<00:00:45.350> octave<00:00:45.890> of

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
I if I continue into a second octave of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.540 
I if I continue into a second octave of
this<00:00:46.460> scale<00:00:46.730> pattern<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.300> next<00:00:47.539> note<00:00:47.719> D<00:00:48.250> is<00:00:49.250> my

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
this scale pattern the next note D is my

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.869 
this scale pattern the next note D is my
ninth<00:00:50.379> now<00:00:51.379> earlier<00:00:51.860> we<00:00:52.039> said<00:00:52.219> d<00:00:52.489> was<00:00:52.699> the

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
ninth now earlier we said d was the

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.119 
ninth now earlier we said d was the
second<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.570> key<00:00:53.809> well<00:00:54.590> but<00:00:54.800> it's<00:00:54.949> an

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
second in this key well but it's an

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.810 
second in this key well but it's an
octave<00:00:55.670> plus<00:00:56.590> away<00:00:57.590> from<00:00:57.860> our<00:00:58.010> original<00:00:58.219> root

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
octave plus away from our original root

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.000 
octave plus away from our original root
note<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.149> see<00:00:59.390> if<00:00:59.960> it's<00:01:00.140> more<00:01:00.350> than<00:01:00.410> an<00:01:00.680> octave

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
note of see if it's more than an octave

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.830 
note of see if it's more than an octave
away<00:01:01.250> we<00:01:01.430> don't<00:01:01.609> call<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:01.969> second<00:01:02.420> we<00:01:02.629> call

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
away we don't call it the second we call

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.259 
away we don't call it the second we call
it<00:01:03.020> the<00:01:03.050> ninth<00:01:03.350> okay<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:04.970> can<00:01:05.150> imagine

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
it the ninth okay and so you can imagine

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.719 
it the ninth okay and so you can imagine
a<00:01:05.750> ninth<00:01:06.049> court<00:01:06.530> has<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:07.189> note<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:07.700> it

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
a ninth court has that note in it

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.750 
a ninth court has that note in it
alright<00:01:08.390> if<00:01:08.630> I<00:01:09.470> continue<00:01:10.159> up<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.310> scale

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
alright if I continue up the scale

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.330 
alright if I continue up the scale
there's<00:01:11.750> some<00:01:12.110> notes<00:01:12.439> that<00:01:12.740> retain<00:01:13.130> their

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
there's some notes that retain their

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.100 
there's some notes that retain their
number<00:01:13.700> name<00:01:13.909> pretty<00:01:14.180> much<00:01:14.420> no<00:01:14.600> matter<00:01:14.720> which

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110

octave<00:01:15.619> they're<00:01:15.799> played<00:01:16.009> in<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.700> third<00:01:17.060> is

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
octave they're played in the third is

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.480 
octave they're played in the third is
pretty<00:01:17.600> much<00:01:17.810> almost<00:01:18.140> always<00:01:19.009> called<00:01:19.310> the

pretty much almost always called the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.270 
pretty much almost always called the

ninth eleventh and thirteenth that are

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.840 
ninth eleventh and thirteenth that are
affected<00:01:43.340> by<00:01:43.369> this<00:01:43.549> okay<00:01:45.340> okay<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:46.520> let's

across the top three strings

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.120 
across the top three strings
if<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.780> look<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.259> notes<00:02:04.470> these<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.920> I've

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
if I look at what notes these are I've

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.300 
if I look at what notes these are I've
got<00:02:05.310> see<00:02:05.790> which<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.420> root<00:02:06.659> note<00:02:06.899> ii<00:02:07.310> which

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
got see which is my root note ii which

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.559 
got see which is my root note ii which
is<00:02:08.520> my<00:02:08.700> third<00:02:09.860> B<00:02:10.860> flat<00:02:11.250> which<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> flat

is my third B flat which is the flat
seventh<00:02:14.030> d<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.480> whole<00:02:16.470> octave<00:02:16.770> plus<00:02:17.400> away<00:02:17.760> from

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
seventh d a whole octave plus away from

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.520 
seventh d a whole octave plus away from
the<00:02:18.090> original<00:02:18.480> root<00:02:18.660> note<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.019> makes<00:02:19.349> it

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the original root note so that makes it

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.250 
the original root note so that makes it
a<00:02:19.680> ninth<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.730> then<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.090> got<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.300> G<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.630> fifth<00:02:22.019> note

you<00:03:31.950> need<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.280> figure<00:03:32.579> that<00:03:32.880> cord<00:03:33.239> out<00:03:33.420> in

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
you need to figure that cord out in

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.780 
you need to figure that cord out in
relation<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.410> those<00:03:34.530> scale<00:03:34.829> steps<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.340> once

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
relation to those scale steps and once

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.129 
relation to those scale steps and once
you<00:03:35.940> start<00:03:36.180> getting<00:03:36.269> good<00:03:36.630> at<00:03:36.750> doing<00:03:37.019> that

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
you start getting good at doing that

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.410 
you start getting good at doing that
you'll<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:37.769> really<00:03:38.340> improve<00:03:39.150> your<00:03:39.329> playing

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
you'll just really improve your playing

a<00:03:39.630> whole<00:03:39.750> lot<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.230> think<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.799> through<00:03:41.010> read

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
a whole lot so think it through read

a whole lot so think it through read
through<00:03:41.790> these<00:03:41.910> things<00:03:42.120> think<00:03:42.389> them<00:03:42.480> through

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
through these things think them through

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.790 
through these things think them through
start<00:03:43.440> applying<00:03:43.680> them<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.950> your<00:03:44.100> guitar<00:03:44.400> right
