up here and let's see what people make
of<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.810> because<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.170> distinctly<00:03:52.739> see<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.130> tab<00:03:53.489> on

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
of it because I distinctly see a tab on

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.479 
of it because I distinctly see a tab on
the<00:03:53.850> WoW<00:03:54.600> website<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.350> says<00:03:55.620> community<00:03:56.220> and

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
the WoW website that says community and

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.210 
the WoW website that says community and
this<00:03:56.989> isn't<00:03:57.989> by<00:03:58.170> any<00:03:58.350> stretch<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.040> the

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
this isn't by any stretch of the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.490 
this isn't by any stretch of the
imagination<00:03:59.660> anything<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.810> do<00:04:00.959> with

imagination anything to do with

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.460 
imagination anything to do with
community<00:04:02.070> but<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.060> fight<00:04:03.690> for<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.049> little<00:04:04.320> man

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
community but I fight for the little man

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.650 
community but I fight for the little man
I<00:04:04.680> want<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.220> give<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> voice<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.209> person

I want to give a voice to the person

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.330 
I want to give a voice to the person
that<00:04:06.690> says<00:04:07.049> there's<00:04:07.320> nothing<00:04:07.500> we<00:04:07.829> can<00:04:08.070> do

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
that says there's nothing we can do

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.940 
that says there's nothing we can do
because<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.730> believe<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.630> if<00:04:09.959> we<00:04:10.590> stand

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
because I believe that is if we stand

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.520

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
the timer and those people followed us

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.029 
the timer and those people followed us
and<00:04:35.550> we<00:04:36.210> managed<00:04:36.539> to<00:04:36.690> grab<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.169> pool<00:04:37.470> yet

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.879 
and we managed to grab the pool yet
again<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.729> once<00:04:39.210> more<00:04:39.690> they<00:04:40.319> attempted<00:04:40.830> to

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
again and once more they attempted to

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.029 
again and once more they attempted to
get<00:04:41.129> it<00:04:41.250> off<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.460> us<00:04:41.849> but<00:04:42.539> this<00:04:42.840> time<00:04:43.229> we<00:04:43.860> were

resolute this time we didn't relinquish

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.059 
resolute this time we didn't relinquish
the<00:04:47.400> mob<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.819> we<00:04:48.300> actually<00:04:48.930> managed<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.530> kill
