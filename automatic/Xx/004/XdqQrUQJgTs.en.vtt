00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.480
 i 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.530
 we started making beer by hobby 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.570
 bored of going to the industrial air of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.090
 market we used a couple of hours a 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.680
 cooler and an inherited demijohn we 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.020
 we try hard when we uncover it our 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.610
 first beer and we could not understand it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 Soon we decided to change the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.050
 equipment by barrels and more than liters and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 a fermented when we made more beer 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.130
 from which we could take the we decided 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.870
 sell the production was growing together 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.470
 with the plant and the desire of the people of 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.270
 take something different 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.190
 the brewing process 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.500
 Barbarian starts here in this pot 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.750
 We heat filtered eroa and leave it 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.190
 perfect maceration temperature one 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.930
 maceration we mix the water with the 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.790
 ground beef malt we circulate you 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.580
 we remove all the sugar we are ready 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.900
 for the reaction in this pot the rhythm 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.270
 is the must and we add the hops 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.100
 to give it all the bitter taste and aroma 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.690
 to the beer once the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.610
 cooking we cool the beer and the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.260
 we send this fermenter in this one 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.060
 fragmenter is where we are going to add 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.170
 Then the yeast needs to be converted 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.160
 all the sugars in alcohol and co2 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.140
 our beer has four 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.420
 main ingredients water hops 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.010
 yeast and malt which are combined 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.600
 with other inputs to create the 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.940
 most powerful and original beers in the 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.220
 seize market we make beer that 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.290
 we really like it we do not use attachments 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.090
 nor preservatives are quantities 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.920
 ridiculous hops we talk about up 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.030
 10 times more hops in the simple 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.030
 industrial beers 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.830
 have to try on us 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.010
 belongs to the free staff hydrates 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.010
 and comfort 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.800
 actually 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.800
 they do not do well 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.069
 Barbarians a Peruvian beer with 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.959
 attitude we idolize the malt of we are 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.849
 addicted students we make graduates 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.590
 personal with passion one of the 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.590
 revolution will be anchored
