00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.420
 george mathieu why do you bathe 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.219
 scratch my drama for who do you paint at 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.940
 month first I go down the most 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.779
 selfishly most deeply in me 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.939
 join the other men 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.220
 where do the shapes come from 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.230
 show them appear on the canvas 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.570
 do they have a relationship with reality 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.880
 visible 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.050
 none of his canvases which you buy from 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.110
 millions do you pity them 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.430
 not a little fast the pope shelters for the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.739
 pleasure of breaking records 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.489
 I paint fast because it's my rhythm 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.399
 the painting tires you as she 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 exhaust redone my sense is devoted my 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.899
 life is a torment is a refuge 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.100
 against life george mathieu why 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.690
 do you live in a setting so unusual it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.359
 may appear contradictory that I 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.739
 live in a frame it is not that of 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.590
 my time is because the quality of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.869
 objects of my time is zero 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.260
 you said one day that you had 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.420
 turned his back on Greek thought 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.060
 why the greek the greek 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.000
 classics especially this manager 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.560
 of the original tare of a whole current 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.009
 of our civilization 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.390
 they have crushed the transcendence you 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.430
 are in contact with personalities 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.380
 from around the world and yet you are a 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.770
 lonely man 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.710
 basically alone but are the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.280
 we do not all need you to 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.380
 solitude 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.150
 I need trouble are not you 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.700
 embarrassed when painting in public 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.490
 not the bread as well to the public 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.979
 that in the solitude of the workshop the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.860
 light has it a meaning for 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.899
 you light is white is the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.310
 black the color you are she 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.170
 indispensable or could you 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.009
 simply paint in black and white yes 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 black enough the color adds a 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.619
 intensity 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.380
 what do you like in party time 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.060
 supreme for me of course this is the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.550
 painting is concentrating assembling 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.650
 all these energies will be forgotten to be 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.069
 when you think of yourself 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.069
 do you consider yourself a person 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 singular 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.040
 I do not know 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.100
 your room is she the reflection of 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.160
 your inner life the room that you 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.420
 have seen is only a room of parade 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.460
 mine and more secret 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.840
 do you believe in the value of the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.420
 provocation does not try to provoke 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.770
 so who are you maybe 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.780
 the incarnation of limits 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.570
 maybe what the public can blame 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.570
 to be in any case I am my painting
