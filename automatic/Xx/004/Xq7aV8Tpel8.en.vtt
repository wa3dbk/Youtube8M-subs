whats<00:00:01.770> up<00:00:01.890> guys<00:00:03.259> today<00:00:04.430> receive<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.549> package

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
whats up guys today receive the package

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.650 
whats up guys today receive the package
from<00:00:06.230> opportunity<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.760> lets<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:09.000> watch

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
from opportunity and lets you watch

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:52.069 
from opportunity and lets you watch
inside<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:47.120> xspc<00:00:48.800> x240<00:00:49.800> doing<00:00:51.079> 120

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
inside so this is a xspc x240 doing 120

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.189 
inside so this is a xspc x240 doing 120
millimeter<00:00:52.620> radiator<00:00:55.460> according<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> xspc<00:00:57.199> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
millimeter radiator according to xspc it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.660 
millimeter radiator according to xspc it
combines<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.359> size<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.840> RSA<00:01:01.500> DS<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
combines the size of the RSA DS and the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.810 
combines the size of the RSA DS and the
performance<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.660> RS<00:01:04.080> series<00:01:04.619> RX<00:01:05.519> series

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
performance of the RS series RX series

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
performance of the RS series RX series
from<00:01:06.210> sorry<00:01:06.799> of<00:01:07.799> course<00:01:08.869> Eric<00:01:09.869> series<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
from sorry of course Eric series is a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:25.219 
from sorry of course Eric series is a
bit<00:01:11.369> better<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> let's<00:01:13.080> take<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:24.229> here's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
bit better so let's take a look here's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.420 
bit better so let's take a look here's
the<00:01:26.210> truth<00:01:27.210> or<00:01:28.040> black<00:01:29.840> we<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.140> longer<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the truth or black we have a longer and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.969 
the truth or black we have a longer and
short<00:01:33.650> booth<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:37.259> don't<00:01:37.320> care<00:01:37.530> about<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
short booth but we don't care about that

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.120 
short booth but we don't care about that
let's<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> actual<00:01:39.450> radiator<00:01:42.950> I'm<00:01:43.950> really

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
let's see the actual radiator I'm really

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.999 
let's see the actual radiator I'm really
excited<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.810> my<00:01:46.140> first<00:01:46.409> cup<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
excited because this is my first cup of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:58.940 
excited because this is my first cup of
water<00:01:47.340> cooling<00:01:47.990> look<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.940 

as<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.130> can<00:02:00.280> see<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:02.200> has<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:04.290> much<00:02:05.290> more<00:02:05.530> things

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
as you can see it has a much more things

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.440 
as you can see it has a much more things
than<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.790> older<00:02:07.750> series<00:02:11.370> also<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:13.120> things

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
than the older series also the things

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.150 
than the older series also the things
are<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:14.110> bit<00:02:15.209> recessed<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.530> touch<00:02:17.739> here

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
are a bit recessed so if you touch here

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.490 
are a bit recessed so if you touch here
you<00:02:18.640> probably<00:02:19.030> want<00:02:19.510> bandit<00:02:23.520> here<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:26.200> have

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
you probably want bandit here we have

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:36.930 
you probably want bandit here we have
some<00:02:27.030> plastic<00:02:28.030> touch<00:02:34.380> paint<00:02:35.380> quality<00:02:36.100> seems

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
some plastic touch paint quality seems

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:45.120 
some plastic touch paint quality seems
quite<00:02:37.750> good<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.900> next<00:02:44.170> few<00:02:44.769> days<00:02:44.980> I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
quite good and in the next few days I

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.970 
quite good and in the next few days I
will<00:02:45.310> receive<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.790> raster<00:02:46.360> parts<00:02:47.350> from<00:02:47.739> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
will receive the raster parts from a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.150 
will receive the raster parts from a
water-cooling<00:02:48.670> system<00:02:49.620> thanks<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:50.739> watching

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
water-cooling system thanks for watching

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.380 
water-cooling system thanks for watching
and<00:02:52.090> subscribe<00:02:53.050> for<00:02:53.080> more
