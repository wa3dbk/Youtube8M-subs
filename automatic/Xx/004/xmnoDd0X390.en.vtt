00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:12.120
 the crowd is fine with the tide turned 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.730
 slaughterer play it here with more video 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 go bad on strike and this time now 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.270
 I like here what is pixote 14 w9 has released 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 today thursday the good deal recording 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.609
 to be able to post a plaque with you today 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.949
 I believe in the right sex shop is some 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.740
 command courses and others barely function 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.969
 slime blog along with the right piston but 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.250
 Let's go to the shock that it 's small and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.559
 if possible do not take to usual 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.010
 certain that the washing machines 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.660
 because this hypothesis would be relatively 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.989
 small to that corner 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.329
 in addition if sfj was used in that corner 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.039
 lizard map and ends up happening one 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.760
 natural disaster exactly right. 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.329
 finally the first thing was modified 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.049
 it was now that the piston which is with Islam 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.900
 bloch 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.479
 she can now push a mobile player 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.970
 with so much going on right now 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.619
 Formerly, this one could be good. 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.470
 You do not even have to stand on the court for 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.090
 right up doing bullying but she can 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.409
 push forward that woman here 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.659
 Tag Fight 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.439
 I put that generated a certain power was 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.210
 one more certain that when trying to speak 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.030
 Okay, okay, I put ice here to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.100
 to be able to inform further and thus 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.979
 get farther certain the most 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.439
 even jeou but what you can do is just 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.579
 ten blocks because compared to the other 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.790
 what is normal 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.829
 it only goes up two blocks away 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.930
 three blocks is right, but it is 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.079
 basically that this new function of the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.020
 psoe to 0 boot one thing to do with it is 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.070
 it's a people launcher it 's up there 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.790
 I can launch myself now I was going to do 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.450
 thereby 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.360
 It is the new tnt cannon sure why 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.759
 we have a pantry full of tnt and the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.380
 push button will talk I tried vodka 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.900
 that hole right there 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.310
 the inter takes here she goes up this one 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.010
 that it rises and if it pushes I tried there 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.720
 To that right hole is beneficent it. 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.610
 now because you do not need the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.980
 water we really needed the other 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.450
 I've sat in other waters right now about 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.400
 this problem remains time to do it 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.290
 some issues and beyond. 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.150
 do this with a bow and arrow 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.410
 also know how to put several arrows here 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.470
 shoot me certain that the auction can do 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.910
 plastic even right corner is fine 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.830
 Interesting , cool, do a lot of 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.560
 things with that now with this function and 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.590
 loving the things I can do and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.040
 This is that you can now do the same 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.090
 that the seal a crazy mover I know there a 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.150
 subway 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.530
 some in kind that you just do 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.420
 develop faster 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.850
 I'll leave a video in the description maybe 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.130
 I do not know what the blog site is 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.710
 also certain that he ended up making a 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.850
 kind of crazy a knot 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:18.210
 there you move faster in the 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.980
 diagonal is low but sometimes not 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.830
 understand right but anyway 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:28.290
 Another thing that was modified was the 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.930
 word border right now is now 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.640
 If I go back home, I 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.010
 grab as they get more 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.110
 near the edge my screen getting 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.360
 red you can see what is normal and 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.710
 that is computed super red addresses 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.220
 also the right screen 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.560
 This is better because now I can know 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.810
 if aboard is near not right and serves 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.950
 when the ball is in motion and when 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.860
 the ball is stopped right in case it is already 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.170
 It has two commands here a cake 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.950
 Ball already has a website that is patient and is 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.459
 select the distance the ball goes right 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.800
 the ball 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.260
 The man who warns is that business 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.800
 was red on both an organ is 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.930
 dividing between time and distance ne 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.090
 the design is for when the ball is in 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.470
 move right how many seconds left 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.450
 for her to come to you 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.340
 she starts to aim to be basically me 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.520
 I said 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.220
 the ball is going to stop and then it can 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.830
 use with you 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.210
 stone for example here we have the other good 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.020
 for him 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.640
 we have here the warm times live that 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.290
 five seconds left for the ball 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.510
 get on me she'll use your loot 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.840
 for 10 and 15 because if I'm not mistaken it 's the 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.090
 right standard here for 10 and 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.470
 put it right ok you can see the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.360
 It's ten seconds before the ball reaches where 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.070
 I'm already red right 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.990
 rodrigo is getting more and more 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.870
 reddish right baby stronger and 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:04.380
 just scare scare enem damn boy 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:08.110
 boy boy chapel jaime ramos goes with 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.470
 damn crack spends a minute by 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.470
 minute 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.230
 Anyway, I do not think the ball goes from 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.630
 it's tiny 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:27.760
 She'll come closer to putting 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:30.700
 that I 5 that is original and has a man 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.360
 distance is the distance in blocks 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.760
 that the shock that begins to aim 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.310
 Pleasure that I play there are ten boxes taborda 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.580
 and from the boxes santa bomb aiming 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:48.040
 if the boot near not sure is also we have 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.460
 that the dn knows that the buffett team is 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.470
 is is compared to damage is damage that 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.800
 approach to work you overcome it 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.260
 it is in relation to the fact that by 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.350
 example the bank is at 5 or only 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.229
 starts lava damage of 25 box ball boot 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.600
 approaching exceeds five blocks 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:11.470
 Then I'll start giving it to you. 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.930
 way to survive right here is that we have the 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.669
 dmca lot to be right when you already 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.710
 giving the second after you 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:24.510
 exceeds the border from edge to edge 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:27.520
 normal beauty ball returned to normal but 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:37.180
 then another change he had was in the 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:37.840
 way the numbers hit you right and you 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.970
 can 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.540
 currently you may have to cut to the 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.600
 player 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.460
 already in the case that has a museum pull 104 if 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.800
 had another player could report 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.810
 now companies to use the time penalty 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.330
 that there was thought to command them to 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:56.160
 tpii could carry me to the player 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:59.200
 It's okay to power or close - and two 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.420
 even ask a member of a 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.630
 time as they had neither the team 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.950
 There is no way to choose rock but anyway 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.950
 basically what're guys 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.870
 If you liked the video there and favorites 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.810
 act shares part of the disclosure is 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.670
 basically this ok then spoke up 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.670
 next 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.670
 went
