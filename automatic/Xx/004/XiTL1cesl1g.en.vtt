00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.000
 gaming brand rafter crack in pro 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 headphones designed for gaming 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.470
 totally to achieve an adjustment 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.940
 Perfect ergonomic have a design and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.730
 a spectacular finish 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.210
 this is to make crack pro cost 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.220
 65 euros the diaphragms are 40 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.260
 millimeters has 32 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 homs and has a frequency response 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.780
 from 20 to 20,000 hertz to have some 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.360
 good bass and treble plus also 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.730
 It has a retractable microphone that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.920
 You can take it out only when you need it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 has some insulating pads 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.690
 perfectly the sound to play without 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.160
 no distraction this closed design 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.170
 the pads creates an insulation 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.180
 acoustic unbeatable so you can 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.860
 concentrate on the game or on a 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.860
 conversation yes noise bothers you 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.140
 external and something that I miss is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.420
 good padding on the headband since 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.609
 it is quite hard and although we have 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.339
 the very big head will not be any 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.630
 problem since we can adjust it up 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.210
 find the height more 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.770
 comfortable for us and if you usually wear 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.289
 the helmets everywhere 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.930
 you are ordaz to the crack in pro can you 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.689
 fold over itself to occupy the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.200
 less space possible and be able to take it 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.720
 with us everywhere in the neck 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 it feels really good and once you 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 we put it on completely isolates the noise 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.179
 outside to be able to listen 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.520
 perfectly the audio of the helmets 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.350
 although I do have to mention that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.479
 personally after a few 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.250
 hours of use the top of the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.670
 head where the padding of the headband 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.319
 is insufficient starts to bother in the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.330
 left part we have a microphone 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.459
 retractable that we can slide towards 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.099
 outside to use it and it's really 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.619
 comfortable plus flexible enough 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:55.619
 to be able to put it in the position that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.179
 we do better and now we are going to make a 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.689
 small test of the microphone of these 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.220
 do crack in pro good guys we're going to 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.950
 test the microphone of these 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.600
 crack in pro to see how it 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.610
 listen and now you are listening to me 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.770
 with this microphone with which I have 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.770
 table the usual normal of all the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.040
 life that from this channel so good we go to 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.060
 approve these so give me a second 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.060
 let's take this 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.989
 let's stop it and now even if it's a 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.840
 little ridiculous myself here because we're 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.349
 testing this helmet microphone 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.120
 to crack for pro and as you see my 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.819
 it seems it is not that it has a quality 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.980
 exaggerated of good I have seen helmets more 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.500
 cheap with better sound quality 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.510
 microphone to communicate with our 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.340
 friends although it is true that the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.980
 The quality of the microphone is not 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.489
 better but enough to communicate 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.920
 with friends I think for the money 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.260
 that cost those helmets should be a 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.620
 little bit better at least the microphone 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.989
 because it seems it seems wrong or at least 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.599
 from my point of view like this we are going to 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.579
 continue with the analysis and my 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.549
 conclusions my personal opinion about 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.680
 these helmets a loose helmets from my 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.680
 point of view since I expected much more 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.659
 of a brand with such fame the design is 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.939
 very nice but they are not the most 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.159
 comfortables of the market the sound in 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.650
 general is very serious we lose a lot 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.290
 quality in the media and treble 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.390
 and the microphone although it sounds good and 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.670
 it does not have a disastrous quality we have 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.280
 very loose helmets that stay in 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.890
 a nice design and little more in general 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.810
 we found little quality in relation to 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.000
 the price I hope you liked it 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.310
 this video you already know that I 'm not trying 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.280
 cheat anyone and I will always give you my 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.760
 impressions and what I believe about if 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.959
 worth or not worth the product 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.450
 remember that you can follow me 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:00.060

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.060
