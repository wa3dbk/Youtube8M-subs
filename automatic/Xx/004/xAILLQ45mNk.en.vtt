 actually she is the skylines 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.280
 not so difficult to master 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.040
 but you should already have a few things 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.900
 Therefore we have the field times 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.150
 reared up from behind and show you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 how your city could look if you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.660
 We make you five fatal mistakes 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.660
 introduce this video 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.880
 important is that the residential and 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.160
 industrial areas a healthy distance 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.230
 industrial areas have each other 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.910
 Pollute the environment whereupon yours 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.970
 city ​​dwellers get sick and also 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.379
 stay ill 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.329
 and of course you should not opera either 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.530
 or the loud wind power plants with 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.659
 build the residential areas 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:52.129
 because the noise drives away your inhabitants 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:53.180
 just fits so well that you present your city 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.220
 not flooded 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.559
 that happens faster than you think 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.539
 as soon as you turn a dam around 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.350
 An area is simply created 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.350
 flooded 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.950
 You should not make your roads too narrow 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.960
 to build 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.940
 Apart from the traffic jam, you will be fast 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.860
 note that neither the fire department nor the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.080
 reach miller in front of your destination 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.730
 at the latest if you burned more frequently 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.110
 houses should be discovered here over a 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:28.400
 Thinking about it does not save that 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.990
 apart from that 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.250
 heaps of buildings burn down yours 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.500
 Residents stay stupid and the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.070
 Crime increases frequently 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.550
 see this symbol and this or 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.550
 this 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.240
 Of course, the taxes should not be too 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.490
 high taxes are too high taxes 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 many inhabitants can not and do not want to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.520
 pay 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.119
 who disobeyed can watch as the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.469
 Residents flee from the city 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.240
 I hope I can help you with our tips 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.459
 maybe you have one too 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.560
 happy population in yours happy
