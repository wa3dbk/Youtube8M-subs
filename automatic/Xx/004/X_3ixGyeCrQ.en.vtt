00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
really is simple let's see how it's done

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.560 
really is simple let's see how it's done
so<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.590> start<00:00:36.980> sticking<00:00:37.400> the<00:00:37.670> pieces<00:00:38.120> we<00:00:38.360> need

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
so to start sticking the pieces we need

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.540 
so to start sticking the pieces we need
to<00:00:38.720> know<00:00:38.900> where<00:00:39.170> we<00:00:39.350> want<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.680> put<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.100> glue<00:00:40.340> on
