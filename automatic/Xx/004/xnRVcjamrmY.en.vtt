00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
we're really hoping to kind of dispel
some<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> myths<00:01:53.250> about<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.030> gamer<00:01:54.270> girl

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
some of the myths about the gamer girl

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
some of the myths about the gamer girl
personality<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.799> show<00:01:56.340> women<00:01:56.549> they

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
personality and and show women they

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
personality and and show women they
could<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.090> into<00:01:57.329> games<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.229> feel<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
could get into games and I feel that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.100 
could get into games and I feel that
that's<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.979> mission<00:01:59.340> that<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.630> both

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that's a mission that they both

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.609 
that's a mission that they both
succeeded<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.009> ultimately<00:02:02.520> failed<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.270> and

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
succeeded and ultimately failed on and

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.300 
succeeded and ultimately failed on and
the<00:02:04.619> reason<00:02:04.770> why<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:07.129> where<00:02:08.129> we've

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the reason why is because of where we've

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.430 
the reason why is because of where we've
been<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.970> past<00:02:09.149> couple<00:02:09.360> years<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.869> terms

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
been in the past couple years in terms

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.309 
been in the past couple years in terms
of<00:02:10.739> discussion<00:02:11.310> about<00:02:11.520> women<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.180> gaming

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
games has moved on and I think that is

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.080 
games has moved on and I think that is
probably<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.379> most<00:03:13.530> telling<00:03:13.920> reason<00:03:14.879> as<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
probably the most telling reason as to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.500 
probably the most telling reason as to
why<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.200> feels<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> dismissal<00:03:17.849> but<00:03:18.480> I

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
why it's it feels like a dismissal but I

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.390 
why it's it feels like a dismissal but I
believe<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.199> it's<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.470> actual<00:03:19.919> truth<00:03:20.220> I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
believe that it's the actual truth I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.990 
believe that it's the actual truth I

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.590 
have the freedom to do that sort of
thing<00:05:12.050> but<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.500> sucks<00:05:14.160> that<00:05:15.000> they're<00:05:15.240> retiring

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600

and<00:05:15.930> even<00:05:16.530> though<00:05:16.710> they<00:05:17.190> haven't<00:05:17.729> really<00:05:17.970> been

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
and even though they haven't really been

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.330 
and even though they haven't really been
relevant<00:05:18.479> in<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.810> number<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.080> years<00:05:19.410> I<00:05:19.620> feel

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
relevant in a number of years I feel

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.659 
relevant in a number of years I feel
when<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.180> comes<00:05:21.449> to<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.810> discussion<00:05:22.410> of

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
when it comes to the discussion of
