00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hey people and welcome here 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.759
 to another video lately 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.170
 reach me some news because 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.630
 I always mention it in 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.170
 my videos that a cpu in this 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.059
 case a clock frequency of 3 4 ghz and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
 for some , the question then came up with something 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.930
 is because now the clock frequency of one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.670
 processors and this I ask today 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.320
 Have fun with this video and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.320
 Immediately after the intro 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.420
 Now the term clock frequency is 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.490
 actually relatively easy explains the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.350
 clock frequency of a processor gives the 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.720
 speed rhythm one of a kind 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.180
 Computer processors also indicated in 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.760
 heart or simply said the number 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.650
 of working steps per second 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.380
 modern processors for example the in 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.450
 tsw cdu we move here in one 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.309
 area of â€‹â€‹several billion 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.160
 which is why there is a value here 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.910
 usually with giga or megahertz 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.680
 is specified 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.780
 In this case, league stands for 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.300
 billion and mega stands in this case 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.860
 for millions in addition differs 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.620
 one still tailor internal and one 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.510
 external clock frequency at the internal 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.240
 clock frequency is this 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.010
 the cpu clocking and this denotes the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.050
 pace with the internal commands 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.180
 be processed the higher the mega 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.580
 dax worth the faster the external 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.080
 clock frequency determined in this case with 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.700
 which speed on the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.460
 RAM or also called short 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.620
 accessed actually would 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.659
 now the more megahertz I mean 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.060
 The faster my calculator is 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.370
 not that in the current time 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.970
 it is more correct to see the cpu 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.770
 from amd from the fx 9000 series the one 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.630
 incredible rate of more than 4.7 gg 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.300
 sometimes also have five degrees and this 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.090
 are just as fast as an old one 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.390
 sandy bridge cpu from intel which to 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.370
 For example, it overclocks to 4.5 degrees 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.140
 the clocking of the cpu is in the current one 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.560
 not all the time 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.070
 computing power of a pcs so the data 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.240
 processing speed is 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.370
 but not only from the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.459
 clock frequency dependent but also of 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.290
 the whole structure of the processor and 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.330
 There is more to the concept in this case 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.160
 clock frequency he can not say anymore 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.780
 I hope you have the video a little further 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.790
 helped if that was the case 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.769
 just answer that with one 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.300
 commentary as well as a positive one 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.890
 rating that would be me in this case 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.690
 of course as always happy 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.430
 please ask more about this 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.530
 contact form on my website 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.959
 if it really needs to be 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.580
 must also about youtube but here's the 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.620
 hints that youtube mailbox 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.810
 currently does not work properly 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.099
 otherwise as always thank you for 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.719
 we will certainly see you in the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.969
 next video again if that's the case 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.900
 should I assume that too 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.640
 subscribe button 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.120
 So you have clicked until the next time 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.120
 pure skin
