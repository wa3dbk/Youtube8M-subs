checking around this wooded area and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
checking around this wooded area and
then<00:00:14.880> come<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:15.929> tree<00:00:16.289> here<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.390> it<00:00:18.390> got

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's just going to be a little bit of a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.250 
it's just going to be a little bit of a
crappy<00:00:48.000> costume<00:00:48.480> jewelry<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.930> I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.170> this
