00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
this is for the most part very true

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.740 
this is for the most part very true
because<00:01:02.989> every<00:01:03.989> character<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> world<00:01:05.309> at

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
because every character in the world at

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.140 
because every character in the world at
most<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:07.170> could<00:01:07.229> only<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.860> around<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.939> Bill

most they could only have around to Bill

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.990 
most they could only have around to Bill
that's<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.170> max<00:01:10.380> amount<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.890> mesos<00:01:11.250> so

that's like the max amount of mesos so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.810 
that's like the max amount of mesos so
there<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.750> an<00:01:13.140> only<00:01:13.590> set<00:01:13.890> amount<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.340> money<00:01:14.580> in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.749 
there is an only set amount of money in
the<00:01:14.939> world<00:01:15.140> per<00:01:16.140> player<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.799> since<00:01:19.799> monsters

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
getting a little bit more into detail

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.280 
getting a little bit more into detail
about<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.640> when<00:02:51.640> there's<00:02:51.849> a<00:02:51.940> low<00:02:52.329> supply<00:02:52.660> and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
about that when there's a low supply and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.240 
about that when there's a low supply and
a<00:02:53.890> high<00:02:54.220> demand<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.930> price<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.590> item<00:02:56.829> is

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
a high demand the price for that item is

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.000 
a high demand the price for that item is
going<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.269> be<00:02:58.420> really<00:02:58.720> high<00:02:58.930> because<00:02:59.739> there's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
going to be really high because there's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.130 
going to be really high because there's
not<00:03:00.160> many<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.299> lot<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.540> people<00:03:01.930> want

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
not many of it and a lot of people want

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.080 
not many of it and a lot of people want
it<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.560> people<00:03:02.739> will<00:03:02.980> be<00:03:03.130> paying<00:03:03.489> or<00:03:03.849> be

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
it so people will be paying or be

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.300 
it so people will be paying or be
willing<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:05.049> pay<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> lot<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.680> money<00:03:05.980> for<00:03:06.069> that

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
willing to pay a lot of money for that

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.949 
willing to pay a lot of money for that
item<00:03:06.519> um<00:03:08.010> which<00:03:09.010> kind<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.599> encourages<00:03:10.599> I<00:03:10.780> guess

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
item um which kind of encourages I guess

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.400 
item um which kind of encourages I guess
you<00:03:11.110> could<00:03:11.230> say<00:03:11.519> maple<00:03:12.519> errs<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:13.180> go<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.170> try

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
you could say maple errs to go and try

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.220 
you could say maple errs to go and try
to<00:03:14.470> get<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.889> light<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.250> them<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:16.230> once

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
to get that light of them and once

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.430 
to get that light of them and once
enough<00:03:17.889> people<00:03:18.430> get<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.480> item<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.139> start

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
enough people get that item and start

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.680 
enough people get that item and start
making<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:21.010> or<00:03:21.190> getting<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.609> or<00:03:21.700> whatever<00:03:21.880> the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
making it or getting it or whatever the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.020 
making it or getting it or whatever the
supply<00:03:23.079> will<00:03:23.319> go<00:03:23.500> up<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.220> demand<00:03:24.670> will<00:03:24.819> go

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
supply will go up and the demand will go

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.559 
supply will go up and the demand will go
down<00:03:25.620> lowering<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.769> price<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> item

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
down lowering the price of the item

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.770 
down lowering the price of the item
which<00:03:28.569> is<00:03:28.870> why<00:03:29.319> items<00:03:30.130> eventually<00:03:30.940> lower<00:03:31.359> and

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
which is why items eventually lower and

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.229 
which is why items eventually lower and
there's<00:03:32.709> also<00:03:32.920> another<00:03:33.160> reason<00:03:33.400> why<00:03:34.030> they'll

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
there's also another reason why they'll

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.800 
there's also another reason why they'll
over<00:03:34.480> two<00:03:34.660> is<00:03:34.930> because<00:03:36.030> rowlett<00:03:37.030> supply<00:03:37.480> is

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
over two is because rowlett supply is

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.900 
over two is because rowlett supply is
getting<00:03:38.290> higher<00:03:38.609> there's<00:03:39.609> going<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.850> be

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
getting higher there's going to be

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.240 
getting higher there's going to be
competition<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.989> it's<00:03:41.920> going<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.130> be

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
competition and it's going to be

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.490 
competition and it's going to be
competition<00:03:42.730> for<00:03:42.970> how<00:03:43.450> low<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.870> could<00:03:44.200> sell

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
competition for how low you could sell

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.180 
competition for how low you could sell
it<00:03:44.530> because<00:03:45.400> if<00:03:46.060> you're<00:03:46.840> selling<00:03:47.290> your<00:03:47.590> item

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
it because if you're selling your item

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.449 
it because if you're selling your item
for<00:03:48.819> an<00:03:48.910> example<00:03:49.180> lower<00:03:50.139> than<00:03:50.650> someone<00:03:51.220> is

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
for an example lower than someone is

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.550 
for an example lower than someone is
selling<00:03:51.700> theirs<00:03:52.120> people<00:03:52.900> are<00:03:53.019> going<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.410> buy

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
selling theirs people are going to buy

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.030 
selling theirs people are going to buy
it<00:03:53.590> from<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.359> in<00:03:55.599> order<00:03:55.900> for<00:03:56.260> people<00:03:56.769> to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
it from you so in order for people to

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.319 
it from you so in order for people to
get<00:03:58.000> money<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.950> guess<00:03:59.950> they<00:04:00.489> have<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.910> make<00:04:01.120> it

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
get money I guess they have to make it

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.530 
get money I guess they have to make it
lower<00:04:01.989> than<00:04:02.410> your<00:04:02.620> price<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:03.359> eventually<00:04:04.359> it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
lower than your price and eventually it

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.449 
lower than your price and eventually it
will<00:04:04.630> just<00:04:04.780> keep<00:04:04.989> steadily<00:04:05.380> going<00:04:05.739> down<00:04:06.160> as

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
will just keep steadily going down as

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.849 
will just keep steadily going down as
the<00:04:07.299> supply<00:04:07.630> goes<00:04:07.870> up<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.349> demand<00:04:08.650> goes

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
the supply goes up and the demand goes

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.370 
the supply goes up and the demand goes
down<00:04:09.090> overall<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.510> brings<00:04:10.750> down<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:10.989> price<00:04:11.230> of

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
down overall it brings down the price of

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.430 
down overall it brings down the price of
the<00:04:11.440> item<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:13.060> other<00:04:13.209> one<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.810> when<00:04:14.260> the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
the item the other one is when the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.360 
the item the other one is when the
supply<00:04:14.709> is<00:04:14.829> where

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
supply is where

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.360 
supply is where
high<00:04:15.580> in<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.000> demand<00:04:16.510> is<00:04:16.690> really<00:04:16.989> low<00:04:17.370> so

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
high in the demand is really low so

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.490 
high in the demand is really low so
these<00:04:18.549> are<00:04:18.609> common<00:04:19.329> items<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.959> are<00:04:20.079> usually

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
these are common items that are usually

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.950 
these are common items that are usually
like<00:04:20.799> not<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.790> great<00:04:22.210> at<00:04:22.510> nobody<00:04:22.930> wants<00:04:23.500> and

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
like not that great at nobody wants and

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.480 
like not that great at nobody wants and
enable<00:04:25.960> story<00:04:26.290> usually<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:27.190> more<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:28.750> less

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
enable story usually the more the less

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.330 
enable story usually the more the less
good<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.820> item<00:04:31.120> is<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:32.199> more<00:04:32.440> calm<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:32.919> to

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
good the item is the more calm it is to

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.330 
good the item is the more calm it is to
get<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.669> or<00:04:33.880> make<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.120> or<00:04:34.540> whatever<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.340> that's

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
get it or make it or whatever and that's

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.020 
get it or make it or whatever and that's
what<00:04:36.669> makes<00:04:36.880> items<00:04:37.949> pretty<00:04:38.949> much<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.400> low<00:04:39.669> price

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
what makes items pretty much a low price

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.689 
what makes items pretty much a low price
and<00:04:40.330> items<00:04:40.900> have<00:04:41.139> a<00:04:41.350> high<00:04:41.560> price<00:04:41.889> that's<00:04:42.370> what

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
and items have a high price that's what

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.969 
and items have a high price that's what
kind<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.740> basis<00:04:44.740> determines<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.990> now<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.770> rule

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
kind of basis determines it now the rule

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.000 
kind of basis determines it now the rule
i<00:04:48.010> was<00:04:48.280> talking<00:04:48.669> about<00:04:48.850> that<00:04:49.030> breaks<00:04:49.449> it<00:04:49.690> is

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
i was talking about that breaks it is

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.730 
i was talking about that breaks it is
events<00:04:51.010> i<00:04:52.169> don't<00:04:53.169> know<00:04:53.260> if<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:53.530> guys<00:04:53.650> can

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
events i don't know if you guys can

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.240 
events i don't know if you guys can
remember<00:04:54.310> but<00:04:55.180> um<00:04:55.690> pretty<00:04:56.680> sure<00:04:56.800> was<00:04:56.919> like<00:04:57.070> the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
remember but um pretty sure was like the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.180 
remember but um pretty sure was like the
leveling<00:04:57.789> ring<00:04:58.150> or<00:04:58.389> whatever<00:04:58.800> like<00:04:59.800> the

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
leveling ring or whatever like the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.560
