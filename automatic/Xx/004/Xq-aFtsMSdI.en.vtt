about<00:00:39.290> math<00:00:40.290> education<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.550> think<00:00:41.760> why

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
about math education and I think why

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.970 
about math education and I think why
everyone<00:00:42.239> hates<00:00:42.420> math<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.960> when<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.559> grow<00:00:43.800> up

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
everyone hates math is when you grow up

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.299 
everyone hates math is when you grow up
especially<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.489> America<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.000> math<00:00:45.239> um<00:00:46.309> what

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
especially in America in math um what

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.069 
especially in America in math um what
they<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.879> tell<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.450> can't<00:00:48.780> do

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
they do is tell you you can't do

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
they do is tell you you can't do
something<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> next<00:00:50.670> year<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.030> math

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
something and then the next year in math

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
something and then the next year in math
they<00:00:51.539> say<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> actually<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.890> here's

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
they say will you actually can here's

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
they say will you actually can here's
how<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.780> can't<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.320> stuff<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
how and but you can't do this stuff and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.840 
how and but you can't do this stuff and
then<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.980> next<00:00:56.190> year<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> would<00:00:56.760> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
then the next year like it would you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.580 
then the next year like it would you
can't<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.750> remember<00:00:58.500> when

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
can't you can do this remember when

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.869 
can't you can do this remember when
you<00:00:58.680> were<00:00:58.770> young<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.430> was

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you were young you know what it was

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
you were young you know what it was
you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.300> only<00:01:00.539> subtract<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> smaller<00:01:01.590> number

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you can only subtract a smaller number

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.660 
you can only subtract a smaller number
from<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> bigger<00:01:02.370> number<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> said<00:01:04.189> 12<00:01:05.189> minus

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
think that don't or you go to hell it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
think that don't or you go to hell it
would<00:01:12.090> bring<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.360> some<00:01:12.750> sort<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> heat<00:01:13.380> really

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
would bring out some sort of heat really

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
would bring out some sort of heat really
scary<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.880> known<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.570> ever<00:01:15.720> marry<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> if

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
scary thing known will ever marry you if

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
scary thing known will ever marry you if
you<00:01:16.409> subtract<00:01:16.920> 20<00:01:17.280> from<00:01:17.310> 12<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.000> can't<00:01:18.240> do

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you subtract 20 from 12 you can't do

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.850 
you subtract 20 from 12 you can't do
that<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> sudden<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.710> hit

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that and then all of a sudden you hit

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
that and then all of a sudden you hit
7th<00:01:20.220> grade<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.670> they're<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.970> negative

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
7th grade and they're like negative

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
numbers you're like negative what can I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.550 
numbers you're like negative what can I
can<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> still<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.369> married

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
can I still get married

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
can I still get married
no<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.009> subtracted<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> sixth<00:01:30.030> grade<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
no you subtracted in sixth grade you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
no you subtracted in sixth grade you
can't<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.590> why<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
can't do that what why do they do that

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.899 
can't do that what why do they do that
why<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.140> way<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.460> can't<00:01:35.759> like

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
why is that the way you can't like

like<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:41.579> we're<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> course

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
like now we're going to have a course

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
like now we're going to have a course
called<00:01:42.600> infinity<00:01:43.590> where<00:01:44.070> all<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.670> talk

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
called infinity where all we do is talk

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.429 
called infinity where all we do is talk
about<00:01:44.850> infinity<00:01:45.329> every<00:01:45.720> day<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.049> multiply

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
about infinity every day we multiply

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.770 
about infinity every day we multiply
everything<00:01:46.740> by<00:01:46.920> infinity<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> know

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
everything by infinity and then you know

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
everything by infinity and then you know
what<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.930> said<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.380> happens<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> subtract

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
what I said what happens if you subtract

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.039 
what I said what happens if you subtract
infinity<00:01:50.909> from<00:01:51.090> infinity<00:01:51.570> they're<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.930> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
infinity from infinity they're like you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.800 
infinity from infinity they're like you
can't<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.549> isn't<00:01:53.729> doesn't<00:01:54.720> even

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
can't do that that isn't doesn't even

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.170 
can't do that that isn't doesn't even
mean<00:01:54.990> anything<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:56.689> then<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> degree

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
mean anything and then I got a degree

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.959 
mean anything and then I got a degree
god<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> hate<00:02:00.450> math<00:02:00.659> why<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.439> people<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.920> that

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
god I hate math why do people do that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.210 
god I hate math why do people do that
why<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.030> they<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.299> that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.559 

you<00:02:08.220> know<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> answer<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.910> what's<00:02:09.119> infinity

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you know the answer to what's infinity

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.559 
you know the answer to what's infinity
minus<00:02:09.869> infinity<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:11.190> depends<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.270> really

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
minus infinity it depends it really

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.809 
minus infinity it depends it really
depends<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.830> could<00:02:14.069> be<00:02:14.160> infinity<00:02:14.580> could<00:02:14.730> be

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
depends it could be infinity could be

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.510 
depends it could be infinity could be
zero<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.390> could<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.630> constant<00:02:16.370> depends<00:02:17.370> I

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
zero it could be a constant depends I

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.949 
zero it could be a constant depends I
don't<00:02:17.670> know<00:02:17.760> can't<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.630> negative<00:02:18.780> number

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
don't know can't be a negative number

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.580 
don't know can't be a negative number
though<00:02:19.489> those<00:02:20.489> aren't<00:02:20.760> real<00:02:21.290> come<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.410> full

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
though those aren't real come in full

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.980 
though those aren't real come in full
