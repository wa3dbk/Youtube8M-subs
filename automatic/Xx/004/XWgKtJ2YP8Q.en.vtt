00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.030
 chess game we started a new 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.760
 series a series that is going to link 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.650
 surrender and this series will consist of 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.750
 that every video I'm going to put five 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.330
 positions okay let's start with 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.380
 very simple positions positions 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.560
 they can be matte in order to win 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.710
 in that is I explain myself if the exercise that 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.280
 I put that day is matter 1 because there will be 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.160
 5 position to mate in a 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.170
 play whether they have to move seaweed 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.110
 We'll tell you white if you have to move 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.649
 to blacks because they will checkmate 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.059
 in a play or it may be to win in already 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.820
 either piece or some type of advantage 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.899
 material is worth x movements per 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.239
 example I will say win in a movement then 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.700
 you have to look for the movement to win 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.809
 in a single movement if I say win in 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.340
 two movements 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.339
 we will have to look for those two movements 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.320
 that do not win the game or if I say 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.270
 kill 2 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.940
 we will have to look for those two movements 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.180
 those three movements to win the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.450
 game will be quick positions and I 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.360
 because in the video I will put here a little watch 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.610
 which will be discounted according to the type of 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.830
 difficulty then I'll put or three seconds 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.200
 so where the time to visualize or 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.970
 five seconds or what you think is necessary 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.850
 in principle in simple exercises 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.800
 of matt in one for example I'll put 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.869
 three seconds because it will be very simple and 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.570
 in three seconds you have to see it is worth it and 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.020
 so we will continue to the next position and 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.640
 will be dynamic in principle then ale 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.770
 five exercises per video 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 well we started the first position and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.810
 white blocks we have 3 seconds 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.180
 the correct move is we have the battery 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.360
 of bishop and lady is lady for g7 check 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.360
 mate 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.369
 We have the second position 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.369
 move to white we have 3 seconds 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.270
 well the correct play is queen for h 7 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.060
 the lady is defended by the horse 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.940
 Checkmate what other care is the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.900
 white the black lujÃ¡n and mate in c 2 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.230
 checkmate and do not pass to the next 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.230
 exercise 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.319
 they play white we have 3 seconds 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.230
 the right move we have the worst in 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.590
 that 6 the correct play is lady g7 and 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.480
 mate check lady supported by the pawn and the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.639
 lady has sneaked into the structure of 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.909
 black pawns in this position plays 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.909
 white more than one we have three seconds 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.240
 the correct move is tower h 3 check 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.220
 mate we see that here the king can not 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.640
 come because he's checking the box 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.220
 you feel the pawn of df 6 and the column 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.410
 the tower dominates on the other hand I hope 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.890
 that you have also seen that yes 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.600
 White did not make that move because the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.600
 negra had a checkmate in f2 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.459
 they are very simple parts but time 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.200
 also the limited we have the new 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.180
 position you have to move the white 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.340
 they have a checkmate in one and the black 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.340
 muhammad in two we have three seconds 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.680
 Although the channel plate contour h 8 fable 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.190
 mate this box is controlled by the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.830
 bishop 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.230
 it will go back no and the black ones win 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.760
 those who have thought that such more wells 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.240
 by fingers lie because it controls the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.240
 bishop 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.600
 with which the play of the dura 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.480
 black 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:11.110
 I gave by check, white has to 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.090
 back with the lady and lady for the 1 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.430
 Javier part good I hope he has 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.950
