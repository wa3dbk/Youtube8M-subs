00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.099
 welcome to my bakery today 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.820
 I will propose a very good dessert 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:31.599
 exceptional is a dessert made of one 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.410
 chocolate mousse with pearls 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.070
 crunchy we will make glasses very much 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.500
 the subjects are fast and really tasty 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.500
 first are a liter of fresh cream 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.290
 650 grams of dark chocolate at 70 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.489
 percent and 600 grams of cream 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.829
 Our first phase confectioner we begin a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.280
 whip the fresh cream 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:12.180
 obviously without sugar we pour it and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:14.729
 a basin at medium speed 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 let's go mount it what i do 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.369
 I also recommend the cream is not too much 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.369
 mounted 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.820
 we continue our mixing 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.690
 we melted the chocolate or in the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:45.000
 microwave or bain-marie and we have 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:48.700
 heated a cream at about 45 degrees 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.290
 with lysed help of a spatula we go 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:59.160
 to pour these two components to make 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:03.520
 a beautiful emotion very important thing 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.320
 is that the emulsion rates have a 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.320
 really chocolate mousse 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.110
 exceptional with the use of a whisk 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.470
 let's mix these two 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.470
 ingredients 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.830
 let's take a good turn with strength and how 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:30.240
 see we got a compound 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.600
 very smooth and shiny that guarantees us 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.380
 a perfect emulsion this temperature 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:44.630
 now we are at about 40 degrees e 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.630
 let's admit whipped cream 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.150
 now first part at the beginning we mix with 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.150
 care 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.150
 so 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.370
 after the first part of the cream 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.849
 is absorbed we add the panda 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.849
 instantly 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.100
 ok 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.099
 I recommend not to overdo it 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.190
 movements 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.190
 otherwise we risk disassembling the product 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:45.579
 this is precisely the technique 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.579
 turn the whip in this way 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.320
 here 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.180
 if our chocolate mousse and 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.180
 ready 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.650
 we are going to compose our glass 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.370
 we begin to put pearls at the base 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.209
 of chocolate with the use of a sac 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.459
 hood we go to fill it with mousse 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.260
 chocolate 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.770
 once our short is 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.570
 completed we go to decorate it melts 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.570
 fresh raspberries said 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.180
 with the suggestions I can give you is that 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.639
 still a dessert and that you can 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.870
 you can also prepare days in advance 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.970
 Freeze in the fridge 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.389
 positive for about four days in 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.330
 perfect way and therefore a product 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.909
 very very easy to serve the 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.000
 temperature service and about 4 degrees 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:49.259
 thanks for your attention 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.259
