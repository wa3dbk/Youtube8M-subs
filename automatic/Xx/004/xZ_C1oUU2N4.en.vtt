 Hello and welcome to always short i am at the ear and he does not he me clear 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.829
 simply again the EBK and Prussia put 1 works 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.119
 That's why it's not that different from Vanishing Point 4 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.119
 but I think four confused Liszt 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.210
 the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.050
 the version is so different 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.079
 the man opens against me 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.099
 Beverstedt here 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.099
 Jailbreaking No. 40 g 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.400
 Dr that can not show just a light Apple TV have it to us 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.960
 expensive 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.780
 then like to give away 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.780
 He is welcome to contact me 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 RP because this window is coming is just no 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.600
 the rest is an eternal one 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.690
 Preparation so it is growing 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.690
 next to it is where the fruit comes from 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.749
 and to explain who the keys once 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.330
 that needs 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.890
 hate the chassis dog 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.750
 and here on the page 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.140
 I had it like this 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.400
 this one here 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 is this the key 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.010
 home button 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 he hates her 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.700
 to care 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.330
 Prepare tough Becks leave it for three seconds 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.120
 because there ideas about Roth dpa 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 Steeb are waiting for you to keep it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.370
 South Baden stuck 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.070
 2 2 seconds and 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 the setting on it 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.100
 irritated me and just go 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.040
 then Peter squeezed 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.110
 and of course I would still have both 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.840
 such a simple reason 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.530
 then the ten seconds waited 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.210
 the very fast right 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.190
 be counted here on the page below 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.680
 if the starting from approx 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.910
 then run are guest 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.230
 this Oberkassel going on 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.770
 that Smith happened at the beginning of that they let go but always 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.929
 again 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.579
 this will be 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.579
 Just let go »us good 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.809
 and if you let go of the upper one 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.639
 therefore, and the lower continues 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.939
 then it has to respond to it for 15 seconds over 1500 m Power PC on 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.779
 occupied drivers 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.109
 and 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.030
 Data and construction workers are pressed best 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.030
 there was informed 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:44.579
 I'm a bit tired it may be that I can not afford the hero in the beginning 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.579
 succeed 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.049
 a tip from me MacBook series came off completely 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.379
 is just easier 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.239
 yes 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.239
 and then we make the topic together 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.869
 in fact 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.589
 we take ours 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.589
 a finger round to beginners 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.339
 and 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.339
 on iTunes just before these three seconds 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.139
 hold on top of the iPad now 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.799
 and then wait for the why 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.879
 for ten seconds 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.499
 you have to say yourself exactly 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.529
 but let's release panels and keep Rome waiting 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.649
 So the Masses applies and he recognizes everything 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.999
 and then he sees already here next door 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.039
 at the bets 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.829
 that is the way is free 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.959
 Follow Albert Village 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.959
 and wait 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.499
 Now, on the old building percent will create a forum or Albertina together 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:07.639
 can 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.639
 a code or loaded and to his program 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:15.349
 around 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.900
 Percent and that's what we are 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.280
 and so the percent or 20 Berlin over the baths that the doctors the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.550
 can or 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.550
 other things 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:33.969
 The first victory - like the other exchanges - is simply one of them 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.099
 completely different BP to the code line 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.740
 appropriate 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.909
 in the man as normal 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.909
 friendlier does not understand 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.419
 in Durban a bit different 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.419
 if they know any 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.939
 Tauss was also an operating system 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.599
 very old one of the first 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.419
 so now he can make a famous cottage on the 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.629
 yes, also back on the program and Türk 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:10.489
 the rest what's going on now
