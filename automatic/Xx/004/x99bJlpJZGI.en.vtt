the end of jailbreaking that's the end

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.930 
the end of jailbreaking that's the end
of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> reason<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.130> wanting<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.460> jailbreak

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
of the reason for wanting to jailbreak

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
of the reason for wanting to jailbreak
there's<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.420> an<00:00:15.630> official<00:00:16.260> way<00:00:16.350> to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
there's going to be an official way to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.830 
there's going to be an official way to
install<00:00:16.740> software<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:18.660> has

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
install software what you know what has

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.599 
install software what you know what has
changed<00:00:19.289> or<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.740> has<00:00:19.920> continued<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
changed or what to has continued the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
changed or what to has continued the
jailbreaking<00:00:20.970> community<00:00:21.510> along<00:00:21.810> after<00:00:22.289> Apple

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
jailbreaking community along after Apple

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.349 
jailbreaking community along after Apple
opened<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.100> up<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.310> essentially<00:00:23.820> created<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
opened it up and essentially created the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849 
opened it up and essentially created the
ability<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:24.930> people<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.500> write<00:00:25.680> applications

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
ability for people to write applications

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.009 
ability for people to write applications
and<00:00:26.430> put<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.300> onto<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> phone

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and put them on to the onto the phone

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.769 
and put them on to the onto the phone
well<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:30.119> big<00:00:30.240> thing<00:00:30.269> about<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> App

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
well so the big thing about the App

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.720 
well so the big thing about the App
Store<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.340> only<00:00:32.550> have

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
Store is that it you really only have

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
Store is that it you really only have
applications<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.780> that's<00:00:34.230> something<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
applications and that's something that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.160 
applications and that's something that
many<00:00:35.640> people<00:00:35.700> don't<00:00:35.940> realize<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
many people don't realize is it is a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.110 
many people don't realize is it is a
core<00:00:37.500> limitation<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.430> an<00:00:38.489> application<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
core limitation I'm in an application is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.760 
core limitation I'm in an application is
something<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.510> has<00:00:39.600> an<00:00:39.690> icon<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.260> opens<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
something it has an icon it opens it

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.369 
something it has an icon it opens it
closes<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.370> gone<00:00:41.610> what<00:00:42.270> people<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:43.020> really

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
closes it's gone what people are really

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
closes it's gone what people are really
interested<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.309> ability<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.030> change

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
interested in is the ability to change

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.540 
interested in is the ability to change
the<00:00:45.780> entire<00:00:45.960> experience<00:00:46.440> even<00:00:47.370> when<00:00:47.489> an

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the entire experience even when an

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.010 
the entire experience even when an
application<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.210> running<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.719> change

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
application is not running to change

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.930 
application is not running to change
what<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.190> do<00:00:50.370> to

a<00:01:15.780> computer<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.590> change<00:01:16.860> your

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
a computer you can change your

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
a computer you can change your
background<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.759> change<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> way<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
background you can change the way that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.030 
background you can change the way that
the<00:01:18.750> layout<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.439> change<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.740> fonts

the layout is you can change your fonts
all<00:01:20.159> those<00:01:20.310> things<00:01:20.549> those<00:01:20.970> things<00:01:21.210> cannot<00:01:21.600> be

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
all those things those things cannot be

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
all those things those things cannot be
done<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.170> an<00:01:22.350> iPhone<00:01:22.770> unless<00:01:23.220> you've

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
done on an iPhone unless you've

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.219 
done on an iPhone unless you've
jailbroken<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.360> City<00:01:24.689> allows<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
jailbroken in so City allows you to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
jailbroken in so City allows you to
install<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:25.770> those<00:01:26.070> plugins<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.970> extensions

install all those plugins and extensions

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.270 
install all those plugins and extensions
and<00:01:27.600> those<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.320> programs<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and those little programs that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.289 
and those little programs that
essentially<00:01:29.729> allow<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> make

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
essentially allow you to make

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
essentially allow you to make
modifications<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:31.290> change<00:01:31.590> all<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.860> those

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
modifications to change all of those

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.830 
modifications to change all of those

settings that you can't do by default
that<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.560> correct<00:01:34.799> waiting<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> break<00:01:36.150> an

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
that is correct waiting can you break an

company<00:03:07.109> do<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.290> find<00:03:07.530> who's<00:03:07.769> going<00:03:08.010> to

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
company do you find who's going to

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.530 
company do you find who's going to
actually<00:03:08.489> physically<00:03:08.790> do<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.060> work<00:03:09.239> on<00:03:09.419> your

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
actually physically do the work on your

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.819 
actually physically do the work on your
phone<00:03:09.689> that<00:03:09.930> might<00:03:10.079> be<00:03:10.200> worth<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.530> maybe<00:03:10.680> you

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
phone that might be worth it maybe you

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.080 
phone that might be worth it maybe you
don't<00:03:10.980> want<00:03:11.189> to<00:03:11.250> learn<00:03:11.310> how<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.549> do<00:03:11.669> that<00:03:11.819> but

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
don't want to learn how to do that but

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.119 
don't want to learn how to do that but
frankly<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.959> software<00:03:13.379> is<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.620> simple<00:03:13.889> these

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
frankly the software is so simple these

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.099 
frankly the software is so simple these
days<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.819> single<00:03:15.150> program<00:03:15.329> you<00:03:15.689> download

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
days it's a single program you download

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.839 
days it's a single program you download
it<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.409> plug<00:03:16.590> your<00:03:16.709> phone<00:03:16.769> in<00:03:17.010> over<00:03:17.189> USB<00:03:17.400> it's

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
it you plug your phone in over USB it's

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.520 
it you plug your phone in over USB it's
got<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.269> button<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.169> click<00:03:19.409> it

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
got one button that's it you click it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.349 
got one button that's it you click it
you<00:03:19.560> try<00:03:20.069> not<00:03:20.159> to<00:03:20.280> touch<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:21.030> only<00:03:21.180> thing

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
you try not to touch it the only thing

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.539 
you try not to touch it the only thing
that<00:03:21.479> go<00:03:21.629> wrong<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.989> if<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.169> touch<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.620> 30

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
that go wrong is if you touch it and 30

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.920 
that go wrong is if you touch it and 30
seconds<00:03:23.849> later<00:03:24.060> your<00:03:24.239> phone<00:03:24.419> is<00:03:24.540> fully<00:03:24.659> done

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
seconds later your phone is fully done

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.229 
seconds later your phone is fully done
so<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.769> think<00:03:26.129> that<00:03:26.310> what<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.909> guys<00:03:27.000> are<00:03:27.209> doing

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
so I think that what you guys are doing

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.629 
so I think that what you guys are doing
to<00:03:27.540> jailbreak<00:03:27.959> every<00:03:28.169> single<00:03:28.409> jailbreak<00:03:28.919> is

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
to jailbreak every single jailbreak is

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.849 
to jailbreak every single jailbreak is
essentially<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.750> reversed<00:03:31.319> when<00:03:31.530> Apple

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
essentially the reversed when Apple

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.740 
essentially the reversed when Apple
releases<00:03:32.189> their<00:03:32.519> next<00:03:32.879> software<00:03:33.030> update<00:03:33.299> and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
releases their next software update and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.089 
releases their next software update and
of<00:03:33.810> course<00:03:34.049> people<00:03:34.229> that<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.560> jailbreak<00:03:34.949> and

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
of course people that have jailbreak and

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.770 
of course people that have jailbreak and
phones<00:03:35.250> need<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.519> be<00:03:35.639> careful<00:03:36.120> when<00:03:36.569> they<00:03:36.720> do

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
phones need to be careful when they do

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.149 
phones need to be careful when they do
their<00:03:37.049> upgrades<00:03:37.379> to<00:03:37.530> make<00:03:37.650> sure<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:37.979> there

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
their upgrades to make sure that there

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.189 
their upgrades to make sure that there
is<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> path<00:03:38.729> to<00:03:39.030> upgrade<00:03:39.569> their<00:03:39.840> with<00:03:40.079> their

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
is a path to upgrade their with their

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.479 
is a path to upgrade their with their
jail<00:03:40.379> right<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.650> next<00:03:40.889> jailbreak<00:03:41.340> is

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
jail right the next jailbreak is

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.490 
jail right the next jailbreak is
available<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.569> guys<00:03:42.720> are<00:03:42.870> essentially

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
available you guys are essentially

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.710 
available you guys are essentially

how many more of these of these flaws

how many more of these of these flaws
are<00:03:54.689> out<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.019> mean<00:03:55.079> are<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.769> guys<00:03:55.919> going

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
are out there I mean are you guys going

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.069 
are out there I mean are you guys going
to<00:03:56.159> run<00:03:56.310> out<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.609> Apple<00:03:56.879> ever<00:03:57.000> going<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.449> to<00:03:57.989> get

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
to run out as Apple ever going to to get

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.899 
to run out as Apple ever going to to get
the<00:03:58.139> next<00:03:58.379> step<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.769> don't<00:03:59.250> know<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.430> mean<00:03:59.699> it's<00:03:59.819> a

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
the next step I don't know I mean it's a

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.670 
the next step I don't know I mean it's a
very<00:03:59.939> complicated<00:04:00.599> system<00:04:01.139> there<00:04:01.349> are<00:04:01.409> a<00:04:01.470> lot

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
very complicated system there are a lot

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.409 
very complicated system there are a lot
of<00:04:01.709> moving<00:04:01.949> parts<00:04:02.189> I'm<00:04:02.609> gonna<00:04:02.939> be<00:04:03.299> not

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
of moving parts I'm gonna be not

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.640 
of moving parts I'm gonna be not
physically<00:04:03.840> moving<00:04:04.019> but<00:04:04.259> there's<00:04:04.409> a<00:04:04.439> lot<00:04:04.620> of

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
physically moving but there's a lot of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.710 
physically moving but there's a lot of
software<00:04:05.069> in<00:04:05.280> there<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.699> we<00:04:06.359> really<00:04:06.599> only

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
software in there and we really only

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.449 
software in there and we really only
have<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.019> find<00:04:07.259> one<00:04:07.560> hole<00:04:07.799> each<00:04:07.979> time<00:04:08.220> and

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
have to find one hole each time and

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.009 
have to find one hole each time and
we're<00:04:08.549> be<00:04:08.639> able<00:04:08.759> to<00:04:08.819> get<00:04:08.909> in<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.599> occasionally

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
we're be able to get in so occasionally

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.539 
we're be able to get in so occasionally
I<00:04:10.290> haven't<00:04:10.620> been<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.799> person<00:04:10.979> saying<00:04:11.370> you

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
I haven't been the person saying you

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.249 
I haven't been the person saying you
know<00:04:11.699> we<00:04:12.030> probably<00:04:12.239> have<00:04:12.449> another<00:04:12.629> month<00:04:12.870> but

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
know we probably have another month but

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.499 
know we probably have another month but
I've<00:04:13.500> learned<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.979> just<00:04:14.159> avoid<00:04:14.459> saying<00:04:14.759> that<00:04:15.030> I

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
I've learned to just avoid saying that I

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.659 
I've learned to just avoid saying that I
were<00:04:16.320> probably<00:04:16.500> never<00:04:16.709> jailbreak<00:04:17.159> I<00:04:17.370> have

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
were probably never jailbreak I have

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.520 
were probably never jailbreak I have
some<00:04:17.880> variety<00:04:18.030> for<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.690> very<00:04:18.870> long<00:04:18.989> time<00:04:19.049> how

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
some variety for a very long time how

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.620 
some variety for a very long time how
many<00:04:19.709> are<00:04:19.829> in<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.009> jailbreak<00:04:20.400> community<00:04:20.630> so

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
many are in the jailbreak community so

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.170 
many are in the jailbreak community so
if<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.109> say<00:04:22.469> that<00:04:22.860> as<00:04:23.159> number<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.520> users<00:04:23.849> we're

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
if you say that as number of users we're

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.940 
if you say that as number of users we're
looking<00:04:24.450> at<00:04:24.659> on<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.990> order<00:04:25.260> of<00:04:25.289> 6<00:04:25.770> million

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
looking at on the order of 6 million

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.610 
looking at on the order of 6 million
maybe<00:04:26.789> I'm

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
maybe I'm

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.260 
maybe I'm
I<00:04:27.650> never<00:04:27.949> have<00:04:28.100> an<00:04:28.190> exact<00:04:28.520> number<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.880> little

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
I never have an exact number a little

there any reporting that goes back when

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.680 
there any reporting that goes back when
you<00:05:01.130> install<00:05:01.430> an<00:05:01.580> application<00:05:01.699> if<00:05:02.210> if<00:05:02.449> an

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
you install an application if if an

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.240 
you install an application if if an
application<00:05:03.050> itself<00:05:03.440> can<00:05:03.680> determine<00:05:04.100> that

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
application itself can determine that

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.159 
application itself can determine that
there<00:05:04.430> is<00:05:04.639> a<00:05:05.000> jailbreak<00:05:05.270> on<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.750> phone<00:05:05.930> is

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
there is a jailbreak on the phone is

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.140 
there is a jailbreak on the phone is
Apple<00:05:06.560> gathering<00:05:07.100> this<00:05:07.220> info<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:07.880> I've<00:05:08.000> never

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
Apple gathering this info so I've never

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.610 
Apple gathering this info so I've never
actually<00:05:08.360> determined<00:05:08.960> whether<00:05:09.139> Apple's

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
actually determined whether Apple's

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.680 
actually determined whether Apple's
gathering<00:05:09.979> that<00:05:10.070> info<00:05:10.310> or<00:05:10.430> not<00:05:10.550> but<00:05:11.240> frankly<00:05:11.660> I

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
gathering that info or not but frankly I

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.150 
gathering that info or not but frankly I
believe<00:05:12.229> that<00:05:12.380> Apple<00:05:12.620> knows<00:05:12.770> if<00:05:12.919> your<00:05:13.039> phone

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
believe that Apple knows if your phone

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.250 
believe that Apple knows if your phone
is<00:05:13.190> jailbroken<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.820> would<00:05:14.240> not<00:05:14.360> get<00:05:14.960> into<00:05:15.110> an

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
is jailbroken I would not get into an

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.540 
is jailbroken I would not get into an
argument<00:05:15.380> with<00:05:15.620> Apple<00:05:15.919> if<00:05:16.010> they<00:05:16.100> claimed<00:05:16.370> your

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
argument with Apple if they claimed your

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.100 
argument with Apple if they claimed your
phone<00:05:16.729> is<00:05:16.850> jailbroken<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.419> he<00:05:17.539> didn't<00:05:17.780> know<00:05:17.840> so

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
phone is jailbroken so he didn't know so

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.870 
phone is jailbroken so he didn't know so
we're<00:05:18.260> probably<00:05:18.470> on<00:05:18.740> some<00:05:18.830> black<00:05:19.280> list<00:05:19.669> and

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
we're probably on some black list and

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.100 
we're probably on some black list and
that's<00:05:20.000> probably<00:05:20.120> why<00:05:20.330> Steve<00:05:20.570> never<00:05:20.780> replies

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
that's probably why Steve never replies

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.240 
that's probably why Steve never replies
