look look down here Kyle this is a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.400 
look look down here Kyle this is a
simple<00:03:22.300> engagement<00:03:22.750> before<00:03:22.900> your<00:03:23.140> 4<00:03:23.320> wheel

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
simple engagement before your 4 wheel

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.350 
simple engagement before your 4 wheel
drive<00:03:23.710> lock<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.430> what<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:24.640> basically<00:03:24.730> does<00:03:25.030> is

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
drive lock and what it basically does is

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.060 
drive lock and what it basically does is
when<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.600> pull<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.930> up<00:03:26.380> on<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.650> dash<00:03:26.830> it'll

when you pull it up on the dash it'll

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.820 
when you pull it up on the dash it'll
say<00:03:27.160> four<00:03:27.340> wheel<00:03:27.460> drive<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.820> means<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.300> your

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
say four wheel drive it means that your

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.140 
say four wheel drive it means that your
portioning<00:03:29.830> out<00:03:30.010> torque<00:03:30.490> front<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:30.970> rear

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
portioning out torque front and rear

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.960 
portioning out torque front and rear
equal<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.230> works<00:03:32.620> like<00:03:33.160> indeed<00:03:33.520> snow<00:03:33.760> and

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
equal and it works like indeed snow and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.190 
equal and it works like indeed snow and
mud<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.270> whatnot<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:34.780> actually<00:03:34.900> works

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
mud and whatnot and it actually works

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.320 
mud and whatnot and it actually works
pretty<00:03:35.260> good<00:03:35.490> sorry<00:03:36.490> I'll<00:03:36.850> let<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.150> get<00:03:37.270> back

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
not only that but the entire interior of

not only that but the entire interior of
the<00:03:50.440> Patriot<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.330> vastly<00:03:52.330> improved<00:03:52.450> over<00:03:53.080> say

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
the Patriot is vastly improved over say

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.650 
the Patriot is vastly improved over say
2012<00:03:54.430> or<00:03:54.910> before

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
2012 or before

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.170 
2012 or before
and<00:03:55.950> fortunately<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.520> materials<00:03:58.000> themselves

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
and fortunately the materials themselves

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.120 
and fortunately the materials themselves
are<00:03:58.810> higher<00:03:59.020> quality<00:03:59.050> granted<00:04:00.040> they're

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
are higher quality granted they're

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.920 
are higher quality granted they're
getting<00:04:00.310> drenched<00:04:00.610> right<00:04:00.730> now<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.150> another

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930

thing that I really do enjoy is the fact
the<00:04:03.550> stereo<00:04:03.910> system<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.360> pretty<00:04:04.570> damn<00:04:05.050> good

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470

road noise the steering well it's fine
it's<00:04:46.930> not<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.140> big<00:04:47.350> deal

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
it's not a big deal

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.710 
it's not a big deal
but<00:04:47.919> it's

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
but it's

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.420 
but it's
not<00:04:48.870> very<00:04:49.200> adjustable<00:04:49.530> either<00:04:50.040> in<00:04:50.310> other

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
not very adjustable either in other

not very adjustable either in other
words<00:04:50.640> there's<00:04:50.970> no<00:04:51.030> telescoping<00:04:51.720> feature

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
words there's no telescoping feature

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.110 
words there's no telescoping feature
damn<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.380> so<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:53.070> goes<00:04:53.490> up<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:53.790> now<00:04:53.880> but<00:04:54.030> it

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
damn it so it goes up and now but it

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.790 
damn it so it goes up and now but it
won't<00:04:54.180> telescope<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:54.900> really<00:04:55.380> wish<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.650> would

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
won't telescope I really wish it would
