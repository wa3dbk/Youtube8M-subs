00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
you have to make Master Chief look

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.480 
you have to make Master Chief look
better<00:05:47.419> no<00:05:47.539> pressure<00:05:47.810> there<00:05:48.050> right<00:05:48.259> yeah<00:05:48.589> no

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
better no pressure there right yeah no

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.779 
better no pressure there right yeah no
pressure<00:05:49.729> challenge<00:05:50.330> yet

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.189 

so<00:05:53.789> obviously<00:05:54.180> you've<00:05:54.330> done<00:05:54.449> a<00:05:54.479> ton<00:05:54.870> of<00:05:54.900> things

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199

flight<00:06:24.810> action<00:06:25.169> sequence<00:06:25.620> we're<00:06:26.099> developing

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
flight action sequence we're developing

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.909 
flight action sequence we're developing
a<00:06:26.639> lot<00:06:26.729> of<00:06:26.849> new<00:06:26.970> technologies<00:06:27.750> that<00:06:28.169> are<00:06:28.410> going

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
a lot of new technologies that are going

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.960 
a lot of new technologies that are going
to<00:06:29.039> I<00:06:29.699> think<00:06:30.560> open<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.650> lot<00:06:31.800> of<00:06:31.889> eyes<00:06:32.039> as<00:06:32.460> to<00:06:32.699> how

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
to I think open a lot of eyes as to how

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.850 
to I think open a lot of eyes as to how
films<00:06:33.389> can<00:06:33.509> be<00:06:33.570> made<00:06:33.810> in<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.050> future<00:06:34.410> so<00:06:34.800> you

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
films can be made in the future so you

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.529 
films can be made in the future so you
guys<00:06:35.039> are<00:06:35.340> a<00:06:35.370> story<00:06:35.789> maker<00:06:36.060> you<00:06:36.210> guys<00:06:36.389> are

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
guys are a story maker you guys are

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.589 
guys are a story maker you guys are
filmmakers<00:06:37.430> storytellers<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:38.460> pioneers<00:06:39.300> in

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
filmmakers storytellers and pioneers in

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.080 
filmmakers storytellers and pioneers in
technology<00:06:40.229> and<00:06:40.380> in<00:06:40.530> that<00:06:41.280> space<00:06:41.610> we're

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
technology and in that space we're

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.310 
technology and in that space we're
talking<00:06:42.270> so<00:06:42.570> much<00:06:42.690> about<00:06:42.750> it<00:06:43.080> I'm<00:06:43.169> getting

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
talking so much about it I'm getting

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.589 
talking so much about it I'm getting
anxious<00:06:43.500> just<00:06:43.830> looking<00:06:44.550> at<00:06:44.669> it<00:06:44.699> wait<00:06:45.389> we're

out you got something that students do
oh<00:06:49.159> I<00:06:50.159> like<00:06:50.729> that<00:06:50.759> out<00:06:50.940> the<00:06:51.090> other<00:06:51.210> this<00:06:51.539> robot

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
oh I like that out the other this robot

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.059 
oh I like that out the other this robot
thing<00:06:52.050> that<00:06:52.199> you<00:06:52.349> don't<00:06:52.560> be<00:06:52.650> like<00:06:52.800> this<00:06:52.889> is

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069 
thing that you don't be like this is

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.890 
thing that you don't be like this is
conscious<00:06:53.610> oh<00:06:53.759> right<00:06:53.970> okay<00:06:54.270> so<00:06:54.659> we're<00:06:54.810> gonna

check our conference this is darren
actually<00:06:59.220> doing<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.520> performance<00:07:00.030> as<00:07:00.210> build

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
actually doing the performance as build

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.719 
actually doing the performance as build
a<00:07:00.960> robot<00:07:01.289> that's<00:07:01.470> his<00:07:01.800> hips<00:07:02.009> you<00:07:02.340> can<00:07:02.490> see<00:07:02.699> a

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
a robot that's his hips you can see a

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:04.279 
a robot that's his hips you can see a
little<00:07:02.880> hip<00:07:03.180> motion<00:07:03.419> going<00:07:03.720> on<00:07:03.900> that's<00:07:04.139> this

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
little hip motion going on that's this

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.749 
little hip motion going on that's this
way<00:07:05.930> so<00:07:06.930> basically<00:07:07.349> bill<00:07:07.590> stumbles<00:07:08.009> into<00:07:08.190> he

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 
way so basically bill stumbles into he

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.640 
way so basically bill stumbles into he
shows<00:07:08.969> up<00:07:09.120> early<00:07:09.270> to<00:07:09.570> construction<00:07:10.020> site<00:07:10.349> for

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
shows up early to construction site for

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.110 
shows up early to construction site for
work<00:07:10.770> one<00:07:10.949> day<00:07:11.130> and<00:07:11.340> it<00:07:11.759> turns<00:07:11.969> out<00:07:12.060> that

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
work one day and it turns out that

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.060 
work one day and it turns out that
there's<00:07:12.509> some<00:07:13.080> of<00:07:13.199> his<00:07:13.289> co-workers<00:07:13.469> doing

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
there's some of his co-workers doing

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.760 
there's some of his co-workers doing
some<00:07:14.280> shady<00:07:14.729> shit<00:07:14.849> with<00:07:15.330> this<00:07:15.659> dead<00:07:15.840> body<00:07:16.050> and

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 
a dump in this body into wet cement and

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.560 
a dump in this body into wet cement and
then<00:07:19.469> they<00:07:19.620> catch<00:07:19.860> him<00:07:20.039> he's<00:07:20.580> like<00:07:20.849> I<00:07:21.030> wasn't

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
then they catch him he's like I wasn't

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.240 
then they catch him he's like I wasn't
supposed<00:07:21.659> to<00:07:21.870> be<00:07:22.020> here<00:07:22.229> rug<00:07:22.500> bug<00:07:22.860> he<00:07:23.070> gets

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
supposed to be here rug bug he gets

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.029 
supposed to be here rug bug he gets
surrounded<00:07:23.750> nail<00:07:24.750> gun<00:07:25.080> see<00:07:25.380> though<00:07:25.560> these

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 
surrounded nail gun see though these

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:27.170
