00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720 

um<00:00:00.089> let's<00:00:00.810> see<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.829> theory<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.190> because

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
um let's see so so the theory is because

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.910 
um let's see so so the theory is because
in<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.240> past<00:00:03.480> whenever<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:03.899> do<00:00:04.080> stuff<00:00:04.319> visually

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
in the past whenever I do stuff visually

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.020 
in the past whenever I do stuff visually
I<00:00:04.950> would<00:00:05.250> draw<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.460> figure<00:00:06.049> around<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:08.030> draw

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
I would draw the figure around I draw

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.879 
I would draw the figure around I draw
the<00:00:09.090> background<00:00:09.540> around<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.929> figure<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.500> but

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the background around the figure and but

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.589 
the background around the figure and but
then<00:00:11.040> if<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.280> ended<00:00:11.519> up<00:00:11.610> nudging<00:00:11.969> him<00:00:12.360> around<00:00:14.599> if

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
then if I ended up nudging him around if

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.810 
then if I ended up nudging him around if
I<00:00:15.750> ended<00:00:15.929> up<00:00:15.990> nudging<00:00:16.369> Robin<00:00:17.369> around<00:00:17.490> or

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
I ended up nudging Robin around or

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.099 
I ended up nudging Robin around or
something<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.210> I'd<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.480> kind<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.840> draw

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
something that I'd have to kind of draw

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.099 
something that I'd have to kind of draw
in<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> back<00:00:19.560> yeah<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.310> can't<00:00:20.580> yeah<00:00:21.359> well<00:00:21.869> so

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
in the back yeah you can't yeah well so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.340 
in the back yeah you can't yeah well so
so<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> mean<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.430> tweak<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.510> fly<00:00:24.779> you

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so now I mean I can tweak on the fly you

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.650 
so now I mean I can tweak on the fly you
know<00:00:25.439> tweak<00:00:25.769> whatever<00:00:26.609> about<00:00:27.090> Robin<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.510> can

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
know tweak whatever about Robin I can

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.150 
know tweak whatever about Robin I can
shrink<00:00:27.840> them<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.619> rotate<00:00:29.010> them

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
shrink them a little bit or rotate them

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.259 
shrink them a little bit or rotate them
or<00:00:29.279> something<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.939> that's<00:00:30.029> what

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
or something like that and that's what

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
or something like that and that's what
your<00:00:30.660> art<00:00:30.869> which<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.380> cool<00:00:31.619> yeah<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.460> that's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
your art which is cool yeah and that's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
your art which is cool yeah and that's
what<00:00:32.820> makes<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.300> much<00:00:33.719> quicker<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.170> because

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
what makes it so much quicker is because

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
what makes it so much quicker is because
if<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.649> draw<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> good<00:00:35.160> face<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.910> but

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
if I draw a good face that I like but

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.720 
if I draw a good face that I like but
it's<00:00:36.210> too<00:00:36.750> small<00:00:37.079> then<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:38.190> isolate

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it's too small then I can just isolate

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.389 
it's too small then I can just isolate
it<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:42.260> can<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.290> lift<00:00:43.530> isolate<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.280> like

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
it I can just lift isolate it with like

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.479 
it I can just lift isolate it with like
a<00:00:44.430> lasso<00:00:44.879> tool<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.120> something<00:00:46.070> this<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
a lasso tool or something this is just a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.889 
a lasso tool or something this is just a
real<00:00:47.670> rough<00:00:47.960> put<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> different<00:00:49.320> layer

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
real rough put it to a different layer

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.250 
real rough put it to a different layer
there<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:54.449> know<00:00:54.570> increase

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
there we go and then you know increase

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.939 
there we go and then you know increase
or<00:00:55.440> decrease<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.920> size<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.840> yeah<00:00:57.949> well

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
or decrease the size of it or yeah well

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.560 
or decrease the size of it or yeah well
this<00:00:59.190> has<00:00:59.370> been<00:00:59.399> real<00:00:59.789> beneficial

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
this has been real beneficial

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.299 
this has been real beneficial
well<00:01:00.899> drawing<00:01:01.109> Robin<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:01.859> he's<00:01:02.129> such<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
well drawing Robin because he's such a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.210 
well drawing Robin because he's such a
difficult<00:01:02.969> age<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.809> portray<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> regular

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
difficult age to portray on a regular

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.300 
difficult age to portray on a regular
basis<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:05.700> he's<00:01:06.049> got<00:01:07.049> weird<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:08.040> quite

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
basis because he's got weird not quite

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.280 
basis because he's got weird not quite
an<00:01:08.460> adult<00:01:08.549> stage<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:09.990> what's<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:11.210> one

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
an adult stage right what's that one

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
an adult stage right what's that one
they<00:01:13.290> did<00:01:13.470> draw<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.090> what

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
they did draw that one but that's what

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.620 
they did draw that one but that's what
he<00:01:15.420> drew<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> drew<00:01:16.340> see<00:01:17.340> look

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
he drew this is what I drew see look

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
he drew this is what I drew see look
this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:18.960> name<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:20.189> Williams<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.799> then

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this is my name pretty Williams and then

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.460 
this is my name pretty Williams and then
also<00:01:23.939> another<00:01:24.540> benefit<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> drawing<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
also another benefit of drawing the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
also another benefit of drawing the
background<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> could

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
background like that is that I could

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.460 
background like that is that I could
then<00:01:27.180> use<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.570> background<00:01:28.020> somewhere<00:01:28.290> else

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
then use this background somewhere else

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.980 
then use this background somewhere else
if<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.710> needed<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.390> save<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.840> all

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
if I needed to because you save it all

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.490 
if I needed to because you save it all
yeah<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.430> preserved<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:34.259> little

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
yeah so that it's preserved this little

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.569 
yeah so that it's preserved this little
nice<00:01:34.650> purse<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.880> oh<00:01:36.090> yeah<00:01:37.020> you

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
nice purse kind of oh yeah you

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.990 
nice purse kind of oh yeah you
duplicated<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> went<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:41.000> okay

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
duplicated it and it went kind of okay

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.960 
duplicated it and it went kind of okay
um<00:01:42.720> let's<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.189> goes<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> inks

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
um let's see so then it goes to the inks

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.460 
um let's see so then it goes to the inks
I<00:01:45.180> usually<00:01:45.750> save<00:01:45.930> them<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.320> different

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
I usually save them out as different

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.630 
I usually save them out as different
files<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.549> goes<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.799> let's<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
files as it goes on let's see so that I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.800 
files as it goes on let's see so that I
have<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> inks<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
have the inks kind of like on a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.270 
have the inks kind of like on a
different<00:01:52.110> layer<00:01:52.320> well<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.070> was<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
different layer well that was the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.030 
different layer well that was the
pouches<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.030> inks<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> different<00:01:54.810> layer

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
pouches but inks on the different layer

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.120 
pouches but inks on the different layer
but<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.170> finally<00:01:58.530> before<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.950> show<00:01:59.100> you

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
but and and finally before I show you
