00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.190
 is that in fact ct was a test for 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.199

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.470
 It's no use trying to talk to you. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.140
 and what is theoretically going to be released 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.840
 Because there is a lot of expensive stuff. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.360
 weapon modification that will be one of the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.550
 major changes that will fall 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.070

 God lift has a lot that 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.129
 it was a lot even practically 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.700
 hitting trying to at least hit a 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:18.930
 game completely and in that last release 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.239
 this last one and then say and the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.170
 is also bringing this promise of 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.330
 that will hit the bf completely 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.940
 You can see there's a lot going on. 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.430
 even talking is going to be for all 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.250
 platforms for all uses and servers 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.349
 this update can always see why it has 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.230
 a lot that she has guns and pro 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.630
 they're hitting is some guns 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.019
 squeezing maps and has some links and 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.959
 maps is has some some guns and will 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.640
 stay a little better and some will 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.590
 worsen a little more precisely for 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.900
 Try to be so little more the game I am 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.319
 playing that is because it has a lot of bad to 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.790
 Mother you give a foot is a shot and a lot 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.739
 you end up killing an enemy 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.079
 very fast in feminism defense then 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.299
 are dropping by about 1% are 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.610
 here below some percentages leave from 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.250
 weapon damage 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.099
 it seems like a lot but in the end the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.730
 accounts there will be a longer time and more 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.100
 where it is that the power to defend itself in 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.250
 relation to your enemy friends 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.480
 You can also see guns pedaling. 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.019
 you can see and carbine ammunition 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.139
 carabinas pd in losing data also lmg 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.239
 from mr everything is being modified with 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.760
 this new pet 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.549
 you may also see some 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.310
 animations will also be 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.730
 modified some bugs that have animation 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.700
 and they are hitting like the newspaper in the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.060
 automatic an automatic rifle in the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.799
 This unique automatic pistol is also and 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.290
 fix the hummer when you pull the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.099
 trigger without hitting the hummer of the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.650
 only 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.440
 So there's a lot to look at and we 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.830
 details of what they are doing in that 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.920
 last patch and it will be 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.080
 a lot of things including 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.790
 also grenades they will be hitting 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.430
 in a balanced computer in the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.750
 grenades ok then take a look at this 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.690
 I left this book in hand that 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.370
 destination at this time and in the 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.110
 description you will see 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.200
 There are a lot of things practically 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.110
 making a new game for a new game 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.800
 comes with this last part and it seems to me 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.380
 that this patch was r in general in fact 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.110
 and as you can see in the bid link 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.930
 for all platforms and in the pc had 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.460
 some are modifications but only 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:53.330
 few things and also on ps3 then 11 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:57.290
 The only other modifications that 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.960
 some on the pc and some also on ps3 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.110
 how is the fixed in the game that was finding 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.740
 a ps3 and also on pc 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.690
 before they serve with a promise and 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.030
 solve these two lend a lot of people 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.250
 were taking even on the pc are 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.680
 playing and suddenly catching everything does not 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.450
 could get by cassio which initial pc or 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.910
 then close the game restart again 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.590
 sometimes he does not even know the game you had 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.870
 you really realize that 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.210
 There are a lot of people that I 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.760

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.800
