00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.609 
XLR audio inputs and here on this side
we've<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:35.040> got<00:01:35.960> jack<00:01:36.960> connections<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we've also got jack connections for the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.649 
we've also got jack connections for the
aviation<00:01:38.040> headsets<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> want<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
aviation headsets so if you want the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.450 
aviation headsets so if you want the
headsets<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.530> noise-canceling<00:01:41.280> headset

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
headsets the noise-canceling headset

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.210 
headsets the noise-canceling headset
with<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> microphone<00:01:42.110> for<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> talkback<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
with a microphone for the talkback you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.490 
with a microphone for the talkback you
plug<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> directly<00:01:44.820> into<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> camera<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
plug it directly into the camera so you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.319 
plug it directly into the camera so you
don't<00:01:46.740> need<00:01:46.860> any<00:01:47.130> additional<00:01:47.340> device<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
don't need any additional device and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.530 
don't need any additional device and
then<00:01:48.750> also<00:01:48.930> there's<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> lank<00:01:50.159> remote<00:01:51.119> control

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
then also there's a lank remote control

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.929 
then also there's a lank remote control
as<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:53.189> designed<00:01:53.790> for

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
as well so it really is designed for

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.460 
as well so it really is designed for
studio<00:01:54.299> use<00:01:54.329> there's<00:01:54.659> no<00:01:54.750> recording<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
studio use there's no recording in the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.870 
studio use there's no recording in the
camera<00:01:55.799> there's<00:01:56.250> never<00:01:56.340> recording

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
camera there's never recording

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.459 
camera there's never recording
capability<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:57.930> designed<00:01:58.320> for

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
capability because it's designed for

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.530 
capability because it's designed for
studio<00:01:58.950> use<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.700> way<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> camera

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
studio use and the way that the camera

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.569 
studio use and the way that the camera
connects<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.530> switches<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.430> other
