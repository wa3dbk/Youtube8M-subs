00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
but why don't you get all three of them

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:52.580 
but why don't you get all three of them
together

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
together

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.409

I<00:04:52.710> like<00:04:53.190> happen<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.790> have<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.120> take<00:04:54.270> extra

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
I like happen so I have to take extra

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.360 
I like happen so I have to take extra
care<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.810> mine<00:04:55.080> I've<00:04:55.470> even<00:04:55.710> got<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.830> cage<00:04:56.100> to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
care of mine I've even got a cage to

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.280 
care of mine I've even got a cage to
keep<00:04:56.520> them<00:04:56.700> in<00:04:56.820> so<00:04:56.970> they<00:04:57.060> can't<00:04:57.270> escape<00:04:57.510> there

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
keep them in so they can't escape there

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.930 
keep them in so they can't escape there
we<00:04:58.440> go

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
we go

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.170 
we go
in<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.060> go<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.419> you're<00:05:00.570> going<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.750> go<00:05:00.900> stay<00:05:02.180> and

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
in you go in you're going to go stay and

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.670 
in you go in you're going to go stay and
put<00:05:03.300> them<00:05:03.450> in<00:05:03.539> like<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.780> that's<00:05:03.840> but<00:05:04.289> because

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
put them in like that that's but because

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.770 
put them in like that that's but because
they're<00:05:04.890> so<00:05:04.919> magic<00:05:05.520> they<00:05:06.180> always<00:05:06.479> manage<00:05:06.750> to

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
they're so magic they always manage to

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.260 
they're so magic they always manage to
escape<00:05:06.960> even<00:05:07.380> when<00:05:07.740> my<00:05:07.890> pet<00:05:08.190> rabbit<00:05:08.430> Geronimo

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
escape even when my pet rabbit Geronimo

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:20.290 
escape even when my pet rabbit Geronimo
is<00:05:09.360> looking<00:05:09.660> after<00:05:09.810> them<00:05:11.180> cheerio<00:05:12.180> folks

do you know you even taught me a magic
way<00:05:27.540> of<00:05:27.690> flying<00:05:27.960> like<00:05:28.200> Superman<00:05:28.250> which<00:05:29.250> is

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
way of flying like Superman which is

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.260 
way of flying like Superman which is
pretty<00:05:29.520> good<00:05:29.700> really<00:05:29.850> because<00:05:30.060> he's<00:05:30.150> actually

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
pretty good really because he's actually

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.730 
pretty good really because he's actually
time<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.660> catch<00:05:30.810> up<00:05:30.990> with<00:05:31.110> space<00:05:31.290> watch<00:05:31.530> now

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
time to catch up with space watch now

what's<00:05:32.460> that<00:05:32.730> you<00:05:33.450> can't<00:05:33.780> fly<00:05:34.200> yes<00:05:35.720> it's<00:05:36.720> easy

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
what's that you can't fly yes it's easy

00:05:36.990 --> 00:06:27.770 
what's that you can't fly yes it's easy
it's<00:05:37.320> like<00:05:37.470> this

well<00:06:42.220> it<00:06:42.550> was<00:06:42.670> quite<00:06:42.880> easy<00:06:42.910> when<00:06:43.420> you<00:06:43.540> were

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
well it was quite easy when you were
