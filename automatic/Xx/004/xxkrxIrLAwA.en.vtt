00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.180
 Now what about friends or friends in this 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.330
 video I will teach you how to record the 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.330
 screen of your ipod touch iphone or ipad 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.600
 well the only requirement that they have to 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.710
 have is the break in your device 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.480
 let's go to silvia 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.730
 drive 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.550
 Edit 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.700
 add 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.700
 and we are going to put h 7 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.250
 v 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.250
 and point 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.860
 they give you to add source I do not because 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400
 I got it 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.400
 is this 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.369
 let's go find 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.369
 and we are going to put display 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.460
 I remembered 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.460
 and this one that says iphone banner 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.960
 we give tap 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.920
 and to install confirm and we wait for 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.920
 run 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.060
 As you can see here, let 's see on restarting 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.060
 the sprint work 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.000
 and we unlock it 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.140
 as you see here is a new icon 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.980
 what is this record is to start 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.980
 record we can 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.770
 to activate the off button 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.770
 to block 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.660
 everything from here giving it here and record 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.250
 as you see here it comes out 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.060
 and start recording 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.740
 and as you see when you record it looks like this 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.400
 a white ball 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.180
 and well then here to finish it 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.180
 they give again here 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.680
 ok they open the room and as you come here to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.969
 be enough 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.969
 the one that they just recorded 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:14.019
 Unfortunately this application does not record 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.019
 sound 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.420
 and for example here they can erase it 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.490
 upload to youtube or 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.100
 and save in the 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:31.200
 in the photos 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.200
 and good that was all they'll let go 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.730
 to put a video of a demonstration that 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.300
 I recorded with this one with the lamb display 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.710
 I saw that if you can record the audio 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.710
 for this we are going to go to settings 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.010
 and here on display I remembered 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.170
 here you can put for example when 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.970
 they are recording a game 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.390
 put it aside 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.680
 left or right the format here 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:09.439
 They give to record the audio too 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.439
 this is if they leave it they do not move anything 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.920
 and then here in the quality of the video 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.900
 medium or high 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.650
 well that was all I hope you have 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:25.840
