00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 how do I today find myself 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.970
 in a video to talk about my 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.620
 hair because soon madam video 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 I have a lot of compliments on 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.130
 hair and we often ask my routine 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.139
 cabinet asterÃ¨s 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 I do not necessarily have a road 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.920
 capillary but in this understatement I 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.420
 shown the products use in matter 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.890
 shampoo and I'll explain a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.859
 little technique for those who want 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.949
 therefore the volume like me here I 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.650
 would like all this in detail in this 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 video I can not take more time 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.890
 to make this video intro I'm going 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.550
 start right in the heart of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.879
 subject here is that maazou hair to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.989
 the base and its 7 6 actually I do not realize 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.190
 not 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.559
 contrary to what we think 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 usually because even in high school 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.390
 fox movies uses her hair 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.520
 schwan is where you have to look good 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.230
 no they are they are my list 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.760
 naturally and would like us to listen 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.690
 and here it is my desire is tight but 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.789
 I want one who has hair 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.260
 cut because high school shows it's 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.449
 boring obviously because we do not have 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.939
 wanted we have it all flat there is 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.659
 any form completely each time it 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.520
 the lava and it's about the recession she 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 even made with the loops it can 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.810
 change from day to day 20 is sure it's 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.520
 that you take it strong I like 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.930
 not necessarily my hair I would like 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.030
 more hours she more forms more of 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.570
 grain market roof more and more of 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.460
 volumes more than two tufts what's 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 blow ben as my hair is really 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.740
 dish I'm told I used it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.740
 volumizing shampoos so that I have 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.159
 started by buying this one from home 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.700
 nivea 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.829
 so it's the nivea organic shampoo inter 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.899
 volume sensations it's for the hair 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.670
 end up in volume than what I have in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.299
 Actually it's true that I tested at the same 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.470
 time but hey it does not work so well that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.990
 it 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.719
 not even at all and in addition he makes 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.730
 knots finally he gets out of the shower and a 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.980
 Belgian 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:06.710
 everything is in addition to that another woman 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.470
 the hair bassar what I have not my 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.190
 hair finally savor my hair like 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.780
 it's short so I do not necessarily like this 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.000
 finally produces the first on board so 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.340
 well I gave up and that one that 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.260
 already been four months that I have them there 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.150
 is still not full but yesterday me 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.630
 I have fully announced this one messin 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.030
 ultra sweet garnish with brewer's yeast 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.130
 so that's going to see these arts too much 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.450
 well because I wanted it was a 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.240
 period when I cut my hair 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.530
 that I wanted to grow them and we 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.690
 when I saw the lipr of beer I say 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.040
 maybe valero push and besides 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.620
 when I saw that it was for the volume 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.690
 and the flat hair then says it's good 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.960
 he is for me and have indeed pushed back 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.240
 to lead joly hm it's perfect and we do not 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.750
 do not push to actually it's not it's 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.290
 not his goal 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.030
 go ahead grow your hair but its 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.550
 goal is to give volume and lyndon 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:10.520
 not wow huddle but not with 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.110
 the telline I use that gives this 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.830
 result we will tell you but my hair 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.800
 are really flat at the base is there I 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:24.170
 I'm glad because well I 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:27.230
 go down more airy more more or even before 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.150
 if there is against it happens I have to 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.400
 really being too north there's still 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.880
 not much anymore 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.890
 and here we buy it so deliver between 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.720
 other property and compel him to 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.110
 the other one and do not want to fall my 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.190
 hair in addition to being up to date beer 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.660
 in front shot if he had drunk two beers and 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.989
 with pomegranate so that they still give 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.590
 more volume I made small 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.709
 research everything on the internet and the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.270
 technique is back more if you know 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.950
 lower his head back he's from himself 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.350
 to dry the hair with the hair dryer 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.950
 to brush or wash them 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.050
 returned like that and 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.660
 it's like that and gp7 and neither when my 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.910
 hair was dry summer but it lasts 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.040
 really not that long it lasts a 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.169
 half an hour not even so I found that 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.030
 would be a little nothing and a jousting after 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.060
 have used on this point I am told 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.310
 if I wear them directly 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.240
 wet with this shampoo that gives 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.280
 volume at the base 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.830
 maybe when he dries he'll get me 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.479
 volume and that's what happened and 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.389
 it was too happy a year I always 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.010
 that and I can reuse this stuff like 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.820
 if he makes your father my hair so much 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.880
 too bad I have to finish 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.450
 but I use that with a turnaround 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.720
 back of the head and it works that 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.040
 market 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.630
 maybe a little less but serge when 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.940
 even since it is for the same volume 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.350
 if I know that all the products where they 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.050
 say it's good day it does not work 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.340
 not finally does not work more or less what 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.900
 you know you do not use too much a 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.000
 shampoo the same field dots at each 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.870
 once you have it hair if not after 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.419
 down your hair gets used and after the 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.660
 shampoo does not effect a blow any more 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.960
 to alternate use it are not 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.479
 who's a killer you're crazy 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.030
 it makes hot or silky briand 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.800
 really even what in game as I go out 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.850
 shower 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.789
 I do not believe backwards like a 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.110
 book we tell my friend the ddt and ben 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.020
 it still gives a little volume a 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.080
 certain point of home at palm or shore with 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.419
 canaillous eggs found it weird but 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.070
 it does not kill you makes not only in 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.570
 even make very since there is no 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.430
 that densely denim areas commonplace point 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.990
 just to wash the hair in fact and 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.840
 as I have no problem for them 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.280
 Hair I have no problem or goat 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.930

 little so they say it's for better 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.550
 strengthen protect them and that's what he 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.960
 done if you want to go if you 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.990

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.229
 that they are without problems that are 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.350
 normal what to buy his wine he enters 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.220
 other awesome 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.840
 they wanted to make even more a 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.190
 even better than before they will be 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.560
 shiny be so-called soft objects like 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.520

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.180
 these two products if you are in the 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.420
 same case as me i want facts on thursday 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.490
 but these are my two 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.160
 shampoos a referral all the time 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.530
 and I recommend them to all those who 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.240
 want volume and who do not have too much 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.310
 the walkers and against that one 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.950
 you can always test how he 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.570
 was making fire is not too much 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.820
 cool time to time like my choices and 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.490
 my smooth hair I read curl with a 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.180
 train or key effect with this doing a 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:55.600
 doubled it's a philips who otherwise his 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.550
 length and his dog that was costing 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.250
 really or the next what side is going 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.890
 there cheap at all it cost less 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:06.400
 20 euros but they will go great 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.800
 the e-book takes a long time if we make them 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.810
 on hair that somehow we use 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.920

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.440
