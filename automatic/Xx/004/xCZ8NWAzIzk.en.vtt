00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
little Ross needs a little scrubbing we

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
little Ross needs a little scrubbing we
think<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.660> maybe<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.410> her<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> that's<00:00:28.830> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
think we can maybe get her a that's a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.179 
think we can maybe get her a that's a
little<00:00:29.160> rough<00:00:29.369> there<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.000> wheel<00:00:31.160> but<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
little rough there on that wheel but I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.209 
little rough there on that wheel but I
think<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.829> we've<00:00:34.829> got<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> little

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
cord here it's been cut off but I think

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.430
