00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
because Jeff is one of the first I think

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.520 
because Jeff is one of the first I think
like<00:05:26.849> four<00:05:27.229> commentators<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.259> I've<00:05:28.500> ever

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
like four commentators that I've ever

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.800 
like four commentators that I've ever
actually<00:05:29.069> subscribed<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.479> I<00:05:30.539> guess<00:05:30.690> you

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
actually subscribed to so I guess you

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.420 
actually subscribed to so I guess you
can<00:05:30.930> call<00:05:31.080> him<00:05:31.199> like<00:05:31.380> an<00:05:31.500> inspiration<00:05:32.159> I<00:05:32.250> don't

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
can call him like an inspiration I don't

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.709
