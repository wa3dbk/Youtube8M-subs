what<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.969> doesn't<00:01:00.270> matter<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:01.520> in

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
what you do it doesn't matter at all in

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
what you do it doesn't matter at all in
clash<00:01:02.850> where<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> guys<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.350> have

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
clash where you get the guys that have

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.880 
clash where you get the guys that have
no<00:01:04.680> thumbs<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.570> can't<00:01:06.570> put<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> kills<00:01:07.409> or

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
no thumbs and can't put up the kills or

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.190 
no thumbs and can't put up the kills or
match<00:01:08.100> kills

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
match kills

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.039 
match kills
so<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.310> why<00:01:11.789> I<00:01:11.820> play<00:01:12.149> this<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.810> it's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
so this is why I play this because it's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.620 
so this is why I play this because it's
just<00:01:13.560> based<00:01:13.829> off<00:01:14.039> myself<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.759> I<00:01:14.939> lose<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.479> my

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
just based off myself if I lose it's my

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
just based off myself if I lose it's my
fault<00:01:15.899> so<00:01:16.200> far<00:01:16.439> haven't<00:01:16.649> lost<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.399> I'm

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that's for my overall thoughts about the

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.680 
that's for my overall thoughts about the
game<00:02:18.450> as<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.959> shooter<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.859> enjoy<00:02:20.130> it

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
game as a shooter I really enjoy it

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.210 
game as a shooter I really enjoy it
there's<00:02:21.690> not<00:02:21.959> really<00:02:22.019> many<00:02:22.470> games<00:02:22.829> out<00:02:23.190> there

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
there's not really many games out there

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.129 
there's not really many games out there
like<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.900> way<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.079> move<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.540> get<00:02:28.019> in

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
like it the way you move and get in

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.129 
like it the way you move and get in
battles<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.739> pretty<00:02:29.100> different<00:02:30.139> pretty

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
battles it's pretty different pretty

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.009 
battles it's pretty different pretty
unique<00:02:31.940> that's<00:02:32.940> why<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.150> enjoy<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.510> too<00:02:33.780> um

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
unique that's why I enjoy it too um

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.680 
unique that's why I enjoy it too um
because<00:02:34.799> it's<00:02:34.859> something<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.569> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
because it's something I not like the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.800 
because it's something I not like the
norm

problem i can see with that is for a

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.430 
problem i can see with that is for a
competitive<00:03:11.770> aspect<00:03:12.490> if<00:03:12.730> they<00:03:12.850> try<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.440> bring

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
different stuff and not everyone will

have the same type of stuff but i don't

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.210 
have the same type of stuff but i don't
think<00:03:19.720> that's<00:03:19.930> their<00:03:20.200> plan<00:03:20.380> with<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:20.770> game<00:03:20.950> i

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
think that's their plan with this game i

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.310 
think that's their plan with this game i
think<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.060> is<00:03:22.240> supposed<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.660> be<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.810> game<00:03:23.050> that

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
think this is supposed to be a game that

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.430 
think this is supposed to be a game that
you<00:03:24.220> can<00:03:24.250> play<00:03:24.610> no<00:03:25.600> matter<00:03:25.750> how<00:03:26.020> old<00:03:26.050> it<00:03:26.320> is

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
you can play no matter how old it is

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.780 
you can play no matter how old it is
because<00:03:26.830> there's<00:03:27.010> always<00:03:27.190> going<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.460> have<00:03:27.490> new

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790
