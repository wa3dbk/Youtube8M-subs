00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
so as you could see he comes with the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.359 
so as you could see he comes with the
sword<00:00:15.020> by<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.080> way<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.529> actually<00:00:16.650> silver

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
sword by the way this is actually silver

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.099 
sword by the way this is actually silver
if<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.359> didn't<00:00:18.630> know<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
if you didn't know that what you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.070 
if you didn't know that what you
probably<00:00:19.470> did<00:00:20.750> um<00:00:21.750> he<00:00:22.199> comes<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.650> face<00:00:22.890> masks

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
probably did um he comes to face masks

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.810 
probably did um he comes to face masks
kind<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.650> other<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.369> actually

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
kind of like the other one this actually

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.710 
kind of like the other one this actually
feels<00:00:26.970> more<00:00:27.330> rubbery<00:00:28.730> but<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.300> sure<00:00:30.570> if

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
feels more rubbery but I'm not sure if

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.479 
feels more rubbery but I'm not sure if
that's<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.109> because<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> plastic<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that's just because of the plastic to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.630 
that's just because of the plastic to
use<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:33.230> hands<00:00:34.230> second<00:00:34.770> I'll<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.460> get

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
use like hands second I'll just go get

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.540 
use like hands second I'll just go get
another<00:00:35.850> mask<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> compare<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.829> these<00:00:38.219> are

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
another mask and compare it so these are

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
another mask and compare it so these are
all<00:00:39.030> these<00:00:39.390> face<00:00:39.660> masks<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.469> far<00:00:40.710> less<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
all these face masks so far less and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
all these face masks so far less and
less<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.760> come<00:00:41.940> off<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.210> knuckles<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.870> or

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
less they come off with knuckles one or

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
less they come off with knuckles one or
jet<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.460> oh<00:00:45.289> boy<00:00:46.289> less<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.980> whatever<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
jet one oh boy less but whatever and you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.400 
jet one oh boy less but whatever and you
can<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:51.059> sonic<00:00:51.600> Excalibur

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.510 
can see like the the sonic Excalibur
mask<00:00:53.120> it's<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.480> two<00:00:54.780> parts<00:00:55.520> unlike

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
mask it's actually two parts unlike

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.000 
mask it's actually two parts unlike
shadow<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.550> silver<00:00:59.780> but<00:01:00.780> silver<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.469> actually

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
shadow and silver but silver is actually

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.340 
shadow and silver but silver is actually

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
like you can kind of bend it it won't

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.880 
like you can kind of bend it it won't
break<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.920> half<00:01:05.510> at<00:01:06.510> least<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:07.260> yet<00:01:07.500> because

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
break in half at least not yet because

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.690 
break in half at least not yet because
Deborah<00:01:08.520> sucks<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.420> mean<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:11.520> first

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
time I got this figure I has reorder it

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
time I got this figure I has reorder it
because<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.970> freaking<00:01:15.330> leg<00:01:15.570> fell<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:16.049> before

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
yeah a piece of because everything they

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.620 
yeah a piece of because everything they
have<00:01:52.140> breaks<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.820> even<00:01:54.090> breaking<00:01:54.479> loose

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
have breaks this is even breaking loose

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050 
have breaks this is even breaking loose
to<00:01:54.750> tape<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.979> moving<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.579> I'll<00:01:56.850> probably

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to tape one but moving on I'll probably

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.459 
to tape one but moving on I'll probably
do<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> video<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> white<00:01:57.960> jazz<00:01:58.259> were

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
do the video on the white jazz were

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.899 
do the video on the white jazz were
sucking<00:01:58.860> light<00:01:59.600> shadow<00:02:00.740> more<00:02:01.740> sturdy<00:02:02.070> it's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
sucking light shadow more sturdy it's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
sucking light shadow more sturdy it's
more<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.610> one<00:02:05.610> side<00:02:06.360> blade<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.320> Sonic

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
more of like a one side blade as Sonic

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.660 
more of like a one side blade as Sonic
is<00:02:09.110> two<00:02:10.110> side<00:02:10.500> blade<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.099> guess<00:02:11.310> what<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.550> was

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
is two side blade I guess what I was

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.270 
is two side blade I guess what I was
called

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
called

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.760 
called
but<00:02:12.640> silver<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.150> shorter<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:13.930> more<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.740> a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
but silver is shorter it's more like a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.970 
but silver is shorter it's more like a
dagger<00:02:15.460> thing<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.530> has<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.800> some

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
dagger thing and it has like some

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.880 
dagger thing and it has like some
ancient<00:02:18.400> night<00:02:18.940> writing<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:20.410> was<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.650> one

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
ancient night writing it was this one

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.400 
ancient night writing it was this one
this<00:02:21.790> one<00:02:22.060> actually<00:02:22.270> in<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> real<00:02:22.870> game<00:02:22.900> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
this one actually in the real game it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.410 
this one actually in the real game it
has<00:02:23.680> something<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.490> top<00:02:24.700> but<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> guess<00:02:25.300> it

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
has something on the top but I guess it

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.910 
has something on the top but I guess it
