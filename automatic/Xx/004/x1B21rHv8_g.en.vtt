00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.820
 after 10 years the old one finally replaces you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.380
 the q7 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.540
 with new model that is currently 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.940
 no longer a direct family of the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.029
 volkswagen touareg and the portia cores 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 no this car is built according to the mlb 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.510
 principle 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.710
 and lb yes for the front wheels to drivers 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.230
 we know in the volkswagen group 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 of course all the SME building principle for that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.140
 the big cars with the engine in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.989
 lengthwise they have within the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.219
 volkswagen groups and mel b conceived 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.899
 this is the first car but the is coming 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.690
 immediately an audi a4 a porsche 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.230
 panamera and go on with foothold 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.230
 for the q7 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.500
 thanks to that new construction platform, the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.399
 car nearly 300 kilos lighter 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.960
 it is of course still none 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.680
 lightweight it is warm two tons we 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.350
 talking about but good thanks to all sorts 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.590
 programs in air suspension system with 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.970
 to keep that weight under control 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.670
 and the good thing is if you go around the corner 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.200
 this car is equipped with a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.430
 four - wheel steering e-mail the rear wheels 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.229
 also participate 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.570
 they mean at low speeds 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.670
 wheels against steering so the rear 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.950
 seems to be moving a bit aside and what 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.890
 can turn tighter 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.330
 this hairpin syrup is pretty easy 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.590
 and go up the speed then she sent 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.420
 right the same way so the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.470
 front wheels 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.890
 giving the car a bit more rest 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890
 coming 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.909
 under the hood you see trusted 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.540
 engines come back so we have a diesel and 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.759
 there is a gasoline 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.140
 in the beginning and later thereafter 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.330
 a little lighter 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.640
 which will be at the beginning and next year too 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.470
 a plug-in hybrid 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.280
 we are on the road with the gasoline engine 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.310
 is 333 hp strong v6 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.140
 know him well in the previous version 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.569
 is a bit sharpened and is also one 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.590
 become much more economical and therefore linked 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.450
 to the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.069
 the classic afterwards 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.959
 that works perfectly 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.030
 they do absolutely no double coupling 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.670
 Techniques This car is tough for 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.650
 they say repentance that is head inverter 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.239
 yet most ideal for such a car or smoothly 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.069
 to set in motion 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.810
 certainly also with the thought that there is one 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.950
 it must be possible to pull a big cart 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.950
 so that works great 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.150
 so in terms of hardware we do it all nicely 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.160
 youtube keep track of each other 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.870
 driving car gives an extra boost 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.430
 given is the electronics again 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.960
 completely up to date 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.250
 so lane and sister is active 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.600
 so brush check 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.270
 virtually it's already a bit myself 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.440
 free in the car it was that attacked 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.030
 board can charge your phone wirelessly 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.680
 systems are of course everywhere 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.330
 have seen before but yes they are coming 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.790
 not this car already together 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.790
 and ready for the next step 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.440
 as the tracking can be used to 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.900
 we use this q7 if we all the way to own 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.220
 provide insight to taste 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.140
 choice of all kinds 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.500
 covering materials this is provided 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.500
 from 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.190
 beautiful weather nicely finished 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.620
 dashboard 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.530
 everything you see and touch it feels 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.000
 well it is firmly put together and make 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.010
 neat 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.410
 all in all the me is seven chapters 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.750
 dire finer automa yes limits 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.880
 moved that could not be better 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.690
 yes, wait till you are later 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.690
 comes with a suv
