00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hi, how are you? I'm marsÃ© de tus 

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.550
 fornells this time I want 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.730
 teach them how to do a very French 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.059
 simple is the best way for who 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.580
 have a bad pulse as I have it, I say 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.699
 just the good experience many times 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.460
 gives you this practice in some aspects 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.180
 and in others not so much this is a method 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.520
 very easy this either for French like 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 unha natural or french with justice 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.600
 in this case, mine are good 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.500
 acrylic was a little blue for the 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.630
 previous video that I made but good that 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.090
 that does not affect initial something that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.950
 I want to teach this this because I 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.629
 I made for a family event that I had 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.100
 yesterday this Saturday and well the truth is 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.210
 very easy to do I will try to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.219
 delineate as much as possible what 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.219
 can the smile line 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.910
 of my French 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.700
 the touch is very clear because good 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.700
 tone of my dress 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.110
 and you can use it with good 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 white and as you will see there is here 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.190
 in this part 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.670
 I left so the whole line I'm not going to 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.640
 wait for it to dry out a lot because 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.509
 then it can be difficult for me a little and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.700
 to delineate what we are going to do is 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.240
 can use a tip with a swab 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 as they say in your country soak it well 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.460
 in acetone and caring not Hindu flood 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.460
 here I already 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.979
 I'm going to pass the youtube 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.979
 and line 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.110
 me here yes yes 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.970
 if the nail collides as good as the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.970
 same with the same type 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.440
 they help each other a little 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.560
 to remove those roughness 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.910
 and it becomes a weight of the enamel with 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.910
 very careful 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.319
 they go back to delineate 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:51.670
 and it's very easy and for the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.670
 Black outlined can use brush 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.980
 well of these fines with acrylic paint 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.980
 or if this one can also use 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.750
 neil al pen de sally hansen in color 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.750
 that you choose 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.110
 what I used in my case was my 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.110
 graphic style black eyeliner 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:30.170
 and they can start from the end 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.560
 to the center 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.160
 of extreme 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.760
 to the center 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.760
 and not 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.480
 and once I know that they can apply their 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.480
 top coat as in this case I used 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.480
 encapsulated 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.400
 and the truth remains very well 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.490
 so you can do a French no 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.300
 it matters if it's with white 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.300
 with blue 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.900
 pink 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.390
 and they add a touch a line what 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.750
 you like it is something very simple if 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.220
 they do not have a lyut swab and for the hand 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.870
 They can use a little bit of 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.840
 cotton has already become entangled here in 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.560
 scissors has a tweezers or 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.020
 in any case in these sticks this one 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.960
 coffee whisks they find in 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.910
 any coffee shop can a stick 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.710
 can use anything to 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.560
 delineate and the French will be left 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.080
 perfect they do not need to have a super 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.650
 pulse and the truth is a tip that is 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.919
 paint fast is outlined and they are ready 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.449
 I hope you liked it hath pleased them 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.370
 the tip 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.559
 and this I hope your visit to the page of 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.710
 tul furnish that have very nice afternoon 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.710
