and I will let you know the results so
just<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.690> get<00:02:30.810> my<00:02:30.930> final<00:02:31.200> thoughts<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
just to get my final thoughts of the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.520 
just to get my final thoughts of the
that<00:02:33.780> heat<00:02:34.470> bonnet<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.160> used<00:02:36.380> again<00:02:37.380> it

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that heat bonnet that I used again it

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.800 
that heat bonnet that I used again it
was<00:02:37.830> very<00:02:38.040> hot<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.550> will<00:02:38.730> have<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.600> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
was very hot I will have to think of a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.990 
was very hot I will have to think of a
new<00:02:40.050> way<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.260> use<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.340> see<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.820> point

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
new way to use it but I do see the point

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.210 
new way to use it but I do see the point
I<00:02:42.209> do<00:02:42.300> see<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> point<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.110> don't<00:02:43.380> feel<00:02:43.590> anything

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
I do see the point I don't feel anything

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.580 
I do see the point I don't feel anything
incredibly<00:02:45.209> different<00:02:45.450> but<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.140> will<00:02:46.410> continue

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
incredibly different but I will continue

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.710 
incredibly different but I will continue
to<00:02:46.830> use<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.880> guess<00:02:48.180> gradually

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
to use it and you know I guess gradually

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.020 
to use it and you know I guess gradually
throughout<00:02:49.020> time<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:50.430> will<00:02:50.580> allow<00:02:50.790> your

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
throughout time it will allow your

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.820 
throughout time it will allow your
conditioner<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:52.080> set<00:02:52.290> into<00:02:52.470> your<00:02:52.560> hair

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
conditioner to really set into your hair

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.330 
conditioner to really set into your hair
and<00:02:52.980> I'll<00:02:53.070> see<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> difference<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:54.590> till<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:55.620> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
and I'll see a difference but till now I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.640 
and I'll see a difference but till now I
don't<00:02:56.550> know<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.880> would<00:02:57.150> recommend<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.989> just

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
don't know if I would recommend it just

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.280 
don't know if I would recommend it just
because<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.670> felt<00:02:59.850> uncomfortable<00:03:00.110> thought<00:03:01.110> um

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
because it felt uncomfortable thought um

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.170 
because it felt uncomfortable thought um
it<00:03:01.890> was<00:03:02.010> only<00:03:02.220> eleven<00:03:02.489> dollars<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.970> get<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
it was only eleven dollars you get it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.090 
it was only eleven dollars you get it
from<00:03:03.270> Sally's<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:03.959> actually<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.860> was<00:03:04.980> not

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
from Sally's so actually it was not

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.850 
from Sally's so actually it was not
eleven<00:03:05.400> dollars<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.760> was<00:03:06.470> $9.99<00:03:07.470> because<00:03:07.830> I

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
eleven dollars it was $9.99 because I

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.000 
eleven dollars it was $9.99 because I
had<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.370> card<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:10.140> know<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.290> figured<00:03:10.830> I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
had the card so you know I figured I

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.290 
had the card so you know I figured I
might<00:03:11.190> as<00:03:11.250> well<00:03:11.340> keep<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.700> since<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.000> was<00:03:12.090> cheap

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
might as well keep it since it was cheap

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.650 
might as well keep it since it was cheap
thanks<00:03:13.260> for<00:03:13.350> watching
