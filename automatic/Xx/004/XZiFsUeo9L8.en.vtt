00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 this is the new boot from forced for 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:15.020
 motocross and enduro comes from an idea 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.789
 over fifteen years ago to be able to 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.210
 offer a product to the market 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.920
 completely innovative than he says 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.349
 but the traditional boots on the market 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.369
 this boot practically presents 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.059
 the very different characteristics the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.910
 before which is lightness is one 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.640
 boot that lighter by about one 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.180
 kilo and a half compared to boots 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.410
 competitors of the same level and this 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.379
 it means that for the pilot 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.629
 there is an energy saving during the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.000
 competition for which it can have more 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.920
 energies towards the end of the race from 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.049
 to be able to spend on his own 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.140
 animals is a boot that does not require 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.500
 practically a maintenance service 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.659
 at the factory because it's all completely 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.430
 we are not removable and returns bill e 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.490
 the levers without moretti can be 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.939
 remove and put in a second the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 global can be removed and replaced 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.009
 with 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.860
 legging let's say relative size 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.509
 let's say to his calf why he is there 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.780
 a problem especially in the states 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.180
 united japan where the pilots have a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.270
 bigger calf than those 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.080
 Europeans and creativity there 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.899
 characteristic of having the fund 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.820
 above indicated the upper for which 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.280
 guarantees maximum waterproofing the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.170
 point of union of the plastic on the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.869
 upper is about 100 percent of the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.239
 surface while on the other boots 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.989
 it is practically only in the area 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.150
 of the seam and and this allows 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.730
 we say to give support on 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.850
 ankles that there is no one else 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.170
 boot that can do so much 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:30.100
 in fact if we take the demon boot 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.850
 blade which was about 50 hours of 50 hours of 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.950
 race 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.340
 we see that it is still completely 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.370
 we say with its initial form there is 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.510
 was naturally a technical development 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.160
 and today we are in the fifth generation e 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.859
 the center boot appears 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.209
 perfectly let's say online for 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.829
 what are the needs of the pilot 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.100
 it is the only boot that has practically 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:01.130
 also an insert on the ankle 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:06.400
 removable it can be replaced to be able to 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:11.830
 let's close the bike frame 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.960
 better than with the other boot is 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.940
 adjustable on all of them 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:24.050
 lele and then we also say the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:28.150
 possibility to change 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.350
 the footboard insert e 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.980
 at the same time also the 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.420
 steel sample is the only boot 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:42.700
 which allows you to do this 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:49.040
 the upper is in technical material e 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:52.910
 synthetic brazil with one inside 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.130
 sponge material for comfort and for 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.620
 practically absorb sweat 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.530
 plus there are these channels to do 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.980
 exit the hot air from inside the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.980
 boot
