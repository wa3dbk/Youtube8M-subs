then<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:49.140> go<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> top<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.579> hand<00:01:51.450> plumb

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
then we go up to the top and hand plumb

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.139 
then we go up to the top and hand plumb
it<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.930> again<00:01:52.860> where<00:01:53.070> our<00:01:53.189> equal<00:01:53.640> distance<00:01:53.970> off

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it up again where our equal distance off

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.700 
it up again where our equal distance off
the<00:01:54.180> siding<00:01:54.659> they're<00:01:54.840> siding<00:01:55.049> which<00:01:55.290> was

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the siding they're siding which was

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.289 
the siding they're siding which was
plumb<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> begin<00:01:56.520> with<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.969> that's<00:01:57.119> all

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
plumb here to begin with and that's all

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.730 
plumb here to begin with and that's all
I<00:01:57.450> made<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> easy<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:59.420> then<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:01.020> also<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
I made it easy and then we also have to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.679 
I made it easy and then we also have to
tweak<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.460> store<00:02:02.729> frame<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.210> bit<00:02:03.509> in

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
tweak to the store frame a little bit in

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.219 
tweak to the store frame a little bit in
order<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.790> get<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.820> door<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> fit

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
order to get the get the door to fit

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.570 
order to get the get the door to fit
right<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> seal<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.369> right<00:02:08.849> now<00:02:09.030> we're

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
right on the seal so right now we're

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.490 
right on the seal so right now we're
a<00:02:09.640> little<00:02:10.240> bit<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.540> on<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.840> side<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> little

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
a little bit in on that side a little

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.850 
a little bit in on that side a little
bit<00:02:11.620> out<00:02:11.770> on<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.100> side<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
bit out on this side and just to get the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.030 
bit out on this side and just to get the
that<00:02:15.460> even<00:02:15.880> seal<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> door<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.830> next

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
that even seal on the door so the next

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.000 
that even seal on the door so the next
step<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.460> is<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.990> check<00:02:20.770> where<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
step here is to is to check where the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.600 
step here is to is to check where the
where<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.620> hinges<00:02:23.980> are<00:02:24.130> whether<00:02:24.370> that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
where the the hinges are whether that

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.190 
where the the hinges are whether that
door<00:02:24.820> pulling<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.750> frame<00:02:25.990> where<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
door pulling on the frame where the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.650 
door pulling on the frame where the
hinges<00:02:26.590> are<00:02:26.740> we<00:02:27.520> have<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:27.880> suck<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.330> back<00:02:28.450> on

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
hinges are we have to suck it back on

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.030 
hinges are we have to suck it back on
the<00:02:28.720> top<00:02:28.930> hinge<00:02:29.140> we<00:02:29.320> might<00:02:29.440> have<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.710> push<00:02:29.890> it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the top hinge we might have to push it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.700 
the top hinge we might have to push it
up<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.280> bottom<00:02:30.580> hinge<00:02:30.760> just<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:32.530> get

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
up in the bottom hinge just to to get

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.950 
up in the bottom hinge just to to get
get<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.610> thing<00:02:33.940> all<00:02:34.090> lined<00:02:34.330> up<00:02:34.510> nice<00:02:34.930> and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
get the thing all lined up nice and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.050 
get the thing all lined up nice and
straight<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:36.250> door<00:02:36.430> frame<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.790> little<00:02:36.970> bit

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
straight this door frame is a little bit

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.370 
straight this door frame is a little bit
tougher<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.450> do<00:02:37.570> because<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:38.020> got<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> double

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
tougher to do because we got a double

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.140 
tougher to do because we got a double
door<00:02:38.680> here<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:38.920> little<00:02:39.280> sidelight<00:02:39.760> actually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
door here that little sidelight actually

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.820 
door here that little sidelight actually
opens<00:02:40.420> up<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.570> swings<00:02:40.870> open<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.260> Sun<00:02:41.440> hinges

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
opens up the swings open the Sun hinges

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.590 
opens up the swings open the Sun hinges
and<00:02:42.280> then<00:02:42.700> it's<00:02:42.880> put<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.120> top<00:02:43.300> on<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.480> bottom

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
and then it's put the top on the bottom

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.020 
and then it's put the top on the bottom
and<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.590> house<00:02:44.920> that's<00:02:45.220> we're<00:02:45.730> having<00:02:46.000> a

just perfect and this double door here

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.210 
just perfect and this double door here
so<00:03:07.570> we<00:03:07.870> got<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.080> hinges<00:03:08.200> be<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:08.800> each<00:03:08.980> hinge

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
so we got the hinges be on each hinge

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.680 
so we got the hinges be on each hinge
there<00:03:09.520> we<00:03:10.420> got<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.720> fitting<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.440> just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
there we got it fitting so that just

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.000 
there we got it fitting so that just
clears<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.840> weatherstrip<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.560> seals<00:03:14.800> real

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
clears that weatherstrip and seals real

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.540 
clears that weatherstrip and seals real
nice<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.290> next<00:03:17.440> step<00:03:17.680> we've<00:03:17.920> cut<00:03:18.430> our

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
nice so the next step we've cut our

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.030 
nice so the next step we've cut our
shims<00:03:18.820> off<00:03:19.030> we're<00:03:19.390> going<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.660> get<00:03:20.170> some<00:03:20.470> red

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
shims off we're going to get some red

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.979 
shims off we're going to get some red
tape<00:03:21.250> on<00:03:21.489> here<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.760> then<00:03:22.060> seal<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.630> over<00:03:22.900> to

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
tape on here and then seal this over to

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.770 
tape on here and then seal this over to
the<00:03:23.080> door<00:03:23.230> frame<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:24.670> get<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.820> outside

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
the door frame to get the outside

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.420 
the door frame to get the outside
favorite<00:03:26.500> barrier<00:03:26.739> sealed<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.160> there

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
favorite barrier sealed in there

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.130 
favorite barrier sealed in there
and<00:03:27.519> then<00:03:28.209> we're<00:03:28.840> going<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:28.989> put<00:03:29.170> our<00:03:29.400> our<00:03:30.400> our
