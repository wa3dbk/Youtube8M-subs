stuff it fits nice like I said there's a
ton<00:01:54.189> of<00:01:54.490> padding<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.180> don't<00:01:55.630> know<00:01:55.689> if<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.869> can

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
ton of padding I don't know if you can

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.810 
ton of padding I don't know if you can
see<00:01:56.640> how<00:01:57.750> thick<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.960> padding<00:01:59.290> is<00:01:59.470> but<00:01:59.820> about

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
see how thick the padding is but about

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.160 
see how thick the padding is but about
that<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.299> probably<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.750> probably<00:02:01.780> have

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
that so probably you probably have

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.800 
that so probably you probably have
almost<00:02:02.470> an<00:02:02.560> inch<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:02.920> padding<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.909> top<00:02:04.150> and
