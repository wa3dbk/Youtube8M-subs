what it's going to do is thicken this a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.999 
what it's going to do is thicken this a
little<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.409> put<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.680> over<00:01:43.799> your

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.230 
will be a little bit thicker you see
it's<00:02:10.039> doing<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.490> now<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:12.940> want<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> mine<00:02:14.209> a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
it's doing that now I want a mine a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.330 
it's doing that now I want a mine a
little<00:02:14.480> bit<00:02:14.570> thicker<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.830> getting<00:02:16.160> there

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
little bit thicker it's getting there

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.860 
little bit thicker it's getting there
but<00:02:16.490> I'm<00:02:16.610> one<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.850> mine<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.270> tiny<00:02:17.630> bit

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
but I'm one of mine just a tiny bit

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.750 
but I'm one of mine just a tiny bit
thicker<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.350> went<00:02:18.560> ahead<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.920> mixed

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
thicker so I went ahead and mixed

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.860 
thicker so I went ahead and mixed
another<00:02:24.250> teaspoon<00:02:25.250> maybe<00:02:25.880> two<00:02:26.270> teaspoons<00:02:26.720> of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
another teaspoon maybe two teaspoons of

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.750 
another teaspoon maybe two teaspoons of
cornstarch<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.770> just<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.100> tiny<00:02:28.250> bit<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.550> water

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
cornstarch and just a tiny bit of water

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.610 
cornstarch and just a tiny bit of water
this<00:02:29.030> time<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.720> I'm<00:02:30.020> just<00:02:30.080> going<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.380> slowly

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
this time and I'm just going to slowly

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.370 
this time and I'm just going to slowly
add<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> little<00:02:31.340> bit<00:02:31.520> at<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.730> time<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.380> that's

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
add a little bit at a time and that's

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.640 
add a little bit at a time and that's
helping<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:35.830> should<00:02:36.830> be<00:02:36.950> sloppy<00:02:37.489> not<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.660> come

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
helping it should be sloppy not to come

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.510 
helping it should be sloppy not to come
