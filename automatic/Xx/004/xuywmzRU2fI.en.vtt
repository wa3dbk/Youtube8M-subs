ridiculous item they like but I think
the<00:03:01.200> game<00:03:01.350> will<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:01.590> over<00:03:01.620> at<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.190> point<00:03:05.480> huge

the game will be over at that point huge

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.420 
the game will be over at that point huge
creep<00:03:06.720> wave<00:03:06.870> right<00:03:07.049> now<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.410> oh<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> didn't

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
mention of course but a huge pushing

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.670 
mention of course but a huge pushing
potential<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.790> Iraq<00:03:12.570> neo<00:03:12.810> perhaps<00:03:13.320> one<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
potential in Iraq neo perhaps one of the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.910 
potential in Iraq neo perhaps one of the
best<00:03:13.860> places<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.400> game<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:16.110> spiders<00:03:16.590> soak

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
best places in the game the spiders soak

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.560 
best places in the game the spiders soak
up<00:03:17.160> tower<00:03:18.120> hits<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.660> no<00:03:18.900> other<00:03:20.209> they<00:03:21.209> die

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
up tower hits like no other they die

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.280 
up tower hits like no other they die
very<00:03:21.600> quickly<00:03:22.140> too<00:03:24.590> because<00:03:25.590> if<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.799> notice

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
very quickly too because if we notice

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.150 
very quickly too because if we notice
they<00:03:28.290> die<00:03:28.440> very<00:03:28.470> quickly<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.690> magic<00:03:30.690> but<00:03:31.590> um

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
they die very quickly to magic but um

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.660 
they die very quickly to magic but um
just<00:03:33.120> due<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.390> their<00:03:33.600> small<00:03:33.870> health<00:03:34.110> pool<00:03:34.670> but

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
just due to their small health pool but

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.710 
just due to their small health pool but
they<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:35.940> really<00:03:36.209> soak<00:03:36.540> up<00:03:36.570> tower<00:03:36.930> heads<00:03:38.720> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
they can really soak up tower heads and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.070 
they can really soak up tower heads and
I<00:03:39.750> think

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
I think

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.540 
I think
spherix<00:03:40.620> can<00:03:40.740> we<00:03:40.800> go<00:03:40.920> down<00:03:41.070> again<00:03:41.220> we'll<00:03:41.520> see

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
spherix can we go down again we'll see

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.850 
spherix can we go down again we'll see
yeah<00:03:42.150> he<00:03:42.420> gets<00:03:42.840> sniped<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.440> ends<00:03:43.620> up<00:03:43.710> going

this game this is just absolute
domination<00:04:38.940> I<00:04:39.150> thought<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.420> would<00:04:39.510> be

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
domination I thought it would be

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.120 
domination I thought it would be
interesting<00:04:39.600> i'm<00:04:40.110> i<00:04:40.320> had<00:04:40.590> heard<00:04:40.740> there<00:04:41.010> are<00:04:41.040> a

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
interesting i'm i had heard there are a

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.040 
interesting i'm i had heard there are a
couple<00:04:41.250> roshan<00:04:41.730> kills<00:04:41.970> like<00:04:42.420> very<00:04:42.780> quickly

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
couple roshan kills like very quickly

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.600 
couple roshan kills like very quickly
but<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.710> turns<00:04:43.950> out<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.220> be<00:04:44.250> not<00:04:44.550> so

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
but it turns out to be not so

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.240 
but it turns out to be not so
interesting<00:04:46.130> but<00:04:48.530> there<00:04:49.530> goes<00:04:49.710> another<00:04:49.830> kill

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250

I<00:04:50.280> think<00:04:50.580> this<00:04:50.669> eventual<00:04:51.570> spirit<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:51.900> bound<00:04:52.110> to

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
I think this eventual spirit is bound to

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.350 
I think this eventual spirit is bound to
go<00:04:52.410> down<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.919> they're<00:04:53.460> going<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.610> mop<00:04:53.940> up<00:04:53.970> some

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360

go down and they're going to mop up some
heroes<00:04:54.660> down<00:04:54.870> here<00:04:57.110> this<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.230> just<00:04:58.350> ridiculous

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
heroes down here this is just ridiculous

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.610 
heroes down here this is just ridiculous

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
so this shows that you know quality dota

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.350 
so this shows that you know quality dota

so<00:05:34.080> um<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:35.030> guess<00:05:36.030> that's<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.510> only<00:05:36.570> way<00:05:36.900> I

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
so um I guess that's the only way I

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.590 
so um I guess that's the only way I
could<00:05:37.050> really<00:05:37.790> clearly<00:05:38.790> i'm<00:05:39.000> just<00:05:39.270> trying<00:05:39.479> to

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
could really clearly i'm just trying to

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.110 
could really clearly i'm just trying to
rationalize<00:05:40.020> why<00:05:40.830> I'm<00:05:41.220> commentating<00:05:41.970> this

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
rationalize why I'm commentating this

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.090 
rationalize why I'm commentating this
game<00:05:42.330> um<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:43.020> didn't<00:05:43.440> know<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.680> result<00:05:43.979> in

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
game um I didn't know the result in

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.250 
game um I didn't know the result in
advance<00:05:44.370> but<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.640> really<00:05:45.300> didn't<00:05:45.540> know<00:05:45.630> that<00:05:45.660> so

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
advance but I really didn't know that so

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.909 
advance but I really didn't know that so
would<00:05:46.790> put<00:05:47.790> up<00:05:47.880> such<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.060> pathetic<00:05:48.300> attempt<00:05:49.110> to

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
would put up such a pathetic attempt to

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.190 
would put up such a pathetic attempt to
slow<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:50.370> advances<00:05:50.910> of<00:05:50.940> Nirvana<00:05:51.479> but

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
anyway um it is also fun sometimes to

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.580 
anyway um it is also fun sometimes to
just<00:05:57.220> see<00:05:57.550> a<00:05:57.580> massacre<00:05:58.150> like<00:05:58.330> that<00:05:58.570> and<00:05:58.840> you
