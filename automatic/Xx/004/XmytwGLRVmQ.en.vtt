00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
like rectangular beads and it's not that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.130 
like rectangular beads and it's not that
we<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.760> options<00:00:53.750> not<00:00:54.750> quite<00:00:55.110> sure

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
we don't have options not quite sure

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.369 
we don't have options not quite sure
which<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.890> grab<00:00:56.870> excess<00:00:57.870> disorder<00:00:58.350> i

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
which one to grab excess disorder i

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.130 
which one to grab excess disorder i
think<00:00:58.649> i'm<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
think i'm going to go with these this is

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
think i'm going to go with these this is
it<00:01:01.320> they're<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.820> hollow<00:01:03.260> tubes<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> i<00:01:05.700> get

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it they're like hollow tubes so i get

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.850 
it they're like hollow tubes so i get
three<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> them<00:01:06.840> hopefully<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.680> that'd

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
three of them hopefully I think that'd

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.789 
three of them hopefully I think that'd
be<00:01:07.979> enough<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:08.580> small<00:01:08.820> hands<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
be enough for my small hands so the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.730 
be enough for my small hands so the
total<00:01:11.040> came<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:13.820> shitty<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.560> little

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
total came out shitty but the little

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.390 
total came out shitty but the little
beads<00:01:17.100> were<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.759> dollar<00:01:18.090> fifty<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:20.159> glass

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.020 
beads were a dollar fifty and the glass
beads<00:01:20.850> were<00:01:21.500> seed<00:01:22.500> beads<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> ducting<00:01:23.520> 299

it's<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.320> little<00:04:28.560> bit<00:04:28.680> too<00:04:28.800> difficult<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.430> I

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
it's a little bit too difficult and I

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.450 
it's a little bit too difficult and I
don't<00:04:30.270> know<00:04:30.360> if<00:04:30.480> I<00:04:30.570> want<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.870> be<00:04:31.220> zooming<00:04:32.220> in

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460

and out constantly in this DIY video

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.920 
and out constantly in this DIY video
because<00:04:34.620> it's<00:04:34.770> just<00:04:35.240> there's<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:36.450> too<00:04:36.690> much

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
because it's just there's just too much

that I really to be honest don't want to
record<00:04:42.150> in<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.600> DOI<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.800> I'm<00:04:44.130> looking<00:04:44.280> at

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
record in the DOI so I'm looking at

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.930 
record in the DOI so I'm looking at
Carly's<00:04:45.450> photo<00:04:45.900> again<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:47.010> looks<00:04:47.190> pretty

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
Carly's photo again and it looks pretty

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.210 
Carly's photo again and it looks pretty
simple<00:04:48.480> so<00:04:48.660> I'm<00:04:48.750> just<00:04:48.960> gonna<00:04:49.080> follow<00:04:49.590> that

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
simple so I'm just gonna follow that

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.730 
simple so I'm just gonna follow that
pattern<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:51.000> see<00:04:51.240> how<00:04:51.390> it<00:04:51.570> goes<00:04:51.840> if<00:04:52.200> not<00:04:52.470> I'll

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
pattern and see how it goes if not I'll

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.920 
pattern and see how it goes if not I'll
just<00:04:52.770> come<00:04:53.040> back<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.310> this<00:04:53.750> prototypes<00:04:54.750> are

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
just come back to this prototypes are

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.270 
just come back to this prototypes are
probably<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.470> worst<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:57.360> learn<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.600> lot<00:04:57.780> and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
probably the worst you learn a lot and

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
probably the worst you learn a lot and
you<00:04:59.280> figure<00:04:59.580> out<00:04:59.610> what<00:04:59.850> works<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.210> what

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
you figure out what works and what

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.880 
you figure out what works and what
doesn't<00:05:00.390> work<00:05:00.750> at<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.230> same<00:05:01.380> time<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:01.800> very

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
doesn't work at the same time it's very

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.120 
doesn't work at the same time it's very
time-consuming<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:04.620> can<00:05:04.740> even<00:05:04.860> use<00:05:05.070> it

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
time-consuming and you can even use it

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.940 
time-consuming and you can even use it
as<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.580> video<00:05:05.790> just<00:05:06.210> because<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.810> know<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:07.200> lot

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
as a video just because you know a lot

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.220 
as a video just because you know a lot
of<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.130> times<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:08.730> mess<00:05:09.120> up<00:05:09.150> as<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.840> monkey

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
of the times you mess up as a monkey

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.130 
of the times you mess up as a monkey
behind<00:05:10.560> me<00:05:10.710> I'm<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:11.760> frustrated<00:05:12.000> because<00:05:12.780> I've

behind me I'm so frustrated because I've
been<00:05:13.350> working<00:05:13.740> on<00:05:13.890> this<00:05:14.040> hand<00:05:14.340> beaded<00:05:14.640> glove

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
to do a couple of prototypes and I

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.950 
to do a couple of prototypes and I
messed<00:05:23.520> up<00:05:23.700> twice<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.270> first<00:05:24.450> one<00:05:24.570> I<00:05:24.600> did<00:05:24.810> my

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
hand ended up looking like I don't know

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.270 
hand ended up looking like I don't know
weird<00:05:27.840> like<00:05:28.020> claw<00:05:28.320> because<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.740> was<00:05:28.830> too<00:05:29.040> tight

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
weird like claw because it was too tight

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.220 
weird like claw because it was too tight

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.260 
and then I just kept trying to play with
the<00:05:31.320> patterns<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.730> beads<00:05:32.940> were<00:05:33.030> too

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
the patterns and the beads were too

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.760 
the patterns and the beads were too
close<00:05:33.419> and<00:05:33.720> things<00:05:33.930> like<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.410> it<00:05:34.530> took<00:05:34.680> a

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.220 
it and it is around 10am right now I
messed<00:05:59.190> up<00:05:59.340> quite<00:05:59.640> a<00:05:59.669> few<00:05:59.970> times<00:06:00.240> from<00:06:00.810> seven

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
messed up quite a few times from seven

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.550 
messed up quite a few times from seven
til<00:06:01.380> 10<00:06:01.620> so<00:06:02.150> if<00:06:03.150> you<00:06:03.570> were<00:06:04.200> to<00:06:04.260> do<00:06:04.530> this

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
til 10 so if you were to do this

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.470 
til 10 so if you were to do this
straight<00:06:04.950> from<00:06:05.130> my<00:06:05.160> video<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.610> you<00:06:06.180> got<00:06:06.450> a

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
straight from my video and you got a

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.350 
straight from my video and you got a
tutorial<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:07.380> think<00:06:08.070> it<00:06:08.250> might<00:06:08.550> take<00:06:08.850> you<00:06:09.030> maybe

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
tutorial I think it might take you maybe

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.040 
tutorial I think it might take you maybe
two<00:06:10.230> hours<00:06:10.260> just<00:06:11.070> to<00:06:11.190> get<00:06:11.310> one<00:06:11.550> glove<00:06:11.850> done<00:06:12.150> I

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
two hours just to get one glove done I

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.530 
two hours just to get one glove done I
think<00:06:14.039> it's<00:06:14.160> kind<00:06:14.310> of<00:06:14.430> cool<00:06:14.610> it's<00:06:14.970> a

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540
