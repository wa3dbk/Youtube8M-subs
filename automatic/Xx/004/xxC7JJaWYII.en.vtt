00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.690
 and the little wolves it's a little 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.580
 moment would sweep pandaria have 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.320
 started after a good week of dreams 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.370
 and lyng so when we decided to go 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.500
 to walk a little bit there without 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.780
 necessarily be too prepared a bottle 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.279
 jester had we had nothing and especially 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.300
 there was still a good shot of 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.890
 nasri who had not really had 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.169
 the opportunity to farm and heroics 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.130
 before the reds we are a little party 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.380
 is a bit green and hurry 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.939
 build it's pretty fun to start 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.470
 the raids having in denying the stop 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.909
 short by being a little not really 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.919
 prepared for these it's a little bit always 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.119
 the little pleasure in the beginning of the extension 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.859
 and it's really not something that 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.070
 lasts so 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:38.660
 so short this video will be a guide without 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.920
 to be a guide that is to say that I will 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.469
 provide some clarification at the level 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.929
 some mechanics will work 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.059
 more as a complement a guide you 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.000
 can find a guide soon 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.739
 written on our site for this beautiful this 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.429
 is at that moment this video will serve 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.780
 really as a complement so the 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.460
 things that are important to note that 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.390
 not necessarily have it all 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.010
 because it's true that it's 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.089
 positions who are the bosses who are 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.280
 new and the mechanics that are 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.080
 news so currently the content 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.040
 is very very rich in little tricks 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.480
 small techniques that can be found 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.370
 for them to improve the game so already 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.240
 we have no hunting dog because 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.100
 means we do not have the dog 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.810
 does the chains that apparently is 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.980
 reputed to be the most boring so 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.380
 when we saw we did not have it we were 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.670
 more or less happy the first thing 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.990
 who really surprised us 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.150
 it's the cobalt traps that you 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.280
 send two for example it takes three 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.660
 now it takes a lot of space and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.640
 it's very very boring and something 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.890
 did not understand precisely at the beginning it's 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.270
 that it stays all the fight these traps 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.620
 stay all the fight if someone has to 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.820
 no feet in it and it's really 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.170
 a horror 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.010
 we arrived at a moment we said to ourselves 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.090
 good it takes someone who clips 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.979
 so the clean people are with 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.330
 hands of freedom at times really 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.570
 not important and we took very dear 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.920
 until we actually realized 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.380
 and we did not necessarily have him at 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.610
 level of strategies other than when the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.860
 cobalt dog is in the process of super sorting 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.360
 proud it's not just the damage of 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.350
 the overhead that will do who will 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.630
 reduced by 20% 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.580
 it's also all the damage of two 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.229
 figures proof that cobalt it is in 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.310
 frost which means in the end of 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.630
 big orders gets petrified you 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.770
 can walk in a trap you go 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.620
 take a year to percent of the guys in me 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.790
 if you're not going to take anything bad 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.739
 you do not have tomorrow freedom where 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.870
 you are not going to wrinkle your hiller 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.360
 duty is worth 10 so weighs in the end this 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.500
 we decided it was volca that was 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.550
 android and who can be confused 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.080
 automatically changing shape 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.850
 was going to walk in all the traps 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.770
 once the cobalt guardian was going 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.880
 start very proud aspect obviously at 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.680
 fight I realized 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.269
 that as a man time since any 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.000
 way I'm doing nothing that I'm in mode 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.290
 full defensive are clairvoyants this 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.540
 Battle healer glyph etc. 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.400
 I'm pure I'm there I try to 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.660
 city ​​a little I support and I resist 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.640
 since but ranges are all 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.110
 way not I told myself after a 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.100
 moment I have two hands of freedom 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.080
 since I have pure talent 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.670
 I can walk in the traps 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.930
 so that's what I did over the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.340
 fight and it went really well 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.450
 like that I could have done it again 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.530
 better manage on the video that was going 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.630
 move on I'm really going to a lot of 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.010
 traps but I really really 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.920
 scared at the level of my life because that's 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.280
 very tense 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.830
 and because of the stuff I had 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.300
 seeing that saffron shit 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.830
 so there are some passages where I 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.780
 slam my freedom I can snap a 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.160
 other live after because of the talent I 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.680
 so go into the traps I do them 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.500
 to fart even when the cobalt is not in 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.450
 to petrify it's feasible or 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.330
 if you can really really 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.590
 do if you have a big cooldown you 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.610
 can snap a hand of freedom 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.230
 you French in the traps you them 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.580
 activate and release you the passage for 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.260
 people we have a dead one moment during 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.849
 the fight because there are too many traps 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.900
 and that and that he can not get out I 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.319
 see that that's true it should not 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.060
 delay and the chains work from the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.489
 same way that the dog chains of 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.350
 hunt do nature damage he me 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.610
 seems and there are a lot of groups that 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.049
 complain on the forums outside one 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.150
 can not manage the strings how 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.480
 we do and ultimately the solution so 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.620
 lyall dead because of 3.3 trap you 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.780
 the better we see so there are people who 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.980
 made it but the celestins that is 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.700
 just the two people who have 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.440
 the chains once active jasper 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.549
 who petrifies and reduces 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.320
 so all the damage of nature he me 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.549
 seems mostly the world 90% these two 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.170
 people can deviate 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.579
 will take almost no damage you 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.470
 go fart cheyney woods 15 seconds and 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.690
 so you'll take that in my opinion 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.600
 one of the elements of the fight that is 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.130
 really ignored 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.289
 that's it really while the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.090
 cobalt the dog cobalt and petrified 136 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.350
 like that was going to make everyone fart 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.640
 traps there he was not even active 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.950
 I took half of my life with a 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.090
 cooldown is no problem at the 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.100
 farting the traps while the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.820
 cobalt and active makes the chains fart 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.140
 while jasper and active 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.940
 for others it's different because 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.870
 first that the other currencies 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.390
 you can not avoid them 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.890
 firstly and the second the formerly r 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.940
 fights is completely rotten 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.290
 when you have jade you are 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.700
 happy where he's just going to do a house 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.860
 from time to time I'm not even sure 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.560
 we notice it at the level of damage 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.780
 it provokes it's here it's not 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.470
 big thing 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.460
 it's really things that are 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.200
 important when you start 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.370
 a fight and that wheeler when you 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.290
 see ours do not rapping 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.670
 manas because that's the kind of thing 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.410
 who saves the manade he is at 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.810
 maximum that makes everything much more 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.800
 fluid and and that makes it possible to fall 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.840
 bosses when you do not have to 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.180
 the level for that it's a fight that 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.500
 is it's not hyper complicated at the level 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.760
 times that has some pressure 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.320
 since we have to make tons under the 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.890
 here and there and it's a bit 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.500
 complex but otherwise it's 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.300
 perfectly manageable and and in full 463 to 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.410
 my opinion and it's not something that 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.080
 should be problematic but think 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.940
 always to clean in quotation marks the 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.980
 boss skills when it's them who 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.600
 are you petrified thinking 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.390
 really really that's a point 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.460
 which is often forgotten and which counts 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.260
 really a bit like winning 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.650
 gold by spending his charm 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.650
 yeah
