00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.260 
has a 180 degree viewing angle you can
view<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.000> icons<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.660> clearly<00:00:32.090> you<00:00:33.090> can

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
thing I notice is this like the speakers

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:07.780 
thing I notice is this like the speakers
like<00:00:58.140> Ray<00:00:58.289> Bob

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.240 

so<00:01:08.960> again<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> IPS<00:01:10.680> screen<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
so we need to make it to a benchmark

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.610 
so we need to make it to a benchmark

and just go to the vault tablet real

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.100 
and just go to the vault tablet real
quick<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.930> f<00:02:15.080> 9<00:02:15.320> X<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:17.600> model<00:02:17.870> number

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
quick so this is f 9 X the model number

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.160 
quick so this is f 9 X the model number
and<00:02:18.140> we're<00:02:18.530> four<00:02:18.680> point<00:02:18.890> one<00:02:18.920> point<00:02:19.010> one

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
and we're four point one point one

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.630 
and we're four point one point one
there's<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:23.110> kernel<00:02:24.110> version<00:02:24.530> January<00:02:25.130> 25th

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
there's the kernel version January 25th

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.760 
there's the kernel version January 25th
so<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.090> was<00:02:26.180> about<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.360> just<00:02:27.290> about<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.710> week

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
so that was about a just about a week

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:37.900 
so that was about a just about a week
ago<00:02:28.240> this<00:02:29.240> is<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.390> really<00:02:29.630> new<00:02:29.750> unit<00:02:36.820> check<00:02:37.820> out

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
ago this is a really new unit check out

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.820 
ago this is a really new unit check out
the<00:02:38.000> storage<00:02:39.730> okay<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:40.970> has<00:02:41.060> two<00:02:41.270> gigabytes

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
the storage okay so it has two gigabytes

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.250 
the storage okay so it has two gigabytes
ddr3<00:02:43.390> some<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.510> apps<00:02:44.690> take<00:02:44.960> up<00:02:45.080> some<00:02:45.230> of

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
ddr3 some of the apps take up some of

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.610 
ddr3 some of the apps take up some of
that<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.710> has<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:46.100> about<00:02:46.450> 1.8<00:02:47.450> three<00:02:47.930> free

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
that so it has just about 1.8 three free

let's<00:06:50.430> maybe<00:06:51.150> go<00:06:51.810> to<00:06:51.870> like<00:06:52.200> a<00:06:55.040> different<00:06:56.040> site

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
let's maybe go to like a different site

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:18.500 
let's maybe go to like a different site
go<00:06:56.490> to<00:06:56.520> cnn.com

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.510
