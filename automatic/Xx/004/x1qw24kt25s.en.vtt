life of organized crime the game is a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.430 
life of organized crime the game is a
really<00:00:36.520> cinematic<00:00:36.850> experience<00:00:37.270> our<00:00:38.020> goal<00:00:38.260> is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
really cinematic experience our goal is

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.470 
really cinematic experience our goal is
really<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:38.710> sort<00:00:39.070> of<00:00:39.129> that<00:00:39.579> put<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.940> play<00:00:40.149> sort

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
really to sort of that put the play sort

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.910 
really to sort of that put the play sort
of<00:00:40.539> as<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.960> central<00:00:41.379> character<00:00:41.559> in<00:00:41.800> a

Goodfellas<00:00:42.399> type<00:00:42.579> story<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.149> I<00:00:43.210> think<00:00:43.420> we<00:00:43.570> we

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
Goodfellas type story and I think we we

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.760 
Goodfellas type story and I think we we
hit<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.079> nail<00:00:44.230> right<00:00:44.260> on<00:00:44.469> the<00:00:44.559> head<00:00:44.620> for

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
hit the nail right on the head for

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.160 
hit the nail right on the head for
achieving<00:00:45.219> that<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:49.329> know<00:00:49.449> game<00:00:49.629> we<00:00:49.780> make<00:00:49.960> use

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
achieving that you know game we make use

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.319 
achieving that you know game we make use
of<00:00:50.199> the<00:00:50.469> physics<00:00:50.829> technology<00:00:51.399> by<00:00:51.550> Nvidia<00:00:51.910> and

of the physics technology by Nvidia and
a<00:00:52.390> lot<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.600> different<00:00:52.989> ways<00:00:53.019> it<00:00:53.350> pushes<00:00:53.680> around

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
a lot of different ways it pushes around

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.439 
a lot of different ways it pushes around
many<00:00:54.219> different<00:00:54.609> things<00:00:54.730> in<00:00:54.940> our<00:00:55.030> game<00:00:55.210> and

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
many different things in our game and

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.090 
many different things in our game and
the<00:00:55.539> most<00:00:55.719> impressive<00:00:56.109> area<00:00:56.559> that<00:00:56.710> people<00:00:56.980> are

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
the most impressive area that people are

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.650 
the most impressive area that people are
going<00:00:57.190> to<00:00:57.280> see<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.609> game<00:00:57.760> uses<00:00:58.059> it's

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
going to see the game uses it's

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.970 
going to see the game uses it's
obviously<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.109> destructible<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.769> in<00:00:59.890> the

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
obviously the destructible is in the

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.970 
obviously the destructible is in the
environment<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:02.140> an<00:01:02.199> open-world<00:01:02.589> game<00:01:02.829> it

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
environment for an open-world game it

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.290 
environment for an open-world game it
really<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.339> impressive<00:01:03.550> what<00:01:03.940> we're<00:01:04.120> doing

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
really is impressive what we're doing

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.820 
really is impressive what we're doing
and<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.510> amount<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:04.870> destructibility<00:01:05.470> the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
and the amount of destructibility the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.370 
and the amount of destructibility the
player<00:01:06.010> can<00:01:06.160> do<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:06.910> can<00:01:07.090> shoot<00:01:07.330> out<00:01:07.570> tires<00:01:08.110> on

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
player can do you can shoot out tires on

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.900 
player can do you can shoot out tires on
vehicles<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.890> can<00:01:08.920> shoot<00:01:09.160> glass<00:01:09.340> bottles<00:01:09.790> off

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910

of flowing trench coat you known the way
they<00:01:29.830> move<00:01:30.070> as<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.580> really<00:01:30.880> important<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.600> us

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
they move as is really important to us
