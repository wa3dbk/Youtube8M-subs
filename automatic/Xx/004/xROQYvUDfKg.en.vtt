00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
particular procedure and what I notice

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.590 
particular procedure and what I notice
is<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.439> procedures<00:00:20.600> involves

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
is that one of these procedures involves

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.050 
is that one of these procedures involves
thoracentesis<00:00:22.260> now<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.369> pretty<00:00:23.550> sure<00:00:23.670> that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
thoracentesis now I'm pretty sure that

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.240 
thoracentesis now I'm pretty sure that
if<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.300> ask<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.869> thoracentesis<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.980> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
if I ask you what thoracentesis is you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.490 
if I ask you what thoracentesis is you
would<00:00:26.400> say<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:27.150> involves<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> needle<00:00:27.960> go<00:00:28.199> into

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
would say it involves a needle go into

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.740 
would say it involves a needle go into
the<00:00:28.590> chest<00:00:28.830> wall<00:00:29.010> right<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.300> tell<00:00:30.510> me

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the chest wall right but can you tell me

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.959 
the chest wall right but can you tell me
the<00:00:31.349> nursing<00:00:31.740> interventions<00:00:31.859> prior<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.880> the

course<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.489> surgical

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
course we all know it's a surgical

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.660 
course we all know it's a surgical
procedure<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:44.070> happens<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
procedure right now what happens is that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.600 
procedure right now what happens is that
there's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> surgical<00:00:45.559> perforation<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.890> the

there's a surgical perforation of the
chest<00:00:48.090> wall<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.719> within<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> pleural<00:00:49.770> space

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
chest wall and within the pleural space

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.700 
chest wall and within the pleural space
right<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.449> call<00:00:51.629> large<00:00:51.989> bore

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
right with what we call large bore

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.880 
right with what we call large bore
needle<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.820> why<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.899> performed<00:00:55.530> right

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
needle and why is it performed right

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.459 
needle and why is it performed right
it's<00:00:56.100> performed<00:00:56.699> -<00:00:56.879> usually<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:58.050> used<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's performed - usually it's used to

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's performed - usually it's used to
obtain<00:00:58.789> specimens<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.410> diagnostic

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
obtain specimens for diagnostic

obtain specimens for diagnostic
evaluations<00:01:02.070> right<00:01:02.629> can<00:01:03.629> also<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:04.080> used<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
evaluations right can also be used to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.500 
evaluations right can also be used to
install<00:01:05.129> medications<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.030> lot<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.270> people

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
install medications a lot of people

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.000 
install medications a lot of people
don't<00:01:06.689> know<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.650> install

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
don't know that you can install

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
don't know that you can install
medication<00:01:08.580> straight<00:01:09.270> into<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> pleural

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
medication straight into the pleural

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
medication straight into the pleural
space<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.280> obviously<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
space right and obviously one of the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
space right and obviously one of the
main<00:01:12.150> reasons<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> remove<00:01:13.140> fluid

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
main reasons would be to remove fluid

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.030 
main reasons would be to remove fluid
which<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:13.920> effusion<00:01:14.820> right<00:01:15.030> or<00:01:15.689> air<00:01:16.229> from<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
which is effusion right or air from the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.870 
which is effusion right or air from the
pleural<00:01:17.159> space<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.990> help<00:01:19.350> alleviate<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
pleural space to help alleviate for a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.149 
pleural space to help alleviate for a
therapeutic<00:01:21.479> relief<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> patient<00:01:22.619> right

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
therapeutic relief for a patient right

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.350 
therapeutic relief for a patient right
from<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.320> pleural<00:01:25.320> pressure<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:26.400> take<00:01:27.330> note

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
from the pleural pressure now take note

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.440 
from the pleural pressure now take note
that<00:01:28.100> thoracentesis<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.759> performed<00:01:30.270> under

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that thoracentesis is performed under

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.530 
that thoracentesis is performed under
local<00:01:30.810> anesthesia<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.390> is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
local anesthesia now what do we do is

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.710 
local anesthesia now what do we do is
the<00:01:33.659> nurse<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.380> locate<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.970> effusion<00:01:36.360> site

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the nurse to locate the effusion site

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
the nurse to locate the effusion site
when<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:36.990> say<00:01:37.200> fusion<00:01:37.590> site<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.040> basically

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
when I say fusion site it basically

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.649 
when I say fusion site it basically
means<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:40.220> removal<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.490> fluid<00:01:41.880> site

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
means just the removal of fluid site

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.109 
means just the removal of fluid site
right<00:01:43.200> called<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.979> insertion<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> needle

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
right called the insertion the needle

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.690 
right called the insertion the needle
insertion<00:01:45.390> site<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.310> use<00:01:47.520> in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
insertion site now what do we use in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.450 
insertion site now what do we use in
order<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.939> locate<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.570> insertion<00:01:49.350> site<00:01:49.680> what

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
order to locate this insertion site what

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.520 
order to locate this insertion site what
we<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.880> would<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.149> percussion<00:01:51.810> right<00:01:52.320> we

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
we can do would be percussion right we

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.380 
we can do would be percussion right we
use<00:01:52.649> percussion<00:01:53.189> auscultation<00:01:53.759> obviously

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
use percussion auscultation obviously

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.230 
use percussion auscultation obviously
but<00:01:55.320> mostly<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.920> use<00:01:56.060> radiography<00:01:57.060> or

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
but mostly we use radiography or

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.760 
but mostly we use radiography or
sonography<00:01:58.049> okay<00:01:58.939> now<00:01:59.939> when<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.990> assess<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
sonography okay now when we assess the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.850 
sonography okay now when we assess the
the<00:02:01.799> effusion<00:02:02.490> area<00:02:02.939> which<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.590> fluid<00:02:04.590> field

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the effusion area which is fluid field

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.399 
the effusion area which is fluid field
area<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.090> usually<00:02:06.509> reveal<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> decrease

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
area it can usually reveal a decrease

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.750 
area it can usually reveal a decrease
breath<00:02:07.920> sounds<00:02:08.459> or<00:02:09.709> adult<00:02:10.709> percussion<00:02:11.340> sounds

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
breath sounds or adult percussion sounds

the the rhythm and the oxygen

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.830 
the the rhythm and the oxygen
oxygenation<00:04:50.190> status<00:04:50.760> okay<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.330> now<00:04:51.660> that

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
oxygenation status okay and now that

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.270 
oxygenation status okay and now that
would<00:04:51.930> be<00:04:51.960> done<00:04:52.200> hourly<00:04:52.740> for<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.040> first

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
would be done hourly for the first

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.550 
would be done hourly for the first
several<00:04:53.730> hours<00:04:54.060> right<00:04:54.750> after<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.260> procedure

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
several hours right after the procedure

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.460 
several hours right after the procedure
now<00:04:56.480> we're<00:04:57.480> also<00:04:57.660> going<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:57.990> encourage<00:04:58.230> a

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
now we're also going to encourage a

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.800 
now we're also going to encourage a
patient<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.130> encourage<00:05:00.120> deep<00:05:00.390> breathing

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
patient to encourage deep breathing

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.660 
patient to encourage deep breathing
right<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:01.920> would<00:05:02.040> help<00:05:02.220> with<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.520> lung

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
right and that would help with a lung

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.810 
right and that would help with a lung
expansion<00:05:03.260> okay<00:05:04.290> now<00:05:04.890> things<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.430> we<00:05:05.670> have

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
expansion okay now things that we have

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.850 
expansion okay now things that we have
to<00:05:05.940> take<00:05:06.090> note<00:05:06.360> right<00:05:06.930> are<00:05:07.110> complications

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
to take note right are complications

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.370 
to take note right are complications
from<00:05:08.100> this<00:05:08.250> procedure<00:05:08.550> can<00:05:08.880> include<00:05:09.350> shock

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
from this procedure can include shock

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.400 
from this procedure can include shock
now<00:05:11.190> with<00:05:11.970> shock<00:05:12.300> we<00:05:12.480> need<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.780> monitor<00:05:12.960> for

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
now with shock we need to monitor for

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.580 
now with shock we need to monitor for
hypotension<00:05:14.130> right<00:05:14.880> and<00:05:15.350> reflex<00:05:16.350> bradycardia

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
hypotension right and reflex bradycardia

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.850 
hypotension right and reflex bradycardia
because<00:05:17.400> those<00:05:17.670> are<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.270> main<00:05:18.810> symptoms<00:05:19.590> of

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
because those are the main symptoms of

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.620 
because those are the main symptoms of
shock<00:05:20.100> right<00:05:20.940> now

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
shock right now

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.540 
shock right now
pneumothorax<00:05:22.380> could<00:05:22.860> also<00:05:22.980> could<00:05:23.220> happen<00:05:23.520> so

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
pneumothorax could also could happen so

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.150 
pneumothorax could also could happen so
we<00:05:24.090> need<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.330> monitor<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.750> client<00:05:25.650> signs<00:05:25.920> and

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
we need to monitor the client signs and

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.670 
we need to monitor the client signs and
symptoms<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.780> pneumothorax<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.470> number

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
symptoms of pneumothorax and the number

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.890 
symptoms of pneumothorax and the number
one<00:05:28.860> symptom<00:05:29.640> that<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.270> need<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.660> know<00:05:30.780> for

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
one symptom that you need to know for

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.110 
one symptom that you need to know for
your<00:05:30.990> NCLEX<00:05:31.320> would<00:05:31.500> be<00:05:31.670> diminished<00:05:32.670> breath

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
your NCLEX would be diminished breath

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.450 
your NCLEX would be diminished breath
sounds<00:05:33.240> okay<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.650> also<00:05:34.770> we're<00:05:35.070> also<00:05:35.100> gonna

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
sounds okay and also we're also gonna

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.880 
sounds okay and also we're also gonna
have<00:05:35.640> obviously<00:05:36.150> our<00:05:36.300> post<00:05:36.900> procedure<00:05:37.170> x-ray

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
have obviously our post procedure x-ray

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.670 
have obviously our post procedure x-ray
alright<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:39.060> another<00:05:39.720> complication<00:05:40.320> that<00:05:40.500> we

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
alright and another complication that we

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.920 
alright and another complication that we
need<00:05:41.010> to<00:05:41.310> be<00:05:41.880> aware<00:05:42.120> about<00:05:42.180> would<00:05:42.600> be<00:05:42.690> bleeding

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
need to be aware about would be bleeding

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.990 
need to be aware about would be bleeding
obviously<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:44.280> therefore<00:05:44.760> we<00:05:44.850> need<00:05:44.970> to

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
obviously so therefore we need to

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.450 
obviously so therefore we need to
monitor<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.450> clients<00:05:45.780> coughing<00:05:46.170> and<00:05:46.460> check

for any human assist or blood in the
sputum<00:05:49.800> okay<00:05:50.550> now<00:05:51.150> this<00:05:51.480> is<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:51.810> for<00:05:51.960> now<00:05:52.110> but
