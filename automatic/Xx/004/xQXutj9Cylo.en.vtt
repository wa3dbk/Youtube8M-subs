00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.300
 Hello everyone , it's our long-awaited hour 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.640
 moment minute second moment when 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.640
 the car will literally leave in 5 minutes 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.860
 from our studio this is a bear bag we 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.850
 will miss this car so 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.000
 how not know if someone can read long 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.580
 can be a short one and a half 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.409
 months we fumbled with this car 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:35.100
 but our corpses are seamstresses for nothing 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.100
 plays cars madly cool almost 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.820
 what can you say about this car 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.070
 I think everyone knows crocus city hall 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.380
 Of 3 words to say and nothing to say 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.360
 we will be held in just three weeks 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.650
 I think 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.660
 hello david the fact is that not only 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.340
 that finished the cars now three o'clock 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.920
 nights 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.840
 In April there will be a discovery difficulty 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.250
 the opening 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.330
 tenishev on 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.700
 I think 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.910
 Our model owner will allow the car 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.700
 pick up 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.710
 and you will actually have the opportunity 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.510
 all see live and now I 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.430
 I will tell everything that happened to this 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.960
 the machine will start with the data head me 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.390
 pioneer head 8500 connection 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.160
 ceiling tv but that's understandable 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.250
 there is a big back sofa 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.740
 it will be very convenient to watch the coach 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.420
 but these are the little things on let's see 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.310
 that on the beasts everyone will stop 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.920
 speaker collection audio 20. horn beeper 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.710
 let's look at that amount of work 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.190
 which are done a day in the time before 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:56.480
 such a long section is shorter 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.550
 A lot of time King did it we will begin 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.220
 of course 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.230
 I'll tell you a little about how big 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.890
 lining here are a few amps you 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.740
 have seen how amplifiers hang interpretations from us 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.540
 on the right yo these are three amplifiers sandalwood 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.540
 on audio 150. houses 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.370
 which is responsible for all the speakers 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.190
 car tweeters 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.620
 on top of here the amplifier created on at 1200 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.360
 who is responsible for our special and 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.050
 the link 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.140
 amplifiers had to screw everything saying 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.340
 there guts upward to kind 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.240
 had when when bit has this leban 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.280
 made a very neat raised floor 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.540
 tightened and alcantara we have turned 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.700
 without gaps yes here it is clear that as 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.130
 we made finds there it is clear that 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:56.140
 we put a sheet of plywood which we 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.660
 drove on exactly bookmarks give 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.410
 putty all crevices and then tightened 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.680
 Alcantara 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.500
 also tightened cantor plastic plastic 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.730
 which is adjacent to the full done 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.280
 holes framed plexiglass there you can see 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:16.650
 very power tribute by which 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:21.370
 all work done two light 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.260
 car amplifier lights she 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.240
 works with such a button 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.570
 here in the hammer unfortunately there is no yes 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.590
 I had to invent my own button on 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.630
 which 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.780
 push nothing back there trunk 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.310
 closes let go like this 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.090
 light music so maybe another 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.970
 the parties will appoint on the opposite 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.400
 side of the tail we set two 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.880
 subwoofer temporarily 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.620
 now i know what 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:56.050
 Since 12 is not available therefore temporary 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:59.120
 We put two such films in 12 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.590
 plays it all k05 ohm plays pretty 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.540
 nice 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.840
 we like it exactly 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:13.300
 execution box is 60 liters closed 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:15.400
 volume and let me tell you one more 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.740
 not what we did we did here two 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:23.470
 new podiums are two dynamics 16 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.900
 inclined centimeters and persistent pishchalka 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:35.289
 back now I will open the back door and 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:37.810
 from there it will be approximately clear 2 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:41.490
 podium that plays a little bit in 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:45.009
 the nasa center is not looking exactly torpedoes and 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.319
 for the volumetric as well as the gassed owner 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.789
 if someone is interested to look at this 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:52.389
 more car we invite all 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:55.930
