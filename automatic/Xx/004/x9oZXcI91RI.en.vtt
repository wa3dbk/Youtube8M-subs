00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
them were Matt and typically I would

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.910 
them were Matt and typically I would
only<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.240> mac<00:02:21.510> shows<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:21.960> my<00:02:22.050> transition<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.890> I

only put mac shows on my transition so I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.190

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
my crease this is going to end up being

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.240 
my crease this is going to end up being
our<00:02:33.600> transition<00:02:34.260> shade<00:02:34.410> again<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:35.070> I

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
our transition shade again because I

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.860

even<00:03:37.700> more

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.630 

I'm<00:03:53.420> going<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.900> take<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.740> what<00:03:55.280> they<00:03:55.370> call<00:03:55.400> a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
I'm going to take this what they call a

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.220 
I'm going to take this what they call a
brow<00:03:55.910> bone<00:03:56.150> color<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.600> think<00:03:56.930> it's<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.110> little

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
brow bone color I think it's a little

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.930 
brow bone color I think it's a little
too<00:03:57.350> intense<00:03:57.740> for<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.070> brow<00:03:58.250> bone<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:58.850> I'm

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
too intense for the brow bone so I'm

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.020 
too intense for the brow bone so I'm
gonna<00:03:59.120> put<00:03:59.330> it<00:03:59.450> on<00:03:59.600> my<00:03:59.900> lid<00:04:00.410> it's<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.310> really
