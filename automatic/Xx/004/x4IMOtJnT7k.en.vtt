00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello guys, it's less like another video on 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.929
 Channel I bring you guys online 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.000
 here in the mission to the confrontations 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.430
 so come on you have to see the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.810
 parking lot and all the people here at 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.390
 No one knows what they have to do 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.220
 everyone stopped and I do not even know one 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.900
 you have to do this mission already 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 As I already said one of the last 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.710
 episodes of online tv mission in things 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.649
 the boy plays here so do not know 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 almost no head like that but there I 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:44.719
 I really like making emissions then 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.719
 beauty caic is by anac covenant 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.559
 so come on, this mission here is the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.590
 marty madrazo tom make mission to the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 boss mafia boss to win 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.100
 I imagine you have enough confrontation. 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.289
 even as the name of the mission already says 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.449
 and this character I'm using 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.030
 here is not my character that I use 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.220
 I used to do gt series online is my 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.900
 character of the first account 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.780
 first character that I did is with 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.040
 a more advanced level and everything else and I 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.689
 I'll start making the videos in this way. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.250
 more random of some more things 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.560
 different that I can not do for 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.450
 least in the series how to play survival 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.220
 for example and my character has not yet 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.720
 have a sufficient level and if it is 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.520
 although not great things have a 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 enough level to do survival 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.650
 so I'll bring some more videos like this 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.240
 separated from the series in the extra videogames 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.369
 because it will give time to work in 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.350
 more complicated videos for the channel and 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.479
 keep the video frequency does not let 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490
 the channel two weeks a month without 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.530
 video only to work on a video 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.189
 of vehicles and curiosities something 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.750
 like this 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.960
 Let's start recording but the matches 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.210
 to have a random line 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.670
 only this point that he is going and 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.409
 it seems that right now the way so right 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.600
 take a look at the map is far from here 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.630
 are sure almost two kilometers 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630
 distance 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.350
 I only hope to have ammunition, I do not 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.159
 I remember if I put ammunition in my 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.450
 weapons 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.310
 the last time I played with this 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.340
 character of as much time as his 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.280
 he has used it even more than the tape 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.720
 tv series online 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 then shoot a gunfight there with 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.340
 certainty will roll is type 99.9 function 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.700
 chance to roll I'll need 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.700
 ammunition 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.150
 we see do not have the music in this car 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.990
 in the eduardo that already is arriving there in the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.880
 We do not vote for anyone who is 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.650
 seriously I still prefer liberty city 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.580
 roque and I liked it better than gta 4 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.350
 come on, come on, come on, I have it here 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:59.490
 It's beauty Torch is motherfucker 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:01.530
 but anyway let's go there too that does not have 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.520
 friendly fire would not have been straight into the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.520
 nape in a fight at home 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.909
 the father of the baby he has still follows 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.099
 I got a beauty and team life was already gone 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.840
 pro only had one too, right? 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.840
 If someone dies now they'll fuck 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.260
 Then I said what I 'm almost carrying bullet 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.989
 here stick your foot 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.940
 let's recover some energy 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:38.269
 otherwise it ends up dying even as it does not 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:45.109
 team life there, the guy was right now 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:47.030
 You see all sides hide well. 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.500
 Even when you want to die here right? 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.420
 I will not stay the rest of the time alone. 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:59.709
 watching dies 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:02.920
 I got to take another side too. 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.920
 people coming 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:10.849
 I love this end I already said in the video I showed 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.359
 to him that I love 36 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.130
 the carbines in favorites 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.169
 I can not get a crazy one 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.959
 ale, I'm just taking the bullet. 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.340
 better to stay a while to recover I 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.349
 I see the other team drivers are 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.820
 dying right? 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.510
 please say that I'm not the only one 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.510
 that's left 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.750
 we like the river mine too if not 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.750

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.990

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.500

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.500

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.180
 He will not care if the car is right. 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.130
 our car is on the verge of destruction 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.669
 not steal the car here on Peace Street 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.669

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:39.759

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:54.630
 mission is very far from that team for 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:56.590
 completely opposite side ranking 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:02.500
 certain is that it will only be one 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:04.150

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.289
