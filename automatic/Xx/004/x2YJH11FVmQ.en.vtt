left corner you can see a little sneak
peek<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.349> another<00:00:28.859> thing<00:00:29.070> i'm<00:00:29.310> working<00:00:29.970> on

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
peek of another thing i'm working on

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.939 
peek of another thing i'm working on
i'll<00:00:30.269> probably<00:00:30.480> make<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> video<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.170> at<00:00:31.710> some

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
i'll probably make a video that at some

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.510 
i'll probably make a video that at some
point<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.239> yeah<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.020> let's<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
point and so yeah so let's go on to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.979 
point and so yeah so let's go on to
demonstrations<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.030> flip<00:00:42.809> this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
demonstrations so so if we flip this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
demonstrations so so if we flip this
lever<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.800> add<00:00:43.829> some<00:00:44.190> plants<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
lever here we can add some plants so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.220 
lever here we can add some plants so
it's<00:00:45.000> supposed<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> represent<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.809> basic

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it's supposed to represent a basic

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.619 
it's supposed to represent a basic
little<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:47.219> single-celled<00:00:48.059> organism

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
little like single-celled organism

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.560 
little like single-celled organism
ecosystem<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.620> little<00:00:50.129> creatures<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.510> we

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
ecosystem of little creatures so then we

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
ecosystem of little creatures so then we
can<00:00:51.719> add<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:52.170> plants<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.949> was<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.219> add

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
can add some plants here I was just add

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.160 
can add some plants here I was just add
a<00:00:53.430> few<00:00:53.610> more<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.360> let's<00:00:54.989> add<00:00:55.140> some

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
a few more and then let's add some

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.500 
a few more and then let's add some
herbivores<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:56.309> two<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.239> somewhere

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
herbivores like two of them or somewhere

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
herbivores like two of them or somewhere
around<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.989> guess<00:00:58.620> we'll<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.859> good<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
around there I guess we'll be good and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.779 
around there I guess we'll be good and
the<00:01:00.059> plants<00:01:00.449> will<00:01:00.539> start<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> spread<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
the plants will start to spread out and

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.070 
the plants will start to spread out and
then<00:01:02.789> I'll<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.750> sac<00:01:04.170> away<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> oh<00:01:06.080> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
then I'll way sac away for the oh the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.719 
then I'll way sac away for the oh the
plants<00:01:07.409> reproduce<00:01:07.530> automatically<00:01:08.340> whereas

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
plants reproduce automatically whereas

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
plants reproduce automatically whereas
the<00:01:08.970> they're<00:01:09.900> herbivores<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.409> carnivores

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the they're herbivores and carnivores

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.920 
the they're herbivores and carnivores
have<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.220> eat<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.580> review<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.150> if<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.450> actually

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
have to eat to review so if we actually

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
have to eat to review so if we actually
watch<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.189> bit<00:01:14.340> yep<00:01:14.549> there

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
watch this for a little bit yep there

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
watch this for a little bit yep there
you<00:01:14.790> go<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.119> there's<00:01:15.330> three<00:01:15.710> herbivores<00:01:16.710> so

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
you go now there's three herbivores so

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
you go now there's three herbivores so
now<00:01:17.310> let's<00:01:17.580> spawn<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.240> carnivore<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> guess

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
now let's spawn in a carnivore I guess

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.240 
now let's spawn in a carnivore I guess
well<00:01:19.920> why<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> spawn<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> carnivore<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
well why not so spawn a carnivore and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.469 
well why not so spawn a carnivore and
you<00:01:23.490> may<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.640> heard<00:01:23.909> how<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.450> working

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
you may have heard how this is working

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.649 
you may have heard how this is working
the<00:01:25.140> dog<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.520> bit<00:01:26.659> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the dog go on to that a little bit so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
the dog go on to that a little bit so
that<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.619> carnivores<00:01:29.040> are<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.400> slower

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that the carnivores are little slower

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.260 
that the carnivores are little slower
but<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:30.119> will<00:01:30.299> eat<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.140> reproduce<00:01:31.979> from<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
but they will eat and reproduce from the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.880 
but they will eat and reproduce from the
blue<00:01:34.049> curve<00:01:34.710> wars<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.590> kind<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
blue curve wars and so it's kind of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.170 
blue curve wars and so it's kind of
interesting<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.340> watch<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> guess<00:01:39.000> I'll

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
interesting the watch so I guess I'll

00:01:39.180 --> 00:02:51.690 
interesting the watch so I guess I'll
just<00:01:39.470> tune<00:01:40.470> out<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.250> let<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.579> play<00:01:41.820> out

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.540 

and<00:02:52.390> as<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.260> see<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.830> carnivores

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
and as you can see the carnivores

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.300 
and as you can see the carnivores
reproduce<00:02:55.030> as<00:02:55.270> well<00:02:55.450> now<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:59.129> yeah<00:03:00.129> that's

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
reproduce as well now so yeah that's

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.250 
reproduce as well now so yeah that's
sort<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.879> what's<00:03:01.030> going<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.300> it's<00:03:01.750> pretty<00:03:02.080> kind

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
sort of what's going to it's pretty kind

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.540 
sort of what's going to it's pretty kind
of<00:03:02.349> fun<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.560> watch<00:03:02.769> how<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.160> whole<00:03:03.519> thing

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
of fun to watch how the whole thing

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.869 
of fun to watch how the whole thing
plays<00:03:04.120> out<00:03:04.360> but<00:03:04.810> dumb<00:03:05.129> so<00:03:06.129> let's<00:03:06.340> go<00:03:06.489> on<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.730> how

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
plays out but dumb so let's go on to how

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.660 
plays out but dumb so let's go on to how
this<00:03:07.120> works<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:10.660> as<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.349> can<00:03:11.380> see<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
this works so this is as you can see the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.850 
this works so this is as you can see the
plants<00:03:13.330> are<00:03:13.480> villagers<00:03:13.959> modified<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:14.709> they

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
plants are villagers modified so they

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.820 
plants are villagers modified so they
can't<00:03:15.190> move<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:16.360> herbivores<00:03:17.080> are<00:03:17.290> zombies

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
can't move the herbivores are zombies

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.820 
can't move the herbivores are zombies
and<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.760> carnivores<00:03:19.390> are<00:03:19.599> golems<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.380> because

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
and the carnivores are golems so because

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.530 
and the carnivores are golems so because
a<00:03:20.860> zombie's<00:03:21.280> attack<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.730> villagers<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.360> fill

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
a zombie's attack the villagers to fill

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.500 
a zombie's attack the villagers to fill
juice<00:03:23.370> well<00:03:24.370> they<00:03:24.730> would<00:03:24.910> run<00:03:25.060> away<00:03:25.180> but<00:03:25.390> they

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
juice well they would run away but they

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.140 
juice well they would run away but they
can't<00:03:25.840> since<00:03:26.799> they're<00:03:27.099> modified<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.819> not<00:03:27.970> blue

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
can't since they're modified to not blue

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.170 
can't since they're modified to not blue
if<00:03:28.269> they<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.630> reproduce<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.470> then<00:03:29.709> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
if they just reproduce and then the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.000 
if they just reproduce and then the
golem<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.650> attack<00:03:32.650> zombies<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:35.010> just

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
golem is that attack zombies and so just

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.370 
golem is that attack zombies and so just
see<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.400> state<00:03:36.640> really<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.959> really<00:03:38.230> easy

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
see the state really this is really easy

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.140 
see the state really this is really easy
method<00:03:38.829> to<00:03:38.920> do<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.099> just<00:03:39.280> be<00:03:39.400> taking<00:03:39.880> advantage

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
method to do it just be taking advantage

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.069 
method to do it just be taking advantage
of<00:03:40.569> their<00:03:40.780> AI<00:03:40.959> but<00:03:41.860> as<00:03:42.700> for<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:43.150> pixel<00:03:43.599> affects

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
of their AI but as for the pixel affects

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.830 
of their AI but as for the pixel affects
what<00:03:44.380> i<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.739> is<00:03:45.099> on<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:45.849> giant<00:03:46.180> fill<00:03:46.569> clock

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
what i have is on this giant fill clock

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.680 
what i have is on this giant fill clock
here<00:03:47.200> i<00:03:47.380> have<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.579> fill<00:03:49.000> command<00:03:49.269> its<00:03:49.450> first

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
here i have a fill command its first

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.479 
here i have a fill command its first
fill<00:03:49.900> in<00:03:50.019> this<00:03:50.110> entire<00:03:50.440> area<00:03:50.680> with<00:03:50.950> black<00:03:51.220> wool

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
fill in this entire area with black wool

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.050 
fill in this entire area with black wool
and<00:03:51.730> then<00:03:52.269> later<00:03:52.450> its<00:03:52.690> placing<00:03:53.170> blocks<00:03:53.440> at

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and then later its placing blocks at

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.770 
and then later its placing blocks at
above<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.299> mobs<00:03:55.630> heads<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:58.150> as<00:03:58.450> for<00:03:58.690> the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
above the mobs heads and so as for the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.620 
above the mobs heads and so as for the
reproduction<00:03:59.500> part<00:03:59.799> it's<00:04:00.160> adding<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.910> score

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
reproduction part it's adding a score

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.330 
reproduction part it's adding a score
every<00:04:02.380> tick<00:04:02.829> for<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:04.410> plants<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.620> once<00:04:06.250> that

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
every tick for the plants and once that

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.759 
every tick for the plants and once that
score<00:04:06.940> which<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.269> certain<00:04:07.750> minimum<00:04:08.200> then<00:04:08.709> a

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
score which is a certain minimum then a

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.860 
score which is a certain minimum then a
cost<00:04:09.130> attempt<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.700> spawn<00:04:09.970> another<00:04:10.150> plants<00:04:10.690> and

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
cost attempt to spawn another plants and

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.410 
cost attempt to spawn another plants and
it<00:04:10.959> sets<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.290> score<00:04:11.560> back<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.799> zero<00:04:12.299> for<00:04:13.299> the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
it sets the score back to zero for the

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.300 
it sets the score back to zero for the
zombies<00:04:13.870> it's<00:04:14.109> running<00:04:14.410> an<00:04:14.500> execute<00:04:14.920> command

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
zombies it's running an execute command

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.400 
zombies it's running an execute command
and<00:04:15.459> all<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.700> plants<00:04:16.209> adding<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.959> score<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.289> the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
and all the plants adding a score to the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.560 
and all the plants adding a score to the
zombies<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.130> when<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.370> score<00:04:18.789> gets<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.539> a

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
zombies and when that score gets to a

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.819 
zombies and when that score gets to a
certain<00:04:19.630> minimum<00:04:20.019> that<00:04:20.229> causes<00:04:20.590> them<00:04:20.799> to

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
certain minimum that causes them to

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.520 
certain minimum that causes them to
reproduce<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:21.760> then<00:04:22.000> SAT<00:04:22.240> score<00:04:22.570> 20<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.080> the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
reproduce and then SAT score 20 and the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.379 
reproduce and then SAT score 20 and the
same<00:04:23.740> goes<00:04:23.770> for<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.130> zombies<00:04:24.550> setting<00:04:25.060> the

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
same goes for the zombies setting the

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.260 
same goes for the zombies setting the
score<00:04:25.780> for<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.169> golems<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:27.030> that's<00:04:28.030> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
score for the golems and that's the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.529 
score for the golems and that's the
whole<00:04:28.450> system<00:04:28.660> in<00:04:28.990> nutshell<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:30.389> see<00:04:31.389> i'm<00:04:31.479> not

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
whole system in nutshell and see i'm not

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:32.640 
whole system in nutshell and see i'm not
going<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.810> go<00:04:31.900> into<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.080> detailed<00:04:32.500> explanation

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
going to go into a detailed explanation

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.950 
going to go into a detailed explanation
of<00:04:33.160> how<00:04:33.340> all<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:33.639> works<00:04:33.850> just<00:04:34.630> because

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
of how all this works just because

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.480 
of how all this works just because
they'll<00:04:35.110> look<00:04:35.289> at<00:04:35.440> how<00:04:35.650> many<00:04:35.710> command<00:04:36.220> blocks

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
they'll look at how many command blocks

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.060 
they'll look at how many command blocks
are<00:04:36.700> in<00:04:36.820> that<00:04:36.970> with<00:04:37.270> them<00:04:37.510> it's<00:04:38.500> it's

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
are in that with them it's it's

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.430 
are in that with them it's it's
basically<00:04:39.580> kind<00:04:39.849> of<00:04:40.000> repetitive<00:04:40.539> for<00:04:41.020> each<00:04:41.139> of

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
basically kind of repetitive for each of

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.710 
basically kind of repetitive for each of
the<00:04:41.530> different<00:04:41.680> parts<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.460> but<00:04:42.700> yeah<00:04:43.690> I

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
the different parts of it but yeah I

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.750 
the different parts of it but yeah I
thought<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.050> think<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.440> pretty<00:04:44.560> cool<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:46.680> yeah

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
thought I think it's pretty cool so yeah

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.719 
thought I think it's pretty cool so yeah
that<00:04:48.760> that's<00:04:48.970> but<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.300> I'm<00:04:50.080> MC<00:04:50.470> labs<00:04:50.650> 15<00:04:51.130> you

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
that that's but it I'm MC labs 15 you
