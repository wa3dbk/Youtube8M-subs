00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.370 

all<00:00:05.790> right<00:00:05.880> so<00:00:06.060> let's<00:00:06.270> break<00:00:06.450> down<00:00:06.510> what<00:00:07.050> those

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
all right so let's break down what those

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.180 
all right so let's break down what those
arpeggios<00:00:08.010> are<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.710> goes<00:00:10.920> into

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
arpeggios are and this is this goes into

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.460 
arpeggios are and this is this goes into
the<00:00:11.309> whole<00:00:11.490> concept<00:00:12.450> over<00:00:12.809> lick<00:00:13.050> I<00:00:13.200> mean<00:00:13.349> that

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470 
the whole concept over lick I mean that

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.709 
the whole concept over lick I mean that
was<00:00:13.590> kind<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.190> lick<00:00:14.610> combining<00:00:15.599> those

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
was kind of a lick combining those

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.019 
was kind of a lick combining those
things<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> concept<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.460> basically

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
things but the concept is basically

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.140 
things but the concept is basically
taking<00:00:18.599> instead<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.189> single

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
taking instead of going up a single

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.330 
taking instead of going up a single
arpeggio<00:00:21.720> from<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> bottom<00:00:22.440> note<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> top

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
arpeggio from the bottom note to the top

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.570 
arpeggio from the bottom note to the top
you<00:00:23.789> start<00:00:24.090> thinking<00:00:24.510> about<00:00:25.580> incorporating

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you start thinking about incorporating

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.240 
you start thinking about incorporating
two<00:00:27.240> arpeggios<00:00:27.930> at<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.199> time<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.680> maybe<00:00:28.890> three

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
two arpeggios at a time or maybe three

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.400 
two arpeggios at a time or maybe three
arpeggios<00:00:29.850> this<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.449> very<00:00:30.689> reminiscent<00:00:31.109> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
arpeggios this is very reminiscent of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.350 
arpeggios this is very reminiscent of
like<00:00:32.010> Larry<00:00:32.250> Carlton<00:00:32.610> does<00:00:32.970> this<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.269> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
like Larry Carlton does this all the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.979 
like Larry Carlton does this all the
time<00:00:33.540> where<00:00:33.780> Robin<00:00:34.110> Ford<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:35.400> lot<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.540> guys<00:00:36.690> do

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
time where Robin Ford a lot of guys do

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.900 
time where Robin Ford a lot of guys do
this<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.469> those<00:00:37.680> two<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.880> time

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
this but those two do it all the time

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.569 
this but those two do it all the time
and<00:00:39.300> Michael<00:00:39.420> lindau<00:00:39.809> does<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.230> lot<00:00:40.520> all<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and Michael lindau does it a lot all the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.040 
and Michael lindau does it a lot all the
really<00:00:42.030> good<00:00:42.149> players<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.719> because<00:00:42.899> it's

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
really good players do it because it's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
really good players do it because it's
it's<00:00:43.770> kind<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.160> unless<00:00:44.399> you're<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.730> rock

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it's kind of unless you're in a rock

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700 
it's kind of unless you're in a rock
situation<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.050> you're<00:00:46.200> doing<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.500> trying

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
situation and all you're doing is trying

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.010 
situation and all you're doing is trying
to<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:46.920> from<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.850> note<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.829> say<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.930> know

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
to get from this note to say you know

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.410 
to get from this note to say you know
what<00:00:55.800> you're<00:00:55.980> doing<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.399> sweeping<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
what you're doing is sweeping up that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.689 
what you're doing is sweeping up that
arpeggio<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.280> trying<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.520> get

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
arpeggio and you're just trying to get

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.950 
arpeggio and you're just trying to get
from<00:00:59.850> here<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> doesn't<00:01:00.480> matter<00:01:00.690> what

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
from here to here it doesn't matter what

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.119 
from here to here it doesn't matter what
you<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.320> between<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.860> you're<00:01:01.980> actually

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you do in between but if you're actually

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
you do in between but if you're actually
trying<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> phrase<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.449> which<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.050> what

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
trying to phrase with it which is what

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.950 
trying to phrase with it which is what
this<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.820> it's<00:01:05.820> taking<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.210> three<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.570> four<00:01:06.780> note

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this is it's taking a three or four note

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.070 
this is it's taking a three or four note
phrase<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.479> actually<00:01:12.630> trying<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
phrase so it's actually trying to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.289 
phrase so it's actually trying to
instead<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.760> arpeggio

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
instead of just going up one arpeggio

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.520 
instead of just going up one arpeggio
with<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.840> break<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> into<00:01:16.350> different

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
with that you break it into different

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
with that you break it into different
voicings<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.060> different<00:01:18.150> tonality

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
voicings and you get different tonality

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.899 
voicings and you get different tonality
Zout<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.260> so<00:01:19.610> anyway<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.880> was

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
Zout of it so anyway that was

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.050 
Zout of it so anyway that was
long-winded<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.000> is

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
long-winded but what this is is this is

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.719 
long-winded but what this is is this is
it<00:01:24.659> starts<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> second<00:01:25.650> inversion<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it starts with the second inversion of a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.450 
it starts with the second inversion of a
D<00:01:27.150> major<00:01:27.390> arpeggio<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:30.470> what<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> mean<00:01:31.770> by<00:01:31.950> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
D major arpeggio and what I mean by this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.039 
D major arpeggio and what I mean by this
maybe<00:01:32.729> basic<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.329> some<00:01:33.479> people<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.869> just

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
maybe basic for some people but I just

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:34.580 
maybe basic for some people but I just
want<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> touch<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
want to touch it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.670 
want to touch it
a<00:01:34.710> touch<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.630> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> touch<00:01:37.290> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
a touch on it I just want to touch it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
a touch on it I just want to touch it
that<00:01:38.520> doesn't<00:01:38.850> sound<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:41.509> first<00:01:42.509> inversion

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
that doesn't sound right first inversion

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
that doesn't sound right first inversion
if<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> triad<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.520> basically<00:01:45.119> it's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
if you have a triad and basically it's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.800 
if you have a triad and basically it's
root<00:01:45.509> third<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.840> fifth<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:50.810> right

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
root third and fifth so you have right

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.240 
root third and fifth so you have right
there's<00:01:52.290> only<00:01:52.380> three<00:01:52.680> notes<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.040> there

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
there's only three notes in there

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.870 
there's only three notes in there
there's<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.670> D<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.509> F<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> D

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
there's a D and F and in it it's a D

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.370 
there's a D and F and in it it's a D
major<00:01:57.119> triad<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:59.750> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.990> play<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
major triad and you can play that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.190 
major triad and you can play that
starting<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:01.950> D<00:02:02.219> which<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.790> D<00:02:03.770> or<00:02:04.770> D<00:02:04.979> F<00:02:05.250> sharp

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
starting on D which is D or D F sharp

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.870 
starting on D which is D or D F sharp
or<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.830> could<00:02:06.979> start<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:07.369> arpeggio

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
or you could start that arpeggio

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.220 
or you could start that arpeggio
starting<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.539> F<00:02:08.810> sharp<00:02:08.929> yes<00:02:09.679> your<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.780> that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
starting on F sharp yes your and that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.440 
starting on F sharp yes your and that
would<00:02:12.380> be<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> second<00:02:13.010> inversion<00:02:13.310> arpeggio<00:02:14.239> or

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
would be a second inversion arpeggio or

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.780 
would be a second inversion arpeggio or
if<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.660> think<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.020> as<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> chord<00:02:15.560> here's<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
if you think of it as a chord here's the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.470 
if you think of it as a chord here's the
first<00:02:16.940> inversion<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.720> chord<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:19.790> D<00:02:20.150> F

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
first inversion of a chord you have D F

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.200 
first inversion of a chord you have D F
sharp<00:02:20.510> a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.390 

well<00:02:24.810> second<00:02:25.260> inversion<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.980> Court

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
well second inversion of that Court

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.430 
well second inversion of that Court
would<00:02:26.580> be<00:02:27.320> good<00:02:28.320> at<00:02:28.440> F<00:02:28.770> sharp<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.370> D<00:02:30.210> same<00:02:31.170> three

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
would be good at F sharp a D same three

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.060 
would be good at F sharp a D same three
notes<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.130> lowest<00:02:32.370> note<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.590> second

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
notes but the lowest note is the second

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.670 
notes but the lowest note is the second
note<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.490> series<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.240> three<00:02:36.480> notes<00:02:36.680> so

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
note in that series of three notes so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.220 
note in that series of three notes so
it's<00:02:37.860> third<00:02:38.280> fifth<00:02:38.670> group<00:02:39.000> now<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> third

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
it's third fifth group now a third

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.160 
it's third fifth group now a third
inversion<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.070> would<00:02:41.310> be<00:02:41.960> which<00:02:42.960> is

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
inversion of that would be which is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.540 
inversion of that would be which is
starting<00:02:43.590> with<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.830> fifth<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:45.600> third<00:02:46.550> so

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
starting with the fifth and the third so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.590 
starting with the fifth and the third so
you<00:02:47.640> understand<00:02:48.000> how<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.240> working<00:02:48.480> out

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
you understand how that's working out

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.780 
you understand how that's working out
well<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.320> basically<00:02:49.650> starting<00:02:50.430> out<00:02:50.550> on

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
well this is basically starting out on

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.130 
well this is basically starting out on
the<00:02:50.940> second<00:02:51.360> inversion<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.950> D<00:02:53.220> major<00:02:53.430> chord

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the second inversion of a D major chord

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.360 
the second inversion of a D major chord
so<00:02:55.140> instead<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.470> going<00:02:55.620> up<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.830> arpeggio<00:02:56.190> like

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
so instead of going up the arpeggio like

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.240 
so instead of going up the arpeggio like
this<00:02:59.780> so<00:03:00.780> that's<00:03:01.020> what<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.440> first<00:03:01.680> arpeggio

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
this so that's what that first arpeggio

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.370 
this so that's what that first arpeggio
is<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.610> just<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.970> second<00:03:03.420> version<00:03:03.600> D<00:03:04.170> major

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
is it's just a second version D major

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.430 
is it's just a second version D major
arpeggio<00:03:05.690> then<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.810> goes<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.290> arpeggio

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
arpeggio then it goes to this arpeggio

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.120 
arpeggio then it goes to this arpeggio
and<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.680> our<00:03:10.830> patio<00:03:11.220> there<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.790> basically<00:03:12.390> a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
and that our patio there is basically a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.310 
and that our patio there is basically a
C<00:03:14.130> major<00:03:14.370> arpeggio<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.750> starts<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
C major arpeggio so it starts on the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.920 
C major arpeggio so it starts on the
root<00:03:16.530> C<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:17.610> have<00:03:17.730> E<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.750> genome<00:03:20.930> well

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
root C and you have E and a genome well

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.220 
root C and you have E and a genome well
what<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.380> does<00:03:22.590> before<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:24.510> goes<00:03:24.930> it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
what it does before that is it goes it

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.730 
what it does before that is it goes it
slides<00:03:25.650> into<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.160> from<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.460> half-step<00:03:26.940> below

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
slides into that from a half-step below

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.170 
slides into that from a half-step below
now<00:03:28.740> what<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.190> do<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.700> can<00:03:29.820> think<00:03:30.000> of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
now what you can do is you can think of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.930 
now what you can do is you can think of
that<00:03:30.300> either<00:03:30.480> as<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.740> one<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.220> two<00:03:32.370> ways<00:03:32.520> you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
that either as in one of two ways you

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.670 
that either as in one of two ways you
can<00:03:33.060> think<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.450> as<00:03:33.570> an<00:03:33.720> approach<00:03:34.080> tone<00:03:34.410> a

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
can think of it as an approach tone a

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.160 
can think of it as an approach tone a
half<00:03:35.070> step<00:03:35.400> below<00:03:35.580> your<00:03:36.150> approach<00:03:36.450> note<00:03:36.720> so

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
half step below your approach note so

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.530 
half step below your approach note so
say<00:03:37.860> we<00:03:38.010> were<00:03:38.130> doing<00:03:38.160> pentatonic<00:03:39.000> stuff<00:03:39.240> you

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
say we were doing pentatonic stuff you

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.520 
say we were doing pentatonic stuff you
can<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.900> let's<00:03:40.860> do<00:03:41.010> D<00:03:41.190> minor<00:03:41.430> pentatonic

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.200 

that<00:03:46.530> kind<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.980> simple<00:03:47.280> thing<00:03:47.520> you<00:03:47.760> could

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
that kind of simple thing you could

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.730 
that kind of simple thing you could
approach<00:03:48.480> some<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.900> those<00:03:48.960> notes<00:03:49.260> from<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.560> half

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
approach some of those notes from a half

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.710 
approach some of those notes from a half
step<00:03:49.980> below<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.550> don't<00:03:51.060> even<00:03:51.150> care<00:03:51.450> if<00:03:51.480> they

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
step below and don't even care if they

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.920 
step below and don't even care if they
belong<00:03:52.110> or<00:03:52.350> not<00:03:52.500> even<00:03:52.860> go<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.600> wasn't<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
belong or not even go so that wasn't the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.530 
belong or not even go so that wasn't the
exact<00:04:01.230> same<00:04:01.410> phrase<00:04:01.680> but<00:04:02.210> so<00:04:03.210> much<00:04:03.360> for

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
exact same phrase but so much for

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.180 
exact same phrase but so much for
mimicking<00:04:04.020> phrases<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:04.920> get<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.160> idea

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
mimicking phrases but you get the idea

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.430 
mimicking phrases but you get the idea
I'm<00:04:05.700> basically<00:04:06.240> literally<00:04:06.960> some<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.380> those

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
I'm basically literally some of those

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.960 
I'm basically literally some of those
notes<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.800> was<00:04:07.950> just<00:04:08.160> approaching<00:04:08.700> from<00:04:08.910> a

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
notes I was just approaching from a

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.510 
notes I was just approaching from a
half-step<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.840> sounds<00:04:10.200> fine<00:04:10.380> well<00:04:11.220> that's

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
half-step and it sounds fine well that's

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.100 
half-step and it sounds fine well that's
what's<00:04:11.760> going<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:12.090> here<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.900> first

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
what's going on here so that first

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.520 
what's going on here so that first
arpeggio<00:04:13.800> starts<00:04:14.340> out<00:04:14.460> like<00:04:14.640> this<00:04:15.410> then<00:04:16.410> it

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
arpeggio starts out like this then it

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.920 
arpeggio starts out like this then it
goes<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.410> main<00:04:19.590> arpeggio<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.930> but

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
goes so the main arpeggio is this but

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.860 
goes so the main arpeggio is this but
it's<00:04:22.049> being<00:04:22.260> approached<00:04:22.590> by<00:04:22.740> half-step<00:04:23.870> now

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
it's being approached by half-step now

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.240 
it's being approached by half-step now
the<00:04:24.930> other<00:04:25.110> way<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.320> could<00:04:25.530> think<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:26.010> is

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
the other way you could think of this is

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.150 
the other way you could think of this is
this<00:04:26.670> is<00:04:26.850> actually<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.360> major<00:04:27.690> 7<00:04:28.170> arpeggio<00:04:28.470> so

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
this is actually a major 7 arpeggio so

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.110 
this is actually a major 7 arpeggio so
it's<00:04:29.340> starting<00:04:29.970> on<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.180> major<00:04:30.420> 7<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:32.730> B<00:04:32.910> note

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
it's starting on the major 7 the B note

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.780 
it's starting on the major 7 the B note
going<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.050> root<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.800> anyway<00:04:38.520> those<00:04:38.640> are

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
going to the root so anyway those are

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.100 
going to the root so anyway those are
two<00:04:38.910> different<00:04:39.030> ways<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.419> thinking<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.900> and

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
two different ways of thinking of it and

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.159 
two different ways of thinking of it and
the<00:04:40.440> reason<00:04:40.680> why<00:04:40.770> I'm<00:04:40.890> doing<00:04:40.950> this<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.400> this

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
the reason why I'm doing this is this

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.990 
the reason why I'm doing this is this
analyzing<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:43.380> in<00:04:43.890> different<00:04:44.100> ways<00:04:44.340> helps

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
analyzing this in different ways helps

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.640 
analyzing this in different ways helps
you<00:04:45.240> when<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:45.570> actually<00:04:45.930> want<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.230> use<00:04:46.440> this

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
you when you actually want to use this

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.980 
you when you actually want to use this
idea<00:04:46.890> yourself<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:48.150> that's<00:04:48.690> what<00:04:48.870> we're

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
idea yourself so that's what we're

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.110 
idea yourself so that's what we're
getting<00:04:49.080> into<00:04:49.410> now<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.610> first<00:04:50.820> start<00:04:51.000> paid

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
getting into now so the first start paid

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.670 
getting into now so the first start paid
you<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:52.400> second<00:04:53.400> one<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:55.410> third

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
you is this second one is this the third

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.020 
you is this second one is this the third
one<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:55.950> this<00:04:57.590> now<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.830> third<00:04:59.100> one<00:04:59.310> again<00:04:59.880> you

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
one is this now that third one again you

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.130 
one is this now that third one again you
could<00:05:00.150> think<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.479> as<00:05:00.600> approaching<00:05:01.080> a

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
could think of as approaching a

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.670 
could think of as approaching a
half-step<00:05:01.560> below<00:05:02.510> and<00:05:03.510> sliding<00:05:04.080> into<00:05:04.260> the

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
half-step below and sliding into the

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.790 
half-step below and sliding into the
first<00:05:05.040> note<00:05:05.250> of<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.430> arpeggio<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.800> then

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
first note of the arpeggio and then

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.130 
first note of the arpeggio and then
doing<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.160> 3<00:05:08.400> note<00:05:08.550> arpeggio<00:05:08.850> now<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:09.990> shape

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
doing the 3 note arpeggio now that shape

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:21.300 
doing the 3 note arpeggio now that shape
really<00:05:13.140> looks<00:05:13.590> like<00:05:13.710> a<00:05:13.830> diminishing

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.230 

but<00:05:22.310> in<00:05:22.850> reality<00:05:23.330> it<00:05:23.960> also<00:05:24.140> could<00:05:24.860> be<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.550> way

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
but in reality it also could be the way

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.840 
but in reality it also could be the way
I'm<00:05:26.420> looking<00:05:26.600> at<00:05:26.870> this<00:05:27.020> as<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.740> minor<00:05:28.400> six

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
I'm looking at this as a minor six

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:37.750 
I'm looking at this as a minor six
arpeggio<00:05:29.450> so<00:05:29.930> a<00:05:30.260> minor<00:05:30.620> would<00:05:30.920> be<00:05:31.070> this<00:05:36.400> now<00:05:37.400> if

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
arpeggio so a minor would be this now if

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.790 
arpeggio so a minor would be this now if
you<00:05:37.910> take<00:05:38.180> this<00:05:38.480> note<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.110> raise<00:05:39.350> it<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.560> this

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
you take this note and raise it to this

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:49.120 
you take this note and raise it to this
note<00:05:40.390> then<00:05:41.390> you'd<00:05:41.540> have<00:05:47.740> so<00:05:48.740> that's<00:05:48.920> what<00:05:49.100> I

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
note then you'd have so that's what I

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.500 
note then you'd have so that's what I
think's<00:05:49.400> going<00:05:49.640> on<00:05:49.700> here<00:05:49.940> that's<00:05:50.150> how<00:05:50.330> I<00:05:50.360> would

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
think's going on here that's how I would

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.390 
think's going on here that's how I would
analyze<00:05:50.990> it<00:05:51.200> again<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:51.740> can<00:05:51.860> analyze<00:05:52.190> these<00:05:52.340> a

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
analyze it again you can analyze these a

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.910 
analyze it again you can analyze these a
million<00:05:52.760> different<00:05:52.880> ways<00:05:53.030> so<00:05:53.780> that<00:05:54.320> note<00:05:54.650> is

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
million different ways so that note is

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.460 
million different ways so that note is
the<00:05:55.190> six<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:56.060> major<00:05:56.330> six<00:05:56.780> of<00:05:57.710> a<00:05:58.580> major<00:05:59.470> and

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
the six the major six of a major and

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.280 
the six the major six of a major and
then<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:00.740> have<00:06:00.950> the<00:06:01.130> root<00:06:01.400> the<00:06:01.730> a<00:06:01.760> note<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.990> C

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
then you have the root the a note the C

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.119 
then you have the root the a note the C
note<00:06:03.500> which<00:06:03.800> is<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.130> minor<00:06:04.430> third

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
note which is the minor third

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.879 
note which is the minor third
and<00:06:06.219> the<00:06:06.550> e<00:06:06.580> note<00:06:06.969> which<00:06:07.719> is<00:06:07.749> v<00:06:08.020> so<00:06:08.559> you<00:06:08.619> have

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.169 

then<00:06:11.889> you<00:06:11.919> slide<00:06:12.249> down<00:06:12.279> to<00:06:12.639> that<00:06:12.789> note<00:06:12.969> which

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:13.179 
then you slide down to that note which

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:15.629 
then you slide down to that note which
at<00:06:13.389> that<00:06:13.419> point<00:06:13.569> that<00:06:14.319> seems<00:06:14.739> like<00:06:15.039> I<00:06:15.279> mean

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
at that point that seems like I mean

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.320 
at that point that seems like I mean
that<00:06:15.669> would<00:06:15.939> be<00:06:16.089> a<00:06:16.119> sharp<00:06:16.479> five<00:06:18.029> that's<00:06:19.029> where

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
that would be a sharp five that's where

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.509 
that would be a sharp five that's where
it<00:06:19.419> seems<00:06:19.689> more<00:06:21.869> likely<00:06:22.869> to<00:06:23.259> analyze<00:06:24.159> that<00:06:24.339> as

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:24.519 
it seems more likely to analyze that as

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:31.290 
it seems more likely to analyze that as
a<00:06:24.550> passing<00:06:25.059> tone<00:06:25.239> like<00:06:25.599> a<00:06:26.399> leading<00:06:27.399> tone<00:06:30.300> then

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
a passing tone like a leading tone then

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.709 
a passing tone like a leading tone then
it<00:06:31.389> slides<00:06:31.689> down<00:06:31.869> that<00:06:32.229> arpeggio<00:06:32.739> and<00:06:33.509> the<00:06:34.509> C

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
it slides down that arpeggio and the C

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:37.109 
it slides down that arpeggio and the C
major<00:06:34.929> arpeggio<00:06:35.610> then<00:06:36.610> it<00:06:36.699> goes<00:06:36.849> to<00:06:36.999> this

00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:37.119 
major arpeggio then it goes to this

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:40.529 
major arpeggio then it goes to this
arpeggio<00:06:38.459> which<00:06:39.459> that<00:06:39.699> arpeggio<00:06:40.209> can<00:06:40.419> be

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
arpeggio which that arpeggio can be

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.649 
arpeggio which that arpeggio can be
looked<00:06:40.749> at<00:06:40.869> as<00:06:41.080> a<00:06:41.110> G<00:06:41.439> major<00:06:41.679> so<00:06:42.129> you<00:06:42.189> have<00:06:42.399> G<00:06:42.759> you

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:43.659 
looked at as a G major so you have G you

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:50.489 
looked at as a G major so you have G you
have<00:06:43.749> me<00:06:44.159> and<00:06:45.159> you<00:06:45.309> have<00:06:45.429> a<00:06:45.459> dino<00:06:45.909> so<00:06:47.189> v<00:06:49.499> and

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:50.499 
have me and you have a dino so v and

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:52.049 
have me and you have a dino so v and
then<00:06:50.589> it<00:06:50.740> slides<00:06:50.919> down<00:06:51.159> to<00:06:51.490> that<00:06:51.639> note<00:06:51.849> which

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:52.059 
then it slides down to that note which

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:54.959 
then it slides down to that note which
again<00:06:52.360> could<00:06:52.659> either<00:06:52.779> be<00:06:53.080> the<00:06:54.009> major<00:06:54.219> seven<00:06:54.819> of

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 
again could either be the major seven of

00:06:54.969 --> 00:07:02.850 
again could either be the major seven of
G<00:06:55.240> major<00:06:56.369> or<00:06:57.369> the<00:06:57.639> major<00:06:57.909> third<00:07:01.649> D<00:07:02.649> major

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
G major or the major third D major

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.959 
G major or the major third D major
second<00:07:03.309> inversion<00:07:04.110> lands<00:07:05.110> on<00:07:05.349> the<00:07:05.439> fifth<00:07:05.969> so

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969 
second inversion lands on the fifth so

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.040 
second inversion lands on the fifth so
anyway<00:07:07.179> I<00:07:07.209> know<00:07:07.300> that<00:07:07.509> was<00:07:07.629> a<00:07:07.659> lot<00:07:07.809> of<00:07:07.839> talk

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
anyway I know that was a lot of talk

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.359 
anyway I know that was a lot of talk
about<00:07:08.349> notes<00:07:08.619> and<00:07:08.769> note<00:07:08.979> names<00:07:09.189> and

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:09.369 
about notes and note names and

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:10.529 
about notes and note names and
everything<00:07:09.550> but<00:07:09.819> if<00:07:09.909> you<00:07:09.999> understand<00:07:10.449> the

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:10.539 
everything but if you understand the

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.049 
everything but if you understand the
concept<00:07:10.569> it's<00:07:11.139> going<00:07:11.469> between<00:07:12.059> several

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:13.059 
concept it's going between several

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:14.489 
concept it's going between several
different<00:07:13.449> arpeggios<00:07:13.929> you<00:07:14.050> have<00:07:14.139> your<00:07:14.289> first

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:14.499 
different arpeggios you have your first

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:17.009 
different arpeggios you have your first
one<00:07:14.769> which<00:07:14.919> is<00:07:14.949> d<00:07:15.300> your<00:07:16.300> second<00:07:16.689> one<00:07:16.779> would<00:07:16.899> you

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:17.019 
one which is d your second one would you

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:17.850 
one which is d your second one would you
see

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
see

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.919 
see
third<00:07:18.399> one<00:07:18.579> which<00:07:18.729> is<00:07:18.759> like<00:07:19.089> an<00:07:19.209> a<00:07:19.389> minor<00:07:20.319> e6

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:21.929 
third one which is like an a minor e6

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:25.169 
third one which is like an a minor e6
back<00:07:22.929> to<00:07:23.139> C<00:07:23.409> then<00:07:23.979> to<00:07:24.219> G<00:07:24.519> so<00:07:24.849> it's<00:07:24.969> actually

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:25.179 
back to C then to G so it's actually

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:28.439 
back to C then to G so it's actually
using<00:07:25.719> four<00:07:26.110> different<00:07:26.139> arpeggios<00:07:26.919> there<00:07:27.449> now

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:28.449 
using four different arpeggios there now

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.290 
using four different arpeggios there now
that<00:07:29.439> to<00:07:29.889> me<00:07:29.919> is<00:07:30.039> a<00:07:30.189> really<00:07:30.550> cool<00:07:30.729> phrase<00:07:31.059> and

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
that to me is a really cool phrase and

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:38.189 
that to me is a really cool phrase and
it<00:07:31.360> works<00:07:31.569> in<00:07:31.749> a<00:07:31.809> lot<00:07:31.959> of<00:07:32.019> cool<00:07:32.289> tonality<00:07:37.199> when

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 
it works in a lot of cool tonality when

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.559 
it works in a lot of cool tonality when
he<00:07:38.259> goes<00:07:38.439> down<00:07:38.469> this<00:07:38.829> arpeggio<00:07:39.389> he<00:07:40.389> may

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:40.569 
he goes down this arpeggio he may

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:45.100 
he goes down this arpeggio he may
actually<00:07:40.749> skip<00:07:41.409> this<00:07:41.679> note<00:07:41.979> and<00:07:42.219> just<00:07:42.279> go

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.110 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.240 

so<00:07:46.009> it<00:07:46.099> holds<00:07:46.520> that<00:07:46.789> no<00:07:47.000> doubt<00:07:47.240> four<00:07:48.250> sixteenth

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.250 
so it holds that no doubt four sixteenth

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.480 
so it holds that no doubt four sixteenth
note<00:07:49.490> or<00:07:49.729> an<00:07:49.819> eighth<00:07:49.939> note<00:07:50.060> longer<00:07:51.310> so<00:07:52.310> now

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.490 
note or an eighth note longer so now

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.209 
note or an eighth note longer so now
what<00:07:53.000> you<00:07:53.120> do<00:07:53.300> is<00:07:53.509> the<00:07:54.319> cool<00:07:54.500> thing<00:07:54.530> is<00:07:54.830> to<00:07:54.979> take

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:55.219 
what you do is the cool thing is to take

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:57.850 
what you do is the cool thing is to take
this<00:07:55.490> concept<00:07:55.879> and<00:07:56.509> actually<00:07:57.080> incorporate<00:07:57.770> it

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:57.860 
this concept and actually incorporate it

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.260 
this concept and actually incorporate it
into<00:07:57.949> your<00:07:58.039> play<00:07:58.219> instead<00:07:58.520> of<00:07:58.639> just<00:07:58.789> learning

00:07:59.260 --> 00:07:59.270 
into your play instead of just learning

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.240 
into your play instead of just learning
this<00:07:59.479> lick<00:07:59.810> and<00:08:00.080> that's<00:08:00.560> all<00:08:00.740> you<00:08:00.889> get<00:08:01.039> out<00:08:01.099> of

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.250 
this lick and that's all you get out of

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.760 
this lick and that's all you get out of
it<00:08:01.400> start<00:08:02.090> using<00:08:02.300> the<00:08:02.539> idea<00:08:02.840> of<00:08:02.990> interjecting

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:03.770 
it start using the idea of interjecting

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.830 
it start using the idea of interjecting
multiple<00:08:04.219> arpeggios<00:08:04.789> into<00:08:05.150> your<00:08:05.300> playing<00:08:05.599> and

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 
multiple arpeggios into your playing and

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:15.570 
multiple arpeggios into your playing and
we'll<00:08:06.289> get<00:08:06.409> into<00:08:06.680> that<00:08:06.830> in<00:08:07.069> a<00:08:07.370> second

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:15.580 

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.639
