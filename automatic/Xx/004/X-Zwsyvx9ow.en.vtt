for the isofix fittings this is fairly

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.040 
for the isofix fittings this is fairly
straightforward<00:00:38.239> it's<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> great<00:00:39.510> button<00:00:39.900> to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.140 
we're now going to install the seat into
the<00:01:55.410> car<00:01:55.770> I've<00:01:56.160> personally<00:01:56.550> found<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
the car I've personally found the

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.730 
the car I've personally found the
easiest<00:01:57.420> way<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.870> that<00:01:57.900> will<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.620> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
easiest way to do that will be to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.470 
easiest way to do that will be to
connect<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.040> front<00:01:59.400> brace<00:01:59.700> first<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.300> all

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
connect the front brace first of all

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.340 
connect the front brace first of all
which<00:02:00.810> simply<00:02:01.820> connects<00:02:02.820> two<00:02:03.570> prongs<00:02:03.900> it<00:02:04.170> fix

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
which simply connects two prongs it fix

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.490 
which simply connects two prongs it fix
into<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.740> slots<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.220> front<00:02:06.200> edge<00:02:07.200> loose

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
into the slots on the front edge loose

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.080 
into the slots on the front edge loose
but<00:02:07.890> that's<00:02:07.920> fine<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:08.759> we're<00:02:09.000> going

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
but that's fine for now but we're going

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.190 
but that's fine for now but we're going
to<00:02:09.149> tighten<00:02:09.540> up<00:02:09.630> want<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.899> sleep<00:02:10.170> some

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
to tighten up want to sleep some

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.230

seat extra support underneath the front

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.689 
seat extra support underneath the front
brace<00:03:49.440> you're<00:03:49.650> going<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.859> find<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.129> ratchet<00:03:50.579> and

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
brace you're going to find a ratchet and

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
the ratchet there is also clip which

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.949 
the ratchet there is also clip which
means<00:03:56.699> if<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:56.940> come<00:03:57.120> if<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.329> push<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.720> clip
