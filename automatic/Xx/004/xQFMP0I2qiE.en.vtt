a<00:00:42.920> little<00:00:43.100> bit<00:00:43.219> and<00:00:43.339> how<00:00:43.820> essentially<00:00:44.600> this

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
a little bit and how essentially this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.049 
a little bit and how essentially this
town<00:00:45.230> is<00:00:45.379> transformed<00:00:46.010> for<00:00:46.579> something<00:00:46.969> like

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
town is transformed for something like

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.819 
town is transformed for something like
EDC<00:00:47.539> what<00:00:47.989> can<00:00:48.109> you<00:00:48.170> say<00:00:48.319> about<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.800> how

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
EDC what can you say about that and how

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.069 
EDC what can you say about that and how
it<00:00:49.010> represents<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:49.819> shift<00:00:50.149> in<00:00:50.390> American

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
it represents that shift in American

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.569 
it represents that shift in American
culture<00:00:51.199> I<00:00:51.530> think<00:00:51.769> there's<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:51.979> whole<00:00:52.100> young

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
culture I think there's a whole young

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.160 
culture I think there's a whole young
generation<00:00:53.120> now<00:00:53.269> growing<00:00:53.510> up<00:00:53.690> listen<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.109> EDM

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
generation now growing up listen to EDM

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.319 
generation now growing up listen to EDM
so<00:00:54.769> it's<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.979> new<00:00:55.129> phenomenon<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.089> think<00:00:56.149> a

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
so it's a new phenomenon and I think a

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.599 
so it's a new phenomenon and I think a
lot<00:00:56.359> of<00:00:56.479> the<00:00:56.569> casino<00:00:57.140> owners<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:57.890> started<00:00:58.550> to

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
lot of the casino owners and started to

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.910 
lot of the casino owners and started to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
like it or not it's the way that the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
like it or not it's the way that the
world<00:01:35.009> works<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.700> soon<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:35.969> something<00:01:36.149> gets

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
world works as soon as something gets

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.319 
world works as soon as something gets
big<00:01:37.280> more<00:01:38.280> money<00:01:38.460> gets<00:01:38.700> involved<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
big more money gets involved so

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.410 
big more money gets involved so
automatically<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.159> shift<00:01:41.159> changes<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
automatically the shift changes but I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.760 
automatically the shift changes but I
think<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.810> important<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.259> stress<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> we

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
think it's important to stress that we

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
think it's important to stress that we
