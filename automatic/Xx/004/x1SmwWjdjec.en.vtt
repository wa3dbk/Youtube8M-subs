you<00:02:37.360> go<00:02:37.480> up<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.200> more<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.470> barometer<00:02:39.010> drops

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
you go up the more the barometer drops

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.300 
you go up the more the barometer drops
now<00:02:40.720> meteorologists<00:02:41.500> folks<00:02:41.710> look<00:02:41.920> at<00:02:42.070> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
now meteorologists folks look at the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.400 
now meteorologists folks look at the
atmosphere<00:02:42.460> like<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.210> would<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.600> layer<00:02:43.990> cake

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
atmosphere like you would a layer cake

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.320 
atmosphere like you would a layer cake
there<00:02:44.680> are<00:02:44.800> several<00:02:45.130> different<00:02:45.820> layers<00:02:46.150> to

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
there are several different layers to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.630 
there are several different layers to
the<00:02:46.600> atmosphere<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.350> they<00:02:47.830> are<00:02:47.980> from<00:02:48.520> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
the atmosphere and they are from the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.210 
the atmosphere and they are from the
bottom<00:02:49.000> up<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.330> troposphere<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.530> tropopause

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
bottom up the troposphere the tropopause

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.280 
bottom up the troposphere the tropopause
that's<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.120> top<00:02:52.330> part<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.020> troposphere

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
that's the top part of the troposphere

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.970 
that's the top part of the troposphere
the<00:02:54.160> stratosphere<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.420> mesosphere<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
the stratosphere the mesosphere and the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.200 
the stratosphere the mesosphere and the
very<00:02:57.280> top<00:02:57.580> layer<00:02:57.850> there<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.960> thermosphere

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
very top layer there is the thermosphere

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.140 
very top layer there is the thermosphere
okay<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.420> atmosphere<00:03:01.960> again<00:03:02.080> here<00:03:02.590> we<00:03:02.740> go

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
okay the atmosphere again here we go

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.640 
okay the atmosphere again here we go

right<00:03:34.540> here's<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.870> big<00:03:34.960> question<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:36.190> what

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
right here's the big question so what

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.060 
right here's the big question so what
causes<00:03:36.640> weather<00:03:37.090> well<00:03:37.870> it's<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.470> simple<00:03:38.650> answer

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
causes weather well it's a simple answer

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.450 
causes weather well it's a simple answer
all<00:03:39.580> weather<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.570> caused<00:03:40.840> by<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.530> change<00:03:41.560> in

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
all weather is caused by a change in

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:50.320 
all weather is caused by a change in
temperature

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.390
