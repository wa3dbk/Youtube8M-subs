00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 ah 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.210
 we select the hair as shown 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.210
 image 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.230
 starting the cut in the back 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.720
 of the head we will continue cutting 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.070
 following the line of the neck from 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.850
 behind the ear until you reach the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.850
 center of the neck 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 this section is cut supporting the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 scissors on the nape of the neck and applying a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.940
 uniform tension the rest of the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.310
 sections that are below the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.310
 occipital bone will sound like this as a guide 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.079
 take a central section in the part 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.079
 later and start the graduation 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.290
 all sections will be taken towards 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.850
 this central section working 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.640
 around the head until you reach the 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.170
 back of the ear it is vital that 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.860
 all sections are worked with the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.860
 same elevation 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.170
 now we go to the section that comes from 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.450
 the top of the head towards the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.700
 sides we tilt all sections 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.500
 towards the crown area is 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.049
 important that all these sections be 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.519
 Tilt back to hold long 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.519
 the weight in the frontal zone 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.470
 this 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.470
 ah 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.870
 ah 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.630
 once we have completed the form 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.820
 internal comb and all sections 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.380
 behind the ears and defines the 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.380
 perimeter cleaning with scissors 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.040
 we will now work the section of 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.960
 bangs I know that hair what we 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.620
 will give a uniform tension when 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.270
 let's cut the frontal area this section will 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.270
 work using the tip of the scissors 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.210
 this line is cut with mirror effect in 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.260
 relationship to the natural contour of the eye 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.990
 when we work with these lines 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.970
 strong bangs it is important that 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.660
 let's follow this form to adapt to 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.660
 each person
