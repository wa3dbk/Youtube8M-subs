00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
the other side the road from us open

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.670 
the other side the road from us open
that<00:00:36.879> doesn't<00:00:37.269> bugger<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.809> deer<00:00:38.110> up<00:00:38.320> too<00:00:38.500> much

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
come through and then uh way out in the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.290 
come through and then uh way out in the
distance<00:03:06.620> too<00:03:07.070> far<00:03:07.280> for<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.580> camera<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.090> saw

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
distance too far for the camera we saw

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.020 
distance too far for the camera we saw
we<00:03:08.720> saw<00:03:08.750> three<00:03:09.200> don't<00:03:09.470> move<00:03:09.650> through<00:03:10.030> they

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
we saw three don't move through they

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.730 
we saw three don't move through they
they<00:03:11.390> look<00:03:11.570> like<00:03:11.720> they<00:03:11.930> doubt<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.290> headed<00:03:12.620> off

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
they look like they doubt it headed off

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
they look like they doubt it headed off
the<00:03:12.920> cornfield<00:03:14.050> but<00:03:15.050> uh<00:03:17.380> it's<00:03:18.380> still<00:03:18.620> early

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
the cornfield but uh it's still early

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.920 
the cornfield but uh it's still early
there<00:03:19.760> still<00:03:19.910> might<00:03:20.060> be<00:03:20.120> deer<00:03:20.420> moving<00:03:20.600> but<00:03:20.900> I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
there still might be deer moving but I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.260 
there still might be deer moving but I
think<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.680> think<00:03:22.280> for<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.520> most<00:03:22.670> part<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.060> deer

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
think I think for the most part the deer

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.030 
think I think for the most part the deer
gone<00:03:23.570> gone<00:03:24.020> to<00:03:24.170> bed<00:03:24.320> is<00:03:24.500> supposed<00:03:24.740> to<00:03:24.830> get<00:03:24.950> up

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
gone gone to bed is supposed to get up

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.940 
gone gone to bed is supposed to get up
to<00:03:25.130> 60<00:03:25.430> days<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.410> it's<00:03:27.410> probably<00:03:27.650> gonna<00:03:27.860> be

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
to 60 days so it's probably gonna be

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.210 
to 60 days so it's probably gonna be
pretty<00:03:28.130> slow<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.640> rest<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.060> morning

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
pretty slow the rest of the morning

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.430 
pretty slow the rest of the morning
stick<00:03:31.220> with<00:03:31.370> us
