00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.610
 it goes so high and low again 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.549
 Today 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 that's why the lego ninjago are there now 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.390
 9 and currently and since I'm fast my 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.220
 sticker album we want to have 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.520
 now again a few booster open 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.350
 third then of course four small ones 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.680
 and from where the course sure and 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.820
 can order easily if I can 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:54.420
 Of course, always under the video 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:57.900
 link and how I think 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 The wiltzer did yahoos succeeded 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 what you think about it 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:12.970
 can you like to post me like the whole 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:19.390
 sticker album finds a big prize 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:25.170
 card that I still find the best mine 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.170
 opinion pleased the criticism comes however 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:46.470
 as I said that the carbon I want 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:50.040
 Also finished and I hope that with it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.040
 finished 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:17.810
 clear clearly liked me really 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:23.090
 not so even if the big ones so far 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:28.780
 everything different no duplicate that 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 Of course, it's already extremely good 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.950
 and as I said if the motives longer 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.459
 I always wanted to enjoy a break 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:52.070
 to press 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:54.769
 you would not have to pillar two already 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.070
 again a different sparkles all 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.220
 really not a double so far 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.060
 been there 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:08.450
 Last time there were some so one 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:25.450
 some good sticker booster know gets caught 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:25.450
 so from the smaller ones see themselves 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:37.060
 already sees a few points in this way 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:53.159
 come now to the last sticker booster 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:55.239
 otherwise today the video will be too long 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.609
 Ingredients, though once again
