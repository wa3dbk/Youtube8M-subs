overcome one is you have to know what

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
overcome one is you have to know what
note<00:00:36.450> you're<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.440> where<00:00:37.560> it's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
note you're going for and where it's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.250 
note you're going for and where it's
located<00:00:37.940> many<00:00:38.940> times<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.630> positional

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
located many times we have a positional

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.960 
located many times we have a positional
understanding<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.040> our<00:00:41.160> fingerboard<00:00:41.640> meaning

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
understanding of our fingerboard meaning

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.850 
understanding of our fingerboard meaning
that<00:00:42.060> if<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.810> sea<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.380> can<00:00:43.710> guess

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that if I know this is a sea I can guess

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190 
that if I know this is a sea I can guess
that's<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.190> d<00:00:44.400> but<00:00:45.120> sometimes<00:00:45.630> if<00:00:45.810> I<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:45.990> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that's a d but sometimes if I know this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
that's a d but sometimes if I know this
to<00:00:46.380> see<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> might<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.100> know<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.310> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.880> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
to see I might not know that this is a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.210 
to see I might not know that this is a
be<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.470> don't<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.740> that<00:00:49.890> same

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
be just you know I don't have that same

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.280 
be just you know I don't have that same
relationship<00:00:50.910> initially<00:00:51.900> we<00:00:52.080> have<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
relationship initially we have to

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.310 
relationship initially we have to
develop<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:53.300> secondly<00:00:54.300> once<00:00:54.540> I<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:55.080> where

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
develop it secondly once I do know where

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.530 
develop it secondly once I do know where
my<00:00:55.470> target<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.980> sometimes<00:00:56.580> you<00:00:56.760> miss<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.150> you

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
my target is sometimes you miss it you

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.540 
my target is sometimes you miss it you
know<00:00:57.630> you<00:00:57.690> don't<00:00:58.530> go<00:00:58.740> far<00:00:59.070> enough<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.370> go<00:00:59.490> too

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
know you don't go far enough you go too

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.550 
know you don't go far enough you go too
far<00:00:59.880> you<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.150> a<00:01:00.210> buzzy<00:01:00.600> note<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.080> there's<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
far you get a buzzy note so there's a

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.780 
far you get a buzzy note so there's a
problem<00:01:01.830> with<00:01:02.010> being<00:01:02.100> clean<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.670> your

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
problem with being clean in your

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.060 
problem with being clean in your
technique<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.960> here's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> single<00:01:04.830> string

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
technique so here's a single string

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.709 
technique so here's a single string
exercise<00:01:05.489> based<00:01:05.700> off<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> hyper<00:01:06.270> next<00:01:06.570> study

slowly<00:01:44.429> or<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.969> drum<00:01:45.149> machine<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.659> worked

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
slowly or with a drum machine and worked

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
slowly or with a drum machine and worked
on<00:01:46.049> your<00:01:46.200> timing<00:01:46.469> you<00:01:47.189> would<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.460> start<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
on your timing you would also start to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
on your timing you would also start to
develop<00:01:48.179> kind<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> necessary<00:01:48.990> skills<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
develop kind of the necessary skills to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.880 
develop kind of the necessary skills to
to<00:01:50.880> cleanly<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> make<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.840> big<00:01:52.079> interval

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
to cleanly to make these big interval

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.309 
to cleanly to make these big interval
jumps<00:01:53.219> on<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.549> finger<00:01:53.880> board<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.170> this

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
jumps on your finger board I like this

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.050 
jumps on your finger board I like this
exercise<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.799> very<00:01:55.950> simple<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.579> understand

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
exercise it's very simple to understand

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.459 
exercise it's very simple to understand
it<00:01:57.390> takes<00:01:57.569> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> time<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.319> work

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
it takes a little bit of time to work

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.499 
it takes a little bit of time to work
out<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.219> start<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.729> 60<00:02:00.149> beats<00:02:00.390> per

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
out but start it like 60 beats per

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.840 
out but start it like 60 beats per
minute<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.709> can<00:02:01.860> even<00:02:01.979> play<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.579> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
minute and you can even play a to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.309 
minute and you can even play a to
sixteen<00:02:03.270> thousand<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.780> eight<00:02:03.899> know<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
sixteen thousand and eight know if you

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.419 
sixteen thousand and eight know if you
want<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.619> give<00:02:04.740> yourself<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.039> little<00:02:05.069> more<00:02:05.250> time

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
want to give yourself a little more time

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
you go one-e-and ah two-e-and one in
three<00:02:11.150> like<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.330> or<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.620> play<00:02:13.709> triplets
