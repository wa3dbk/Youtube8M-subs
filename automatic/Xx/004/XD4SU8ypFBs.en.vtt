 handsome so it's right here right now video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.810
 daily and I'm here with another 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.670
 demonstration of how one-armed I am and 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.580
 you will say why not because good 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.679
 because I'm up to the caps after 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.839
 noses of this game of all the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.539
 games as you see the first one was left 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.580
 ten casualties and I say good come on let's 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.740
 come in let's see what we can do 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.750
 our beds here the sweeps let's see 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
 if we can what will go back a bit 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.510
 get us some clip or something and the case is 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.239
 you do not know what's happening but I know that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.460
 I know it well now you will see it calm 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.070
 as you will see here I 'm almost going to do a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.800
 oil 3 what would be a led or see how 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.260
 you see me load two and those that do not 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.120
 almost almost almost but hey, I'm out here 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 the streak of 5 and with this of 6 and I come 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.360
 that I already have the harriers that this is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.050
 a comeback that I put the first in 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.660
 zero eat that name the truth 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.200
 the end of this story is a little 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.239
 I know as tragic as starting 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.250
 you are in this channel a few 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.400
 you will find because I already know the bad 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.710
 that I am and the case is that every time 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.970
 it costs more and suddenly it comes like this 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.960
 They take out the harriers and they have the illusion 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.020
 of being able to do some power 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.850
 take something out and suddenly you see that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.430
 starts to get better because they start 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.649
 the good support the support of the harris 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.170
 sorry they start to kill but just 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.539
 look down on the casualties that carry the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.430
 otherwise there are two casualties left to win 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.619
 the game will get back 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.539
 I'll get good now you'll see 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.300
 The fact is that I already have here the 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.119
 I support good without losing more time not 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.440
 I look at what the opposite 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.440
 directly we go for them to 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.660
 try to get that 30 to 0 would be 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.190
 or whatever the case is, I was wearing 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.860
 the nuclear put as gusts as 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.810
 you could see wearing the harriers 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.640
 the support and what I lacked was the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.110
 announced because higher no then no 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.870
 you can have nothing more 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.480
 I could get on but I think it's good 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.890
 a waste of time 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.590
 the fact is that I was there with my 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.850
 support I say come down that is already 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.490
 I do not have to take out 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.330
 I started to see that I ended up a lot 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.580
 I literally say good you will see when 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.890
 I have 19 that I have 19 that I can take 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.540
 have to give five that are left four me 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 nothing remains, I have nothing left 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.430
 this nuclear island is going to arrive 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.250
 cooking's Cooking have it and 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.440
 I'm uploading you too 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.270
 What will change a little 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.120
 history we're not going to let you be 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.800
 part already say I'm dislike more 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.600
 annoyed or car of this story I do not 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.070
 I liked I do not know how good this story is 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.950
 is another different and that I told you the other 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.860
 Good day, he had just a run of 24 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.130
 here and good was that it happened that happened 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.140
 now 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.050
 right here I went out and they started me 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.840
 shoot and good management most 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.450
 of the consellers to a low but what 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.590
 happened what happened what happened just right 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.790
 I was there old and nothing killed me 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.740
 could have been two nuclear one 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.690
 departure because then later lift 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.190
 immense than another nuclear but it was not like that 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.610
 the fact is that we return with our 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.710
 story and what happened that I wear a 24 0 a 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.260
 24 out of 0 and the game was just over 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.030
 winning another as you can see 24 0 me 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.000
 there was one for the nuclear with the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.710
 Jimmy and climbing and nothing has been this 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.230
 everything you hope that I hope that 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.180
 you understand what I banked that I am the good thing 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.420
 what are the others and until next time 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.420
 bye
