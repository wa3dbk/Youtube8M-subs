00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.680
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.540
 tutorial from me on mission eufor now 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 is this about how to make 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.210
 graphics card so improved that is in 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.900
 so there are no fps break-ins 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.090
 For example, laptops now give the fps 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
 have burglaries and I want you one 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.660
 Couple the three four tips show like you 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.119
 that can improve and I show it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.750
 not difficult 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.040
 he needed an additional program 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 actually it is easy 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.570
 yes and we'll catch her soon 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 makes a right click on system 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.379
 in how the system control of this gate 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.120
 just for people the nvidia graphics cards 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.640
 to have 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.399
 the good thing is i guess amd is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 it is so similar as to be surely 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.230
 Never program so much else 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.550
 So if then then I would have to stop 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.629
 here you have windows 8 you have 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.000
 probably in the 7th 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.150
 The most common is just going on 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.280
 Control panel then in video and then 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.439
 in the video control panel then I have 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.439
 it is a window that means either system 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.000
 show and there you can just as individual 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.860
 select things and yes now I show 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.630
 you guys my duckling I use 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.689
 So here everything is set back 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.659
 on normal standard and he shows steadily 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.909
 he has a preference for my favorite 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.170
 attitudes and states that it is from 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:39.570
 quality on performance that should be 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.829
 bring that one more sword so the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.329
 focus lays more on the performance 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:50.250
 instead of quality 7 and me 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.320
 It's bloody, too 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.290
 press on take over then it takes 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 second because that must learn then goes 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.520
 yes to 3d settings manage 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.979
 that's how global it is with me 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.259
 attitude and here you go on nvidia 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.360
 use high performance processor because 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.710
 that is the automatic selection and the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.179
 is by no means as good as that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.060
 high performance processor 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.540
 then you go on it goes on 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.830
 also adopt 3d settings 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.650
 then behave we come again and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.450
 now goes the physics configuration 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.090
 establish 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.670
 and here you see what already 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.519
 graphics card has the gtx the geforce gt 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.260
 750 m 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.099
 and yes I play on a laptop so 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.430
 I have a laptop and pc in any case 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.900
 you do not use the automatic 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.239
 because they will be back on 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.120
 the tv or an automatic 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.290
 choice and you are very clear 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 to be sure on the geforce gt 750 m 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.489
 and goes on to assume that lasts 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.409
 even a piece thinker and now you can 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.319
 you are sure your game will be 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.090
 less fps or collapses 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.769
 There was no such thing at all with me 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.800
 a problem games I have crysis 2 though 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.860
 set to 14 with full graphics 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.050
 and everything without fps salmon and stuff 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.420
 but played this game 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.110
 this game has already prepared me 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.540
 because it did not work that way 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.250
 11 15 fps has you and that could not 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.290
 go on like this 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.080
 and I thought so yes knew 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.730
 what are you looking at and what are you thinking? 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.190
 then stop here in the video system 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.549
 trouble've got therefore already tried and 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.290
 yes then it worked too 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.849
 even a few fans better too 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.269
 the 3d screen goes on 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.470
 manage the program setting and 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.450
 this is your first here 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.580
 be installed program on top and 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.440
 then all one after I say 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.590
 The windows have been recognized here 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.650
 yes, it was found on the pc 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.299
 so and you can do it in standard 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.620
 you can restore some 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.689
 Add now we are looking for 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.830
 a game or a program that could 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.439
 also a program does not have to be yes 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.890
 be absolutely what I add 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.720
 want to go on it now 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.880
 and now just pick up the fast 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.900
 cube he will have a good cheer 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.510
 louder and then open here 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.940
 that's it ipl the elder scrolls 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.180
 first had but where they stop like here 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.510
 from son with you then stand here 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.040
 again the global one piece for how 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.890
 Use the high performance processor 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.450
 but you only go in like that 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.820
 high performance processor use the 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.270
 means the city ​​takes over the course 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.250
 first of all, a video artist is coming in 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.919
 on this and if you have one now 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.660
 right-click on it 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.520
 okay then it's not on everyone 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.540
 if it is open now 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.370
 should open it with the 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:05.730
 attitudes just a business 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:09.320
 he was that it was executed here 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.880
 is it what this rausw? 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.820
 that 's basically why you were 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.770
 No extra program needs cooking and that 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.360
 it was already hope it has 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.729
 helped you if such helped 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.530
 I hope for a positive rating 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.250
 when I write in the comments 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.120
 what could I improve and yes 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.140
 until next time 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.140
 Thank you very much for your mission
