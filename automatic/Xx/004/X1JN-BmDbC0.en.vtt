bionic<00:00:06.049> it<00:00:07.049> has<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.560> qhd<00:00:08.340> screen<00:00:08.450> just<00:00:09.450> like<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
bionic it has a qhd screen just like the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.099 
bionic it has a qhd screen just like the
atrix<00:00:11.900> it<00:00:12.900> also<00:00:13.019> has<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> dual<00:00:13.590> core<00:00:13.769> processor

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
atrix it also has a dual core processor

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:23.470 
atrix it also has a dual core processor
just<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.320> HX<00:00:16.619> as<00:00:16.770> well<00:00:18.140> stress<00:00:19.140> out

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.109 

I<00:00:23.539> can<00:00:24.109> tell<00:00:24.230> right<00:00:24.289> after<00:00:24.680> that<00:00:24.859> is<00:00:25.189> a<00:00:25.789> lot

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
I can tell right after that is a lot

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.990 
I can tell right after that is a lot
more<00:00:26.150> responsive<00:00:26.779> than<00:00:26.810> matrix<00:00:27.410> I<00:00:27.820> like<00:00:28.820> the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
more responsive than matrix I like the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.060 
more responsive than matrix I like the
design<00:00:29.619> it's<00:00:31.239> definitely<00:00:32.239> a<00:00:32.300> little<00:00:32.480> bit

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
design it's definitely a little bit

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.950 
design it's definitely a little bit
bulkier<00:00:34.070> than<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:34.309> thought<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.820> would<00:00:34.910> be<00:00:35.150> but<00:00:35.660> I

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
bulkier than I thought it would be but I

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.700 
bulkier than I thought it would be but I
do<00:00:36.170> like<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.500> way<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:36.949> laid<00:00:37.760> out

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.069 

see<00:00:41.219> some<00:00:41.460> widgets

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.399 

it's<00:00:46.620> still<00:00:46.859> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.159> choppy<00:00:48.170> but<00:00:49.170> still

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
it's still a little choppy but still

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.740 
it's still a little choppy but still
better<00:00:49.559> than<00:00:49.710> matrix<00:00:50.420> even<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> dual

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
better than matrix even with the dual

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.509 
better than matrix even with the dual
core<00:00:51.929> processor<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.890> sure<00:00:53.039> how<00:00:53.280> well

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
core processor I'm not sure how well

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:07.040 
core processor I'm not sure how well
it's<00:00:53.670> gonna<00:00:54.019> do

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.400 

I<00:01:07.440> like<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.800> screen<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.450> qhd<00:01:09.990> screen<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
I like the screen and the qhd screen is

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:23.850 
I like the screen and the qhd screen is
really<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.070> nice

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.220 

compared<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.670> iphone

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
compared to the iphone

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.000 
compared to the iphone
it's<00:01:26.470> not<00:01:26.710> quite<00:01:27.010> there<00:01:27.310> yet<00:01:27.340> but<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:29.320> make<00:01:29.470> a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
it's not quite there yet but we make a

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.200 
it's not quite there yet but we make a
run<00:01:30.190> from<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.520> base

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
run from the base

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.660 
run from the base
for<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.540> sponsors

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
for the sponsors

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.630 
for the sponsors
it's<00:01:34.240> pretty<00:01:34.630> decent<00:01:34.930> this<00:01:35.860> probably<00:01:36.159> closest

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
it's pretty decent this probably closest
