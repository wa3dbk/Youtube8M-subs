00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
nails and make sure that you know I've

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.209 
nails and make sure that you know I've
measured<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:40.290> ones<00:00:40.500> look<00:00:40.680> best<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.070> my

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
measured out which ones look best on my

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.030 
measured out which ones look best on my
nail<00:00:41.430> which<00:00:42.090> fit<00:00:42.480> my<00:00:42.690> nail<00:00:42.930> bed<00:00:43.170> properly<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
nail which fit my nail bed properly and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.490 
nail which fit my nail bed properly and
so<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:45.000> find<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.930> doing<00:00:46.350> this

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so I find that just kind of doing this

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200 
so I find that just kind of doing this
and<00:00:46.770> laying<00:00:47.070> them<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:48.090> really

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and laying them all out really really

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.630 
and laying them all out really really
benefits<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.320> process<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.070> find

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
benefits you in this process I find

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.939 
benefits you in this process I find
sometimes<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:52.110> finger<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.680> hand

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
sometimes like one finger on one hand

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.560 
sometimes like one finger on one hand
will<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.190> bigger<00:00:53.760> than<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> other<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.420> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
will be bigger than the other if that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.729 
will be bigger than the other if that
makes<00:00:54.750> sense<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> nail<00:00:55.320> bed<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.620> it's

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
makes sense like the nail bed so it's

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.080 
makes sense like the nail bed so it's
really<00:00:55.860> good<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.280> make<00:00:56.760> sure<00:00:56.910> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
really good to like make sure you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.520 
really good to like make sure you
measure<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.930> make<00:00:58.140> sure<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.410> you're

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
measure and like make sure that you're

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
measure and like make sure that you're
getting<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:58.980> nice<00:00:59.309> fit<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> nails

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
getting a really nice fit with the nails

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.720 
getting a really nice fit with the nails
because<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.590> want<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.980> look<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> look<00:01:02.579> as

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
because you want this look to look as

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
because you want this look to look as
natural<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.180> possible<00:01:03.270> obviously<00:01:04.110> these<00:01:04.229> are

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
natural as possible obviously these are

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.870 
natural as possible obviously these are
fake<00:01:04.769> glue<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.159> nails<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.760> going

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
fake glue or nails and they're not going

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
fake glue or nails and they're not going
to<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.060> perfect<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> want

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to be perfect but they are going to want

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
to be perfect but they are going to want
to<00:01:08.130> look<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.490> natural<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:09.030> possible<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to look as natural as possible and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450 
to look as natural as possible and
that's<00:01:10.049> partially<00:01:10.380> why<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.680> chose<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> short

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that's partially why I chose the short

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.310 
that's partially why I chose the short
ones<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.850> personally<00:01:12.750> think<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.049> look<00:01:13.200> better

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
ones I personally think they look better

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.840 
ones I personally think they look better
on<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.710> fingers<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.820> a

your nails you're going to be creating a
surface<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.250> little<00:01:38.820> bit<00:01:39.000> less<00:01:39.290> smooth

than<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.619> typical<00:01:40.740> nail<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
than your typical nail it's not going to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730 
than your typical nail it's not going to
damage<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.540> nail<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.020> any<00:01:43.229> way<00:01:43.409> shape<00:01:43.590> or

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
form but what it's going to do is it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
form but what it's going to do is it's
going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> cause<00:01:45.420> kind<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> little<00:01:46.350> bit<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
going to cause kind of a little bit of a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
going to cause kind of a little bit of a
rougher<00:01:47.130> surface<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> really

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
rougher surface but it's going to really

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.679 
rougher surface but it's going to really
benefit<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.520> when<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> glue<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.299> nails<00:01:51.450> on

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
benefit you when you glue your nails on

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.969 
benefit you when you glue your nails on
because<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.960> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.170> gives<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.500> nails<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
because it kind of gives your nails a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
because it kind of gives your nails a
little<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:53.700> grip<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> makes<00:01:54.450> sense<00:01:54.570> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
little more grip if that makes sense so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.889 
little more grip if that makes sense so

coats on and you make it thick enough
it's<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.110> last<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.190> way<00:02:11.370> better<00:02:11.610> you

can also kind of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.620 
can also kind of
at<00:02:13.160> your<00:02:13.580> nail<00:02:13.760> better<00:02:14.000> than<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.300> would<00:02:14.450> with

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
at your nail better than you would with

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.840

there's like a little bit of a plastic

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.600 
there's like a little bit of a plastic
edge<00:04:02.300> on<00:04:02.750> them<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.320> that's<00:04:03.830> about<00:04:04.220> it

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
edge on them but that's about it
