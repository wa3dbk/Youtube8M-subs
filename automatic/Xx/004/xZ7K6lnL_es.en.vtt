00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 Moscow metro is truly unique 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.000
 place is practically the underworld in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.439
 the very center of our vast country is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.599
 not only the fastest view 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.609
 transport metropolitan metropolis but 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.000
 it is here that the terrorist happen 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.309
 acts 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.989
 killing dozens of people is 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.510
 The main meeting place for Muscovites and guests 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.430
 the capital only in the subway can go down 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.350
 a man without schooling and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 come out a happy diploma holder 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.100
 prestigious university 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.079
 but also itâ€™s a huge counter 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.690
 nuclear bunker capable case 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.940
 total pin up to cover tens of thousands 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.219
 people and so much around it goes 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.350
 rumors of secret contact points 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.329
 about mutants living somewhere in the depths 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.530
 from secret government lines 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.090
 stretching almost to Siberia is not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.189
 it is surprising that such a fertile 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.680
 writer dmitry glukhovsky 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.420
 successfully created his imperishable 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.180
 metro 2033 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 It all began in 2002 with a small 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.320
 pages on the internet where dmitry 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.549
 laid out the chapters of his novel supplying 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.770
 their music tracks 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.290
 to create the right mood so to speak 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.119
 people liked the story so much 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 that after some time by the publishing house 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 ekmo he was released a full-fledged novel about 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 artistic merits of metro 2033 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.979
 can argue 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.960
 but the fact is that Glukhovsky managed 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.540
 recreate the awesome atmosphere of Moscow 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.979
 survived a nuclear apocalypse of his 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.380
 novel habitual Moscow metro 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.780
 appeared in a terrible light where on different 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.670
 stations huddle a handful of survivors 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.360
 trying to survive in hostile 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.909
 filled with deadly dangers 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.060
 a world where the world will never be 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.649
 the sun 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.840
 the surface doesn't exit without a gas mask and 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:00.990
 rifles and every day can easily 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:05.280
 become the last I was born in Moscow 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.280
 but I don't remember anything about those times 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:12.060
 when old scattered in the flame 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.410
 atomic fire 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.480
 I was still quite small before 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.910
 ukrainian history developers games 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.190
 There was a difficult task to transfer very 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.050
 atmospheric novels virtual rails yes 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.700
 also retell it as part of the stock 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.590
 first-person shooter 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.880
 of course they already had time to fill my hand 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.220
 having worked on the great and terrible 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.319
 stalker but still not a problem 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.510
 light now it does not matter what was 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.310
 the reason for the success of talent developers 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.800
 money is not sensible advice western 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.390
 the publisher, but the fact is that for and games 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.190
 something great happened 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.350
 there is a dense atmosphere and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.810
 fascinating story but above all 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.610
 this fascinating game is not some 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.110
 niche product for their 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.450
 modern beautiful 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.670
 in some places a terrible action that puts 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.700
 on both blades there are all kinds of shooting ranges and content 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.700
 and 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.020
 larin price 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.020
 herself 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.610
 the plot as a whole repeats the novel however 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.560
 many scene developers are pretty 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.390
 expanded by turning them full 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.849
 level some events and characters 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.409
 were ruthlessly cut especially 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.329
 zealous admirers of works 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.230
 Glukhovsky have every right to furious 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.480
 sputter 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.159
 but for ordinary players everything is done as 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.159
 you need to keep up the pace 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.180
 The disposition is clear the main character Artem 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.069
 living at the station 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.900
 by the will of fate forced to go to 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.610
 long journey on the Moscow metro 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.739
 to get to the pole 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.750
 it is at this station that is rumored 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.480
 fighters able to cope with the new 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.489
 an affliction called black threats from 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.900
 these creatures terrible and deal with them 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.269
 nobody seems 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.459
 take off the hat to the developers want 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.769
 already at the very beginning of the game when you take under 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.600
 control artema looking around in amazement 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.410
 the parties understand that far from 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.479
 each rbg 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.880
 not to mention the shooter developers 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.070
 show such attention to detail here 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.260
 wall close room artem completed 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.360
 and postcards from the past gone forever 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.139
 life here is littered with some papers 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.540
 table and next door the subway book 2033 elegant 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.000
 PR move on like in a kaleidoscope 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.130
 gun market dirty hospital quiet 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.740
 guitar songs distant cry of a child 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.210
 atmosphere of total hopelessness 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.430
 covers with his head and already seems in 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.639
 reality you smell the smell of gunpowder dirty 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.850
 boots and unwashed bodies are torn people reduce from 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.530
 Could not mind and died 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.530
 get to get 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:04.610
 does not come out of no do not be gone 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.259
 touch me the game does not offer 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.689
 open world as the creators conceived 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.909
 initially but each level worked 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.800
 enviable attention to detail when after 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.629
 first fierce battle you find yourself in 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.819
 bowels of the subway shower heels goes 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.319
 regularly to achieve this effect 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.989
 developers use all means 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.119
 light little ammo worth its weight in gold 

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:24.860
 open attack really unexpectedly 

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:26.989
 often when the next monster 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.249
 I want to shout for obscenities and release all 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:30.249
 clip if only he died quickly 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.390
 we do almost every level 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.580
 imprinted in the brain firmly from 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:05.400
 jogging with bourbon on the surface of the mouse 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:07.080
 across the abyss and red skirmishes here 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.150
 unforgettable trip with khan 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.190
 abandoned metro lines where the scene with 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.310
 the speeding ghost of a train plunges 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.310
 in shock 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.780
 the game is relatively small on 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.780
 the passage goes away
