 practiced for two and a half hours 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.650

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.689
 this is exactly the supporting workout in 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.220
 business trips for flights in those cases 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.689
 when there are guns when not 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.499
 opportunities to continue full 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.839
 training in the gym 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.069

 keep you just even psychologically 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:41.899
 because it is no secret that everyone who

 playing sports he rocks two or three 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.350
 day without training the person begins 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.139
 depression seems to him that everything is gone 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.600
 that the results go away 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:52.600
 took well took went 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.519
 gym classes these 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.500
 exercises will not replace them, but they are quite 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.839
 enough for people who just 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.030
 want to be in shape 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.280
 I went to the weather in the gym 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 I was like I was tired then I 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.009
 went out with the guys on the street started 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.360
 physique my physical form and me 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.159
 everything developed was born on the street not 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.659

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.810
 frame for keeping fit 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.700
 sufficient yard area took back 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.009
 perfectly smooth billed noise is not a dumbbell well 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.470
 so I will pour out and elbow well wonder sit 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.380
 perfectly smooth shred this miracle and went 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.170
 down to a little finger and omit Well 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.080
 twisted with his fingers killed and at the top point 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.299
 stayed last year across odessa 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.190
 there are dozens of new playgrounds 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.770

 sports infrastructure Sergey baduk 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.299

 Deputy Igor Markov I really hope that 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.250
 Igor will help have Igor Markov and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.200
 turned to him with a request and he promised 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 help he promised to build a site 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 highlight announcing not the most important thing 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.929
 punch resolution meaning is not to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.459
 just put a couple near the house 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.530
 horizontal bars it's about creating 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.660
 high-grade sports ground under 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.819

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.720
 for a million city of course a little but 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.090
 Sergey Badiuk sure this can be 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 a good example of a culture should be 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.510
 available to everyone if in every district 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.730
 there will be at least one good 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.739
 sports ground youth do not have to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.390
