partner so we have the VA in place and
the<00:01:24.619> monitor<00:01:25.009> on<00:01:27.940> with<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.000> fast<00:01:29.240> patches<00:01:29.750> and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
the monitor on with the fast patches and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.650 
the monitor on with the fast patches and
what<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.130> see<00:01:31.400> on<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.580> monitor<00:01:31.759> is<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.300> wide

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
what I see on the monitor is a wide

complex tachycardia

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.999 
complex tachycardia
following<00:01:34.790> that<00:01:34.940> v-tach<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:36.590> have<00:01:36.800> no

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
following that v-tach and I have no

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.280 
following that v-tach and I have no
pulse<00:01:37.280> with<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.360> I'm<00:01:38.450> gonna<00:01:38.570> treat<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:38.930> as

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
pulse with this so I'm gonna treat it as

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.609 
pulse with this so I'm gonna treat it as
V<00:01:39.830> fib<00:01:40.100> or<00:01:40.369> false<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.789> decent<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.110> when<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.410> then

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
V fib or false is decent so when I then

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.029 
V fib or false is decent so when I then
charge<00:01:42.979> my<00:01:43.190> monitor<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.560> lowest<00:01:45.950> energy

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
charge my monitor to the lowest energy

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.590 
charge my monitor to the lowest energy

I<00:01:57.410> still<00:01:57.770> have<00:01:57.950> v-tach<00:01:58.369> on<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.610> monitor

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.669 

thank<00:02:01.300> professions<00:02:02.300> have<00:02:02.390> started<00:02:02.720> again<00:02:02.810> I

use 40 units of vasopressin IV and then

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.650 
use 40 units of vasopressin IV and then
follow<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.170> up<00:02:15.290> with<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.500> 10<00:02:15.740> cc<00:02:16.100> flush<00:02:16.660> I'm

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
follow that up with a 10 cc flush I'm

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.630 
follow that up with a 10 cc flush I'm
going<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.990> defibrillate<00:02:18.500> my<00:02:18.650> patient<00:02:19.100> every

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
going to defibrillate my patient every

going to defibrillate my patient every
basically<00:02:20.270> every<00:02:20.390> clause<00:02:20.630> check<00:02:20.930> does<00:02:21.080> every

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
basically every clause check does every
