iron is due to two factors the reason is

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.740 
iron is due to two factors the reason is

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
earth and also the extreme temperatures

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.929 
earth and also the extreme temperatures
they<00:02:56.370> haven't<00:02:56.700> been<00:02:56.760> able<00:02:56.909> to<00:02:57.709> make<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.919> tool<00:02:59.400> to

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
they haven't been able to make a tool to

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.629 
they haven't been able to make a tool to
be<00:03:00.120> able<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.540> sustain<00:03:01.049> those<00:03:01.500> temperatures

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.229 

lastly<00:03:05.639> is<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:07.079> inner<00:03:07.319> core<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:08.519> inner<00:03:08.790> core

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
lastly is the inner core the inner core

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.839 
lastly is the inner core the inner core
is<00:03:09.439> represented<00:03:10.439> by<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.650> seeds<00:03:11.099> here<00:03:11.549> in<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
is represented by the seeds here in the

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.920 
is represented by the seeds here in the
Apple<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:15.299> air<00:03:15.569> core<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.500> even<00:03:17.370> hotter<00:03:18.060> than

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
Apple the air core is even hotter than

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.819 
Apple the air core is even hotter than
the<00:03:19.169> outer<00:03:19.349> core<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:21.090> inner<00:03:21.449> core<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.290> made

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
the outer core the inner core is made

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.149 
the outer core the inner core is made
out<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.040> solid<00:03:23.639> nickel<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.780> iron<00:03:25.129> take<00:03:26.129> a

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
out of solid nickel and iron take a

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.179 
out of solid nickel and iron take a
second<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.849> think<00:03:27.449> about<00:03:27.629> why<00:03:28.379> might<00:03:28.829> the

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
second and think about why might the

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.809 
second and think about why might the
inner<00:03:29.400> core<00:03:29.939> be<00:03:30.510> made<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.959> solid<00:03:31.769> nickel<00:03:32.699> and

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
inner core be made of solid nickel and

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.439 
inner core be made of solid nickel and
iron<00:03:35.689> the<00:03:36.689> reason<00:03:37.199> is<00:03:37.349> is<00:03:37.650> because<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:39.329> the

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
iron the reason is is because of the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.949 
iron the reason is is because of the
pressure<00:03:39.810> pushing<00:03:40.680> down<00:03:40.979> on<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:42.329> inner<00:03:42.509> core

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
pressure pushing down on the inner core

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.469 
pressure pushing down on the inner core
there's<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.919> much<00:03:44.129> pressure<00:03:44.489> being<00:03:45.060> pushed

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
there's so much pressure being pushed

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:51.080 
there's so much pressure being pushed
down<00:03:45.629> then<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.709> turns<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.669> be<00:03:47.790> solid<00:03:50.090> okay

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
down then it turns it to be solid okay

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.159 
down then it turns it to be solid okay
let's<00:03:51.689> recap<00:03:52.459> there<00:03:53.459> are<00:03:53.639> four<00:03:54.389> layers<00:03:54.750> of

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
let's recap there are four layers of

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.939 
let's recap there are four layers of
earth<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.479> outermost<00:03:57.479> layer<00:03:58.019> is<00:03:59.120> the<00:04:00.120> crust

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
earth the outermost layer is the crust

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.140 
earth the outermost layer is the crust
the<00:04:01.949> next<00:04:02.340> layer<00:04:02.639> is<00:04:02.909> the<00:04:03.290> mantle<00:04:04.699> the<00:04:05.699> next

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
the next layer is the mantle the next

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.699 
the next layer is the mantle the next
layer<00:04:06.449> is<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.840> outer<00:04:07.739> core<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:09.319> innermost<00:04:10.319> is

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
layer is the outer core and innermost is

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.110 
layer is the outer core and innermost is
the<00:04:11.459> inner<00:04:11.699> core<00:04:12.620> something<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.769> remember<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
the inner core something to remember the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.810 
the inner core something to remember the
deeper<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.930> go<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:17.070> hotter<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.579> gets<00:04:19.370> as<00:04:20.370> you

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
deeper you go the hotter it gets as you

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.149 
deeper you go the hotter it gets as you
eat<00:04:20.969> your<00:04:21.180> Apple<00:04:21.599> think<00:04:22.109> about<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.770> different

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
eat your Apple think about the different

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.040 
eat your Apple think about the different
layers

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
layers

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.770 
layers
the<00:04:25.169> characteristics<00:04:25.949> about<00:04:26.099> each<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.780> think

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
the characteristics about each and think

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.389 
the characteristics about each and think
about<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.440> facts<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:28.949> just<00:04:29.160> learned<00:04:29.389> enjoy
