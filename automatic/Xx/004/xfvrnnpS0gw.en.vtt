Audi<00:01:41.080> TT<00:01:41.650> allroad<00:01:42.130> concept<00:01:42.790> we<00:01:43.210> knew<00:01:43.330> out<00:01:43.510> he

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
Audi TT allroad concept we knew out he

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.870 
Audi TT allroad concept we knew out he
was<00:01:43.810> they<00:01:44.290> were<00:01:44.409> considering<00:01:45.040> other<00:01:45.280> versions

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
was they were considering other versions

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.340 
was they were considering other versions
of<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.120> model<00:01:46.300> but<00:01:46.600> we<00:01:46.720> didn't<00:01:46.900> really<00:01:47.050> know

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
of the model but we didn't really know

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.920 
of the model but we didn't really know
what<00:01:48.190> those<00:01:48.430> other<00:01:48.460> versions<00:01:49.150> would<00:01:49.300> be<00:01:49.540> but

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
what those other versions would be but

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.440 
what those other versions would be but
now<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:51.220> looking<00:01:51.370> like<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.820> best<00:01:52.000> chance<00:01:52.300> of

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
now it's looking like the best chance of

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.800 
now it's looking like the best chance of
another<00:01:52.630> variant<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.440> compact<00:01:54.010> sedan

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
another variant is a compact sedan

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.870 
another variant is a compact sedan
apparently<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.229> sedan<00:01:56.560> would<00:01:56.740> battle<00:01:57.220> the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
apparently the sedan would battle the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.460 
apparently the sedan would battle the
