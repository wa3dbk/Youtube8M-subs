 he left and got only use even with a 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.090
 then you have to put the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.370
 Government has majority but does not need 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.500
 show in the area and eusebio scheid usually 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.410

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.580
 to express in the morning is that he only had the

 magic had magically willingly see 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.230

 that's never seen anything 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.340
 something is way ahead of me 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:59.480
 You know more or less what to expect. 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:02.329
 not be someone with the participation of the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.820
 beats and the joker and lex the corinthians 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.320

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.650
 Descends from Journeys History 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:17.480

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.320
 Trust me, this is the best of me. 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.870
 that give so much expectation of this film 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.850
 business and extensive and much more 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.400

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:40.670
 I agree with you but I have in the middle 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:42.380
 You know, I know the story and I 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.810
 I think it's going to be something like 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.970
 what you have is what type 'oh come on and 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.070
 believe in someone and a challenge to 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.170
 To decide that she loved, she just had a good time. 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.010
 is to be able to keep so many 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.140
 characters is a focus a weight of each 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.840
 distributed because the bank does not get 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.489

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.870
