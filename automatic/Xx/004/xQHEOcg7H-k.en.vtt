 Hello, the next parcel arrived in 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.500
 this time came three packages and they all 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.719
 no track numbers so 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.340
 what they have you really do not know but in 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.360
 principle guess because these 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.430
 parcels on the idea 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.500
 ordered through an intermediary therefore 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.590
 Meyhana in any case, to shoot 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.910
 the man saw them coming 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.590
 look at the seller the goods are written here 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.380
 Kraft hunts of some 8 baxter rated on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 really here before the clock the clock the clock the clock 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.829
 Cheap watches by the way in my cost 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 was either two or three dollars a reference 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.320
 will be in the description well look look 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.110
 by the way fun better than they were 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.300
 previous te green black strap 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:57.809
 here already so here some jamb 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 I see if you will see here here 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:06.090
 some kind of cant dan there are small but in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.790
 In principle, the watches themselves also go without 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.260
 stubs without anything without any extra 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.090
 buttons 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.010
 strap by the way done by the way so 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.970
 cool looks like a thick skin 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.659
 cool color can look stitched 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.270
 too, and the holes do not pierce everywhere and with one 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.509
 and on the other hand everything is here too 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.360
 well done so i will teach pleasant and color 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.729
 watch case such a matte does not shine 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.110
 nothing matra cool looks real 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.270
 cool double buckle 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.409
 for 3 bucks in principle can even 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.509
 interesting watch 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.570
 here it is even written juice juices who what 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.030
 Juices prefer here so immediately on 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.549
 the dial already has a date or how it is 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.189
 called which date immediately shows 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.340
 month and simple what dial 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.079
 quite dark seems to me not much qt 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 find a bright but there you have it 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.520
 strap though too little with a braid 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.310
 here it is a little sloppy stitched well 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.649
 for 3 bucks count for something 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.530
 good quality i think is not worth it here 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.190
 this one too 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.610
 extra strap somehow 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.010
 trimmed rivet incomprehensible crooked 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.870
 Well, $ 3 such for such a clock and so 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.550
 they look pretty solid in principle 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.220
 for three three bucks 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.260
 too indulge with ok next 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.790
 the package we have is the cheapest bumper 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.200
 bumper by the way the seller 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:38.730
 here even the seller put a gift 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.860
 See the strazik plug in the phone at 35 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.710
 magic paste to prevent dirt 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.540
 when there are no headphones 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.880
 principle 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.480
 a trifle is nice and the bumper is packed in 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.390
 pimple 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.260
 You know such a difficult puzyrka 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:00.150

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.920

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.770

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.580
 know it seems like soft touch nice on 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.120
 the touch is very nice and plastic but bending 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.310
 I will not because they are mine 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.260
 the dollar in my cost may even less 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.210
 the piece will be on the seller we are under the video 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.190
 You can not move a lot of all sorts 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.350
 covers and all for a penny 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.660
 sold at no extra charge 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.610
 track numbers so cheap case goes 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.830
 under two for one dollar for 3 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.990
 Dollars can be book covers to take as 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.300
 on the cheap 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.520

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.040
 the dollar in my covers is strange 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.040

 Lopatnik probably 5 5 to most likely 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.730
 5 5 because straight almost-fits 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.400

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.630
 they are also soft-touch in theory 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.570
 it will be nice to the touch but only 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.390
