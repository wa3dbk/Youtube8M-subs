my<00:06:37.770> dad's<00:06:38.190> putting<00:06:38.760> it<00:06:38.940> the<00:06:39.180> screw<00:06:39.750> in<00:06:40.080> and

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
my dad's putting it the screw in and

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.200 
my dad's putting it the screw in and
then<00:06:40.800> of<00:06:40.920> course<00:06:41.190> you<00:06:41.370> need<00:06:41.550> to<00:06:41.760> put<00:06:42.030> the

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
then of course you need to put the

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.180 
then of course you need to put the
washer<00:06:42.660> in<00:06:42.840> so<00:06:43.140> it<00:06:43.290> doesn't<00:06:43.320> scratch<00:06:43.830> up<00:06:44.040> the

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
washer in so it doesn't scratch up the

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.070 
washer in so it doesn't scratch up the
toilet<00:06:44.610> seat<00:06:44.820> you're<00:06:45.330> gonna<00:06:45.480> have<00:06:45.630> to<00:06:45.750> do<00:06:45.900> that

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
put it through both of the holes I guess

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.040

you<00:06:47.910> could<00:06:48.030> say<00:06:48.210> then<00:06:48.450> you<00:06:48.540> put<00:06:48.750> it<00:06:48.840> in<00:06:48.900> the

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
you could say then you put it in the

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.110 
you could say then you put it in the
hole<00:06:49.230> through<00:06:49.440> the<00:06:49.560> toilet<00:06:49.830> and<00:06:50.280> then<00:06:50.910> you're

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
hole through the toilet and then you're
