00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
really struck me you know history is

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.860 
really struck me you know history is
always<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> guide<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.180> present<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
always a guide to the present for that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.450 
always a guide to the present for that
exact<00:00:55.230> reason<00:00:55.289> human<00:00:55.829> nature<00:00:56.070> doesn't<00:00:56.250> really

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
exact reason human nature doesn't really

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.150 
exact reason human nature doesn't really
change<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.020> sometimes<00:00:58.410> jokingly<00:00:58.710> say

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
change and as I sometimes jokingly say

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.950 
change and as I sometimes jokingly say
yeah<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.640> sort<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.910> sopranos<00:01:00.510> type

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
yeah there was sort of a sopranos type

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.680 
yeah there was sort of a sopranos type
of<00:01:01.199> family<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.609> sort<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> ruling<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
of family that was sort of ruling the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
of family that was sort of ruling the
temple<00:01:04.080> ruling<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> priesthood<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.280> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
temple ruling the priesthood at that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.980 
temple ruling the priesthood at that
time<00:01:05.670> kya<00:01:06.540> fussing<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.400> his<00:01:08.400> family<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
time kya fussing and his family and and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.390 
time kya fussing and his family and and
it<00:01:10.140> sounds<00:01:10.439> very<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.770> what's<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.250> on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it sounds very much like what's going on

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.950 
it sounds very much like what's going on
in<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> news<00:01:11.729> today<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
in the news today so I think that's the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
in the news today so I think that's the
benefit<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.380> studying<00:01:13.710> these<00:01:13.890> things<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
benefit of studying these things and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
benefit of studying these things and
paying<00:01:14.729> attention<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> past

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
paying attention to the past

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.179 
paying attention to the past
particularly<00:01:15.869> biblical<00:01:16.470> history<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.040> like

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
particularly biblical history it's like

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.289 
particularly biblical history it's like
I<00:01:17.310> think<00:01:17.490> he<00:01:17.580> said<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> introduction

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
I think he said in the introduction

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.960 
I think he said in the introduction
about<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.780> smoke-filled<00:01:19.290> rooms<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:20.850> know

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
about the smoke-filled rooms you know

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.539 
about the smoke-filled rooms you know
the<00:01:21.420> conspiring<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.830> kill<00:01:23.040> Jesus

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the conspiring to actually kill Jesus

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
the conspiring to actually kill Jesus
that<00:01:23.759> took<00:01:23.939> place<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:25.110> were<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that took place here and these were you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.380 
that took place here and these were you
know<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.430> look<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:26.759> historically

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
know if we look back historically

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.090 
know if we look back historically
through<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> Bible<00:01:28.380> describes<00:01:28.799> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.319 
his troops in the gate on the western
side<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.019> Jesus<00:03:16.620> chose<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.100> moment<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.610> come

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
side and Jesus chose that moment to come

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.210 
side and Jesus chose that moment to come
in<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.780> gates<00:03:18.989> from<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> eastern<00:03:19.709> side<00:03:19.950> and

so<00:03:20.400> he<00:03:20.549> was<00:03:20.700> he<00:03:21.030> was<00:03:21.150> sort<00:03:21.299> of<00:03:21.329> declaring

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
so he was he was sort of declaring

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.360

anymore<00:03:22.200> perhaps<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.680> challenge<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.250> two

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
anymore perhaps a challenge of two

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.710 
anymore perhaps a challenge of two
kingdoms<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.150> think<00:03:24.480> that's<00:03:24.630> a
