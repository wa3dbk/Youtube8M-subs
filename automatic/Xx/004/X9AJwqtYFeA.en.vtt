00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.240
 gone gone 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.790
 I already had promising horses 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.620
 but it was not that easy 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.840
 had start 15 and it was very 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.290
 open is so I said it can 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.400
 67 win the derby fair and I was 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.990
 I also hesitate to see him 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.480
 in or in the pool e and i am mine 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.740
 heart followed and yes I am today 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.030
 Rewards where everything is a really great horse 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.580
 fought the crisis and I am pleased 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.630
 of course he's like winning too 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.130
 if it is the sixth it feels 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.210
 always like it first and it 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.980
 find something for the jockey 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.690
 special and it stays that way though 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.390
 normal heart decision for lucky 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.070
 speed or were there other criteria 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.170
 as better then the union was yes where one 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.550
 poly second was undoubtedly the favorite 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.900
 been in the derby and I in munich 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.460
 you have beaten 400 in the 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.990
 Wettmarkt and that's why I have one 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.060
 a bit later but he is 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.110
 from the character sensational and I am 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.730
 gone there too because I was the player 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.240
 a few marks and that was the same 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.210
 decision 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.520
 The name lucky speed was not successful until now 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.230
 finish shortly before the finish 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.840
 how is the race course like her 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.460
 So yes, it's just in Hamburg 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.350
 the value always ran very fast and 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.510
 mostly I came in all of my 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.940
 how to win far from the back like now 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.220
 are also specifically about and so could 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.330
 I then calmly approach my race and 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.620
 already have a good feeling in the final arc 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.120
 had I could position for position 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.740
 I make up for them just 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.130
 pulled out then fought huge 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.690
 and yes class gives such a value 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.140
 already for this sixth derby victory 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.820
 or even one shows that he 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.710
 so no matter where you are in the world 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.360
 wins and now with the battery with 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.130
 the king george are of course exception 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.240
 But the race here I did not feel 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.520
 worse on the contrary 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.530
 peter hearted test print victory in derby 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.900
 how do you expect that lucky 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.870
 speed your strongest drive was you have 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.540
 the field not i had was from her 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.040
 pace and paint is in the process that I'm after 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.420
 Of course, the bonus has everything right 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.100
 has made and judge had run 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.210
 the right way is and im 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.930
 block had already felt good 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.910

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.710

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.660
 others have that will be very 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.490
 I found detained as they have 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.900
 your race has seen and experienced 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.580
