clamp<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.820> idea<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.840> keeps<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
clamp the idea is that it keeps the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.069 
clamp the idea is that it keeps the
record<00:00:46.829> firmly<00:00:47.670> attached<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.510> platter

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.439 
record firmly attached to the platter
this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.950> especially<00:00:50.160> key<00:00:50.820> when<00:00:51.120> you're<00:00:51.239> using

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this is especially key when you're using

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
this is especially key when you're using
a<00:00:51.629> high-quality<00:00:51.870> platter<00:00:52.590> light<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.039> comes

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
thick acrylic platters act very much

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.139 
thick acrylic platters act very much
like<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.590> record<00:00:58.949> themselves<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
like the record themselves and when you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.869 
like the record themselves and when you
have<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> good<00:01:00.780> clamp<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.129> able<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> do

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
have a good clamp what that's able to do

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.840 
have a good clamp what that's able to do
is<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.390> able<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.140> essence<00:01:04.799> couple<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
is it's able to in essence couple the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.230 
is it's able to in essence couple the
record<00:01:06.420> completely<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> platter

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
record completely to the platter

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.520 
record completely to the platter
effectively<00:01:09.240> making<00:01:09.479> your<00:01:09.750> record<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.229> thick

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
effectively making your record as thick

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.890 
effectively making your record as thick
and<00:01:10.680> heavy<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> platter<00:01:11.520> itself<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and heavy as the platter itself as we

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
and heavy as the platter itself as we
all<00:01:13.020> know<00:01:13.229> thicker<00:01:13.560> records<00:01:14.070> sound<00:01:14.430> better

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
all know thicker records sound better

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700 
all know thicker records sound better
that's<00:01:15.090> why<00:01:15.270> most<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> reissue<00:01:16.140> records

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that's why most of the reissue records

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.870 
that's why most of the reissue records
today<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.159> being<00:01:17.460> done<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.960> 180<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.229> 200<00:01:19.740> grams

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
today are being done at 180 or 200 grams

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
today are being done at 180 or 200 grams
well<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.030> essence<00:01:21.390> once<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.840> use<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> clamp<00:01:22.619> on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
well in essence once you use a clamp on

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.010 
well in essence once you use a clamp on
a<00:01:22.920> platter<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.790> you're<00:01:24.509> effectively

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
a platter like this you're effectively

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.929 
a platter like this you're effectively
getting<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> four<00:01:25.920> pound<00:01:26.220> record<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
getting about a four pound record and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.210 
getting about a four pound record and
that<00:01:27.060> gives<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> better<00:01:27.600> sound<00:01:27.900> still<00:01:28.320> let<00:01:29.100> me

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that gives you better sound still let me

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.819 
that gives you better sound still let me
show<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> exactly<00:01:29.880> how<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> works<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.020> take<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
show you exactly how it works I take a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.270 
show you exactly how it works I take a
record<00:01:32.900> put<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> platter<00:01:35.210> like<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:37.280> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
record put it on the platter like so and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.789 
record put it on the platter like so and
then<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.180> didn't<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> clamp<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.470> record

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
then if I didn't have a clamp the record

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
then if I didn't have a clamp the record
has<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> tendency<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> rock<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> little

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the things you want to think about what

the things you want to think about what
the<00:02:07.469> twister<00:02:07.890> clamp<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.849> Delrin

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the twister clamp is that the Delrin

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.420 
the twister clamp is that the Delrin
like<00:02:09.690> material<00:02:10.319> used<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.950> body<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.400> very

it doesn't ring and this is important in

it doesn't ring and this is important in
essence<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.840> mimics<00:02:16.319> very<00:02:16.560> much<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.069> same

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300

it's<00:02:19.709> used<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:21.150> way<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.840> all

it's used with and that way you get all
the<00:02:22.380> benefits<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.069> clamping<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.730> record<00:02:24.120> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
you know introducing any kind of

you know introducing any kind of
additional<00:02:30.080> glassiness<00:02:31.080> or<00:02:31.320> brightness<00:02:31.800> to

additional glassiness or brightness to
the<00:02:32.070> sound<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.420> twister<00:02:33.780> clamp<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> very

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
the sound so the twister clamp is a very

the sound so the twister clamp is a very
very<00:02:35.100> good<00:02:35.280> product<00:02:35.610> very<00:02:36.150> high-quality<00:02:36.440> it's

very good product very high-quality it's
still<00:02:37.709> very<00:02:37.920> affordable<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:39.360> fairly<00:02:39.870> heavy

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
still very affordable it's fairly heavy

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.440 
still very affordable it's fairly heavy
lightweight<00:02:41.190> enough<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.550> use<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> lot<00:02:42.330> of

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
lightweight enough to use on a lot of
