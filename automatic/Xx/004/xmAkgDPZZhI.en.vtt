put on the standard ball and you wanna
have<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.269> side<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> paper<00:00:24.869> match<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.609> with

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
have one side of the paper match up with

the<00:00:26.760> side<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> your<00:00:27.210> sample<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.970> once<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.150> just

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the side of your sample and once I just

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.229 
the side of your sample and once I just
kind<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.720> sticking<00:00:30.929> out<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> edge

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
kind of sticking out you want the edge

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.930 
kind of sticking out you want the edge
of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> paper<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.530> sand<00:00:37.860> paper<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.670> in

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
of the paper the sand paper to be in

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.600 
of the paper the sand paper to be in
line<00:00:39.300> with<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> edge<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> sander<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.489> it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
line with the edge of the sander so it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.760 
line with the edge of the sander so it
looks<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.390> behind<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.989> that's

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
looks like that from behind and that's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.770 
looks like that from behind and that's
the<00:00:44.040> side<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.760> want<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.030> send<00:00:45.570> it

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
stand with with just a spine so we just

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.050 
stand with with just a spine so we just
quickly<00:02:17.430> buff<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.330> out<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:20.610> our<00:02:20.790> pole
