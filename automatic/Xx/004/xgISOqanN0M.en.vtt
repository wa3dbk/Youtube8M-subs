00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.310
 let people know the weekly training spectrum is affecting now and last week 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.130
 I had made changes to game technology news marieke among others 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.369
 just started discussing more news at a fast pace 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.269
 and I never had a quarter of an image every once in a while and yes your fiba radar post from 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.860
 super right on the puff because the read 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.179
 that you liked it 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.390
 I want to say in advance if you found a video nice for pin on 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.569
 breda if we don't just leave diving possible moment encourages right 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:30.060
 to get full to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.490
 if you tube, you used to spend more on videos because 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.560
 people who 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.200
 show a rating through thumbs and also through 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.149
 reactions but we will now start with interviews 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.769
 The first is about this that many people naturally looked forward to 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.710
 the ps that voice version 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.350
 and that game first finally came out last Tuesday that came on steam 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.790
 available as pearl your card 6 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.749
 you should also mention the game or the stentor 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:01.129
 which is currently in the places already this simply means 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.680
 that the game is still in a very early phase of its development 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:08.060
 and thereby 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.390
 that there are just a lot of functions always wrong that is also the case with this 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.430
 on the steam page of the beesies urby exes state to bread milk of what is left 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.210
 all must come in this die and a performance can just be very bad 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.610
 and bugs can still happen a lot because 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.300
 the desist and lafarge really very early this development puts the maker of 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.539
 the one that said it could take years 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.869
 grasp indeed there comes a dance hall maybe still years can for that 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.160
 the full game comes out 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.509
 and thus 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.590
 for people who are thinking about buying 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.970
 you have to think of lee 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.290
 that the game is not yet complete that a lot has happened can be that 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.640
 to make another point 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 And then you have to look from the story told what is now also one 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.710
 group of players that per developer kg 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.610
 and then you can decide if you are going to buy a hood 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.080
 and they also have a time, by the way 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.150
 very very nice nothing announced on Wednesday a day after the ps3 in 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.999
 less than 24 hours in 24 hours 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.330
 more than 170,000 4 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.450

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.650
 who have been buying sea for 24 euros on boost and was also in addition 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.940
 they step to mobile drawing he many people play of course 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.419
 dedemsvaart 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.849
 some people think you can't name games 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.049
 but i think we just desselgem and play games of course on a high 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.129
 potential on a high pet and the Dutch game rudik telesport the 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.589
 shining collapse apple proclaimed only of game of the year 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.899

 That means you have Christian unity 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.550
 because all the games on the ai van van field 2013 that is actually quite a lot 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.539
 the station itself 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:09.409

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:51.369
 years in the future is not only going to get bigger and then 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.779
