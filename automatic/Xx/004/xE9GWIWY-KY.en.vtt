over<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.100> RF<00:00:20.490> 350<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.480> their

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
over here with the RF 350 this is their

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.230 
over here with the RF 350 this is their
entry-level<00:00:22.050> keyless<00:00:22.740> entry<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.970> three

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
entry-level keyless entry it's a three

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.670 
entry-level keyless entry it's a three
channel<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.019> basically<00:00:25.289> gonna<00:00:25.470> give

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
into the brain unit right in here this

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
into the brain unit right in here this
is<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.930> those<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.770> want

another thing that's really cool with
this<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.850> one<00:02:40.000> here<00:02:40.270> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
this one and the one here the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.690 
this one and the one here the
seven-thirty<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.560> uses<00:02:41.920> what<00:02:42.310> they<00:02:42.460> call

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
seven-thirty is it uses what they call

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.150 
seven-thirty is it uses what they call
the<00:02:43.210> spectrum<00:02:43.630> technology<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.740> basically

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
the spectrum technology so basically

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.610 
the spectrum technology so basically
when<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.430> push<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.300> lock<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.750> unlock<00:02:47.050> I'm

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
when you push this lock and unlock I'm

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.800 
when you push this lock and unlock I'm
instead<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.310> descending<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:48.790> one<00:02:49.030> signal<00:02:49.450> to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
instead of descending in one signal to

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.080 
instead of descending in one signal to
the<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> receiver<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.070> back<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.640> it

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
the to the receiver and back and it

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.910 
the to the receiver and back and it
sends<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.420> bunch<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.870> them<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.740> way

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
sends a bunch of them and so that way

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.640 
sends a bunch of them and so that way
when<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.190> push<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.610> lock<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:54.910> unlock<00:02:55.090> its

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
when you push that lock and unlock its

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.170 
when you push that lock and unlock its
gonna<00:02:56.650> you're<00:02:56.920> gonna<00:02:56.980> have<00:02:57.160> more<00:02:57.370> opportunity

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
gonna you're gonna have more opportunity

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.790 
gonna you're gonna have more opportunity
to<00:02:58.360> really<00:02:58.780> make<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:59.170> connection<00:02:59.470> which

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
to really make that connection which

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.410 
to really make that connection which
means<00:03:00.010> there's<00:03:00.220> less<00:03:00.490> time<00:03:00.760> fumbling<00:03:01.300> around

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
means there's less time fumbling around

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.660 
means there's less time fumbling around
with<00:03:01.720> your<00:03:01.900> remote<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.260> more<00:03:02.770> time<00:03:02.980> actually

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
with your remote and more time actually

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.580 
with your remote and more time actually
working<00:03:03.910> locking<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.840> unlocking<00:03:04.900> your<00:03:05.350> car

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
working locking and unlocking your car

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.270 
working locking and unlocking your car
so<00:03:06.220> these<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.420> range<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.840> car
