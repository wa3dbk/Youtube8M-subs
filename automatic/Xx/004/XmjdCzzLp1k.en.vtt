here<00:00:05.390> I'm<00:00:05.540> testing<00:00:05.990> the<00:00:06.140> performance<00:00:07.100> of

the<00:00:41.449> thing<00:00:41.660> I'm<00:00:41.809> finding<00:00:41.989> with<00:00:42.199> this<00:00:42.379> though

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
the thing I'm finding with this though

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.340 
the thing I'm finding with this though
is<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.699> it<00:00:44.030> is<00:00:44.059> performing<00:00:44.660> really<00:00:45.050> very

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
is that it is performing really very

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.770 
is that it is performing really very
well<00:00:45.559> compared<00:00:45.949> with<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:46.129> one<00:00:46.280> that's<00:00:46.489> on<00:00:46.610> the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
well compared with the one that's on the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.670 
well compared with the one that's on the
turbine<00:00:47.780> at<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.019> moment<00:00:48.320> I<00:00:48.469> just<00:00:48.949> get<00:00:49.070> that<00:00:50.680> as

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
turbine at the moment I just get that as

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.620 
turbine at the moment I just get that as
a<00:00:51.739> quick<00:00:52.039> flick<00:00:55.390> and<00:00:56.390> into<00:00:56.659> the<00:00:56.750> meat

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
a quick flick and into the meat

-<00:00:59.050> whatever<00:00:59.350> ten<00:00:59.620> volts<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.600> as<00:01:01.780> you<00:01:01.900> can<00:01:01.989> see

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
- whatever ten volts and as you can see

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.380 
- whatever ten volts and as you can see
that's<00:01:02.260> any<00:01:02.440> few<00:01:02.739> off<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.100> end<00:01:03.220> there

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510 

so<00:01:09.900> there's<00:01:10.530> quite<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.920> variation<00:01:11.190> in

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so there's quite a bit of variation in

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.870 
so there's quite a bit of variation in
the<00:01:11.640> focus

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.969 

again<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> reason<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.110> quite<00:01:16.350> slow

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.359 

and<00:01:26.990> this<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.229> kind<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.650> infinitely<00:01:28.130> better

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
and this is kind of infinitely better

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.070 
and this is kind of infinitely better

I'd have expected similar performance

I'd have expected similar performance
but<00:01:59.060> obviously<00:01:59.330> not

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.020 

okay<00:02:27.620> might<00:02:28.010> help<00:02:28.160> me<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.400> my<00:02:28.550> actually

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
the voltage is going up very little

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.319 

I'll<00:03:59.890> apply<00:04:00.220> more<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.610> more<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.000> speeds<00:04:01.239> of

I<00:04:13.480> see<00:04:14.480> it<00:04:14.540> we<00:04:14.629> become<00:04:14.780> disconnected<00:04:15.850> okay

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
I see it we become disconnected okay

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.409 
I see it we become disconnected okay
interesting<00:04:18.829> stuff<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:19.549> maybe<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.150> sober

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419
