 the stab and tv infection we put 1 million 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.709
 then the strategy of 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.299
 because the traced runs really are either adequate 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.249
 plague that kind of occasion 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.039
 the golden grandson 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.789
 1 I have a ribbon 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.789

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.419
 this type of event 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.329
 the future 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.329
 I'll do it all by myself 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.300
 she gets more confident that she had 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.789
 other cities as well 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.789

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.339
 has been so you need more charge silicone plate 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.790
 visitor portrait 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.599
 made on paper very very poor very good by civilians kind of do 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.020
 as long as you have 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.110
 the proper plate and the machine 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.950
 so U.S 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.870
 next vicente to tottenham I have to comply 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.699

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.710
 they will hit the leftover tower 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.099
 It fits right here and I did not mention it here. 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.029

 name of the bride and groom 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.180
 proc for this 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.780
 this patronage you've cut has to be a bit more in the attack 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.610
 the coach 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.129
 Why do you even stand in Cachoeiro? 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:40.809

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.990
 in the clip I put in the roll of windows 7 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.449
 helena gets frustrated 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.169

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.159
 it's like one 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.009
 it can not be discussed 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.979
