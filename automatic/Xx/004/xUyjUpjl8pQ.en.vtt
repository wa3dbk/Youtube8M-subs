00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
vehicle and the picture of the rims that

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.420 
vehicle and the picture of the rims that
you<00:00:21.190> want<00:00:21.430> to<00:00:21.670> put<00:00:21.880> on<00:00:22.030> the<00:00:22.180> vehicle<00:00:23.190> your<00:00:24.190> next

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
you want to put on the vehicle your next

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.080 
you want to put on the vehicle your next
step<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.850> to<00:00:25.720> go<00:00:25.840> over<00:00:26.080> to<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.260> truck<00:00:26.440> picture

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
step is to go over to the truck picture

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.470 
step is to go over to the truck picture
take<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.120> elliptical<00:00:28.870> marquee<00:00:29.440> tool<00:00:29.470> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
take the elliptical marquee tool and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.560 
take the elliptical marquee tool and
draw<00:00:31.480> an<00:00:31.630> ellipse<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:32.680> same<00:00:32.949> size<00:00:33.280> as<00:00:33.699> the<00:00:34.329> car

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
draw an ellipse the same size as the car

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.390 
draw an ellipse the same size as the car
rims<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:38.650> now<00:00:38.800> we<00:00:38.860> want<00:00:39.130> to<00:00:39.220> take<00:00:39.370> a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
rims and now we want to take a

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.540 
rims and now we want to take a
paintbrush<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.390> paint<00:00:41.010> inside<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.250> ellipse

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
paintbrush and paint inside that ellipse

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.229 
paintbrush and paint inside that ellipse
to<00:00:42.850> black<00:00:43.180> out<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.690> old<00:00:43.840> rims<00:00:44.970> for<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.090> other

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
to black out the old rims for the other

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.610 
to black out the old rims for the other
wheel<00:00:46.480> we<00:00:46.989> just<00:00:47.170> want<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.440> hit<00:00:47.530> edit<00:00:48.090> copy<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
wheel we just want to hit edit copy and

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.970 
wheel we just want to hit edit copy and

drag<00:00:59.350> and<00:00:59.860> bring<00:01:00.399> it<00:01:00.520> over<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.180> other<00:01:01.329> rim

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:03.689 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.749 

this<00:01:04.689> is<00:01:04.869> one<00:01:05.049> to<00:01:05.199> lock<00:01:05.409> into<00:01:05.649> place<00:01:05.920> so<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.490> fix

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
this is one to lock into place so to fix

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.109 
this is one to lock into place so to fix
that<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.619> zoom<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.490> have<00:01:09.670> more

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
control over clicking and dragging the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.419 
control over clicking and dragging the
ellipse<00:01:14.939> alright<00:01:15.939> just<00:01:16.299> like<00:01:16.749> so<00:01:17.200> zoom<00:01:18.189> back

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
ellipse alright just like so zoom back

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.039 
ellipse alright just like so zoom back
out<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:20.350> next<00:01:20.709> step<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:21.329> to<00:01:22.329> go<00:01:22.689> over<00:01:22.719> to<00:01:23.020> our

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
out the next step is to go over to our

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.940 
out the next step is to go over to our
picture<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.740> our<00:01:23.770> rim<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:26.049> I'm<00:01:26.679> going<00:01:26.799> to<00:01:26.859> use

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
picture of our rim and I'm going to use

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.569 
picture of our rim and I'm going to use
the<00:01:27.100> magic<00:01:27.549> wand<00:01:27.789> tool<00:01:28.179> and<00:01:28.889> select<00:01:29.889> all<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.809 
the magic wand tool and select all the
white<00:01:31.109> behind<00:01:32.109> this<00:01:32.289> rim<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:35.649> I'm<00:01:36.639> going<00:01:36.789> to

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
white behind this rim and I'm going to

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.289 
white behind this rim and I'm going to
go<00:01:36.939> select<00:01:37.439> inverse<00:01:38.789> that's<00:01:39.789> gonna<00:01:40.090> select

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
go select inverse that's gonna select

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.089 
go select inverse that's gonna select
the<00:01:40.450> opposite<00:01:41.079> of<00:01:41.259> whatever<00:01:41.439> we<00:01:41.770> just

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099

everything<00:01:44.829> but<00:01:45.069> the<00:01:45.219> white<00:01:45.399> is<00:01:45.579> selected<00:01:46.469> and

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
everything but the white is selected and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.849 
everything but the white is selected and
we<00:01:47.560> just<00:01:47.740> go<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.859> edit<00:01:48.039> copy<00:01:49.469> go<00:01:50.469> over<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.740> our

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
we just go to edit copy go over to our

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.959 
we just go to edit copy go over to our
truck<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.340> hit<00:01:51.669> edit<00:01:51.849> paste<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.729> we're<00:01:54.849> going

truck and hit edit paste and we're going
to<00:01:54.999> take<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.329> ellipse<00:01:55.599> tool<00:01:55.689> one<00:01:56.169> more<00:01:56.349> time

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
to take the ellipse tool one more time

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.929 
to take the ellipse tool one more time
do<00:01:56.919> you<00:01:56.950> lip<00:01:57.130> tackle<00:01:57.399> marquee<00:01:57.819> tool<00:01:58.029> and<00:01:59.939> draw

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
do you lip tackle marquee tool and draw

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.489 
do you lip tackle marquee tool and draw
an<00:02:01.060> ellipse<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.539> same<00:02:01.719> size<00:02:01.989> as<00:02:02.200> our<00:02:02.289> rim<00:02:03.389> and

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
an ellipse the same size as our rim and

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.469 
an ellipse the same size as our rim and
make<00:02:05.499> sure<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.770> bottom<00:02:06.039> of<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:07.209> ellipse

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
make sure the bottom of the ellipse

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.040 
make sure the bottom of the ellipse
lines<00:02:07.899> up<00:02:08.170> whoops

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
lines up whoops

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.610 
lines up whoops

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
lines up with the bottom of the rim

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.550 
lines up with the bottom of the rim
after<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.770> we<00:02:14.980> go<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.130> select<00:02:15.900> inverse<00:02:16.900> to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
after that we go to select inverse to

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.500 
after that we go to select inverse to
like<00:02:17.739> everything<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.670> rim<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:21.390> take<00:02:22.390> the

eraser you're gonna erase this little

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.370 
eraser you're gonna erase this little
shadow<00:02:25.270> down<00:02:25.599> here<00:02:25.989> underneath<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.890> rim<00:02:28.380> now

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
shadow down here underneath the rim now

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.120 
shadow down here underneath the rim now
go<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.650> select<00:02:30.099> deselect<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.650> we're<00:02:32.980> going<00:02:33.099> to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
go to select deselect and we're going to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.080 
go to select deselect and we're going to
resize<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.790> rim<00:02:34.000> now<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.989> fit<00:02:35.470> our<00:02:35.739> vehicle<00:02:36.090> so

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
resize the rim now to fit our vehicle so

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.729 
resize the rim now to fit our vehicle so
you<00:02:37.120> go<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.330> edit<00:02:38.230> transform<00:02:38.970> scale<00:02:40.739> hold
