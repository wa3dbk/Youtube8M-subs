 amazing car that combines 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.290
 in itself a lot of possibilities and 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.420

 flip your commercial relationship 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.010
 motor transport for this we have chosen 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.450
 perhaps the dirtiest most impassable 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.879
 creepy in the automotive sense of the word 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.410
 a place in Moscow you can spend thousands 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.149
 like a description of cars in 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.340
 off-road qualities and characteristics 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.390
 but the most important test she will try 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.780
 car case 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.210
 We went to the novel Schukin journalist 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.050
 Russian car radio observer 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.860
 News Service 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.830
 35 years old driving experience 15 years 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.170
 testing more than 80 cars realized 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.420
 which is frankly bad cars practically 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.330
 no there are not properly formulated 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.830
 requests to the car at the time of selection 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.409
 convinced that driving a little respect 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.200
 first of all driving 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.970
 you need to respect yourself cancer this prefix 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.400
 means something to me prefix 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.200
 means that this car has 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.240
 cross-country and for this we 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.710
 have chosen a special place not increased 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.880
 permeability is just what you need 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.340
 for auto 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.829
 this is finally broken road which 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.900
 dream a terrible dream to any lovers 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:50.409
 off-road even in summer and we came here 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.420
 in the spring thaw and if you could 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.049
 see this rut ​​eyes are afraid 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.350
 berlin go through I do with you 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.220
 today 1 are familiar with this car 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.200
 terms honestly 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.850
 close to combat you must see it 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.240
 on the machine side does something 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.220
 unimaginable if we are such that I think 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.380
 I would not risk to come here on def Yandex 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.130
 or true but a car if you 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.050
 will listen 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.660
 It hurts a little, but here it’s not afraid 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.250
 need you no vital organs 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.230
 don't damage his cars just 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.540
 because already in the basic configuration it 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.330
 equipped with steel protection it is not 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.430
 tinsel is not something for this purpose 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.260
 so marketers can sell you 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.120
 car poison is really steel 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.920
 sheet and mines which was created in order 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.720
 to hold intact and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.030
 preservation all life on important organs 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.710
 car 200 millimeters clearance 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.940
 try to give another commercial 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.640
 car heels 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.240
 or pie as you like with such 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.090
 clearance and you will understand that this task 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.790
 practically impossible to machine first 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.520
 business is captivating space for growth 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.950
 189 centimeters is not that you stay 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.280
 now just need you to 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.150
 understood that in this car even 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.050
 a man with growth of 189,190 or 200 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.780
 centimeters 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.750
 will feel small 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.520
 little man just because over your head 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.180
 me but visually just space 20 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.180
 centimeters 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.390
 in the conditions when the sun beats right in 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.250
 eyes are not very readable devices though 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.320
 everything is done very well but if 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.770
 honestly I would have made the dashboard arrows 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.140
 panels 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.850
 different from the color itself 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.640
 central top but because amid 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.800
 light gray dial look at 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.300
 white arrows of course comfortable just 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.340
 because you don't need to strain te ik 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.080
 practically not see for that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.900
 get upset big mirrors need 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.420
 say the volume is wonderful racks though 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.250
 wide visually but at the same time 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.250
 practically gray-haired from arthur 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.019
 I can't describe you right now 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.739
 really insulation situation 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.620
 car tell you about dynamic 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.390
 features of citroen berlingo trek exactly 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.930
 because the maximum gear on 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.150
 which I manage committee 2 exactly 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.900
 because make peace with speed 10 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.519
 kilometers an hour and honestly it 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:27.080
 speed is optimal for driving under 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:31.430
 such a road will now storm 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.460
 serious lift see how the car 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.060
 deal with it I can not say that 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.919
 the machine does it playing but I think that 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.710
 no car that would do it 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.180
 playfully commercial vehicle on 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.789
 our roads now hardly anyone 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.469
 surprise and honestly this car 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.979
 even visually determined immediately in 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.110
 flow 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.139
 from the usual classic serial 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.719
 berlingo detail we used to top hat 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.360
 track differs increased clearance 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.520
 here 200 millimeters freestyle prostrate 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.259
 to 8 centimeters it is increased three times 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.969
 so much that can be overcome 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:09.830
 obstacles that serial berlingo 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.409
 wouldn't even have stuck his low 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.440
 planted nose and by the way in this 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.849
 car entry exit angles record 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.949
 not a tube for a commercial vehicle 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:24.469
 but also for a higher class machine 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.490
 SUV or crossover record 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:32.120
 exit angle of 47 degrees and practically 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.080
 record 27 and 7 degrees exit angle 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.409
 obstacles gives us the opportunity today 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.600
 storm obstacles that are hardened 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.440
 SUV 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.610
 for mayall of all i think drive 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.450
 the front is exactly the same as on 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.370
 car thought but there is one small 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:54.010
 little thing that makes this one on mobility 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.410
 almost rogues and almost SUV 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.840
 on the background of the front drive we have 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.150
 the lock in the front axle is 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.330
 allows wearing the main throw 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.420
 torque between the wheels and attached 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.540
 vehicle crossover capabilities I would 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.880
 so said men of increased rigidity 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.920
 which in itself can be on comfort 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.080
 movement is not very good but 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.130
 while the car copes with 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.530
 broken roads 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:25.270
 body volume is also a record if the car 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.830
 not what I did not attract before but here 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.350
 right now and precisely in these conditions 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.870
 need to show potential customers 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.550
 the capabilities of this car is our test 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.140
 passes along road sections where there is 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.260
 only three types of coverage is there a valet 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:43.450
 or 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:47.280
 snow or clay on the summer highway 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:50.680
 rubber and at the same time the car goes 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.389
 wonderful effect incredible feeling 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.180
 In fairness, I must say that it is not 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.990
 just by car i think that on foot 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.990
 it was impossible to pass here 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.700
 and what promised to turn into a routine 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.410
 common pie test from the company 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.260
 citrine has become fascinating 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.820
 shippering SUV trip 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.460
 despite all-wheel drive car 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.670
 proved to be perfectly solid 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.900
 emotions 200 millimeters clearance 

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.490
 huge salon and incredible 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.140
 patency as if it did not sound 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.180
 one word citroen 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.450
 applause and I believe that in my 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.820
 dress from one of the most toothy most 

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.830
 important and most likely 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.830
 betrayed on summer tires cars 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.840
 it was a grand seat setra m berlin go 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.090

 continuation in a second with you was 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.220
