okay so do you hate water seedlings and

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.020 
okay so do you hate water seedlings and
now<00:00:08.230> the<00:00:08.290> next<00:00:08.710> thing<00:00:08.889> is<00:00:09.099> to<00:00:09.429> look<00:00:09.580> at<00:00:09.790> how<00:00:09.820> to

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
now the next thing is to look at how to

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.509 
now the next thing is to look at how to
reduce<00:00:10.360> the<00:00:10.900> need<00:00:11.019> for<00:00:11.080> watering<00:00:11.740> out<00:00:12.130> in<00:00:12.400> the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
reduce the need for watering out in the

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.669 
reduce the need for watering out in the
garden<00:00:12.969> and<00:00:13.500> here

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
garden and here

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.930 
garden and here
mulch<00:00:15.150> really<00:00:16.150> comes<00:00:16.420> into<00:00:16.660> it<00:00:16.990> and<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.820> have

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
mulch really comes into it and you have

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.990 
mulch really comes into it and you have
to<00:00:19.060> be<00:00:19.180> careful<00:00:19.540> with<00:00:19.660> mulch<00:00:20.280> because<00:00:21.280> I<00:00:21.790> mean

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
to be careful with mulch because I mean

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.690 
to be careful with mulch because I mean
it's<00:00:22.180> wonderful<00:00:22.570> stuff<00:00:22.960> when<00:00:23.920> in<00:00:24.190> hot<00:00:24.550> weather

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
it's wonderful stuff when in hot weather

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.920 
it's wonderful stuff when in hot weather
hot<00:00:25.120> dry<00:00:25.540> weather<00:00:25.860> so<00:00:26.860> I<00:00:27.160> wanted<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:27.970> this<00:00:28.630> bed

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
hot dry weather so I wanted the this bed

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.500 
hot dry weather so I wanted the this bed
thoroughly<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:30.040> then<00:00:30.370> next<00:00:30.940> thing<00:00:31.090> I<00:00:31.270> put

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
thoroughly and then next thing I put

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.920 
thoroughly and then next thing I put
down<00:00:31.750> was<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.619> layer<00:00:33.010> of<00:00:34.710> well<00:00:35.710> rotted<00:00:36.160> manure

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
down was a layer of well rotted manure

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.710 
down was a layer of well rotted manure
composted<00:00:37.960> well<00:00:38.290> composted<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.910> there's<00:00:40.510> the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
composted well composted so there's the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.050 
composted well composted so there's the
soil<00:00:41.050> underneath<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:41.740> soil<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.370> well

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
soil underneath that soil is well

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.080 
soil underneath that soil is well
watered<00:00:44.610> layer<00:00:45.610> of<00:00:46.020> compost<00:00:47.020> on<00:00:47.290> top<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:48.090> then

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
watered layer of compost on top and then

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.930 
watered layer of compost on top and then
on<00:00:49.270> top<00:00:49.480> of<00:00:49.540> that<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:50.140> layer<00:00:50.829> of<00:00:51.130> straw

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
on top of that a layer of straw

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.490 
on top of that a layer of straw
immaterial<00:00:52.750> this<00:00:53.410> in<00:00:53.590> fact<00:00:53.829> is<00:00:54.040> reeds<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
immaterial this in fact is reeds and so

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.170 
immaterial this in fact is reeds and so
what<00:00:56.770> that<00:00:56.950> means<00:00:57.280> is<00:00:57.579> that<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:58.000> moisture

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
what that means is that the moisture

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.569 
what that means is that the moisture
that's<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.840> that<00:00:59.110> soil<00:00:59.500> will<00:00:59.829> stay<00:01:00.190> in<00:01:00.370> that

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
that's in that soil will stay in that

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.970 
that's in that soil will stay in that
soil<00:01:00.880> and<00:01:01.210> we've<00:01:01.870> had<00:01:02.050> some<00:01:02.230> very<00:01:02.470> dry<00:01:02.710> weather

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
soil and we've had some very dry weather

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.840 
soil and we've had some very dry weather
recently<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:04.299> so<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.600> decided<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:05.229> do<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
recently and so I decided to do this and

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.240 
recently and so I decided to do this and
in<00:01:07.600> order<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:08.050> save<00:01:08.290> me<00:01:08.530> watering<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:11.080> if<00:01:12.040> the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
in order to save me watering but if the

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.370 
in order to save me watering but if the
weather<00:01:12.460> really<00:01:12.700> turns<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:13.870> get<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.080> lot<00:01:14.260> of

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
weather really turns and we get a lot of

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.080 
weather really turns and we get a lot of
rainy<00:01:14.590> weather<00:01:14.890> if<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.250> start<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.610> see<00:01:15.790> slug

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
rainy weather if I start to see slug

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.090 
rainy weather if I start to see slug
damage<00:01:16.330> I'm<00:01:16.870> gonna<00:01:17.110> take<00:01:17.409> this<00:01:17.590> top<00:01:17.830> layer

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
damage I'm gonna take this top layer

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.640 
damage I'm gonna take this top layer
straight<00:01:18.670> back<00:01:18.909> off<00:01:19.120> again<00:01:19.450> because<00:01:20.110> the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
straight back off again because the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.450 
straight back off again because the
downside<00:01:21.549> of<00:01:21.580> mulching<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.990> slugs<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.770> so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
downside of mulching is the slugs and so

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.910 
downside of mulching is the slugs and so
it's<00:01:24.909> very<00:01:25.299> much<00:01:25.479> here<00:01:26.260> in<00:01:26.409> our<00:01:26.560> British

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
it's very much here in our British

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.920 
it's very much here in our British
climate<00:01:27.370> is<00:01:27.520> very<00:01:27.850> much<00:01:28.150> a<00:01:28.180> matter<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.690> some

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
climate is very much a matter of some

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.600 
climate is very much a matter of some
walking<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.440> tightrope<00:01:29.500> between<00:01:30.250> on<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
walking that tightrope between on the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.190 
walking that tightrope between on the
one<00:01:30.700> hand<00:01:31.060> things<00:01:31.299> drying<00:01:31.600> out<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.049> on<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
one hand things drying out and on the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.810 
one hand things drying out and on the
other<00:01:32.380> hand<00:01:32.619> things<00:01:32.979> getting<00:01:33.250> massacred<00:01:33.580> by

other hand things getting massacred by

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.090 
other hand things getting massacred by
slugs<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.600> here<00:01:35.170> on<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.500> side<00:01:35.770> there's<00:01:36.010> a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
slugs and here on this side there's a

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.870 
slugs and here on this side there's a
small<00:01:36.400> patch<00:01:36.760> of<00:01:37.020> broad<00:01:38.020> beans<00:01:38.350> these<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.520> so

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
small patch of broad beans these I so

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
small patch of broad beans these I so
last<00:01:40.210> autumn<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.049> this<00:01:42.040> spring<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:42.729> put<00:01:42.850> down

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
last autumn and this spring I put down

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.350 
last autumn and this spring I put down
just<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.500> same<00:01:44.710> water<00:01:46.110> compost<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
just the same water compost and then the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.649 
just the same water compost and then the
the<00:01:49.570> reeds<00:01:49.780> on<00:01:50.110> top<00:01:50.409> strory<00:01:51.040> material<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.390> keep

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
the reeds on top strory material to keep

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.420 
the reeds on top strory material to keep
that<00:01:52.930> moisture<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:53.860> won't<00:01:54.159> need<00:01:54.280> to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
that moisture in so I won't need to

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.420 
that moisture in so I won't need to
water<00:01:54.610> them<00:01:54.880> again<00:01:55.119> now<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:55.750> thing<00:01:56.049> with

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
water them again now the thing with

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.460 
water them again now the thing with
plants<00:01:57.430> which<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:57.909> which<00:01:57.970> we<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.960> seed<00:01:59.200> or<00:01:59.439> the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
plants which of which we the seed or the

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.840 
plants which of which we the seed or the
fruit<00:02:00.159> like<00:02:00.960> beans<00:02:02.340> squashes<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.490> courgettes

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
fruit like beans squashes and courgettes

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.090 
fruit like beans squashes and courgettes
things<00:02:04.210> like<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.780> time<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.380> water<00:02:05.590> them<00:02:05.920> is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
things like that a time to water them is

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.279 
things like that a time to water them is
when<00:02:06.340> they're<00:02:06.520> flowering<00:02:07.000> because<00:02:07.869> that's

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
when they're flowering because that's

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.019 
when they're flowering because that's
when<00:02:08.560> they<00:02:08.709> really<00:02:09.069> need<00:02:09.249> water<00:02:09.489> if<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:09.909> get

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:10.029 
when they really need water if you get

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.510 
when they really need water if you get
plenty<00:02:10.329> of<00:02:10.450> water<00:02:10.539> then

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
plenty of water then

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.340 
plenty of water then
or<00:02:11.730> when<00:02:12.240> they're<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.660> beginning<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.080> form

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
or when they're just beginning to form

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.760 
or when they're just beginning to form
their<00:02:13.650> pods<00:02:13.980> or<00:02:14.340> their<00:02:15.320> squashes<00:02:16.320> or<00:02:16.470> whatever

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770

well<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.990> always<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.740> use<00:02:23.040> rain<00:02:23.430> water<00:02:23.460> if

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
well I always like to use rain water if

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.910 
well I always like to use rain water if
at<00:02:24.090> all<00:02:24.180> possible<00:02:24.240> because<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.260> pure<00:02:25.530> got<00:02:25.770> no

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
at all possible because it's pure got no

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.670 
at all possible because it's pure got no
chemicals<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.520> anything<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.680> of

course<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.840> ecologically<00:02:30.840> you're

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
course you know ecologically you're

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.140 
course you know ecologically you're
saving<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.340> pressure<00:02:32.610> on<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> main

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
saving on the pressure on the main

system<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.320> my<00:02:34.470> rain<00:02:34.710> but<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.400> collects

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
system this is my rain but here collects

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.070 
system this is my rain but here collects
water<00:02:36.570> off<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.900> roof<00:02:37.140> thousand<00:02:38.040> liters<00:02:38.370> and

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
water off the roof thousand liters and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.800 
water off the roof thousand liters and
up<00:02:40.080> there<00:02:40.440> there<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> filter<00:02:41.460> which<00:02:42.390> takes

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
up there there is a filter which takes

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.550 
up there there is a filter which takes
out<00:02:42.960> all<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.140> gunk

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
out all the gunk

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.400 
out all the gunk
so<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.340> pure<00:02:44.550> water<00:02:44.730> goes<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:48.410> would

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
so that just pure water goes in I would

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.050 
so that just pure water goes in I would
really<00:02:50.010> advise<00:02:50.430> people<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:51.180> get<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.720> largest

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
really advise people to get the largest

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.050 
really advise people to get the largest
water<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.300> they<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.050> there's<00:02:55.380> a

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
water but they can and there's a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.620 
water but they can and there's a
thousand<00:02:57.060> litre<00:02:57.590> IBC<00:02:58.590> which<00:02:59.490> just<00:03:00.180> about<00:03:00.330> fits

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
thousand litre IBC which just about fits

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.400 
thousand litre IBC which just about fits
in<00:03:00.870> here<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.970> because<00:03:02.970> normal<00:03:03.900> water<00:03:04.110> but

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
in here and because normal water but

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.110 
in here and because normal water but
will<00:03:04.620> finish<00:03:04.860> very<00:03:05.130> quickly<00:03:05.460> in<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.760> bit<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.000> hot

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
will finish very quickly in a bit of hot

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.080 
will finish very quickly in a bit of hot
weather<00:03:06.830> why<00:03:07.830> something<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.340> will<00:03:08.910> go

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
weather why something like this will go

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.070 
weather why something like this will go
on<00:03:09.270> for<00:03:09.540> much<00:03:09.660> longer<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:11.480> try<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.600> store<00:03:12.960> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
on for much longer and try and store it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.250 
on for much longer and try and store it
as<00:03:13.200> high<00:03:13.410> up<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.160> in<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.330> layout<00:03:15.930> of

as high up as you can in the layout of

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.530 
as high up as you can in the layout of
my<00:03:16.380> garden<00:03:16.830> one-story<00:03:17.460> house<00:03:17.760> it's

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
my garden one-story house it's

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.570 
my garden one-story house it's
impossible<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.530> lay<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.950> out<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.100> such<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> way

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
impossible to lay it out in such a way

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.310 
impossible to lay it out in such a way
that<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.820> can<00:03:20.970> use<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> hose<00:03:21.330> pipe<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:22.140> if<00:03:22.230> you

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
that you can use a hose pipe but if you

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.930 
that you can use a hose pipe but if you
can<00:03:22.470> get<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.740> higher<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.430> then<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.790> use<00:03:23.910> a

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
can get it higher and then you can use a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.420 
can get it higher and then you can use a
hose<00:03:24.090> pipe<00:03:24.120> instead<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.750> watering<00:03:25.170> can

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
hose pipe instead of a watering can

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.520 
hose pipe instead of a watering can
which<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.580> great<00:03:26.880> if<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.900> do<00:03:27.960> run<00:03:28.320> out<00:03:28.500> of

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
which is great if I do run out of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.300 
which is great if I do run out of
rainwater<00:03:28.890> what<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.460> do<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.120> put<00:03:31.070> tap<00:03:32.070> water

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
rainwater what I do is I put tap water

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.160 
rainwater what I do is I put tap water
into<00:03:32.640> buckets<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.330> just<00:03:33.390> leave<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.870> there<00:03:34.020> for

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
into buckets and just leave it there for

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.950 
into buckets and just leave it there for
overnight<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.970> chlorine<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.840> add

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
overnight so that the chlorine can add

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.230 
overnight so that the chlorine can add
