00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
as the fight went on but the power was

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.160

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
what essentially what was the difference

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.380 
what essentially what was the difference
in<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.560> way<00:03:18.770> and<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.250> feel<00:03:19.460> like<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.850> man<00:03:20.120> Vic

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
in this way and I feel like this man Vic

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.260 
in this way and I feel like this man Vic
has<00:03:20.570> proven<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.200> be<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.710> star<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.580> this<00:03:22.700> division

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
has proven to be a star in this division

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.600 
has proven to be a star in this division
and<00:03:23.840> if<00:03:24.260> he<00:03:24.410> fights<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.860> way<00:03:25.070> it's<00:03:25.340> going<00:03:25.520> to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
and if he fights that way it's going to

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.500 
and if he fights that way it's going to
be<00:03:25.670> hard<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.030> beat<00:03:26.210> him

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510
