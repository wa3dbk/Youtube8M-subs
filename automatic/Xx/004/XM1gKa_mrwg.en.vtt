surprisingly this thing crossfire it's
less<00:01:08.569> frames<00:01:08.990> than<00:01:09.319> uncross<00:01:09.950> fired<00:01:10.280> we're

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
less frames than uncross fired we're

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.219 
less frames than uncross fired we're
gonna<00:01:10.639> max<00:01:10.939> out<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.270> settings<00:01:11.630> here<00:01:11.899> and<00:01:11.959> see

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
gonna max out the settings here and see

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.399 
gonna max out the settings here and see
what<00:01:12.350> happens

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.480 

your<00:01:16.249> settings<00:01:16.670> on<00:01:16.939> ultra<00:01:17.859> might<00:01:18.859> be<00:01:19.039> cygnus

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
your settings on ultra might be cygnus

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.859 
your settings on ultra might be cygnus
off<00:01:19.789> obviously<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.829> yeah<00:01:22.780> we're<00:01:23.780> gonna

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
off obviously is it yeah we're gonna

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.870 
off obviously is it yeah we're gonna
apply<00:01:24.200> those<00:01:24.500> settings<00:01:25.929> yeah

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.940 

case<00:01:31.880> we're<00:01:32.150> getting<00:01:32.380> about<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.710> same

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
case we're getting about the same

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.880 
case we're getting about the same
actually<00:01:36.280> that's<00:01:37.280> pretty<00:01:37.430> good

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
actually that's pretty good

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.290 
actually that's pretty good
these<00:01:39.890> can't<00:01:40.190> get<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.400> thing<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:41.680> max<00:01:42.680> out

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
these can't get this thing to max out

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.960 
these can't get this thing to max out
framework<00:01:44.650> here<00:01:45.650> is<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:48.250> Teredo<00:01:49.250> what<00:01:49.880> the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
framework here is the Teredo what the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.510 
framework here is the Teredo what the
cards<00:01:50.270> are<00:01:50.360> doing<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:51.410> GPUs<00:01:51.830> are<00:01:52.010> not<00:01:52.190> being

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
cards are doing the GPUs are not being

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.330 
cards are doing the GPUs are not being
used<00:01:52.700> 100%<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.600> time

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
used 100% of the time

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.060 
used 100% of the time
so<00:01:55.340> anyways<00:01:55.610> there<00:01:56.150> it<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.300> guys<00:01:56.920> three<00:01:57.920> of
