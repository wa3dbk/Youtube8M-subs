00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
my template for this video so then I'm

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.850 
my template for this video so then I'm
gonna<00:00:32.660> be<00:00:32.810> sure<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.080> knew<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.380> measurements

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
gonna be sure you knew the measurements

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.860 
gonna be sure you knew the measurements
for<00:00:33.950> making<00:00:34.310> it<00:00:34.490> for<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:34.850> specific<00:00:35.390> book<00:00:35.600> and

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
for making it for this specific book and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.200 
for making it for this specific book and
then<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.379> just<00:00:36.620> have<00:00:36.739> to<00:00:36.860> adapt<00:00:37.219> them<00:00:37.550> for<00:00:37.579> any

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
then you just have to adapt them for any

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.510 
then you just have to adapt them for any
book<00:00:38.600> you're<00:00:38.809> making<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.260> for<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:39.800> but<00:00:40.399> this

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
book you're making it for so but this

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.130 
book you're making it for so but this
will<00:00:40.700> be<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.940> template<00:00:41.329> for<00:00:41.539> this<00:00:41.660> video<00:00:42.379> here

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.470 

my<00:00:48.290> first<00:00:48.590> step<00:00:48.860> was<00:00:49.070> I<00:00:49.130> measured<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.940> spine

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
my first step was I measured the spine

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.060 
my first step was I measured the spine
of<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.870> book<00:00:51.200> and<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.620> turned<00:00:51.770> out<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.010> be

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
of the book and it turned out to be

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.860 
of the book and it turned out to be
about<00:00:52.280> six<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.730> three-quarter<00:00:53.300> inches<00:00:53.690> and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
about six and three-quarter inches and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.660 
about six and three-quarter inches and
I'm<00:00:54.350> going<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.680> go<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.800> little<00:00:55.070> bit<00:00:55.250> beyond<00:00:55.640> that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
I'm going to go a little bit beyond that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.280 
I'm going to go a little bit beyond that
so<00:00:56.030> I'm<00:00:56.090> going<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.270> go<00:00:56.360> to<00:00:56.420> seven<00:00:56.750> inches<00:00:56.960> and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
so I'm going to go to seven inches and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.270 
so I'm going to go to seven inches and
that's<00:00:57.410> pretty<00:00:57.590> much<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.829> good<00:00:57.949> rule<00:00:58.160> of<00:00:58.190> thumb

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
that's pretty much a good rule of thumb

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.939 
that's pretty much a good rule of thumb
to<00:00:58.460> go<00:00:58.730> at<00:00:58.879> least<00:00:58.970> a<00:00:59.449> quarter<00:00:59.809> of<00:00:59.899> an<00:01:00.050> inch<00:01:00.199> more

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
to go at least a quarter of an inch more

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.220 
to go at least a quarter of an inch more
than<00:01:01.190> what<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.520> book<00:01:01.760> how<00:01:01.970> long<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.840> book<00:01:03.050> is

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
than what the book how long the book is

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.650 
than what the book how long the book is
on<00:01:03.470> on<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.739> book<00:01:03.920> on<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.250> book<00:01:04.400> spine<00:01:04.759> so<00:01:05.630> I

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
on on the book on the book spine so I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.859 
on on the book on the book spine so I
cut<00:01:05.960> out<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.440> seven<00:01:07.190> inch<00:01:07.369> strips<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.420> I'm

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
cut out to seven inch strips and I'm

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.140 
cut out to seven inch strips and I'm
going<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.170> stick<00:01:09.380> them<00:01:09.470> together<00:01:09.619> just<00:01:10.150> like

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
going to stick them together just like

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.660 
going to stick them together just like
this

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
this

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.450 
this
now<00:01:13.670> basically<00:01:13.970> what<00:01:14.240> I'm<00:01:14.420> aiming<00:01:14.750> for

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
now basically what I'm aiming for

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.710 
now basically what I'm aiming for
eventually<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:17.300> complete<00:01:18.259> a<00:01:19.600> sheet<00:01:20.600> of

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
eventually is to complete a sheet of

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.300 
eventually is to complete a sheet of
duct<00:01:20.869> tape<00:01:20.899> that's<00:01:21.200> going<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.619> be<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:22.039> little

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
duct tape that's going to be a little

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.370 
duct tape that's going to be a little
bit<00:01:22.490> larger<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:22.970> little<00:01:23.090> bit<00:01:23.300> longer<00:01:23.840> wider

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
bit larger a little bit longer wider

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.580 
bit larger a little bit longer wider
than<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:24.890> fun<00:01:25.460> cover<00:01:25.789> of<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.090> book<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:26.690> I'm

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
than this fun cover of the book so I'm

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.020 
than this fun cover of the book so I'm
going<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.890> take<00:01:28.070> another<00:01:28.660> seven<00:01:29.660> inch<00:01:29.810> strip

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
going to take another seven inch strip

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.090 
going to take another seven inch strip
lie<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.090> overlap<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.229> just<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.410> little<00:01:33.649> bit<00:01:33.770> here

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
lie it overlap it just a little bit here

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.990 
lie it overlap it just a little bit here
bottom<00:01:36.250> peel<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.460> up<00:01:37.660> flip<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.780> over<00:01:40.000> take

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
bottom peel it up flip it over take

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.370 
bottom peel it up flip it over take
another<00:01:41.660> seven<00:01:42.229> strip<00:01:43.390> overlap<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.660> will

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
another seven strip overlap it will

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.139 
another seven strip overlap it will
place<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.710> down<00:01:45.800> so<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.039> overlap<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:46.789> little<00:01:47.000> bit

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
place it down so it overlap a little bit

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.249 
place it down so it overlap a little bit
stick<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.020> down<00:01:48.170> put<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.160> back<00:01:49.369> over<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:51.110> now<00:01:51.229> I

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
stick it down put it back over and now I

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.850 
stick it down put it back over and now I
should<00:01:51.530> be<00:01:51.619> getting<00:01:51.860> close<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.280> my<00:01:53.320> my<00:01:54.320> desired

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
should be getting close to my my desired

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.910 
should be getting close to my my desired
length<00:01:55.790> here<00:01:56.270> just<00:01:56.659> a<00:01:56.750> little<00:01:56.900> bit<00:01:57.110> more<00:01:57.350> so

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
length here just a little bit more so

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.490 
length here just a little bit more so
I'm<00:01:58.009> going<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.189> need<00:01:58.310> two<00:01:58.579> more<00:01:58.820> strips<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.600> I'm

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
I'm going to need two more strips so I'm

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.969

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
only used six pieces of duct tape so if

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.190 
only used six pieces of duct tape so if
you're<00:02:24.700> using<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:25.060> much<00:02:25.239> larger<00:02:25.720> book<00:02:25.959> you're

going to be you may be using a lot more

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.210 
going to be you may be using a lot more
pieces<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.900> overlap<00:02:29.530> them<00:02:29.709> back<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.040> forth

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
pieces to overlap them back and forth

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.009 
pieces to overlap them back and forth
until<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.580> make<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.239> big<00:02:31.480> enough<00:02:31.510> sheet<00:02:31.930> of

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
until you make it big enough sheet of

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.530 
until you make it big enough sheet of
duct<00:02:32.200> tape<00:02:32.230> that's<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.950> same<00:02:33.190> size<00:02:33.430> as<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
duct tape that's the same size as the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.160 
duct tape that's the same size as the
book's<00:02:34.780> cover<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.920> that's<00:02:36.190> your<00:02:36.780> your<00:02:37.780> third

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.670 

to<00:02:44.910> make<00:02:45.150> an<00:02:45.330> exact<00:02:45.720> duplicate<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
to make an exact duplicate of the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.740 
to make an exact duplicate of the
you<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:46.800> made<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.670> basically<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.210> my<00:02:48.360> case<00:02:48.600> I

there right down the middle well we can

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.690 
there right down the middle well we can
fix<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.570> all<00:04:32.260> you<00:04:32.350> do<00:04:32.500> is<00:04:32.680> just<00:04:32.890> take<00:04:33.070> another

going to take for this this will cover
two<00:05:03.530> seven<00:05:03.920> inch<00:05:04.040> strips

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
two seven inch strips

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.960 
two seven inch strips
stick<00:05:05.810> them<00:05:05.900> together<00:05:07.120> like<00:05:08.120> this<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:08.990> that

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
stick them together like this like that

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.730 
stick them together like this like that
take<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.150> strip<00:05:11.390> and<00:05:11.570> lie<00:05:11.720> it<00:05:11.780> on<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.500> book

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
take the strip and lie it on the book

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.020 
take the strip and lie it on the book
over<00:05:13.010> here<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.310> if<00:05:13.400> you're<00:05:13.550> wondering<00:05:13.910> which

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
over here and if you're wondering which

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.300 
over here and if you're wondering which
side<00:05:14.390> this<00:05:15.200> is<00:05:15.260> on<00:05:15.590> its<00:05:15.800> going<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.040> fold

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
side this is on its going to fold

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.250 
side this is on its going to fold
eventually<00:05:16.940> like<00:05:17.090> this<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:17.990> is<00:05:18.140> the

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
eventually like this so this is the

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.470 
eventually like this so this is the
inside<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:18.980> cover<00:05:21.910> line<00:05:22.910> to<00:05:23.090> line<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.300> up

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
inside of the cover line to line it up

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.270 
inside of the cover line to line it up
so<00:05:23.540> it's<00:05:24.080> lined<00:05:24.380> up<00:05:24.500> on<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.650> bottom<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.220> the

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
so it's lined up on the bottom and the

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.490 
so it's lined up on the bottom and the
sides<00:05:25.690> take<00:05:26.690> another<00:05:28.780> put<00:05:29.780> half<00:05:30.020> of<00:05:30.170> it<00:05:30.320> on

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
sides take another put half of it on

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.590 
sides take another put half of it on
this<00:05:30.770> half<00:05:31.340> of<00:05:31.580> it<00:05:31.730> on<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.090> surface<00:05:32.330> that

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
this half of it on the surface that

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.320 
this half of it on the surface that
you're<00:05:32.720> working<00:05:32.780> on<00:05:33.610> very<00:05:34.610> carefully<00:05:34.910> flip

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
you're working on very carefully flip

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.860 
you're working on very carefully flip
the<00:05:35.600> whole<00:05:35.750> thing<00:05:35.810> over<00:05:36.170> and<00:05:36.620> queue<00:05:37.460> it<00:05:37.580> back

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
the whole thing over and queue it back

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:46.000 
the whole thing over and queue it back
around<00:05:38.870> just<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:41.750> fat<00:05:43.570> okay<00:05:44.770> so<00:05:45.770> now<00:05:45.890> you've<00:05:45.980> got

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
around just a fat okay so now you've got

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.160 
around just a fat okay so now you've got
that<00:05:46.310> flap<00:05:46.640> at<00:05:46.880> it<00:05:47.030> on<00:05:47.180> next<00:05:47.720> thing<00:05:47.900> you<00:05:47.960> do<00:05:48.110> is

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
that flap at it on next thing you do is

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.660 
that flap at it on next thing you do is
take<00:05:48.320> two<00:05:48.500> small<00:05:48.800> pieces<00:05:48.980> of<00:05:49.100> duct<00:05:49.280> tape<00:05:49.310> the

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
take two small pieces of duct tape the

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.490 
take two small pieces of duct tape the
ROI<00:05:49.790> doesn't<00:05:50.090> matter<00:05:50.210> how<00:05:50.300> big<00:05:50.450> they<00:05:50.660> are<00:05:50.690> long

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
ROI doesn't matter how big they are long

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.310 
ROI doesn't matter how big they are long
as<00:05:51.710> they're<00:05:51.830> able<00:05:51.920> to<00:05:52.160> wrap<00:05:52.340> around<00:05:52.760> all<00:05:53.320> the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
as they're able to wrap around all the

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.310 
as they're able to wrap around all the
way<00:05:54.470> just<00:05:54.740> like<00:05:54.890> this<00:05:55.780> so<00:05:56.780> that's<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.110> one

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
way just like this so that's the one

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.310 
way just like this so that's the one
side<00:05:58.630> piece<00:05:59.630> of<00:05:59.780> duct<00:05:59.960> tape<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:02.270> wrap<00:06:03.170> it

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
side piece of duct tape and wrap it

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.559 
side piece of duct tape and wrap it
around<00:06:03.760> on<00:06:04.760> this<00:06:05.300> side

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.850 

okay<00:06:09.569> so<00:06:09.629> there's<00:06:09.960> a<00:06:10.050> one<00:06:10.289> pocket<00:06:10.559> right<00:06:10.830> there

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
okay so there's a one pocket right there

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.589 
okay so there's a one pocket right there
now<00:06:11.219> you're<00:06:11.490> gonna<00:06:11.610> flip<00:06:11.879> it<00:06:12.059> over<00:06:12.270> and<00:06:12.539> you're

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
now you're gonna flip it over and you're

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.779 
now you're gonna flip it over and you're
gonna<00:06:12.809> do<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.589> exact<00:06:13.949> same<00:06:13.979> thing<00:06:14.430> you<00:06:14.550> that

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
gonna do the exact same thing you that
