00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
part of the brief so the idea that it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.119 
part of the brief so the idea that it
could<00:00:55.979> hold<00:00:56.370> any<00:00:57.089> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.449> fluid<00:00:57.900> or<00:00:58.019> liquid

was<00:00:59.129> important<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.080> we've<00:01:01.080> made<00:01:01.229> it<00:01:01.350> quite

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
was important and we've made it quite

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.930 
was important and we've made it quite

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
big so we'll hold quite a bit of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
big so we'll hold quite a bit of
champagne<00:01:03.089> which<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.869> hopefully<00:01:04.140> good<00:01:04.589> for

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
