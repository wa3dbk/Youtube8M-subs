00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
detangle that point out so that it

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.520 
detangle that point out so that it
doesn't<00:03:04.260> create<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.920> real<00:03:05.250> be<00:03:05.610> not<00:03:06.150> there<00:03:06.530> so

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530
