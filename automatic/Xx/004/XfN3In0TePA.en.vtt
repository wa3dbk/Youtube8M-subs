 Hi, girls, it's not Amanda, I take care of myself. 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.090
 here 's the coty's blog and we'll do it 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
 a step-by-step tutorial of a make 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.430
 It's really cool to show you 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.380
 stated Barreto is a specialist and make e 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.740
 also gives automation course 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 Let's start preparing the skin you used 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
 carol to prepare the skin to leave the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.890
 very cool face without makeup before 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 first agent john gray for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.960
 smooth the skin texture left in the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.809
 neighbor that used a base in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.969
 reports to corrective color and powder blush 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.510
 A little lipstick, to give us something. 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.100
 Our first makeup is the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.270
 our first tutorial here for the blog 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.399
 of the famous coty or kitten carol with a 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 A little for us, that 's okay. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.629
 complicated so I know a lot of people 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.670
 can not do all I can with myself 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.640
 to do with pen is really the most 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 easy so the practical pen 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 to make you alone at home, that she 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.180
 gives a little more firmness brings a 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.159
 children, it is easier to support the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 hand on face too, so stay a little 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.360
 easier now a gel usually 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.619
 fact that it has a darker trait but 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.659
 consistent, so generally the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.850
 people work more with gel that understands 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 today will cause with gel or with 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.860
 a pen is here that we have to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.500
 people can buy for 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.930
 more practical, but we'll use the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.119
 gel yes you will use up one of them in 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.890
 12 see people have a notion that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.990
 you can use the color of proof the mediator 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.790
 colorful during the day no problem here 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.409
 it's great the enrichment to super 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.780
 high and prominent in the parades 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.950
 international and here in Brazil too 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.619
 Carol, how are we going to do? 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.509
 ice cream no 1 the rest of the make on the face 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.630
 so when the trend is now 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.310
 people are doing align with 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.200
 uniting people also see that it is 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.159
 possible to use the catwalk trends 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.950
 on a daily basis 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.119
 and there the tendency is against, therefore, with 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.920
 a strong mouth 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.119
 there is no such thing as an eye 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.340
 everything mouth nothing 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.709
 now the same fashion is to put a sketch 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.560
 colored with a strong mouth too 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.030
 come on the trend at the moment is the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.069
 People work with the kitten more 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.140
 thick but the secret during which 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.630
 We always start with the part 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.640
 where you will get more 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.560
 product in the brush and we will want 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.370
 more product in the eye then restart 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.200
 always on the outside inside 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.060
 and never the opposite because people 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.489
 always wants inside to have at least one 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.940
 product from the outside and so 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.769
 like marking from the outside in 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.580
 if you find it necessary then you can 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.560
 to make an opposite move than within 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.930
 out but the episode will not have 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.870
 so much product is easier to control 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.940
 An arm goes, another secret is if you 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.190
 I want to make the kitten that point 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.440
 clinches dinha higher you of 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.930
 mark here on the thickest eyelid 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.560
 your trait is in the end we will give 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.560
 a hatchet here and from here we pull 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.550
 one of the tricks for you to get a 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.620
 firm line in the litter area is 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.810
 always a dagger to the face 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.180
 you can support your boy in the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.870
 cheek and there's a better leaf to do 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.870
 the case but yes 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.010
 we passed the eyeliner is a more colorful 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.150
 once more darker a little more 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.890
 discrete right 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.660
 and to complement we will pass 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.850
 a red lipstick that the great trend 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.470
 now with his leaving the race with the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.320
 mouth at the party that we are going 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.070
 lipstick is there that is already a practicality 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.320
 because it is not necessary to use the pencil to 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.510
 set side and then lipstick 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.010
 so now we end up with lipstick 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.140
 red and amanda will take a peek 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.820
 What do you think about the finished look for him? 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.980
 I loved it with a make up well the turn in the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.110
 home that is very nocturnal from day to day 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.630
 you can use a very striking lipstick 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.730
 void of a very light and small radio 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.380
 eyeliner a little lighter also or 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.570
 We can use it more heavily. 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.100
 were we used this is try to know the 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.470
 which makes it a bit smaller than the 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.760
 press with a more marked dash more 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:55.500
 for the average night high I loved it 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.500
 Thank you, little babies until the next.
