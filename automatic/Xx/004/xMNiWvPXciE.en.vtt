dance and if we take a quick look we

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580 
dance and if we take a quick look we
know<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.630> there's<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.020> pattern<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
know that there's one pattern of the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.840 
know that there's one pattern of the
golden<00:01:34.890> waltz<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.369> there's<00:01:35.520> also<00:01:35.700> a

golden waltz and then there's also a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.420 
golden waltz and then there's also a
short<00:01:36.270> lift<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.750> midline<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:38.009> touching

sequence and a set of sequential

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920 
sequence and a set of sequential
twizzles<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> thought<00:01:42.270> might<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.509> kind

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
twizzles so what I thought might be kind

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.620 
twizzles so what I thought might be kind
of<00:01:43.049> fun<00:01:43.130> would<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.460> us<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> look<00:01:45.360> at

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
mention PJ is that even though this is

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.410 
mention PJ is that even though this is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
year the judges are really looking at it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.200 
year the judges are really looking at it
technically<00:02:14.280> which<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.670> different<00:02:15.060> from<00:02:15.900> past

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
technically which is different from past

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
technically which is different from past
but<00:02:18.210> through<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.600> part<00:02:18.840> they're<00:02:18.990> really

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
but through this part they're really

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.530 
but through this part they're really
going<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.440> be<00:02:19.560> looking<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.860> see<00:02:20.190> how<00:02:20.970> close<00:02:21.300> the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.500 

now<00:03:42.070> for<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.550> lady<00:03:42.760> what<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.210> the<00:03:43.360> most

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
now for the lady what is the most

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.790 
now for the lady what is the most
challenging<00:03:43.810> part<00:03:44.140> aside<00:03:44.530> from<00:03:44.710> the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
challenging part aside from the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.470 
challenging part aside from the
walk-around<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.430> find<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.850> difficulty

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
walk-around you find this difficulty

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.600 
walk-around you find this difficulty
this<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.440> very<00:03:47.710> challenging<00:03:47.920> part<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.550> think

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
this is a very challenging part I think

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.640 
this is a very challenging part I think
just<00:03:49.030> maintaining<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.690> waltz<00:03:50.170> feel<00:03:50.410> and

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
just maintaining that waltz feel and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.800 
just maintaining that waltz feel and
that<00:03:50.740> lightness<00:03:51.340> while<00:03:52.270> staying<00:03:52.540> close<00:03:52.780> to

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
that lightness while staying close to

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.690 
that lightness while staying close to
your<00:03:53.080> partner<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.500> mean<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.980> dance<00:03:54.160> actually

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
your partner I mean the dance actually

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.750 
your partner I mean the dance actually
is<00:03:54.880> quite<00:03:55.390> quick<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:55.990> rhythm<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.100> maintaining

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
is quite quick in rhythm so maintaining

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.120 
is quite quick in rhythm so maintaining
that<00:03:57.910> all<00:03:58.450> of<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:58.780> composure<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.650> getting

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
that all of that composure and getting

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.990 
that all of that composure and getting
the<00:04:00.220> footwork<00:04:00.550> is<00:04:00.790> difficult<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:02.790> we<00:04:03.790> already

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
the footwork is difficult and we already

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.080 
the footwork is difficult and we already
know<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:05.130> golden<00:04:06.130> waltz<00:04:06.430> portion<00:04:06.940> of

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
the short dance has to be between 61 and

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.990 
the short dance has to be between 61 and
63<00:04:10.360> three<00:04:11.320> beat<00:04:11.500> measures<00:04:12.070> per<00:04:12.400> minute<00:04:12.700> if<00:04:12.850> I

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
everything people but this is a great

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.219 
everything people but this is a great
compulsory<00:04:25.300> dance<00:04:25.479> because<00:04:25.780> it's<00:04:25.930> one<00:04:26.050> of<00:04:26.169> the

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
compulsory dance because it's one of the

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.089 
compulsory dance because it's one of the
newer<00:04:26.470> ones<00:04:26.759> I<00:04:27.759> think<00:04:28.479> it<00:04:28.780> really<00:04:29.139> helps<00:04:29.500> when

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
newer ones I think it really helps when

newer ones I think it really helps when
it<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.370> newer<00:04:30.610> dance<00:04:30.909> and<00:04:31.060> we're<00:04:31.150> not<00:04:31.270> doing

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:32.969 
it is a newer dance and we're not doing

dances that were made in the 50s so it's

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.770 
dances that were made in the 50s so it's
a<00:04:33.039> lot<00:04:33.190> more<00:04:33.220> intricate<00:04:33.759> and<00:04:33.789> a<00:04:34.270> lot<00:04:34.449> more<00:04:34.479> fun

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
a lot more intricate and a lot more fun

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.439

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
of the challenges that all of the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.570 
of the challenges that all of the
skaters<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.289> coaches<00:04:41.860> were<00:04:41.979> facing<00:04:42.430> and

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
skaters and coaches were facing and

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.820

trying to come up with shortcuts well

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.110 
trying to come up with shortcuts well
it's<00:04:44.979> a<00:04:45.039> three<00:04:45.280> minute<00:04:45.310> program<00:04:45.699> and<00:04:46.060> the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
it's a three minute program and the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.790 
it's a three minute program and the
golden<00:04:46.389> waltz<00:04:46.629> takes<00:04:46.930> up<00:04:47.110> about<00:04:47.349> one<00:04:47.590> minute

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
golden waltz takes up about one minute

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.619 
golden waltz takes up about one minute
of<00:04:47.979> that<00:04:48.159> time<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:49.000> want<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.240> create<00:04:49.449> an

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
of that time you want to create an

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.689 
of that time you want to create an
interesting<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.440> entertaining<00:04:50.560> program<00:04:51.460> and

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
interesting and entertaining program and

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.490 
interesting and entertaining program and
sort<00:04:52.000> of<00:04:52.030> blend<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.659> golden<00:04:52.960> waltz<00:04:53.169> pattern

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
sort of blend the golden waltz pattern

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.830 
sort of blend the golden waltz pattern
within<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:54.069> within<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.669> dance<00:04:54.849> and<00:04:55.449> I<00:04:55.569> think

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
within the within the dance and I think

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.469 
within the within the dance and I think
that's<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.949> biggest<00:04:57.159> challenge<00:04:57.490> because<00:04:58.030> you

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
that's the biggest challenge because you

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.300 
that's the biggest challenge because you
have<00:04:58.509> to<00:04:58.720> take<00:04:58.900> on<00:04:59.110> your<00:04:59.289> your<00:04:59.650> own<00:04:59.800> programs

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
have to take on your your own programs

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.510 
have to take on your your own programs
characteristic<00:05:01.240> we<00:05:01.479> can't<00:05:02.130> just<00:05:03.130> get<00:05:03.250> stuck

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.640 
movements we have to sort of switch up
the<00:05:07.030> positions<00:05:07.449> and<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.960> make<00:05:08.349> sure<00:05:08.500> it

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
the positions and and make sure it

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.980

really is in character so does it feel
waltz<00:05:11.469> like<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:11.979> as<00:05:12.219> now<00:05:12.789> as<00:05:12.969> it's<00:05:13.150> part<00:05:13.419> of

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
waltz like to you as now as it's part of

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.570

the<00:05:13.810> short<00:05:14.050> dance<00:05:14.229> or<00:05:14.710> has<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:15.009> been<00:05:15.069> taken

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
the short dance or has it been taken

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.189 
the short dance or has it been taken
completely<00:05:15.969> out<00:05:16.060> of<00:05:16.180> context<00:05:16.780> well<00:05:17.020> I<00:05:17.050> think

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
completely out of context well I think

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.689 
completely out of context well I think
the<00:05:17.500> trick<00:05:17.740> will<00:05:17.919> be<00:05:17.949> for<00:05:18.219> the<00:05:18.310> skaters<00:05:18.669> to

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
the trick will be for the skaters to

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.490 
the trick will be for the skaters to
keep<00:05:19.000> it<00:05:19.120> really<00:05:19.360> fluent<00:05:19.750> you're<00:05:20.259> not<00:05:20.349> gonna

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
keep it really fluent you're not gonna

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.839 
keep it really fluent you're not gonna
want<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.800> notice<00:05:21.069> that<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.310> golden<00:05:21.520> wall<00:05:21.669> just

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
want to notice that the golden wall just

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.120 
want to notice that the golden wall just
coming<00:05:22.150> up<00:05:22.270> but<00:05:22.449> as<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.259> said<00:05:23.319> earlier<00:05:23.770> it's<00:05:24.009> the

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
coming up but as I said earlier it's the

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.860 
coming up but as I said earlier it's the
game<00:05:24.400> has<00:05:24.550> really<00:05:24.729> changed<00:05:25.210> just<00:05:25.419> as<00:05:25.539> the<00:05:25.719> game

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
game has really changed just as the game

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.600 
game has really changed just as the game
changed<00:05:26.259> for<00:05:26.319> when<00:05:26.620> single<00:05:27.219> skating<00:05:27.490> watch

what really defines it

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.589 
what really defines it
now<00:06:03.190> what<00:06:03.370> about<00:06:03.460> creating<00:06:04.000> a<00:06:04.090> lift<00:06:04.360> for

within the short dance did you find that
that<00:06:07.060> was<00:06:07.210> difficult<00:06:07.569> it's<00:06:07.659> a<00:06:07.750> six-second<00:06:08.380> or

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
one position am I right about that

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.010 
one position am I right about that
usually<00:06:12.789> yeah<00:06:12.940> that's<00:06:13.270> that's<00:06:13.479> the<00:06:13.690> challenge

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
usually yeah that's that's the challenge
