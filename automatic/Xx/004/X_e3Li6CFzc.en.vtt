time<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> script<00:00:20.310> came<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.730> found<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.600> very

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
time the script came I found it very

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.250 
time the script came I found it very
shallow<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.100> felt<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.760> action<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.750> there<00:00:25.019> I

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
shallow I felt the action was there I

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.200 
shallow I felt the action was there I
felt<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.010> storyline<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.820> there<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
felt the storyline was there the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.070 
felt the storyline was there the
development<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> character<00:00:29.960> he<00:00:30.960> was

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
development of the character he was

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840 
development of the character he was
almost<00:00:31.230> humanoid<00:00:31.830> rather<00:00:32.099> than<00:00:32.250> being<00:00:32.430> human

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
almost humanoid rather than being human

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.240 
almost humanoid rather than being human
and<00:00:32.969> they<00:00:33.210> said<00:00:33.390> well<00:00:33.600> talk<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> us<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> that's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and they said well talk to us and that's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.760 
and they said well talk to us and that's
and<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.850> basically<00:00:36.210> rebuilt<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:37.290> bit<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> Sam's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
and we basically rebuilt a bit of Sam's
