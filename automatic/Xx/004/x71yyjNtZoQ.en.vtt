00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.720
 I was watching you ... 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.134
 ... you were watching me. 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.100
 My dear, Miss Everdeen. 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.600
 Don't make a mistake. 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.940
 Because the games are coming to an end. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.900
 For the first time in our lives we are connected to each other with 13 mıntıka. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.060
 Our future begins tomorrow at dawn. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.420
 We're gonna walk to Capitol. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.560
 In this act, President Snow is laying mines on the roads. 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.800
 To facilitate our deaths, the designers of the Games entered into cooperation. 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.140
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 76th Hunger Games. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.360
 THIS NOVEMBER 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.920
 FENOMY OF THE WORLD 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 WELCOME TO EPIC FINAL 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.140
 We have one chance. 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.900
 Let's evaluate. 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.440
 Nothing good while he's alive is safe. 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.900
 Snow has to pay for what he did. 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.620
 Our lives don't belong to us. 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.040
 It all depends on what Snow will do. 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.960
 If you kill him, Katniss ... 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.240
 ... if you end all this ... 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.660
 ... all those deaths ... 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.180
 ... it means something. 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.000
 This night... 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.180
 ... your weapons ... 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.700
 ... turn to Capitol. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.780
 your weapons ... 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.780
 ... turn to Snow! 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.240
