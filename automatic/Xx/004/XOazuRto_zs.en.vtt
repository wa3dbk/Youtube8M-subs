00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
know that I have that allergy because my

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
know that I have that allergy because my
dad<00:00:52.079> has<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> same<00:00:52.649> thing<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
dad has the same thing so it's like a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
dad has the same thing so it's like a
genetic<00:00:53.969> thing<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
genetic thing going on so what kind of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340 
genetic thing going on so what kind of
food<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.399> Japan<00:00:56.670> has<00:00:56.850> melted<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.360> ah<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
food in Japan has melted it ah the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
food in Japan has melted it ah the
simple<00:00:58.649> answer<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.550> traditionally

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
simple answer is if it's traditionally

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
simple answer is if it's traditionally
Japanese<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.989> doesn't<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.530> milk<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.890> and

Japanese it doesn't have milk in it and
I'm<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> convinced<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.270> Japanese

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I'm kind of convinced that Japanese

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.500 
I'm kind of convinced that Japanese
people<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:04.170> didn't<00:01:04.619> drink<00:01:05.100> milk<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.880> use

Japanese<00:05:06.660> person<00:05:07.080> who's<00:05:07.350> lactose<00:05:07.500> intolerant

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
Japanese person who's lactose intolerant

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.100 
Japanese person who's lactose intolerant
so<00:05:08.520> when<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:08.700> try<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:08.970> explain<00:05:09.210> at<00:05:09.539> a<00:05:09.570> restaurant

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
so when I try to explain at a restaurant

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.920 
so when I try to explain at a restaurant
that<00:05:10.289> like<00:05:10.860> immediately<00:05:11.580> edit<00:05:12.030> again<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:12.660> is

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
that like immediately edit again this is

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.650 
that like immediately edit again this is
a--<00:05:13.139> or<00:05:13.500> like<00:05:13.710> i<00:05:13.860> have<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.100> milk<00:05:14.340> allergy<00:05:14.520> i<00:05:15.090> have

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
a-- or like i have a milk allergy i have

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.540 
a-- or like i have a milk allergy i have
to<00:05:15.780> then<00:05:15.930> explain<00:05:16.320> like<00:05:16.560> milk<00:05:16.919> is<00:05:17.100> and<00:05:17.280> cheese

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
to then explain like milk is and cheese

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.460 
to then explain like milk is and cheese
and<00:05:17.910> it's<00:05:18.180> same<00:05:18.419> whipped<00:05:18.660> cream<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:19.200> please

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
and it's same whipped cream like please

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.340 
and it's same whipped cream like please
don't<00:05:19.889> put<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.370> on<00:05:20.430> my<00:05:20.610> food<00:05:20.850> because<00:05:21.300> then<00:05:21.810> i

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
don't put that on my food because then i

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.100 
don't put that on my food because then i
will<00:05:23.039> not<00:05:23.280> be<00:05:23.550> okay<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:24.210> I'll<00:05:24.419> be<00:05:24.630> very<00:05:24.690> sad

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
will not be okay and I'll be very sad

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.529 
will not be okay and I'll be very sad
yeah<00:05:25.889> so<00:05:26.100> I<00:05:26.130> guess<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.490> biggest<00:05:26.669> con<00:05:27.000> in<00:05:27.210> Japan

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
yeah so I guess the biggest con in Japan

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:28.820 
yeah so I guess the biggest con in Japan
is<00:05:27.660> that<00:05:27.750> it's<00:05:27.870> really<00:05:27.990> awkward<00:05:28.260> trying<00:05:28.740> to

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
is that it's really awkward trying to

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.500 
is that it's really awkward trying to
explain<00:05:29.190> that<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.460> have<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.580> milk<00:05:29.789> allergy<00:05:30.270> and

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
explain that I have a milk allergy and

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.480 
explain that I have a milk allergy and
like<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.320> that's<00:05:31.530> a<00:05:31.710> real<00:05:32.070> thing<00:05:32.460> that

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
like that that's a real thing that

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.760 
like that that's a real thing that
people<00:05:33.060> can<00:05:33.240> actually<00:05:33.720> have<00:05:33.930> milk<00:05:34.229> allergies

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
people can actually have milk allergies

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.560 
people can actually have milk allergies
and<00:05:35.099> then<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.550> course<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.910> biggest<00:05:36.150> pro<00:05:36.389> in

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
and then of course the biggest pro in

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.940 
and then of course the biggest pro in
Japan<00:05:36.840> is<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.139> lot<00:05:37.320> of<00:05:37.349> things<00:05:37.590> don't<00:05:37.800> have

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
Japan is that a lot of things don't have

jerk in my friend group when we're all
picking<00:05:56.280> restaurant<00:05:56.700> yeah<00:05:57.510> so<00:05:57.750> I<00:05:57.780> guess<00:05:57.870> I

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
picking restaurant yeah so I guess I

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.540 
picking restaurant yeah so I guess I
would<00:05:58.200> rather<00:05:58.349> be<00:05:58.470> lactose<00:05:58.770> intolerant<00:05:59.190> you

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
would rather be lactose intolerant you

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.150 
would rather be lactose intolerant you
can<00:05:59.760> than<00:06:00.060> in<00:06:00.150> America<00:06:00.630> which<00:06:01.260> lucky<00:06:01.650> me<00:06:01.950> is

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
can than in America which lucky me is

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.890 
can than in America which lucky me is
exactly<00:06:02.729> what<00:06:02.970> I<00:06:03.000> am<00:06:03.180> right<00:06:03.450> now

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
exactly what I am right now

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.710 
exactly what I am right now
so<00:06:04.440> that's<00:06:05.280> what<00:06:05.669> it's<00:06:05.789> like<00:06:05.849> being<00:06:06.300> lactose

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
so that's what it's like being lactose

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.200 
so that's what it's like being lactose
intolerant<00:06:07.289> or<00:06:07.380> allergic<00:06:07.889> to<00:06:08.130> milk<00:06:08.250> in<00:06:08.520> Japan
