00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hey guys what is up my here and today

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.550 
hey guys what is up my here and today
I'm<00:00:03.149> going<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.330> be<00:00:03.389> going<00:00:03.689> over<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.410> new

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
I'm going to be going over the new

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.079 
I'm going to be going over the new
animation<00:00:05.190> system<00:00:05.400> that<00:00:05.730> they're<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:06.000> to

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
animation system that they're going to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.179 
animation system that they're going to
be<00:00:06.150> introducing<00:00:06.930> into<00:00:07.319> projects<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:07.859> Boyd<00:00:08.040> in

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
be introducing into projects on Boyd in

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.400 
be introducing into projects on Boyd in
the<00:00:08.519> next<00:00:08.820> patch<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.360> here's<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.599> small<00:00:09.929> clip<00:00:10.260> of

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
the next patch so here's a small clip of

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
the next patch so here's a small clip of
it<00:00:10.500> just<00:00:10.679> basically<00:00:10.920> showing<00:00:11.370> off<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.849> you

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
it just basically showing off and you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.850 
it just basically showing off and you
might<00:00:12.300> notice<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> animations<00:00:13.410> are<00:00:13.530> so

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
might notice that the animations are so

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.129 
might notice that the animations are so
much<00:00:14.040> more<00:00:14.070> fluid<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.849> sprites<00:00:15.269> look<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.960> much

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
much more fluid the sprites look so much

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.029 
much more fluid the sprites look so much
better<00:00:16.580> Helders<00:00:17.580> even<00:00:17.820> idle<00:00:18.150> animations<00:00:18.660> now

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
better Helders even idle animations now

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.560 
better Helders even idle animations now
but<00:00:20.039> basically<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.760> reason<00:00:21.060> they're<00:00:21.330> able<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
but basically the reason they're able to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.060 
but basically the reason they're able to
do<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.960> now<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.260> because<00:00:22.410> they've<00:00:22.710> changed

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
do this now is because they've changed

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.140 
do this now is because they've changed
the<00:00:23.369> way<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.519> they're<00:00:23.789> doing<00:00:24.029> their

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
the way that they're doing their

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.810 
the way that they're doing their
animations<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.439> originally<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.519> they<00:00:26.670> do

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
animations so originally the way they do

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.429 
animations so originally the way they do
it<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> go<00:00:27.990> through<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
it was that have to go through and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.890 
it was that have to go through and
handle<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> sprites<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.750> have

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
handle all of the sprites so that have

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.299 
handle all of the sprites so that have
to<00:00:31.019> draw<00:00:31.170> them<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.529> all<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> different

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to draw them at all of the different

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.160 
to draw them at all of the different
angles<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.180> know<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> different

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
angles you know for all of the different

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.560 
angles you know for all of the different
keyframes<00:00:34.590> very<00:00:35.340> very<00:00:35.579> tedious<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> huge

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
keyframes very very tedious and a huge

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
keyframes very very tedious and a huge
pain<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> ass<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.040> developers

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
pain in the ass you know for developers

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.970 
pain in the ass you know for developers
so<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.600> they've<00:00:39.750> come<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.440> this

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
so what they've come up with is this

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.290 
so what they've come up with is this
really<00:00:41.280> cool<00:00:41.430> way<00:00:41.610> where<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.120> actually

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
really cool way where they actually

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.750 
really cool way where they actually
model<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> animate<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.129> zombies<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
model and animate the zombies the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.260 
model and animate the zombies the
characters<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> items<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.960> 3d<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.520> all

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
characters the items in 3d and then all

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.580 
characters the items in 3d and then all
they<00:00:48.420> simply<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.140> push<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> button

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
they simply have to do is push a button

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.410 
they simply have to do is push a button
and<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.190> export<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> frames<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and they can export the frames like you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.260 
and they can export the frames like you
can<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.910> makes<00:00:54.059> their

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
can see here and you know it makes their

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.850 
can see here and you know it makes their
life<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.780> easier<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
life so much easier and because of that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
life so much easier and because of that
they're<00:00:56.219> able<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.730> introduce<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.510> lot<00:00:57.840> more

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
they're able to introduce a lot more

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.250 
they're able to introduce a lot more
into<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> game<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> mean<00:01:00.750> by<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.020> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
into the game so what I mean by that is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.540 
into the game so what I mean by that is
originally<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.070> lots<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
originally you know lots of the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
originally you know lots of the
animations<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.120> were<00:01:03.180> pretty<00:01:03.449> much<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
animations they were pretty much the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
animations they were pretty much the
same<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> reason<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.280> did<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
same and the reason they did that is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
same and the reason they did that is
because<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> huge<00:01:07.140> amount<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.380> work<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
because it is a huge amount of work to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.679 
because it is a huge amount of work to
draw<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.950> many<00:01:08.130> keyframes<00:01:08.549> yourself<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.570> by

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
draw that many keyframes yourself but by

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.200 
draw that many keyframes yourself but by
doing<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.430> they're<00:01:11.430> able<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.729> add<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
doing this now they're able to add so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.580 
doing this now they're able to add so
many<00:01:12.299> more<00:01:12.540> future<00:01:12.900> arm<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.290> many<00:01:13.439> more

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
many more future arm so many more

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.980 
many more future arm so many more
features<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.400> instead<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.780> know<00:01:15.810> having

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
features so instead of you know having

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899 
features so instead of you know having
to<00:01:16.140> limit<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> animations<00:01:17.130> things<00:01:17.729> like

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
to limit the animations things like

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.660 
to limit the animations things like
yanking<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.479> axe<00:01:18.689> from<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> zombies<00:01:19.259> ribcage

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
yanking an axe from a zombies ribcage

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
yanking an axe from a zombies ribcage
decapitations<00:01:20.670> zombies<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.390> busted<00:01:21.840> legs

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
decapitations zombies with busted legs

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
decapitations zombies with busted legs
dragging<00:01:23.009> themselves<00:01:23.130> toward<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.939> all

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
dragging themselves toward you it's all

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
dragging themselves toward you it's all
possible<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.500> hopefully<00:01:25.680> we're<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
possible now so hopefully we're going to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
possible now so hopefully we're going to
be<00:01:26.189> seeing<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.640> some<00:01:26.850> more<00:01:27.030> unique<00:01:27.360> kill

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
be seeing you know some more unique kill

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.480 
be seeing you know some more unique kill
death<00:01:27.869> animations<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.829> some<00:01:29.009> more<00:01:29.159> unique

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
death animations and some more unique

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.630 
death animations and some more unique
walk<00:01:30.030> cycles<00:01:30.540> idle<00:01:30.900> animations<00:01:31.439> things<00:01:32.430> like

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
walk cycles idle animations things like
