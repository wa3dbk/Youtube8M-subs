DLC and is actually kind of interesting

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849 
DLC and is actually kind of interesting
so<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.600> testings<00:00:19.050> I've<00:00:19.199> discovered<00:00:19.619> that

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
so for my testings I've discovered that

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.859 
so for my testings I've discovered that
this<00:00:20.160> upgrade<00:00:20.850> basically<00:00:21.300> allows<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
this upgrade basically allows you to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.840 
this upgrade basically allows you to
take<00:00:22.050> 50%<00:00:22.949> less<00:00:23.279> flinch

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
take 50% less flinch

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.279 
take 50% less flinch
this<00:00:24.119> means<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.570> start<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.109> hundred

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
this means if you start with a hundred

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.050 
this means if you start with a hundred
percent<00:00:25.470> flinch<00:00:25.920> where<00:00:26.130> your<00:00:26.279> gun<00:00:26.699> goes<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
percent flinch where your gun goes a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.870 
percent flinch where your gun goes a
certain<00:00:27.359> travel<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.140> X<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.890> goes<00:00:29.189> half<00:00:29.580> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
certain travel of X it goes half that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299 
certain travel of X it goes half that
distance<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.750> go<00:00:31.019> half<00:00:31.320> X<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.859> that

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
distance so you go half X in that

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.310 
distance so you go half X in that
distance<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.790> you're<00:00:32.969> aiming<00:00:33.390> at<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> scorpion

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
distance so you're aiming at a scorpion

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.959 
distance so you're aiming at a scorpion
in<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> distance<00:00:34.890> normally<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.550> hit<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
in the distance normally you get hit it

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.520 
in the distance normally you get hit it
goes<00:00:36.210> all<00:00:36.420> wonky<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> way<00:00:37.200> across<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
goes all wonky all the way across the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.049 
goes all wonky all the way across the
screen<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.340> far<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.640> this

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
screen really really far with this

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
screen really really far with this
flinch<00:00:39.420> less<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.930> allows<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.590> half<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
flinch less it allows you to go half the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.040 
flinch less it allows you to go half the
distance<00:00:41.460> where<00:00:42.059> your<00:00:42.180> gun<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.540> wobbles

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
distance where your gun like wobbles

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
distance where your gun like wobbles
half<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> distance<00:00:43.800> away<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.280> improves<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
half the distance away and improves the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.850 
half the distance away and improves the
centering<00:00:45.629> speed<00:00:45.930> how<00:00:46.110> fast<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.530> comes<00:00:46.620> back

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
centering speed how fast it comes back

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.830 
centering speed how fast it comes back
to<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.129> center<00:00:47.370> since<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> lesser

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to the center since it when a lesser

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900 
to the center since it when a lesser
distance<00:00:48.960> away<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:50.160> makes<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.670> able<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
distance away which makes you be able to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.180 
distance away which makes you be able to
shoot<00:00:51.270> targets<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> distance<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:52.890> better

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
shoot targets in a distance a lot better

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.189 
shoot targets in a distance a lot better
now<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:54.059> downside<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:54.960> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
now the one downside to this is it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
now the one downside to this is it
actually<00:00:55.680> makes<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.730> don't<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.420> how

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
actually makes it so you don't know how

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.270 
actually makes it so you don't know how
much<00:00:57.750> damage<00:00:58.020> you're<00:00:58.289> taking<00:00:58.559> I've<00:00:58.859> had<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> few

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
much damage you're taking I've had a few

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
much damage you're taking I've had a few
times<00:00:59.520> while<00:00:59.640> using<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.030> upgrade<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.690> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
times while using this upgrade where I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.689 
times while using this upgrade where I
just<00:01:01.260> randomly<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.859> down<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> didn't<00:01:02.579> even

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
just randomly got down I didn't even

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.609 
just randomly got down I didn't even
look<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.059> help<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.260> times<00:01:04.439> I'm

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
look at my help and a lot of times I'm

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.840 
look at my help and a lot of times I'm
not<00:01:04.650> looking<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> bottom<00:01:05.549> left<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.760> my

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
not looking at the bottom left of my

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
not looking at the bottom left of my
screen<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.810> upgrade<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.320> did<00:01:07.530> make

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
screen and with this upgrade it did make

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.920 
screen and with this upgrade it did make
it<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.310> didn't<00:01:09.060> notice<00:01:09.150> myself<00:01:09.630> getting

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it so I didn't notice myself getting

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.600 
it so I didn't notice myself getting
hurt<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.380> lot<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> times<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> guys

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
hurt a lot of the times so if you guys

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
hurt a lot of the times so if you guys
do<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.450> cut<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.049> be

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
do get this up cut you have to be

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020 
do get this up cut you have to be
mindful<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:13.770> body<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.520> screen<00:01:14.729> because

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
mindful of your body your screen because

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
mindful of your body your screen because
it<00:01:15.270> definitely<00:01:15.509> does<00:01:15.900> significantly<00:01:16.110> reduce

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it definitely does significantly reduce

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.130 
it definitely does significantly reduce
the<00:01:17.040> actual<00:01:17.280> impact<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.630> screen<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the actual impact it on the screen and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140 
the actual impact it on the screen and
on<00:01:19.200> your<00:01:19.409> gun<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> might<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.610> notice<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
on your gun so you might not notice it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
on your gun so you might not notice it
before<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.990> too<00:01:22.110> late<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.799> all<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.430> all<00:01:23.580> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
before it's too late so all in all I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
before it's too late so all in all I
don't<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.659> recommend<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.259> upgrade

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
don't really recommend this upgrade

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.380 
don't really recommend this upgrade
because<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.610> down<00:01:26.909> more<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
because it will get you down more of the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
because it will get you down more of the
times<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> actually<00:01:28.350> helps<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:29.250> you
