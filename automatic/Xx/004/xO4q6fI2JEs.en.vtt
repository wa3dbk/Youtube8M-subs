00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
bought new clay that is hard crumbly and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.810 
bought new clay that is hard crumbly and
pretty<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:09.060> useless<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:11.640> box

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
pretty much useless and one of my box

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.609 
pretty much useless and one of my box
blocks<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> clay<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> bought<00:01:13.260> which<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
blocks the clay that I bought which I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
blocks the clay that I bought which I
was<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:13.860> excited<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> it's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
was really excited about is the and it's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.760 
was really excited about is the and it's
new<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.530> us<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.070> fimo<00:01:17.490> effect<00:01:18.409> our<00:01:19.409> stores

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
new to us this fimo effect our stores

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
new to us this fimo effect our stores
have<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.070> had<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.780> but<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.799> think

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
have not had this but it's I think

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.560 
have not had this but it's I think
glow-in-the-dark<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> says

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
glow-in-the-dark because it says

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
glow-in-the-dark because it says
fluorescent<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.680> I'm<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.220> concerned

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
fluorescent but I'm a little concerned

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.130 
fluorescent but I'm a little concerned
because<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:28.320> cannot<00:01:28.710> squish<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.720> I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
because I really cannot squish it so I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
because I really cannot squish it so I
guess<00:01:31.740> we'll<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.880> any<00:01:33.210> good<00:01:33.299> or<00:01:33.570> not

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
guess we'll see if it's any good or not

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.319 
guess we'll see if it's any good or not
but<00:01:34.530> normally<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> recommend<00:01:35.670> when<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.150> pick

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
but normally I recommend when you pick

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.890 
but normally I recommend when you pick
up<00:01:36.360> your<00:01:36.540> clay<00:01:37.340> in<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> store<00:01:38.820> give<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
up your clay in the store give it a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.469 
up your clay in the store give it a
squish<00:01:40.259> make<00:01:40.770> sure<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.000> hard<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
squish make sure that it's not hard as a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.990 
squish make sure that it's not hard as a
rock<00:01:42.570> because<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:44.130> many<00:01:44.369> times<00:01:44.700> bought

the effect is but I'm concerned about

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.540 
the effect is but I'm concerned about
these<00:05:14.000> because<00:05:14.330> they're<00:05:14.630> so<00:05:14.810> hard<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:16.010> don't

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
these because they're so hard so I don't

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.370 
these because they're so hard so I don't
know<00:05:16.700> if<00:05:16.970> y'all<00:05:17.210> have<00:05:17.450> been<00:05:17.480> using<00:05:18.020> them<00:05:18.260> out

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
know if y'all have been using them out

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.190 
know if y'all have been using them out
there<00:05:18.620> for<00:05:18.890> a<00:05:18.920> while<00:05:19.270> maybe<00:05:20.270> y'all<00:05:20.540> know<00:05:20.750> but

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
there for a while maybe y'all know but

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.700 
there for a while maybe y'all know but
I'm<00:05:22.190> not<00:05:22.280> sure<00:05:22.580> why<00:05:22.730> they're<00:05:22.910> so<00:05:23.120> hard<00:05:25.120> caramel

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710
