00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.410
 May 23, 2013 will be in every bufalo hearts 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.849
 engraved as saying goodbye to it 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.920
 rotten stadium 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 we saved the atmosphere for you and measured it 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.460
 for memories on this powerful 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
 evening full 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.300
 distance here who follow man so too 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.570
 born in the on if you are single now 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 legendary moments that you 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.180
 associates with the on which would that be 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.519
 to be 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.900
 undoubtedly the 6 2 against club Brugge 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 that they are the moment everyone else 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.760
 probably will mention but also 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.430
 the a 7 defeat against a roma one 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 us rebellion better than roma 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.140
 until that German referee there 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.390
 suddenly another judgment well polluted 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.010
 very unfortunate that we did benefit then 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.989
 beating with the buttocks are but 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.309
 maintains that a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.989
 another referee knew was man 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.789
 results like one of my most 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.570
 down legendary moments and up to the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.629
 stadium what makes the oops 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.280
 what made this stage so special 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.400
 where I wrote it today 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.930
 in a column for me too, the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.659
 friendship that arose in until 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.799
 stadium very important one there I have 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.510
 maybe a little bit of a fright 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.880
 in the back of the stadium a piece 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.860
 bigger piece less it personal 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.170
 otten stadium is small friendly to a 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.340
 street but really the 80s but 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.049
 then of course for the progress of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.810
 football is not that positive but what 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.790
 the atmosphere within a stadium is over 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.840
 good comes and then it makes up for me 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.979
 interesting 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.600
 lots of lots of new friends 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.470
 made my friends here for it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.869
 life 'of course 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.640
 I remember my first match 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.439
 I was seven years old 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.689
 my father was a huge wall of pain 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.570
 juice of having stood below 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.790
 homeless than they said but of course 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.710
 that was a time loved by freddy's 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.530
 to be 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.360
 and the mass segers and the role but how 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.310
 those you serve a bag of often 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.100
 natural but lost than normal yes 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.140
 hear a lot of nostalgia in which that is for you 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.180
 took the most beautiful moments 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.280
 here in the on stage for you 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.080
 bike cap there are many beautiful moments that sven 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.909
 too many to mention but I am now 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.320
 often been a journalist in 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.970
 professional 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.619
 then of course it was not supporter 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.230
 many agents 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.440
 but well that store was always in my 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.200
 heart so I am gentenaar buildings so 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.620
 that buffalo oh yes he only knows sir 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.739
 twitter a bit of nostalgia tonight and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.570
 goodbye to this ottenstad where you 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.670
 yet has also been quite a few years 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.630
 because even though long supporter actually m 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.730
 from before you 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.170
 chairman worked he is i was one 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.239
 great supporter 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.780
 then I became a member of the council of 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.880
 directors and almost 15 years as chairman 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.030
 I think that's already a whole course 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.330
 easy if you are allowed to do this for a few moments 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.850
 enumerate who will never forget that 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.290
 connects to this otten stadium which would 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.970
 that then be 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.549
 golden there are very many natural 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.140
 but to be a bit of one at your request 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.090
 she also responded in a structured way 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.750
 a number of victories of which certainly 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.860
 and fixed the 6 2 victory 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.380
 this is slippery yes i think we are 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.750
 can't forget that 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.700
 then I also have to say a little bit 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.330
 personally and and when I am president 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.430
 became and and and and the first years almost then 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.709
 the the supporters and the fans actually 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.150
 kind of started calling my name 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.070
 while normally 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.380
 that the player is like a train of what 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.090
 then also then so then wanted afterwards 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.070

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.320
 buy what plays in the edges 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.330
 calling that was a special one 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.870
 moment and then a pretty saying 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.870

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.540

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.640
 easy here and I've always had it 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.850
 done is the contact with the people 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.130
 and that's how we always like to go and also 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.780
 their supporters into a supporter 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.040
