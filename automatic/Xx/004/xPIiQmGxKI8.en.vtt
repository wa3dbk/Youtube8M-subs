at the actual settings and let's see

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.470 
at the actual settings and let's see
which<00:03:56.060> version<00:03:56.359> of<00:03:56.810> Windows<00:03:57.290> Phone<00:03:57.920> has

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
which version of Windows Phone has

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.300 
which version of Windows Phone has
pre-installed<00:03:59.480> on<00:03:59.690> this<00:03:59.959> device<00:04:00.409> so<00:04:00.769> if<00:04:01.129> we

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
pre-installed on this device so if we

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.140 
pre-installed on this device so if we
could<00:04:01.579> -<00:04:02.109> I<00:04:03.109> guess<00:04:03.650> it's<00:04:03.859> about<00:04:04.129> it<00:04:04.730> should<00:04:04.940> let

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
could - I guess it's about it should let

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.470 
could - I guess it's about it should let
us<00:04:05.269> know<00:04:05.299> that<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.879> out<00:04:07.879> of<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.090> box<00:04:08.269> we<00:04:08.420> are

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
us know that and out of the box we are

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.960 
us know that and out of the box we are
getting<00:04:08.750> Windows<00:04:09.170> Phone<00:04:09.530> 8.1<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.519> that's<00:04:10.700> nice

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
getting Windows Phone 8.1 so that's nice

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.930 
getting Windows Phone 8.1 so that's nice
so<00:04:11.659> we<00:04:11.840> do<00:04:11.959> get<00:04:12.109> a<00:04:12.319> Windows<00:04:12.680> Phone<00:04:12.709> 8.1<00:04:13.220> out<00:04:13.849> of

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
so we do get a Windows Phone 8.1 out of
