actually got two the first one would be

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.050 
actually got two the first one would be
in<00:06:13.539> the<00:06:14.289> first<00:06:14.469> movie<00:06:14.949> when<00:06:15.190> I<00:06:15.340> sounded<00:06:15.729> like<00:06:15.759> I

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
in the first movie when I sounded like I

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.080 
in the first movie when I sounded like I
just<00:06:16.449> swallowed<00:06:16.569> a<00:06:16.690> load<00:06:16.840> of<00:06:16.960> helium<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:18.520> said

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
just swallowed a load of helium and said

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.610 
just swallowed a load of helium and said
honestly<00:06:19.569> woman<00:06:19.900> you<00:06:19.960> call<00:06:20.080> yourself<00:06:20.409> our

honestly woman you call yourself our

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.080 
honestly woman you call yourself our
mother<00:06:20.860> so<00:06:21.550> I<00:06:21.580> remember<00:06:21.759> being<00:06:21.880> really

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
mother so I remember being really

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.700 
mother so I remember being really
excited<00:06:22.300> if<00:06:22.840> I<00:06:22.930> said<00:06:23.229> that's<00:06:23.380> my<00:06:23.529> mum<00:06:23.680> I

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
excited if I said that's my mum I

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.550 
excited if I said that's my mum I
probably<00:06:24.039> be<00:06:24.099> ducking<00:06:24.370> for<00:06:24.550> a<00:06:24.580> smack<00:06:24.880> so<00:06:25.560> my

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
probably be ducking for a smack so my

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.140 
probably be ducking for a smack so my
second<00:06:26.889> one<00:06:27.009> would<00:06:27.130> be<00:06:27.190> mischief<00:06:27.789> managed

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
second one would be mischief managed

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.909 
second one would be mischief managed
which<00:06:28.870> I<00:06:28.990> think<00:06:29.169> sums<00:06:29.380> up<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.560> character's

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
which I think sums up the character's

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.939 
which I think sums up the character's
pretty<00:06:30.130> well<00:06:30.569> I<00:06:31.569> think<00:06:31.930> my<00:06:32.289> favorite<00:06:32.889> line

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
pretty well I think my favorite line

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.309 
pretty well I think my favorite line
would<00:06:33.520> be<00:06:33.550> in<00:06:34.000> deafening<00:06:34.840> I<00:06:34.900> was<00:06:35.020> part<00:06:35.259> one

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
would be in deafening I was part one

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.360 
would be in deafening I was part one
when<00:06:35.680> Harry<00:06:36.069> and<00:06:36.279> Ginny<00:06:36.430> of<00:06:36.639> just<00:06:36.940> kissing<00:06:37.870> and

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
when Harry and Ginny of just kissing and

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
and I've got fewer lines than that so I

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.869 
and I've got fewer lines than that so I
