00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
really hard you've you've pushed

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.050 
really hard you've you've pushed
yourself<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.140> extended<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.060> flexibility

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
yourself you extended your flexibility

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.780 
yourself you extended your flexibility
and<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:58.170> basically<00:01:58.920> rip<00:01:59.159> your<00:01:59.369> muscles

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and your you basically rip your muscles

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.120 
and your you basically rip your muscles
in<00:01:59.939> different<00:02:00.390> ways<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.350> now<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
in different ways so now you have to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.320 
in different ways so now you have to
help<00:02:02.280> them<00:02:02.430> recover<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
help them recover it and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.440 
help them recover it and
a<00:02:03.390> nice<00:02:03.930> static<00:02:04.530> stretch<00:02:04.890> after<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> practice

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
a nice static stretch after a practice

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.350 
a nice static stretch after a practice
after<00:02:07.050> game<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.100> important<00:02:08.670> may<00:02:08.850> not<00:02:09.060> think

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
after game is so important may not think

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.590 
after game is so important may not think
that<00:02:09.540> this<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.410> important<00:02:10.979> but

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
that this is that important but

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.630 
that this is that important but
nutrition<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.840> hydration<00:02:13.050> go<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> long<00:02:14.400> way

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
nutrition and hydration go a long way

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.730 
nutrition and hydration go a long way
when<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.390> comes<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.780> preventing<00:02:16.200> injury<00:02:16.530> if

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
when it comes to preventing injury if

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
going to be much more likely to get

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.000 
going to be much more likely to get
injured<00:02:21.570> if<00:02:21.900> your<00:02:22.020> body<00:02:22.260> has<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> proper
