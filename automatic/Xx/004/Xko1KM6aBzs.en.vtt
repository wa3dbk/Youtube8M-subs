it
yeah<00:01:19.100> what<00:01:19.939> if<00:01:20.030> these<00:01:20.119> first<00:01:20.600> two<00:01:20.750> days<00:01:20.990> been

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
yeah what if these first two days been

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.139 
yeah what if these first two days been
like<00:01:21.259> in<00:01:21.770> terms<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.100> catching<00:01:22.789> up<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.060> the

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
like in terms of catching up to the
