00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
thought was cool about the these shoes

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810 
thought was cool about the these shoes
in<00:01:02.969> particular<00:01:04.070> was<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.430> came<00:01:05.640> with

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
in particular was that they came with

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.980 
in particular was that they came with
the<00:01:05.939> shoe<00:01:06.150> laces<00:01:07.909> hold<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.360> second

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the shoe laces hold on one second

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.880 
the shoe laces hold on one second
it<00:01:10.350> came<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.740> shoe<00:01:11.010> laces<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.670> match

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
it came with the shoe laces that match

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.149 
it came with the shoe laces that match
the<00:01:13.890> color<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.549> shoe<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:17.180> not<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.450> white

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
the color of the shoe and not just white

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
the color of the shoe and not just white
so<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> thought<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.790> pretty<00:01:21.030> cool<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
so I thought that was pretty cool that
they<00:01:21.810> threw<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.439> there<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.890> appreciate

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
when they put some extra stuff in there

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.310 
when they put some extra stuff in there
