and forth and I was in Los Angeles

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.200 
and forth and I was in Los Angeles
yesterday<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.350> I<00:00:35.559> was<00:00:35.770> following<00:00:36.040> it<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:36.850> it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
yesterday and I was following it and it

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.370 
yesterday and I was following it and it
looked<00:00:37.390> like<00:00:37.510> he<00:00:37.600> was<00:00:37.750> gonna<00:00:37.930> make<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.200> final

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
looked like he was gonna make the final

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.470 
looked like he was gonna make the final
table<00:00:38.740> so<00:00:39.160> I<00:00:39.190> caught<00:00:39.580> a<00:00:39.610> plane<00:00:40.000> I<00:00:40.210> flew<00:00:40.450> out

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
table so I caught a plane I flew out

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.980 
table so I caught a plane I flew out
here<00:00:40.630> just<00:00:41.020> for<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.380> day<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.890> hope<00:00:42.490> he<00:00:42.730> wins<00:00:43.000> I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
here just for the day I hope he wins I

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.250 
here just for the day I hope he wins I
think<00:00:44.770> it's<00:00:45.280> about<00:00:45.880> five<00:00:46.329> years<00:00:46.660> ago<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.079> last

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
think it's about five years ago the last

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.350 
think it's about five years ago the last
time<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.560> I<00:00:47.890> reeled<00:00:48.280> him<00:00:48.490> making<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:49.000> final

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
time that I reeled him making a final

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.240 
time that I reeled him making a final
table<00:00:49.660> at<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.870> World<00:00:50.020> Series<00:00:50.079> of<00:00:50.350> Poker<00:00:50.500> you

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
table at the World Series of Poker you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.400 
table at the World Series of Poker you
weren't<00:00:51.520> there<00:00:51.670> in<00:00:51.700> Europe<00:00:52.060> no<00:00:52.570> no<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:52.780> was<00:00:53.170> here

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
weren't there in Europe no no I was here

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.350 
weren't there in Europe no no I was here
the<00:00:53.530> last<00:00:53.560> time<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.489> last<00:00:54.520> time<00:00:54.910> he<00:00:55.090> made<00:00:55.120> a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
the last time the last time he made a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.150 
the last time the last time he made a
final<00:00:55.780> table<00:00:56.200> I<00:00:56.230> was<00:00:56.350> here<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:56.680> I<00:00:56.770> was<00:00:56.860> reeling

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
final table I was here and I was reeling

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.610 
final table I was here and I was reeling
but<00:00:57.310> it's<00:00:57.880> so<00:00:58.210> much<00:00:58.420> harder<00:00:58.630> to<00:00:58.899> reel<00:00:59.140> somebody

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
but it's so much harder to reel somebody

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.000 
but it's so much harder to reel somebody
then<00:00:59.950> actually<00:01:00.790> play<00:01:01.000> yourself<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.890> know

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
then actually play yourself and you know

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.799 
then actually play yourself and you know
