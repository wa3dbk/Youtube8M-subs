00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 I will simply have to follow a few steps 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.470
 what will i say next 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.660

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.770
 the rays with the theme of where these 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.630
 hacker 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.880
 although there is no problem that I 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.080
 If my channel at most be something I'm 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.790
 one hundred percent sure it's not going to 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.740
 spend nothing besides is another separate account 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.690
 It is not yours then if you are going or 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.790
 something is not going to happen because it 's a 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.430
 account that is linked to us 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.750
 your own so well we're going 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.790
 I am going to comment 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.430
 in a moment the requirements that you have 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.680
 what to do to participate in this draw 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.510
 The first is to subscribe to all 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.430
 channels of all the participants both 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.770
 the one of chaotic like that of beer the one of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.980
 sector of carlitos and obviously if the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.020
 you are not also 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.230
 the second step will be to lay it out of this 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.660
 video is simply worth a like no it is not 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.790
 for free, nothing is going to happen and as 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.340
 third step will be to comment participo 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.470
 ballet but attentive to this expense because 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.000
 you have to comment I participate in everything in 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.530
 all the videos are worth every one of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.570
 we will upload a video type of 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.670
 exercise here because you will see it in the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.380
 different channels that happens that we 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.540
 to catch the participants we are not going to 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.430
 catch this has commented the video of 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.350
 chaotic this in the weak and this in the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.720
 doctor no no no no we are going to 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.310
 catch some participants of a video on 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.930
 concrete let's not say which one so 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.570
 if you want to have more possibilities it is 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.250
 you have to comment on all the videos 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.350
 because imagine you comment in the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.810
 weak of cautious and in this sector and not 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.400
 comment on mine or on quali 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.260
 well imagine that we take the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.690
 comments of el carlitos then os 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.000
 you will not participate then you have 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.250
 to comment on all possible to 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.890
 have more possibilities 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.560
 and as a last step would be to follow me in 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.750
 twitter that will be in the description 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 this really is not a requirement 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.980
 obligatory but yes that goes very well 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.690
