I was putting now I had been using the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.109 
I was putting now I had been using the
wet<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.420> wavy<00:02:00.829> this<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.700> works<00:02:02.939> really

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
wet and wavy this and this works really

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.340 
wet and wavy this and this works really
good<00:02:03.329> too<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:05.700> day<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
good too but one day I was just like you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.309 
good too but one day I was just like you
know<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.500> wanted<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.629> just<00:02:09.629> rinse<00:02:09.899> off<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
know I wanted to just rinse off the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.390 
know I wanted to just rinse off the
stuff<00:02:10.619> instead<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.280> washing<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:11.790> shampoo

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
stuff instead of washing it with shampoo

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.100 
stuff instead of washing it with shampoo
because<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.030> wasn't<00:02:13.180> go<00:02:13.299> back<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.629> manage<00:02:13.900> Drake

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
because I wasn't go back to manage Drake

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.559 
because I wasn't go back to manage Drake
so<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.260> just<00:02:14.500> decided<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:15.220> day<00:02:15.640> I'm<00:02:16.480> just

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
so I just decided that day I'm just

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.759 
so I just decided that day I'm just
gonna<00:02:16.750> use<00:02:16.930> conditioner<00:02:17.470> because<00:02:17.560> it's

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
gonna use conditioner because it's

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.589 
gonna use conditioner because it's
easier<00:02:18.069> just<00:02:18.129> to<00:02:18.340> rinse<00:02:18.579> it<00:02:18.700> out<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.000> then<00:02:19.090> go

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
easier just to rinse it out and then go

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.509 
easier just to rinse it out and then go

you know a nice medium luster to it but
once<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.300> straightened<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:14.870> out<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.260> washed<00:05:15.470> it

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
once I straightened it out and washed it

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.350 
once I straightened it out and washed it
and<00:05:15.800> condition<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.670> once<00:05:16.850> I<00:05:16.970> straighten<00:05:17.270> it

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
and condition and once I straighten it

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.530 
and condition and once I straighten it
out<00:05:17.420> it<00:05:18.020> had<00:05:18.290> more<00:05:18.530> of<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.860> low<00:05:19.400> luster<00:05:19.670> which

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
out it had more of a low luster which

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.570 
out it had more of a low luster which
may<00:05:20.780> made<00:05:21.230> it<00:05:21.350> look<00:05:21.470> even<00:05:21.620> more<00:05:21.830> natural<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.340> me

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
may made it look even more natural to me

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.120 
may made it look even more natural to me

but I really like the task it's been

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.910 
but I really like the task it's been
easy<00:06:41.130> for<00:06:41.280> me<00:06:41.550> I<00:06:41.760> mean<00:06:42.000> I<00:06:42.210> like<00:06:43.140> waiting<00:06:43.830> for

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
easy for me I mean I like waiting for

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.360 
easy for me I mean I like waiting for
only<00:06:44.010> half<00:06:44.280> so<00:06:44.490> it's<00:06:44.730> been<00:06:44.910> it's<00:06:45.180> been<00:06:45.240> very<00:06:46.370> to

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
only half so it's been it's been very to

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.220 
only half so it's been it's been very to
me<00:06:47.610> I<00:06:47.640> think<00:06:47.880> it's<00:06:48.300> low<00:06:48.420> maintenance<00:06:48.450> I<00:06:48.990> mean

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
me I think it's low maintenance I mean

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.960 
me I think it's low maintenance I mean
some<00:06:49.470> people<00:06:49.710> think<00:06:49.860> curl<00:06:50.310> your<00:06:50.490> hair<00:06:50.700> is

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
some people think curl your hair is

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.700 
some people think curl your hair is
higher<00:06:51.240> maintenance<00:06:51.600> and<00:06:51.960> I<00:06:52.050> do<00:06:52.110> think<00:06:52.590> the

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
higher maintenance and I do think the

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.790 
higher maintenance and I do think the
