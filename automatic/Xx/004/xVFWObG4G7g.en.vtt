00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.780
 and what we are going to occupy are 5 chiles de 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:16.219
 tree 2 chipotle chilli 1 in chile 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.810
 morita a clove of garlic a clove a 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:24.050
 pepper and 6 chiles new mexico 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.259
 butter salt pepper oil onion 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.810
 and a pound of shrimp after 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.509
 we are busy stripping the entire pound of 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.900
 shrimp without tails without anything left 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.890
 well clean in a pan that little bit 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.370
 oil and let's put all the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.370
 chilies 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.630
 and also put slices 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.630
 onion 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:04.620
 after him and I put the pepper garlic a 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:08.210
 pinch of oregano and a clove 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.210
 and we continue to beat him 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.140
 and then I have super short bodies and 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.290
 we do not have to leave it for long either 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.580
 time since they are toasted we are going to 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.580
 put 2 cups of water 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.950
 and we stopped boiling a couple of minutes 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.070
 so that everything can be softened and 35 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.070
 minutes 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:45.670
 if we are going to accompany it with a rice with 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.670
 butter butter cheese or rice 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.650
 the way 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.650
 let's put in a butter pan 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.490
 a garlic 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.920
 and we put pieces of onions 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.500
 since it looks a little bit, it's made up of 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.870
 rice and since it is soft it can 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.990
 feel the difference by not replicating the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.540
 we are going to liquefy since the onion and the 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.340
 garlic be a little soft we are going to add 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.130
 a cup of rice over medium high heat 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.690
 medium fire and I think my page like 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.250
 you can see fill me that the difference 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.050
 between nothing of the games is not a payment 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.770
 we follow it true beating 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.050
 that problem 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.860
 since rice is grabbed like a little 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.560
 more color or white color you will 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.310
 places 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 good 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:58.410
 cups of water and you also put them 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:02.110
 chicken consommÃ© with a good average 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.690
 half a teaspoon and no master beats and 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.670
 leaves there are only six stage it covers and it 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.950
 leave only there and a pan 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.460
 I'm going to use the same we put another 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.060
 oil time 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.260
 and I think he passed my hand and I 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.260
 we put the shrimp 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:33.970
 let's caramelize the little ones and 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.710
 we put a pinch of salt and pepper and 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.710
 then we lower the fire 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.890
 and since they are more or less like this already 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:49.170
 cooked or as people would say 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.170
 know how to caramelize something 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.129
 caramelized let's add half 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:01.439
 onions in slices with slices after more 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.439
 or less a teaspoon of butter 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.890
 and when they are like this more or less is that 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.930
 I already finished it with this part sees very 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.880
 very rich in this mind not because I already 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.100
 we are cooking but I do not know about you 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.260
 well rich since the shrimp do not 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.209
 transparent we're going to get all of 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.709
 there so that they do not continue cooking and 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.709
 let's leave the onion only 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.350
 and we left one more challenge that remains 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.180
 they tell me before putting the sauce and the 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.180
 we are going to pour sauce 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.240
 you are 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.240
 and with patience because this is not fast 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.280
 and as you can see from here it does not come out 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.479
 juice this is already like the shell or 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.500
 seeds to something else and now we turn it off 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.300
 and the sauce and we put the shrimp 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.940
 again 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.159
 and now we just beat them so that 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.159
 be well bathed in the sauce 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:26.070
 and the rice we check if it is already dry 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:30.480
 it is already there and we turn it off and it seems 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:33.960
 that this girl is already going to eat and that's how 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.840
 how was the whole end of the shrimp 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.230
 the devil the rice with butter and a 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.780
 cucumber and me and my mother as are the 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.650
 Mexicans we put lemon on everything 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.900
 a slice of lemon to everyone and if this 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.470
 they liked me they asked me a lot already 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.950
 finally I could record them take care of themselves and 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.950
 see you
