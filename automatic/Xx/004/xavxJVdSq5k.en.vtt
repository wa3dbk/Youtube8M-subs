00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
kind of fishing argue easy son on it

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.120 
kind of fishing argue easy son on it
really<00:02:40.329> you<00:02:40.900> know<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.260> they<00:02:41.500> were<00:02:41.560> molested

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
really you know that they were molested

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.500 
really you know that they were molested
they<00:02:42.280> do<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:42.639> they<00:02:42.760> want<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.030> do<00:02:43.150> when<00:02:43.329> they

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
they do what they want to do when they

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.120 
they do what they want to do when they
want<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.780> do<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.290> genuinely<00:02:44.650> think<00:02:45.040> that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
want to do it and I genuinely think that

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.830 
want to do it and I genuinely think that
makes<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.549> all<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.819> more<00:02:45.850> worthwhile<00:02:46.209> you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
makes it all the more worthwhile you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.020 
makes it all the more worthwhile you
know<00:02:46.989> because<00:02:47.410> they<00:02:47.680> they<00:02:48.310> react<00:02:48.609> how<00:02:48.850> they

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
know because they they react how they

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.780 
know because they they react how they
want<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.359> react<00:02:49.600> when<00:02:49.930> they<00:02:49.959> want<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.440> react

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
want to react when they want to react

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.300 
want to react when they want to react
and<00:02:51.790> ultimately<00:02:52.690> those<00:02:53.500> fishing<00:02:53.950> forum<00:02:54.190> is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
and ultimately those fishing forum is

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.970 
and ultimately those fishing forum is
fairly<00:02:54.549> alien<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.329> basically<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.049> means<00:02:56.079> if

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
fairly alien so basically that means if

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.190 
fairly alien so basically that means if
I<00:02:57.130> get<00:02:57.370> anything<00:02:57.579> wrong<00:02:57.910> they<00:02:58.600> know<00:02:58.840> straight

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
I get anything wrong they know straight

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.479 
I get anything wrong they know straight
away<00:02:59.230> because<00:02:59.620> they're<00:02:59.859> the<00:02:59.950> master<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.310> their

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
away because they're the master of their

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.770 
away because they're the master of their
own<00:03:00.579> environment<00:03:00.880> they're<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.420> most<00:03:01.540> of

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
own environment they're the most of

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.809 
own environment they're the most of
their<00:03:01.900> habitat<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.950> know<00:03:03.100> if<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.310> drift<00:03:03.700> over

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
their habitat you know if I drift over

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.550 
their habitat you know if I drift over
them<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.269> boat<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.690> clumsily<00:03:05.109> with<00:03:05.319> an<00:03:05.410> all

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
them in the boat to clumsily with an all

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.680 
them in the boat to clumsily with an all
or<00:03:05.590> crash<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.370> bang<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:07.000> soon<00:03:07.299> see<00:03:07.540> him

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
or crash and bang you soon see him

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.300 
or crash and bang you soon see him
disappear<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.440> know<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.769> opportunity

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
disappear and you know that opportunity

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.309 
disappear and you know that opportunity
is<00:03:09.340> not<00:03:09.549> coming<00:03:09.819> again<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> think<00:03:11.019> it<00:03:11.139> makes

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
is not coming again so I think it makes

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.550 
is not coming again so I think it makes
you<00:03:11.500> hone<00:03:12.069> your<00:03:12.310> skills<00:03:12.639> more<00:03:13.540> doing<00:03:14.410> it

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
you hone your skills more doing it

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.750 
you hone your skills more doing it
because<00:03:14.769> they're<00:03:15.069> not<00:03:15.130> used<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:15.670> they're

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
because they're not used to it they're

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.129 
because they're not used to it they're
not<00:03:15.880> used<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.239> pressure<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:16.720> they're<00:03:16.870> behave

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
not used to pressure so they're behave

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.920 
not used to pressure so they're behave
naturally<00:03:17.380> which<00:03:18.220> makes<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:19.000> massive

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
naturally which makes it a massive

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.780 
naturally which makes it a massive
massive<00:03:20.260> on<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.650> really<00:03:20.980> because<00:03:21.430> there's<00:03:21.639> not

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
massive on it really because there's not

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.970 
massive on it really because there's not
I<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.780> countenance<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.349> can<00:03:23.590> count<00:03:23.799> on<00:03:23.920> to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
I can countenance I can count on to

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.319 
I can countenance I can count on to

that I know of so it does make it a
