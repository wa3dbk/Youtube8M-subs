00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
if you're gonna do this kind of project

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.979 
if you're gonna do this kind of project
definitely<00:00:34.829> practice<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.910> looks<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.480> easy<00:00:36.510> but

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
definitely practice it looks so easy but

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.860 
definitely practice it looks so easy but
it<00:00:37.559> was<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.250> easy<00:00:38.609> at<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.660> actually

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
it was not easy at all and I actually

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.529 
it was not easy at all and I actually
have<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.530> been<00:00:40.679> able<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.949> master<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:42.359> I'm

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
have not been able to master it but I'm

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.330 
have not been able to master it but I'm
also<00:00:42.780> horrible<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> kitchen<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
also horrible in the kitchen so that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
also horrible in the kitchen so that
also<00:00:44.789> helps<00:00:45.359> so<00:00:46.109> these<00:00:46.260> are<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> few<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
also helps so these are a few of the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.569 
also helps so these are a few of the
projects<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.879> she<00:00:48.149> has<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.280> learned

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
projects that she has and I have learned

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.180 
projects that she has and I have learned
that<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> can't<00:00:51.269> just<00:00:51.570> use<00:00:51.870> regular<00:00:52.230> from<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that you can't just use regular from the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.849 
that you can't just use regular from the
store<00:00:53.670> box<00:00:54.059> cake<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:55.469> some<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.769> these

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
store box cake for some of these

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.939 
store box cake for some of these
projects<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.239> not<00:00:57.739> sturdy<00:00:58.739> enough

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
projects because it's not sturdy enough

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
projects because it's not sturdy enough
and<00:01:00.589> if<00:01:01.640> it's<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.850> it'll<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.690> collapse<00:01:04.170> on

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and if it's not it'll just collapse on

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
and if it's not it'll just collapse on
itself<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.750> definitely<00:01:06.750> something<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
itself so definitely something to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.560 
itself so definitely something to
consider<00:01:07.410> I<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.800> a<00:01:07.980> good<00:01:08.250> cake<00:01:08.730> recipe<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
consider I have a good cake recipe and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
consider I have a good cake recipe and
definitely<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.470> cake<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> little

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
definitely a cake that's a little

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
definitely a cake that's a little
sturdier<00:01:11.760> than<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.390> boxes

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
sturdier than the boxes

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.180 
sturdier than the boxes
I<00:01:13.380> love<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> confetti<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:15.290> but<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.980> not<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
I love the confetti one but it was not a

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.620 
I love the confetti one but it was not a
good<00:01:17.400> choice<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.970> I'll<00:01:18.060> show<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.480> one

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
good choice and I'll show you the one

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.250 
good choice and I'll show you the one

number one the I bought the mold to make

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.690 
number one the I bought the mold to make
a<00:01:45.010> round<00:01:45.280> cake<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.270> used<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.720> box<00:01:46.960> cake<00:01:47.320> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
a round cake and I used the box cake and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.160 
a round cake and I used the box cake and
right<00:01:48.700> here<00:01:48.940> at<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.120> bottom<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.630> weight<00:01:49.840> was

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
right here at the bottom the weight was

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.320 
right here at the bottom the weight was
too<00:01:50.380> much<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.040> kind<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.520> squished<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.240> it

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
too much so it kind of squished it so it

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.630 
too much so it kind of squished it so it
just<00:01:52.360> looked<00:01:52.750> like<00:01:52.840> half<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.200> circle<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
just looked like half a circle the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.480 
just looked like half a circle the
fondant<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.510> can't<00:01:56.380> figure<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.830> out<00:01:56.950> for<00:01:57.400> the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
fondant I can't figure it out for the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.850 
fondant I can't figure it out for the
life<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.820> me<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.300> that<00:01:58.510> cat<00:01:58.780> looks<00:01:59.110> so<00:01:59.380> easy<00:01:59.410> to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
life of me and that cat looks so easy to

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.740 
life of me and that cat looks so easy to
make<00:02:00.040> I<00:02:01.440> did<00:02:02.440> not<00:02:02.650> come<00:02:02.860> out<00:02:02.950> like<00:02:03.160> that<00:02:03.370> I<00:02:04.030> need

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
make I did not come out like that I need

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.990 
make I did not come out like that I need
to<00:02:04.840> practice<00:02:05.260> more<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.830> will<00:02:06.010> definitely<00:02:06.850> try

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
to practice more I will definitely try

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.590 
to practice more I will definitely try
and<00:02:07.150> figure<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.420> out<00:02:07.570> but<00:02:07.980> in<00:02:08.980> the<00:02:09.190> meanwhile

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
and figure it out but in the meanwhile

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.680 
and figure it out but in the meanwhile
things<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.810> consider<00:02:11.230> if<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.620> try<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:13.090> she

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
things to consider if you try this she

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.750 
things to consider if you try this she
does<00:02:13.930> give<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.260> tips<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.830> how<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.160> roll<00:02:15.460> it<00:02:15.640> out

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
does give you tips on how to roll it out

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.820 
does give you tips on how to roll it out
but<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.330> looks<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:16.870> much<00:02:16.930> easier<00:02:17.500> than<00:02:17.650> it

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
but it looks so much easier than it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.550 
but it looks so much easier than it
