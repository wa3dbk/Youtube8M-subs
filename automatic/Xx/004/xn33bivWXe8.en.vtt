 Lederhosen at the tent festival but how 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.939
 always a lot of beer drunk very much 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.720
 I'm smoking at 4 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.020

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.379
 attract 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.420
 It was not possible at that time 22 years 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.360
 we thought something was right 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.239
 not with you went to work 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.300
 At the time, postbeamte was two in the morning 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.219
 Beer drank cigarettes brought on 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.160
 afternoon the family doctor comes to me 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.390
 fits and then give up letters and says 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.399
 you enjoyed a lot 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 that will look again comes to me 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.719
 to ask the ordination to lift 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.119
 We also have the kg of this whole 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.600
 best and he says to me boy now like that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.110
 you will not go on 30 yet 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.020
 always thought 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.720
 the plays but it has no peace 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 left and spent the whole night over it 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.310
 thought what that means if you 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.920
 dying with 30 that only has eight more 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.240
 You have decided then in the years 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.360
 center or book an empty book and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.210
 dvd currently on this book and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.180
 write on what I do with the catch 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.909
 the training on 16 june 1989 is before the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.130
 front door with over 100 kilo 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.939
 if not operated at all and have 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.399
 I thought no way it was possible me 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.369
 I went to two minutes was at 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.170
 have my po stunt underneath and the 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.700
 phone booth turned and I'm back after 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.610
 house and yard proud of my chit 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.030
 written 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.440
 16 june 1989 training to go four minutes 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.290
 had always thought the next day 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.850
 difficult today I'm back to 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.690
 gone to a telephone booth 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.230
 thought twice nearly 17 million in 1989 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.180
 four minutes and so on and so on 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.760
 until I suddenly noticed 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.300
 it is possible that you have 100 meters 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.340
 Running very slowly is possible 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.560
 at some point with other miles 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.420
 creates very slowly and then was at 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.010
 us in my hometown one in the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.080
 Styria a volkslauf over 10 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.580
 kilometre 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.670
 here one has thought since push now 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.540
 and believe the 10 under the sole 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.910
 glasses look 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.680
 I'm gone knows boost 200 something 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.420
 and eight kilometers was whether the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.880
 post from the fire department never had 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.010
 collapsed really collapsed 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.510
 I am going there in the wiesn and the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.209
 Firefighters project themselves on me 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.360
 says shoot when it can run 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.360
 the run was announced were the emergency doctor 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.170
 your faith war is a heart attack I am 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.840
 then got up was schwerst dance 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.670
 disappointed as followed and you have 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.680
 thought 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.989
 It was eight kilometers that's right 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.530
 because it may have something shorter 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.320
 then go to the newspaper 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.680
 Turn up and see you next week only 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.780

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.030

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.519
 he says that to me that was for me 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.930
 decisive 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.030
 I 've never seen such a fight 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.549
 as it always thought 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.140
 if the man takes care of the materials grant 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.400
 is that's what I am after that 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.570
 repeatedly went to my chit 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.690
 have continued to train and continue 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.840
