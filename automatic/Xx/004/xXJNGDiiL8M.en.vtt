00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.170

 go to the texture pack friday and today 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.740
 it's about the 6 pack mk working from 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.360
 handball rp 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.449
 yes now finally is the 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.239
 beta version for the version 1.0.1 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.949
 finally appeared from this day 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.440
 It took a long time but some 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.570
 things are in the low-flying as well as 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.410
 justin for water and have title 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.660
 but alright so the news is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.550
 this is the new blocks here as well 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.850
 have new texture but it was im 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 The foundation stone started and working 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.030
 technology is also what franck uses 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.730
 in his lp and also hannibal and yet 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.890
 many many others use this in theirs 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.590
 LPS is a quasi with a mixture of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.720
 a comic reason of one 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.350
 Realistic from a perlick texture 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.979
 pack this and where but then somewhere too 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.479
 more realistic has also been victorious than 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.610
 the comic version, so to speak, is very 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.360
 many nice things but it is more like that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.910
 a quasi standard six pack for 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.399
 minecraft and I have to be honest 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.179
 say I have bacon with this day 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.720
 started to play so it was mine 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.640
 first t shirt what i mean by what i mean 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.009
 had played head before what 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.990
 Of course default and I have to say it 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.970
 is still a nice bag away 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.870
 still after 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.000
 Almost two years since I minecraft 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.040
 not play quite true but still 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.340
 it's just a nice texture 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.620
 pack 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.070
 We are watching the other blocks here 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.260
 the farm are chosen very nice otherwise 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.050
 Here at the wheat window very nice 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.640
 made and what is right now 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.190
 was looking forward to this new one 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.360
 version beta version in some cases 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.290
 as I said, then not quite 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.330
 finished are the tools 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.220
 I take time namely that they millstone 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.490
 are still so beautiful was 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.610
 in the meantime well so much has become 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.090
 So not so comichaft but 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.959
 so by default so thin and everything and 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.780
 I think 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.300
 I have it like this with this tool 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.430
 starting with this texture and me 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.310
 think that's still that easy 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.550
 really nice texture easy for 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.650
 tools with special stone with 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.560
 these bands that stones like that 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.230
 stick together and I think it is 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.690
 just gorgeous this table mac needs 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.209
 I honestly say some blocks 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.100
 Of course not too good for 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.170
 example here as well as the band stone but 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.120
 otherwise this is really a very nice one 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.000
 texture pack so if you like it too 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.830
 then you can still download and 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.959
 in the video description i can do it 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.480
 recommend to everyone and we will wait 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.489
 Just look forward to it 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.530
 finally in the right vision that and 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.120
 not a beta version anymore but me 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.799
 But I am also the leaves here 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.200
 beautiful and yes, everything is beautiful 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.320
 on the greeting and beautiful and the lava 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.220
 not nice but we hope that one 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.549
 becomes fix 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.200
 and I want to say that because it is 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.680
 just down and have easy 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.799
 a lot of quantity amount of fun 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.959
 and the wool unfortunately has its little ones 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.549
 edging but still chic chic 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.890
 Chic Chic Chic Chic Chic 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.750
 It's good to say that it's possible 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.459
 suddenly wants to pull out in the long run 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.120

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.769

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.420
