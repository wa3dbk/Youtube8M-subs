00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.440
 yes 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.830
 very good to all welcome to this 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.920
 tutorial on how to make an insert 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.050
 the first thing that is a lynx a lot of people 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.330
 he does not know what a being is to join is like 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.160
 it is called the play or place that is done 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.599
 with leasing in which we will use 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.340
 skills of certain situations 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.270
 to take an enemy to a position 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.150
 that gives us an advantage to finish him 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.550
 there are variations of these plays and 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.090
 with the help of Manuel and I are going to see 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.420
 a few 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.390
 the first example we will use the two 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.790
 times to approach the enemy 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.250
 we will then use the w on a website that will be 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.489
 placed placed behind the enemy and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.690
 then we will give you the ultimate 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.699
 this helps us so that the enemy does not 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.260
 get to the safe zone for example if 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.720
 is a long line would not reach the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.470
 tower because he does not for that makes the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.270
 cinema very 8 and so we can finish him 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.479
 without taking damage from the tower without having 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.479
 to deal with 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.800
 in example 2 we will use the one that once 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.070
 we will place an enemy's garden 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.830
 we will use the w just in which 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.810
 we just placed 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.210
 and then we press the last 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.090
 then in that when in mine 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.520
 flying towards the direction in which 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.560
 it was coming for us we clicked again 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.210
 is personally in my favorite play 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.109
 because it is the most movement has and in 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.109
 the most complex 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.400
 good in example 3 in the case that 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.330
 We do not have a guard or we do not have it in 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.640
 cd or by 67 make it money that they 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.810
 complicate you we can use flash instead of 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:03.280
 a guard is just as effective 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.550
 and even then wonderful to make a 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.500
 played with flash but use a guard to 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.150
 return to a safe position then do 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.640
 even action this video showed a 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.030
 way to improve that play now let's go 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.600
 to see a couple of insel places that are 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.910
 Well, if they catch you there, they 're dead 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.780
 because as you know Lisin has Europe 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.180
 who is very knowledgeable and good 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.490
 go through walls then there are walls 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.200
 that if you are in a place and they take you 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.210
 to another is the whole team with different 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.510
 of that you are dead, consider yourself 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.510
 dead 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.160
 well here you have a couple of examples in 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.160
 some game that we have played 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.900
 thank you very much to manolillo his gunner 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.299
 for the chorizos for helping me in these 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.040
 plays I hope they serve and what 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.129
 practice a lot I want to see a lot 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.480
 people flying by him and finally see if 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.079
 you liked the nest 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.829
 I hope you give it to her and share 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:21.609
 and apologize if it's a little bland at the time 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:24.760
 to talk because he recorded me a bit to 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.420
 do tutorials and well was my first 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.490
 time 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.640
 see you in the next video up 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.640
 then 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.720
