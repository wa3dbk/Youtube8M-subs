this video is a reveal it's actually a
pre<00:00:09.240> loved<00:00:09.450> item<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.080> it's<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.070> Sameer<00:00:11.610> 30

pre loved item and it's the Sameer 30

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.250 
pre loved item and it's the Sameer 30
here's<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> back<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.219> already<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.260> packed

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
here's the back I already have it packed

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.560 
here's the back I already have it packed
with<00:00:16.770> stuff<00:00:17.480> pretty<00:00:18.480> much<00:00:20.210> full-on<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> don't

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
with stuff pretty much full-on I don't

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.750 
with stuff pretty much full-on I don't
believe<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.109> fit<00:00:22.350> anything<00:00:22.619> else<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.369> here

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
believe I can fit anything else in here

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.650 
believe I can fit anything else in here
but<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.720> size<00:00:25.050> 30<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:26.310> believe<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
but this is the size 30 I believe that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.160 
but this is the size 30 I believe that
is<00:00:27.840> equivalent<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.800> mm<00:00:29.369> size<00:00:29.760> now<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.900> has

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
is equivalent to the mm size now it has

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.370 
is equivalent to the mm size now it has
such<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.679> gorgeous<00:00:32.130> patina<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.480> even<00:00:34.079> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
such a gorgeous patina it's very even I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.630 
such a gorgeous patina it's very even I
think<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.480> where<00:00:36.719> these<00:00:36.930> straps

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
think just right here where these straps

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.810 
think just right here where these straps
I<00:00:39.050> guess<00:00:40.050> go<00:00:40.320> into<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.280> little<00:00:41.489> loop<00:00:41.790> here

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
I guess go into this little loop here

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.650 
I guess go into this little loop here
there's<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:43.430> maybe<00:00:44.430> dirt<00:00:45.059> buildup

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
there's like a little maybe dirt buildup

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720 
there's like a little maybe dirt buildup
or<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.230> mark<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.829> that's<00:00:47.039> seriously

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
or a little mark but that's seriously

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.540 
or a little mark but that's seriously

so<00:04:48.980> fits<00:04:49.700> quite<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.000> lot<00:04:50.330> now<00:04:50.360> when<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:50.990> pick<00:04:51.200> up

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
so fits quite a lot now when I pick up

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.730 
so fits quite a lot now when I pick up
my<00:04:51.380> speedy<00:04:52.330> pretty<00:04:53.330> heavy<00:04:53.570> and<00:04:54.910> there's<00:04:55.910> a

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
my speedy pretty heavy and there's a

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.780 
my speedy pretty heavy and there's a
bunch<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.919> stuff<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:58.370> there

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
bunch of stuff in there

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.040 
bunch of stuff in there
I<00:04:58.820> mean<00:04:59.410> it's<00:05:00.410> pretty<00:05:00.770> packed<00:05:01.600> so<00:05:02.600> I<00:05:02.630> mean

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
I mean it's pretty packed so I mean

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.690 
I mean it's pretty packed so I mean
there's<00:05:03.229> a<00:05:03.290> little<00:05:03.650> bit<00:05:03.770> of<00:05:03.889> space<00:05:04.130> in<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.520> top

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
there's a little bit of space in the top

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.719 
there's a little bit of space in the top
if<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.090> want<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.419> throw<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.780> shawl<00:05:06.080> in<00:05:06.410> here

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
if you want to throw a shawl in here

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.060 
if you want to throw a shawl in here
this<00:05:08.419> one<00:05:08.780> you'd<00:05:09.050> probably<00:05:09.260> have<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.800> tie<00:05:10.010> the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
this one you'd probably have to tie the

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.340 
this one you'd probably have to tie the
SHA<00:05:10.370> on<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.610> side<00:05:10.880> but<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:11.780> fits<00:05:12.020> everything

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
SHA on the side but it fits everything

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.080 
SHA on the side but it fits everything
that<00:05:12.860> a30<00:05:13.760> fit<00:05:14.150> so<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:15.490> mean<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.580> need<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:16.850> carry

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
that a30 fit so I mean I need to carry

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.290 
that a30 fit so I mean I need to carry
it<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.270> little<00:05:17.419> bit<00:05:17.570> more<00:05:17.810> but<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:19.090> really<00:05:20.090> like

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
it a little bit more but I really like

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.890 
it a little bit more but I really like
it<00:05:20.540> and<00:05:20.950> also<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.370> same<00:05:22.669> stuff<00:05:23.150> in<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.600> speedy

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
it and also the same stuff in the speedy

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.320 
it and also the same stuff in the speedy
the<00:05:24.110> speedy<00:05:24.380> feels<00:05:24.650> heavier<00:05:25.130> this<00:05:26.000> feels<00:05:26.240> very

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
the speedy feels heavier this feels very

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.719 
the speedy feels heavier this feels very
lightweight<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:27.050> don't<00:05:27.350> know<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:28.400> know<00:05:28.520> and

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
lightweight I don't know you know and

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.070 
lightweight I don't know you know and
that<00:05:28.850> was<00:05:29.000> one<00:05:29.240> of<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.419> things<00:05:29.660> I<00:05:29.780> liked<00:05:29.960> about

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
that was one of the things I liked about

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.469 
that was one of the things I liked about
the<00:05:30.320> speedy<00:05:30.620> is<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.400> could<00:05:31.970> put<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.300> same

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
the speedy is that I could put the same

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.180 
the speedy is that I could put the same
stuff<00:05:32.750> in<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:32.930> different<00:05:32.960> bag<00:05:33.470> and<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:33.979> bag

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
stuff in a different bag and that bag

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.860 
stuff in a different bag and that bag
would<00:05:34.310> feel<00:05:34.520> heavier<00:05:34.880> than<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.150> speedy<00:05:35.479> so<00:05:35.840> I

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
would feel heavier than the speedy so I

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.420 
would feel heavier than the speedy so I
thought<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:36.350> speedy<00:05:36.620> was<00:05:36.800> designed<00:05:37.160> pretty

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
thought the speedy was designed pretty

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.330 
thought the speedy was designed pretty
well<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.940> make<00:05:38.419> that<00:05:38.690> weight<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.320> don't<00:05:40.100> know<00:05:40.190> if

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
well to make that weight I don't know if

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.950 
well to make that weight I don't know if
it's<00:05:40.460> anchored<00:05:40.880> just<00:05:41.120> with<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.360> handles<00:05:41.750> that

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
it's anchored just with the handles that

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.320 
it's anchored just with the handles that
makes<00:05:42.140> it<00:05:42.320> not<00:05:42.500> as<00:05:42.680> heavy<00:05:42.919> feeling<00:05:43.460> but<00:05:44.030> this

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
makes it not as heavy feeling but this

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.420 
makes it not as heavy feeling but this
is<00:05:44.630> excellent<00:05:45.169> and<00:05:45.380> obviously<00:05:45.890> you<00:05:46.100> have<00:05:46.340> it

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
is excellent and obviously you have it

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.600 
is excellent and obviously you have it
across<00:05:46.640> your<00:05:46.850> body<00:05:46.910> but<00:05:47.710> this<00:05:48.710> also<00:05:48.979> has<00:05:49.310> this

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
across your body but this also has this

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.480 
across your body but this also has this
wider<00:05:50.600> part<00:05:51.020> to<00:05:51.229> the<00:05:51.320> strap<00:05:51.650> right<00:05:51.889> here<00:05:51.950> to<00:05:52.340> go

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
wider part to the strap right here to go

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.920 
wider part to the strap right here to go
over<00:05:52.639> your<00:05:52.760> shoulder<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:53.389> that<00:05:53.570> you're<00:05:53.780> not

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
over your shoulder so that you're not

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.590 
over your shoulder so that you're not
digging<00:05:54.560> into<00:05:54.710> your<00:05:54.889> shoulder<00:05:55.400> like<00:05:55.789> some

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
digging into your shoulder like some

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.409 
digging into your shoulder like some
people<00:05:56.840> complain<00:05:57.169> about<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.710> never<00:05:57.889> full<00:05:58.419> so

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
people complain about the never full so

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.950 
people complain about the never full so
it<00:05:59.600> lays<00:05:59.780> nice<00:06:00.169> fat<00:06:00.620> flat<00:06:01.389> along<00:06:02.389> the<00:06:02.660> top<00:06:02.840> of

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
it lays nice fat flat along the top of

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.340 
it lays nice fat flat along the top of
your<00:06:03.050> shoulder<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.919> I<00:06:04.760> love<00:06:05.210> it<00:06:05.360> but<00:06:05.840> this<00:06:06.139> is

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
your shoulder and I love it but this is

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.279 
your shoulder and I love it but this is
a<00:06:06.380> rout<00:06:06.710> of<00:06:06.889> the<00:06:07.060> reveal<00:06:08.060> video<00:06:08.240> and<00:06:08.690> I<00:06:09.110> guess

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
a rout of the reveal video and I guess

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.260 
a rout of the reveal video and I guess
I'll<00:06:09.470> use<00:06:09.500> it<00:06:09.860> maybe<00:06:10.010> for<00:06:10.340> two<00:06:10.550> or<00:06:10.729> three<00:06:11.000> weeks

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
I'll use it maybe for two or three weeks

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.440 
I'll use it maybe for two or three weeks
and<00:06:11.570> I<00:06:12.169> will<00:06:12.410> possibly<00:06:13.340> come<00:06:13.550> back<00:06:13.760> with<00:06:14.419> a

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
and I will possibly come back with a

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.950 
and I will possibly come back with a
review<00:06:14.900> video<00:06:15.320> if<00:06:15.919> any<00:06:16.190> of<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.490> want<00:06:16.729> that<00:06:17.030> you
