00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 and your nose red here and yes I have one 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.090
 kind of webcam now 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.160
 And yes the human now on my macbook 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.500
 that is why I am actually called for it 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.289
 no yes 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 web someone because yes or celebrate my macbook 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 to recorders a little glue actually 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 so but now I have and the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.000
 webcam a day through that was nice for that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.090
 this video 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.609
 and well welcome to 2014 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.369
 and I hope we will yes this year 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.600
 can make further videos 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.579
 And then I'm sure that there is 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 is going to happen because of course we have 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.430
 still the role and the l series where you still 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.989
 really want to go further and yes there 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.789
 I also have some actors where 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 that pathetic my next videos back 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.789
 To get some more actors we put in the videos 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 but for now why did it take so long 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.030
 long before we came to videos 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.820
 of course vacation 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.739
 but this week was busy with school and me 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 actually wanted to show me why 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.739
 the awkward was so busy with school 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.710
 namely I was working on a project you 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.560
 yes that is called grade of programming 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.860
 yes that she has a school lesson and needs to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.530
 So you make a game for yes for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.710
 school and I am working on one together 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.430
 classroom chow chow mein room and so we make 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.770
 a 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.659
 a game in a web browser and then think 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.909
 you only have a game and the web browser true 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.330
 we really make a 3d game in a web 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.369
 browser 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.420
 but because ali is pretty fat and for me 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.210
 it is also a bit new that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 techniques so but i will go for a while 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.860
 just show you how it all works 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.860
 works 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.299
 so here we have our tank game we 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.399
 also have precisely built in there 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.310
 yes what you see now is all still at home 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.619
 on the tests and oh those yes those tags above 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.180
 those that fall because of them are broken 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.399
 but so what you see is everything else 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.909
 bit so tess world 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.070
 we currently have a 3d 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.590
 There is a model for us who has the idea of ​​drinks 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.659
 makes 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.909
 yes we have kind of chosen to 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.569
 a bit sort of loop polygram set 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.759
 to make 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.160
 and yes very keem is completely 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.120
 so made from the 3d fish or dirt from one 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.530
 physics 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.209
 up to the 3d models so yes and you 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.500
 can really do everything this works 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:28.870
 everything in a browser is possible 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:33.819
 show then I just have to do that 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.819
 you end up on the website 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.849
 And yes this is just in the browser as you 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:46.489
 go to see you then you just go 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.700
 to loading screen 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.700
 click on start and just watch player 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.549
 Right now you can will really die too 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.040
 so you are only slightly stronger 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:02.690
 then the and exactly who well to walk again 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.549
 villages and you just see twice hit 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.610
 or three times the case is me again 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:13.340
 how often were you full a few times 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.420
 so you have to loft a lot too 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.609
 models and come for example these 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.440
 models here that are pretty good 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.970
 only if the esmolol sister is small 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.010
 beach with a kind of cubes that 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.230
 we tip drive to watch that 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.709
 had it built in to test if the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.450
 physics you could use a little bottle 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:35.810
 Really everywhere about a row of t-ara you 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.889
 calls that profession I hope okay and yes we do 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.989
 search may actually be even more so 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.239
 people to have a drink 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.709
 so if you are good at blender understanding 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.739
 had blender 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.349
 send us some loop polygram that you like this 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.849
 style six trees a bit this tank 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.450
 if yes yes yes yes blender cheat you were there 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.959
 good at it 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.480
 and yes show and show and maybe 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.579
 can you help us with this game 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.959
 what we go natural next to school 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.310
 we are going to need this cake out properly 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.269
 to expand 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.049
 because we wanted to just real 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.870
 make a full game well for the rest 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.540
 worry thinking maybe i wanted to 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.209
 some kind of launches how to make out 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.949
 explain how to create and play a game 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.739
 that fall and game in 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.720
 in the web browser because I am just now 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.569
 been doing, I know what it 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.039
 quite a lot of these 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.479
 and yes maybe it was nice too 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.550
 to know how to do that 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.770
 so if you like it late in the 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.939
 comments know yes let's come 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.099
 know if you are interested in it 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:39.139
 make moodle's for this game and then 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.689
 watch out in blender 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.030
 blender is also an open source 3d 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.860
 program completely free so even though you can 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.530
 you still in that the tree demon de le 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.860
 said download it and go try us 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.120
 really really nice and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.509
 but then I would join the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.509
 been upset 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.300
 for other things and for me now 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.580
 do n't think for a moment 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.819
 and yes they will come again from now on 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.719
 enough videos out so until the next 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.719
 video
