now<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> middlemost<00:00:47.100> design<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> appreciated

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
now the middlemost design is appreciated

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
now the middlemost design is appreciated
but<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.320> complaint<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
but we just have one complaint and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
but we just have one complaint and
that's<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> pointy<00:00:51.390> corners<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.110> its<00:00:52.260> facade

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that's the pointy corners on its facade

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
that's the pointy corners on its facade
which<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.520> sharp<00:00:53.789> enough<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> cause<00:00:54.329> more

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
which are sharp enough to cause more

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.439 
which are sharp enough to cause more
than<00:00:54.660> superficial<00:00:55.500> cuts<00:00:56.120> well<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.180> promise

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
than superficial cuts well the promise

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.910 
than superficial cuts well the promise
is<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.719> rat<00:00:57.930> there's<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.710> lot<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
is that rat there's actually a lot of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.939 
is that rat there's actually a lot of
tech<00:00:59.489> involved<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.600> they're<00:01:01.170> exactly<00:01:01.559> 64

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
tech involved here they're exactly 64

now<00:01:04.979> these<00:01:05.400> squares<00:01:05.909> law<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.540> produced

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
now these squares law down it produced

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.320 
now these squares law down it produced
some<00:01:07.020> interesting<00:01:07.439> patterns<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> animations

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
some interesting patterns and animations

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
some interesting patterns and animations
and<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:10.560> gotta<00:01:10.710> say<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.280> light<00:01:11.549> emitted<00:01:11.939> by

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and we gotta say the light emitted by

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.539 
and we gotta say the light emitted by
each<00:01:12.240> LED<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.869> blinding<00:01:13.560> each<00:01:14.070> square<00:01:14.400> has

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
each LED is blinding each square has

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.910 
each LED is blinding each square has
