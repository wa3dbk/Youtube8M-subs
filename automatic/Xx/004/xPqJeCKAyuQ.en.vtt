00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.550
 setting up a project 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.700
 now that we have our material 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.820
 We will submit the request as you prefer. 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.090
 some in the same way as materials 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.189
 Let's start by pressing the new button one 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.440
 window will open suggest a number that 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.900
 you can change if you want 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.290
 in our case we will simply accept 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.309
 giving an enrollment worksheet ok 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.910
 open 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.980
 Let's give a name to the project 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.290
 example cabinet two doors 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.260
 if you want we can also put a 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.800
 remark any example your oscar 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.300
 who is our fictitious client and also 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 We can put the name of who is 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.610
 preparing calculation but let's go now 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.329
 dictate the list of parts that make up this 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.860
 armed 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.950
 two pieces of 1,600 by 420 millimeters 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.780
 that will be the sides 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.110
 we will also need two pieces of 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.500
 870 by 420 millimeters 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.660
 As the number above is already 420 it's just for 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.330
 understand the program copy 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.149
 you do not need to retype it 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.910
 thing in relation to the material code is 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.979
 only 40 and now let's put in description 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:31.280
 base base is slightly smaller 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.280
 1,600 by 370 millimeters and the rest we go 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.810
 in one we only add in the description the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.500
 central word 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.130
 we also have two shelves of 870 per 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:48.970
 370 millimeters in have again 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:54.670
 we wrote shelves and two doors of 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.670
 445 for 1495 minutes 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.770
 and the footers are still missing the bottom 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.610
 but for example it is enough just to see 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.610
 okay and you're done
