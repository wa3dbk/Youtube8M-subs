00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
didn't think was worth covering before

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.710 
didn't think was worth covering before
but<00:00:18.200> now<00:00:18.410> after<00:00:18.800> looking<00:00:19.220> at<00:00:19.310> it<00:00:19.369> for<00:00:19.700> a<00:00:20.000> couple

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
of days I found it quite useful addition

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.589 
of days I found it quite useful addition
and<00:00:24.380> it's<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.830> daydream<00:00:25.670> of<00:00:25.699> facility<00:00:26.420> that's

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
and it's the daydream of facility that's

and it's the daydream of facility that's
available<00:00:26.810> now<00:00:27.619> in<00:00:28.220> order<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.490> use<00:00:28.670> it<00:00:28.820> it's

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
available now in order to use it it's

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.550 
available now in order to use it it's
tucked<00:00:29.240> away<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.510> little<00:00:29.660> bit<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.259> you<00:00:30.349> have<00:00:30.470> to

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
tucked away a little bit so you have to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.369 
tucked away a little bit so you have to
go<00:00:30.679> to<00:00:30.740> settings<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:33.230> then<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:34.280> display<00:00:34.760> and

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
then a new option here is the daydream

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.610 
then a new option here is the daydream
option<00:00:39.320> here<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.430> what<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:41.540> basically<00:00:41.989> does

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
option here so what this basically does

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.500 
option here so what this basically does

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
plugged in and charging the screen will

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.830 
plugged in and charging the screen will
go<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.910> this<00:00:50.300> kind<00:00:50.600> of<00:00:50.809> screen<00:00:51.320> saver<00:00:52.840> option

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
go to this kind of screen saver option

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.410 
go to this kind of screen saver option
rather<00:00:54.469> than<00:00:54.800> turning<00:00:55.789> off<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:55.969> screen<00:00:56.270> and

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
rather than turning off the screen and

rather than turning off the screen and
kind<00:00:56.690> of<00:00:56.750> going<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:56.989> sleep<00:00:57.160> so<00:00:58.160> if<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:58.760> just<00:00:59.000> down

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
kind of going to sleep so if I just down

kind of going to sleep so if I just down
straight<00:00:59.390> very<00:00:59.539> quickly<00:00:59.719> because<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.199> can<00:01:00.379> turn

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
straight very quickly because I can turn

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.340 
straight very quickly because I can turn
on<00:01:00.859> daydream<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:01.730> show<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:01.940> by<00:01:02.629> press<00:01:02.930> Start

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
now this is what the daydream facility

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.790 
now this is what the daydream facility
would<00:01:06.649> look<00:01:06.860> like<00:01:07.119> if<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.539> was<00:01:08.840> docked<00:01:09.470> or

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
would look like if it was docked or

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.320 
would look like if it was docked or
plugged<00:01:10.190> in<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.459> can<00:01:10.640> there<00:01:10.819> choose<00:01:11.209> the

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
option if you wish and in this example

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.490 
option if you wish and in this example
it's<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.250> very<00:01:13.520> simple<00:01:13.700> clock<00:01:14.119> but<00:01:15.110> there<00:01:15.349> are

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
it's a very simple clock but there are

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.210 
it's a very simple clock but there are
many<00:01:16.130> options<00:01:16.340> available<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.300> as<00:01:17.990> more<00:01:18.770> apps

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
many options available and as more apps

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.540 
many options available and as more apps
are<00:01:19.670> tip<00:01:20.330> making<00:01:20.660> use<00:01:20.869> of<00:01:20.899> this<00:01:21.259> your<00:01:22.160> list<00:01:22.399> is

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
are tip making use of this your list is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.919 
are tip making use of this your list is
likely<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.910> increase<00:01:23.000> with<00:01:23.569> more<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:23.899> more

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
likely to increase with more and more

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.080 
likely to increase with more and more
ups<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:24.979> another<00:01:25.160> example<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:25.789> I<00:01:25.910> deal

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
ups so just another example is if I deal

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.130 
ups so just another example is if I deal
with<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.270> battery<00:01:26.509> widget<00:01:26.869> reborn<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.890> do<00:01:28.640> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
with a battery widget reborn and do the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.359 
with a battery widget reborn and do the
stadium<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.200> game<00:01:30.229> it's<00:01:30.770> just<00:01:30.979> going<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.220> give

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
stadium a game it's just going to give

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.510 
stadium a game it's just going to give
me<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.729> constant<00:01:32.450> read<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.709> battery<00:01:33.920> now

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
me a constant read of a battery now

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.410 
me a constant read of a battery now
which<00:01:34.700> might<00:01:34.880> be<00:01:34.970> useful<00:01:35.090> when<00:01:35.330> you're

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
which might be useful when you're

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.839 
which might be useful when you're
charging<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:36.140> show<00:01:36.289> you<00:01:36.349> quickly<00:01:36.679> how<00:01:36.860> quickly

charging to show you quickly how quickly

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:41.109 
charging to show you quickly how quickly
your<00:01:38.360> battery<00:01:39.050> is<00:01:39.289> charging<00:01:39.709> another<00:01:40.520> good

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
your battery is charging another good

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.440 
your battery is charging another good
example<00:01:41.209> and<00:01:41.770> this<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.979> for<00:01:43.399> news<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:44.420> a

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
example and this is for news this is a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.770 
example and this is for news this is a
biggie<00:01:44.929> and<00:01:45.229> again<00:01:45.709> if<00:01:45.830> I<00:01:45.950> start<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.780> day

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
biggie and again if I start the day

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.570 
biggie and again if I start the day
dream<00:01:47.989> is<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:48.349> going<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.560> rotate<00:01:48.800> through<00:01:49.369> a

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
dream is just going to rotate through a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.410 
dream is just going to rotate through a
range<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.599> stories<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:52.520> think<00:01:52.819> every<00:01:53.179> few

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
range of stories and I think every few

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.969 
range of stories and I think every few
seconds<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.899> will<00:01:53.989> go<00:01:54.140> from<00:01:54.259> one<00:01:54.470> headline<00:01:54.830> to

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
seconds it will go from one headline to

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.880 
seconds it will go from one headline to
another<00:01:55.190> headline<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:55.849> I<00:01:56.720> also<00:01:57.319> it<00:01:57.619> gives<00:01:57.739> me

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
another headline and I also it gives me

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.320 
another headline and I also it gives me
access<00:01:58.069> to<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.429> application<00:01:58.520> itself<00:01:58.940> if<00:01:59.239> I

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
access to the application itself if I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.059 
access to the application itself if I
press<00:01:59.599> on<00:01:59.750> that<00:01:59.899> new<00:02:00.050> story<00:02:00.319> it<00:02:00.770> will<00:02:00.920> then

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
press on that new story it will then

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.490

the<00:02:03.679> particular<00:02:03.979> stories<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.849> so<00:02:05.599> that's<00:02:05.750> a

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
the particular stories and so that's a

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.270 
the particular stories and so that's a
nice<00:02:06.170> feature<00:02:06.500> as<00:02:06.830> well<00:02:07.149> each<00:02:08.149> set<00:02:08.959> each

application<00:02:10.280> or<00:02:10.819> daydream<00:02:11.660> works<00:02:12.320> in<00:02:12.500> a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
application or daydream works in a

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
application or daydream works in a
slightly<00:02:12.890> different<00:02:13.040> way<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:14.150> if<00:02:14.450> i<00:02:14.690> go<00:02:14.720> to

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
slightly different way so if i go to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.010 
slightly different way so if i go to
currents<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.730> do<00:02:17.210> exactly<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.690> same

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020

a game is as a news aggregating app but
now<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.610> giving<00:02:22.970> me<00:02:23.000> some<00:02:23.510> rotating<00:02:24.080> news<00:02:24.260> so

currents<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.450> then<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.660> would<00:02:38.750> actually

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
currents and then it would actually

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.320 
currents and then it would actually
launch<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.680> application<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.610> as<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.210> can

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
launch the application and as you can

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.050 
launch the application and as you can
see<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.870> flicked<00:02:42.230> back<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:43.430> daydream

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
see that it flicked back to the daydream

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.390 
see that it flicked back to the daydream
style<00:02:44.750> without<00:02:45.470> me<00:02:45.740> having<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:46.010> do<00:02:46.190> anything

so it's a nice feature and each
application<00:02:49.340> works<00:02:49.700> very<00:02:49.910> differently<00:02:49.970> as

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
application works very differently as

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.000 
application works very differently as
you<00:02:50.600> can<00:02:50.750> save<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.960> some<00:02:51.170> little<00:02:51.620> option
