00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.710
 glaucoma is a disease of the nerve 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.920
 optical the optic nerve is the cable that 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.930
 connects what we see with the brain with 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.360
 this disease occurs a deterioration 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.210
 very slow of the fibers of this nerve 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.550
 optical so that little by little it goes 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.199
 losing visual function in a first 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.480
 time most patients do not 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.369
 they notice practically nothing because what 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.190
 is lost is vision of the laterals and 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.780
 the center stays well in stadiums 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.310
 early in the disease there are patients 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.130
 that they notice that maybe they have more 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.530
 falls more accidents or they are a bit 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.780
 more clumsy but many times this does not 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.370
 attributed to a visual problem and 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.340
 then it usually happens a lot 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.380
 unnoticed everyone can 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.300
 have glaucoma but there is a 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.820
 series of risk factors that give us 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.710
 greater propensity to have the disease 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.490
 above all they are having the pressure of 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.860
 elevated eye 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.690
 having a background in the family that 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.360
 practically multiplies by four the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.930
 risk and then age and from the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.310
 60 years it is easier to have the disease 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.240
 There are other risk factors such as 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.220
 example being short-sighted hit on the eye 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.430
 take certain medications but they are already 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.930
 less important in Spain is calculated 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.360
 that there are approximately one million 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.130
 people affected and the problem more 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.290
 great that has precisely because no 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.960
 has symptoms is that many of them 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.610
 almost 50 percent do not know yet 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.250
 who has the disease because they have not 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.410
 it came to be diagnosed once the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.300
 disease what we do is apply a 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.130
 treatment and to this day the most 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.229
 effective is to lower eye pressure 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.910
 we can get this from several 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.190
 ways and usually in a first 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.340
 moment is with drops if this does not work 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.869
 you have to use other techniques and that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.240
 we can apply them here in the institut 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.869
 of the macula and the retina as they are the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.320
 laser or already surgeries with implants 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.540
 various types 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.360
 anyway what is more 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.860
 important is from 40 years old 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.750
 have a checkup that includes the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.789
 intraocular pressure and the evaluation of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.750
 optic nerve to be able to diagnose 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.750
 time this disease
