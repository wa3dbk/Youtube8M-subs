00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.610
 reaching these points is not easy for the two agents 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.910

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.309
 able to defeat those in seconds 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.580

 because they are very touched and Christian is finished with a brutal stab 

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:17.089
 in the back 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:21.099
 the rock platform they are on is beginning to collapse and a 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:23.069
 moribund wesker falls to the lava 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.210
