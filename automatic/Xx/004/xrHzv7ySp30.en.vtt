kirchhoff neeps q method with a few with
a<00:00:14.940> few<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.269> stairs<00:00:15.480> eggs<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.420> so<00:00:18.420> I'm<00:00:18.570> not

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
a few of stairs eggs in it so I'm not

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.179 
a few of stairs eggs in it so I'm not
gonna<00:00:18.840> not<00:00:19.410> really<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.010> over

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
gonna not really going to be going over

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.470 
gonna not really going to be going over
the<00:00:20.369> algorithms<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.850> used<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.390> can

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the algorithms I used because you can

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.230 
the algorithms I used because you can
find<00:00:21.689> those<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.740> website<00:00:23.150> they're<00:00:24.150> all

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
find those on the website they're all

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.670 
find those on the website they're all
just<00:00:24.390> show<00:00:24.510> my<00:00:24.660> thought<00:00:24.840> process<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.500> what<00:00:25.650> I

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
just show my thought process and what I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500 
just show my thought process and what I
would<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.220> what<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.460> would<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.029> how<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
would see in what I would do and how I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.910 
would see in what I would do and how I
would<00:00:27.779> recognize<00:00:28.170> stuff<00:00:33.290> okay<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
would recognize stuff okay so in this

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.770 
would recognize stuff okay so in this
first<00:00:34.980> scramble<00:00:35.579> um<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:37.070> think<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.550> would<00:00:39.239> go<00:00:39.750> for

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
first scramble um I think I would go for

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.869 
first scramble um I think I would go for
white<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:41.850> under<00:00:42.840> start<00:00:43.110> putting<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.920> white

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
white I under start putting this white

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.200 
white I under start putting this white
right<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:48.410> this<00:00:49.410> can

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
right there so that's there now this can

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
right there so that's there now this can
go<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.800> oh

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
go there like that and then that me oh

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.270 
go there like that and then that me oh
there<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:58.649> take<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
there and this one let's take it out and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810 
there and this one let's take it out and
rotate<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> put<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.570> back<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:01.100> um<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.640> now<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
rotate it and put it back in um so now I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.890 
rotate it and put it back in um so now I
see<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> peanut<00:01:03.899> case<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
see I have the peanut case and the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.870 
see I have the peanut case and the
yellow<00:01:06.900> centers<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.500> back<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
yellow centers in the back like that so

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.399 
yellow centers in the back like that so
I<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> inverse<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> algorithm

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I can do the inverse of the algorithm

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.859 
I can do the inverse of the algorithm
it's<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> website<00:01:11.540> because<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.750> would

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it's on the website because that would

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.840 
it's on the website because that would
solve<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> yellow<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
solve it if the yellow is there but this

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.300 
solve it if the yellow is there but this
way<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.780> elbows<00:01:16.020> back<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:16.920> I'll

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
way if the elbows back here and so I'll

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.359 
way if the elbows back here and so I'll
end<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.350> with<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> center<00:01:19.740> matching

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
end up with the with the center matching

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.330 
end up with the with the center matching
went<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:23.810> like<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.990> let's<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.159> have

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
went up like that let's now I just have

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:39.550 
went up like that let's now I just have
to<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.140> next<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.479> would

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.340 

go<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.590> yellow<00:01:41.210> um<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.229> had

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
go for yellow um so I see that I had

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.039 
go for yellow um so I see that I had
these<00:01:43.560> two<00:01:43.920> yellow<00:01:44.430> orange<00:01:45.210> corners<00:01:45.899> right

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
these two yellow orange corners right

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.920 
these two yellow orange corners right
here<00:01:46.110> oh<00:01:46.439> man<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.280> place<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.689> is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
here oh man if I place this one this is

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.450 
here oh man if I place this one this is
an<00:01:49.079> oriented<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> bring<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> down<00:01:50.189> like

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
an oriented right to bring it down like

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.080 
an oriented right to bring it down like
that<00:01:51.259> but<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.439> place<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.460> first<00:01:53.729> then

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that but if I place that one first then

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.389 
that but if I place that one first then
this<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.630> will<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.840> down<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.219> don't<00:01:56.340> have

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
this one will go down and you don't have

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.340 
this one will go down and you don't have
to<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:57.000> any<00:01:57.149> extra<00:01:57.270> moves<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.200> goes

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
to do any extra moves and this one goes

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.700 
to do any extra moves and this one goes
along<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.270> right<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.960> she<00:02:01.590> have

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
along with it right there and she have

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.350 
along with it right there and she have
to<00:02:01.890> take<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.180> put<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> right<00:02:03.899> way<00:02:05.360> now

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
to take out and put in the right way now

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240 
to take out and put in the right way now
i<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.540> i<00:02:06.659> had<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> same<00:02:06.960> peanut<00:02:07.439> case<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
i see i had the same peanut case but the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.969 
i see i had the same peanut case but the
center<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> left<00:02:09.000> back<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.050> time<00:02:10.289> so

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
center is on the left back this time so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.900 
center is on the left back this time so
i<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
i can do the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.090 
i can do the
universe<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.570> algorithm<00:02:12.930> adjusted<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
universe of the algorithm adjusted and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:27.920 
universe of the algorithm adjusted and
so<00:02:14.850> now<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.000> end<00:02:15.360> up<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.570> an<00:02:15.690> H<00:02:15.810> bro<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> for

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
so now I end up with an H bro so for

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.370 
so now I end up with an H bro so for
this<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.410> would<00:02:28.470> go<00:02:28.650> for<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.610> yellow<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.380> I

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
this one I would go for the yellow and I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.610 
this one I would go for the yellow and I
see<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.800> these<00:02:32.130> two<00:02:32.460> yellow<00:02:33.240> red<00:02:33.620> corners

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
see I have these two yellow red corners

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.530 
see I have these two yellow red corners
right<00:02:34.740> here<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.910> if<00:02:35.970> i<00:02:36.060> put<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.330> one

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
right here and so if i put this one

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.390 
right here and so if i put this one
first<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.320> one<00:02:38.240> like<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.770> if<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.040> just

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
first this one like this one if I just

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.830 
first this one like this one if I just
do<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:41.940> one<00:02:42.090> first<00:02:42.270> time<00:02:42.510> after<00:02:42.630> like

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
do this one first time after like

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.510 
do this one first time after like
flipping<00:02:43.110> around<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.410> burden<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.460> do

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
flipping around the burden but if I do

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.400 
flipping around the burden but if I do
this<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:44.940> first<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.540> Orient's<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.050> so

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
this one first and it Orient's it so

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.050 
this one first and it Orient's it so
it's<00:02:46.560> correctly<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.820> one<00:02:51.030> I

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
it's correctly like that and this one I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.750 
it's correctly like that and this one I
have<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.620> flip<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.710> like<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.400> i<00:02:53.430> can<00:02:53.670> bring

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
have to flip it like that so i can bring

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.070 
have to flip it like that so i can bring
it<00:02:53.910> down<00:02:54.030> there<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.710> this<00:02:55.710> one<00:02:56.840> goes<00:02:57.840> like

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it down there and this one goes like

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.550 
it down there and this one goes like
that<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.850> now<00:02:59.970> i<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.930> nutcase<00:03:01.140> again

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
that so now i have the you nutcase again

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.380 
that so now i have the you nutcase again
but<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> center<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.520> already<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.820> top<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.360> i

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
but the center is already on top so i

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.200 
but the center is already on top so i
can<00:03:03.630> just<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:05.010> however<00:03:05.400> algorithm<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:05.970> doesn't

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
can just do however algorithm it doesn't

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.180 
can just do however algorithm it doesn't
matter<00:03:06.330> because<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.840> won't<00:03:07.020> solve<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.980> top

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
matter because it won't solve the top

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.520 
matter because it won't solve the top
center<00:03:08.490> anyway<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:09.780> now<00:03:09.870> i<00:03:09.900> see<00:03:10.110> i<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.200> z

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
center anyway and so now i see i have z

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.520 
center anyway and so now i see i have z
perm<00:03:10.770> um<00:03:11.490> so<00:03:11.970> i<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.180> set<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.390> up<00:03:12.510> like<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.230> so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
perm um so i just set it up like that so

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.790 
perm um so i just set it up like that so
it<00:03:13.620> isn't<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:13.950> correct<00:03:14.100> spot<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.910> deep<00:03:15.060> I'm

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
it isn't it correct spot to the deep I'm

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:26.390 
it isn't it correct spot to the deep I'm
giddy<00:03:16.800> up<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.160> I'll<00:03:17.520> do<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.670> setup<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.370> i

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
giddy up and I'll do the setup so i

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.310 
giddy up and I'll do the setup so i
probably<00:03:26.640> go<00:03:26.820> for<00:03:26.970> white<00:03:27.270> on<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.020> see

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
probably go for white on this one I see

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.620 
probably go for white on this one I see
I<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.530> these<00:03:28.650> two<00:03:28.860> white<00:03:29.160> red<00:03:29.400> here<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.540> I

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
I of these two white red here and if I

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.890 
I of these two white red here and if I
place<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:31.020> one<00:03:31.200> first<00:03:31.970> like<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.209> then<00:03:33.750> this

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
place this one first like that then this

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.930 
place this one first like that then this
one's<00:03:34.110> already<00:03:34.310> oriented<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.459> i<00:03:35.490> can<00:03:35.670> bring<00:03:35.820> it

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
one's already oriented so i can bring it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:46.040 
one's already oriented so i can bring it
down<00:03:36.060> next<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:41.180> then<00:03:42.180> oh<00:03:43.220> if<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:45.050> not

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
down next to it and then oh if I not

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.400 
down next to it and then oh if I not
that<00:03:46.230> work<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:46.980> just<00:03:47.130> put<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.140> on<00:03:49.140> there

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
that work I can just put that on there

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.020 
that work I can just put that on there
that<00:03:49.739> one<00:03:50.459> there<00:03:50.690> kind<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.810> long<00:03:51.989> face<00:03:52.380> but

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
that one there kind of a long face but

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.460 
that one there kind of a long face but
it<00:03:54.030> works<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.540> don't<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:54.989> had<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.170> peanut

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
it works I don't know I had the peanut

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.990 
it works I don't know I had the peanut
case<00:03:55.620> again<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.459> one<00:03:59.610> turns<00:03:59.760> out<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.970> be

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
case again and this one turns out to be

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.060 
case again and this one turns out to be
the<00:04:00.120> same<00:04:00.330> Z<00:04:00.510> Prime<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:05.570> get<00:04:06.570> like<00:04:06.750> that

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
the same Z Prime and so I get like that

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.190 
the same Z Prime and so I get like that
I'm<00:04:08.070> do<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> setup<00:04:11.390> ok<00:04:12.390> now<00:04:12.540> for<00:04:12.570> this<00:04:12.810> one<00:04:12.989> I

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
I'm do the setup ok now for this one I

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.990 
I'm do the setup ok now for this one I
see<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.440> have<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:14.040> sort<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.520> black<00:04:14.730> thing

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
see I have this sort of black thing

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.500 
see I have this sort of black thing
right<00:04:15.030> here<00:04:15.209> oh<00:04:15.739> this<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.890> nice<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.520> I<00:04:17.549> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
right here oh this is nice so I the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.210 
right here oh this is nice so I the
other<00:04:18.540> two<00:04:18.810> white<00:04:19.020> corners<00:04:19.680> all<00:04:19.919> right<00:04:20.039> there

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
other two white corners all right there

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.030 
other two white corners all right there
and<00:04:20.460> if<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.180> do<00:04:21.239> that

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
and if I do that

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.940 
and if I do that
and<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.900> solves<00:04:23.900> all<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.110> corners<00:04:24.410> so<00:04:24.920> that

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
and that solves all the corners so that

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.790 
and that solves all the corners so that
was<00:04:25.130> easy<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.910> now<00:04:26.300> it's<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:26.600> z<00:04:26.750> /<00:04:26.930> do<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.650> to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
was easy and now it's a z / do that to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.490 
was easy and now it's a z / do that to
set<00:04:27.980> up<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.340> then<00:04:30.040> give<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.130> algorithm<00:04:31.400> and

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
set up and then give the algorithm and

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.740 
set up and then give the algorithm and
there<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:34.180> might<00:04:35.180> as<00:04:35.240> well<00:04:35.300> do<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.510> extra

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
there you I might as well do the extra

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.570 
there you I might as well do the extra
scrambles<00:04:36.230> on<00:04:36.320> this<00:04:36.470> since<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:37.040> soldiers<00:04:37.520> are

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
scrambles on this since the soldiers are

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.070 
scrambles on this since the soldiers are
so<00:04:37.700> short<00:04:39.160> okay<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:40.220> for<00:04:40.550> this<00:04:40.640> one<00:04:41.080> I'll

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
so short okay so for this one I'll

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.930 
so short okay so for this one I'll
probably<00:04:42.410> go<00:04:42.620> for<00:04:42.740> yellow<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.550> i<00:04:43.640> see<00:04:43.760> that<00:04:43.880> i

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
probably go for yellow and i see that i

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.550 
probably go for yellow and i see that i
have<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.210> yellow<00:04:44.720> blue<00:04:44.930> right<00:04:45.110> here<00:04:45.350> and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
have this yellow blue right here and

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.780 
have this yellow blue right here and
this<00:04:45.650> yellow<00:04:45.920> blue<00:04:46.130> right<00:04:46.340> here<00:04:46.550> already

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
this yellow blue right here already

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.340 
this yellow blue right here already
ready<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.240> go<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:47.570> i<00:04:47.600> just<00:04:47.750> have<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.020> do<00:04:48.140> one

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
ready to go so i just have to do one

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.600 
ready to go so i just have to do one
turn<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.800> get<00:04:48.920> it<00:04:49.010> there<00:04:49.100> and<00:04:51.160> other<00:04:52.160> storms

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
turn to get it there and other storms

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.410 
turn to get it there and other storms
here<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.480> i<00:04:53.510> have<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:54.550> do<00:04:55.550> that<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.970> get<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.240> in

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
here so i have to do that to get it in

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.840 
here so i have to do that to get it in
the<00:04:56.630> right<00:04:56.720> spot<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:57.230> then<00:04:57.980> that<00:04:58.220> makes<00:04:58.700> this

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
the right spot and then that makes this

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.790 
the right spot and then that makes this
one<00:04:59.090> oriented<00:04:59.540> correctly<00:04:59.660> just<00:05:00.440> slice<00:05:00.620> down

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
one oriented correctly just slice down

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.390 
one oriented correctly just slice down
like<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.720> now<00:05:02.720> i<00:05:02.750> see<00:05:02.990> i<00:05:03.020> have<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.440> p<00:05:03.980> you're

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
like that now i see i have the p you're

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.330 
like that now i see i have the p you're
the<00:05:04.580> PI<00:05:05.000> case<00:05:05.560> with<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.770> white<00:05:07.070> center

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
the PI case with the white center

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.540 
the PI case with the white center
already<00:05:07.580> on<00:05:07.670> top<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.060> i<00:05:08.810> see<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.110> i<00:05:09.380> have<00:05:09.800> a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
already on top and i see that i have a

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.890 
already on top and i see that i have a
three<00:05:11.300> centers<00:05:12.400> wrong<00:05:13.400> so<00:05:13.760> it's<00:05:13.880> you<00:05:14.090> from<00:05:14.330> if

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
three centers wrong so it's you from if

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.180 
three centers wrong so it's you from if
i<00:05:15.290> turn<00:05:16.100> that<00:05:16.250> on<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.460> bottom<00:05:16.640> i'm<00:05:17.510> gonna<00:05:17.660> do

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
i turn that on the bottom i'm gonna do

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.080 
i turn that on the bottom i'm gonna do
two<00:05:19.190> of<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:20.090> a<00:05:20.350> cases<00:05:21.350> from<00:05:21.680> sears<00:05:22.160> method<00:05:22.520> and

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
two of the a cases from sears method and

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.300 
two of the a cases from sears method and
so<00:05:23.210> now<00:05:23.330> i<00:05:23.390> have<00:05:23.480> a<00:05:23.870> you<00:05:24.410> from<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:24.890> that's<00:05:25.130> like

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
so now i have a you from and that's like

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.330 
so now i have a you from and that's like
one<00:05:25.520> of<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.640> that's<00:05:26.560> that's<00:05:27.560> one<00:05:28.190> of<00:05:28.250> the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
one of the that's that's one of the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.590 
one of the that's that's one of the
situation<00:05:28.760> for<00:05:28.880> if<00:05:29.030> you<00:05:29.120> know<00:05:29.210> if<00:05:29.270> your<00:05:29.420> java

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
situation for if you know if your java

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.180 
situation for if you know if your java
meet<00:05:29.840> you<00:05:30.230> might<00:05:30.380> as<00:05:30.470> well<00:05:30.650> just<00:05:30.830> learn<00:05:31.010> like

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
meet you might as well just learn like

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.360 
meet you might as well just learn like
one<00:05:31.340> or<00:05:31.430> two<00:05:31.460> CLL<00:05:32.450> plus<00:05:32.780> one<00:05:33.350> Center<00:05:33.710> cases

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
one or two CLL plus one Center cases

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.130 
one or two CLL plus one Center cases
because<00:05:35.060> it<00:05:35.180> makes<00:05:35.300> it<00:05:35.450> easier<00:05:35.720> like<00:05:35.870> that

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.960 

okay<00:05:42.140> for<00:05:42.260> this<00:05:42.320> next<00:05:42.380> one<00:05:42.740> I<00:05:42.920> have<00:05:43.160> I'll

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
okay for this next one I have I'll

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.870 
okay for this next one I have I'll
probably<00:05:44.150> go<00:05:44.330> for<00:05:44.450> white<00:05:44.600> and<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.980> good<00:05:46.310> thing

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
probably go for white and a good thing

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.760 
probably go for white and a good thing
to<00:05:47.000> remember<00:05:47.150> is<00:05:47.480> that<00:05:47.510> you<00:05:47.900> can<00:05:48.080> never<00:05:48.500> have

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
to remember is that you can never have

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.940 
to remember is that you can never have
too<00:05:49.420> diagonal<00:05:50.420> corners<00:05:50.780> in<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.800> wrong

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
too diagonal corners in the wrong

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.560 
too diagonal corners in the wrong
position<00:05:52.160> in<00:05:52.670> relation<00:05:52.790> to<00:05:53.090> each<00:05:53.150> other<00:05:53.360> like

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
position in relation to each other like

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.140 
position in relation to each other like
if<00:05:54.260> you<00:05:54.380> put<00:05:54.560> if<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:55.010> put<00:05:55.190> two<00:05:55.400> corners

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
if you put if you put two corners

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.760 
if you put if you put two corners
together<00:05:56.300> like<00:05:56.630> that<00:05:56.660> they<00:05:57.230> can<00:05:57.380> obviously<00:05:57.590> be

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
together like that they can obviously be

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.400 
together like that they can obviously be
the<00:05:58.610> wrong<00:05:58.730> one<00:05:59.000> but<00:05:59.690> diagram<00:06:00.110> which<00:06:00.260> will

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
the wrong one but diagram which will

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.260 
the wrong one but diagram which will
always<00:06:00.650> be<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:00.890> correct<00:06:01.400> one<00:06:01.520> so<00:06:02.060> that's<00:06:02.180> like

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
always be the correct one so that's like

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.600 
always be the correct one so that's like
one<00:06:02.450> last<00:06:02.570> thing<00:06:02.750> at<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.050> thing<00:06:03.080> about<00:06:03.380> and<00:06:03.800> so

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
one last thing at the thing about and so

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.800 
one last thing at the thing about and so
now<00:06:04.730> this<00:06:04.790> one's<00:06:05.030> already<00:06:05.150> in<00:06:05.300> place<00:06:05.510> so<00:06:05.720> I<00:06:05.780> can

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
now this one's already in place so I can

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.720 
now this one's already in place so I can
just<00:06:05.960> move<00:06:06.230> it<00:06:06.350> there<00:06:06.650> that's<00:06:07.310> one<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:07.550> have<00:06:07.640> to

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
just move it there that's one I have to

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.870 
just move it there that's one I have to
take<00:06:07.910> it<00:06:08.030> out<00:06:08.150> and<00:06:08.920> do<00:06:09.920> a<00:06:09.980> sledgehammer<00:06:10.430> type

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
take it out and do a sledgehammer type

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.600 
take it out and do a sledgehammer type
thing<00:06:11.120> put<00:06:11.420> it<00:06:11.510> in<00:06:11.740> um<00:06:12.740> so<00:06:12.980> now<00:06:13.070> I<00:06:13.100> have<00:06:13.190> a<00:06:13.310> pie

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
thing put it in um so now I have a pie

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.020 
thing put it in um so now I have a pie
case<00:06:13.930> again<00:06:14.930> but<00:06:15.890> I<00:06:16.040> don't<00:06:16.190> know<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.370> case<00:06:16.550> for

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
case again but I don't know the case for

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.090 
case again but I don't know the case for
with<00:06:17.480> yellow<00:06:17.780> on<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.500> front<00:06:18.680> like<00:06:18.770> that<00:06:18.920> so

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
with yellow on the front like that so

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.200 
with yellow on the front like that so
i'll<00:06:19.220> just<00:06:19.360> do<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.480> normal<00:06:20.600> pie<00:06:20.990> algorithm

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
i'll just do the normal pie algorithm

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.930 
i'll just do the normal pie algorithm
and<00:06:23.210> now<00:06:23.690> i<00:06:23.720> see<00:06:24.200> that<00:06:24.440> i<00:06:24.470> have<00:06:24.620> one<00:06:25.400> opposite

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
and now i see that i have one opposite

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.910 
and now i see that i have one opposite
center<00:06:26.240> like<00:06:26.450> red<00:06:26.630> is<00:06:26.750> a<00:06:26.810> bit<00:06:26.990> of<00:06:27.080> orange<00:06:27.560> and<00:06:27.830> i

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
center like red is a bit of orange and i

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.780 
center like red is a bit of orange and i
only<00:06:28.040> have<00:06:28.160> one<00:06:28.340> of<00:06:28.430> those

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
only have one of those

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.850 
only have one of those
are<00:06:28.880> the<00:06:29.090> others<00:06:29.300> are<00:06:29.480> opposite<00:06:29.900> and<00:06:30.440> so<00:06:30.830> I

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
are the others are opposite and so I

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.960 
are the others are opposite and so I
know<00:06:30.950> it<00:06:31.130> has<00:06:31.250> to<00:06:31.430> be<00:06:31.610> one<00:06:31.970> of<00:06:32.090> the<00:06:32.240> more<00:06:32.900> of<00:06:33.140> the

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
know it has to be one of the more of the

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.970 
know it has to be one of the more of the
ladies<00:06:34.970> called<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.240> ex<00:06:35.390> cases<00:06:36.020> no<00:06:36.680> these<00:06:36.830> are

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
ladies called the ex cases no these are

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.790 
ladies called the ex cases no these are
the<00:06:37.070> I<00:06:37.310> don't<00:06:37.850> know<00:06:37.910> mythical<00:06:38.210> but<00:06:38.900> so<00:06:39.500> I<00:06:39.740> know

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
the I don't know mythical but so I know

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.490 
the I don't know mythical but so I know
that<00:06:40.270> there's<00:06:41.270> only<00:06:41.450> one<00:06:41.750> opposite<00:06:42.230> center

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
that there's only one opposite center

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.190 
that there's only one opposite center
like<00:06:42.650> that<00:06:42.830> and<00:06:43.060> so<00:06:44.060> now<00:06:44.090> I<00:06:44.480> look<00:06:44.750> at<00:06:44.900> the<00:06:45.020> color

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
like that and so now I look at the color

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.280 
like that and so now I look at the color
on<00:06:45.290> the<00:06:45.470> top<00:06:45.500> or<00:06:45.860> the<00:06:46.070> opposite<00:06:46.640> of<00:06:46.880> the<00:06:47.290> face

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
on the top or the opposite of the face

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.130 
on the top or the opposite of the face
and<00:06:49.070> I<00:06:49.130> see<00:06:49.280> that's<00:06:49.520> blue<00:06:49.820> and<00:06:50.060> so<00:06:50.840> if<00:06:50.930> I<00:06:50.990> hold

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
and I see that's blue and so if I hold

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.800 
and I see that's blue and so if I hold
it<00:06:51.260> like<00:06:51.350> this<00:06:51.380> the<00:06:51.830> blue<00:06:52.010> go<00:06:52.160> down<00:06:52.400> there<00:06:52.610> and

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
it like this the blue go down there and

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.650 
it like this the blue go down there and
so<00:06:53.810> I<00:06:53.840> know<00:06:53.930> it's<00:06:54.490> this<00:06:55.490> version<00:06:56.210> of<00:06:56.300> the<00:06:56.480> case

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
so I know it's this version of the case

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.230 
so I know it's this version of the case
because<00:06:57.050> if<00:06:57.410> it<00:06:57.590> was<00:06:57.710> a<00:06:57.740> it<00:06:58.400> was<00:06:58.460> a<00:06:58.550> green<00:06:58.880> it

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
because if it was a it was a green it

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.970 
because if it was a it was a green it
would<00:06:59.390> go<00:06:59.480> down<00:06:59.510> there<00:06:59.870> and<00:07:00.050> so<00:07:00.650> I<00:07:00.680> would<00:07:00.800> hold

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
would go down there and so I would hold

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.560 
would go down there and so I would hold
it<00:07:01.040> like<00:07:01.130> this<00:07:01.160> this<00:07:01.970> is<00:07:02.120> blue<00:07:02.270> so<00:07:02.390> it<00:07:02.420> goes

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
it like this this is blue so it goes

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.370 
it like this this is blue so it goes
like<00:07:02.660> that<00:07:02.900> then<00:07:03.500> I<00:07:03.890> rotate<00:07:04.460> around<00:07:04.700> the

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
like that then I rotate around the

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:11.110 
like that then I rotate around the
correct<00:07:06.380> center<00:07:07.240> and<00:07:08.240> I<00:07:08.390> do<00:07:08.600> yoga<00:07:08.690> or<00:07:09.760> I<00:07:10.760> rotate

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
correct center and I do yoga or I rotate

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.200 
correct center and I do yoga or I rotate
around<00:07:11.210> the<00:07:11.510> top<00:07:12.500> of<00:07:12.530> the<00:07:12.740> center<00:07:12.920> rather<00:07:13.220> um

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
around the top of the center rather um

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.090 
around the top of the center rather um
so<00:07:14.960> there's<00:07:15.170> some<00:07:15.320> skewed<00:07:15.560> walk<00:07:15.710> yourselves

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.100 
so there's some skewed walk yourselves

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.270 
so there's some skewed walk yourselves
um<00:07:16.510> if<00:07:17.510> you<00:07:17.930> have<00:07:18.380> any<00:07:18.560> questions<00:07:18.920> or<00:07:19.070> comments

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 
um if you have any questions or comments

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.650 
um if you have any questions or comments
