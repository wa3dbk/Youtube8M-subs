00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.939 
figured well i'm cleaning out my desk so
i<00:05:36.090> figured<00:05:36.419> i<00:05:36.659> put<00:05:37.169> it<00:05:37.259> over<00:05:37.349> here<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:37.680> put<00:05:37.830> it

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
i figured i put it over here and put it

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.180 
i figured i put it over here and put it
to<00:05:38.009> use<00:05:38.270> here<00:05:39.270> it<00:05:39.360> is<00:05:39.449> a<00:05:39.720> a<00:05:40.259> lot<00:05:40.860> of<00:05:41.039> you

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
to use here it is a a lot of you

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.350 
to use here it is a a lot of you
probably<00:05:41.340> don't<00:05:41.669> remember<00:05:41.729> this<00:05:41.940> machine

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
probably don't remember this machine

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.469 
probably don't remember this machine
this<00:05:42.539> has<00:05:42.810> dual<00:05:43.680> 500<00:05:44.340> megahertz<00:05:44.580> Pentium<00:05:44.909> 3<00:05:45.150> s

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
this has dual 500 megahertz Pentium 3 s

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.800 
this has dual 500 megahertz Pentium 3 s
it<00:05:45.659> has<00:05:45.780> 1<00:05:46.110> point<00:05:46.320> no<00:05:46.970> 512<00:05:47.970> megabytes<00:05:48.389> of<00:05:48.509> RAM

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
it has 1 point no 512 megabytes of RAM

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.580 
it has 1 point no 512 megabytes of RAM
and<00:05:50.509> 66<00:05:51.509> gigabyte<00:05:51.990> hard<00:05:52.139> drives<00:05:52.440> I<00:05:52.560> think

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
and 66 gigabyte hard drives I think

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.120 
and 66 gigabyte hard drives I think
something<00:05:53.520> like<00:05:53.580> that<00:05:53.789> no<00:05:54.139> 69<00:05:55.139> gigabyte<00:05:55.979> hard

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
something like that no 69 gigabyte hard

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.260 
something like that no 69 gigabyte hard
drives<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.690> don't<00:05:57.690> know<00:05:58.159> moving<00:05:59.159> on<00:05:59.280> I<00:05:59.550> think

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
drives I don't know moving on I think

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.930 
drives I don't know moving on I think
they're<00:06:00.419> in<00:06:00.509> raid<00:06:00.719> 0<00:06:00.750> you<00:06:01.469> can<00:06:01.620> see<00:06:01.860> just<00:06:02.130> all

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
they're in raid 0 you can see just all

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.430 
they're in raid 0 you can see just all
of<00:06:03.479> the<00:06:03.630> diagnostic<00:06:04.349> lies<00:06:04.500> in<00:06:04.680> there

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
of the diagnostic lies in there

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.680 
of the diagnostic lies in there
so<00:06:06.440> yeah<00:06:06.590> this<00:06:06.830> machine<00:06:07.190> still<00:06:07.430> less<00:06:07.610> work<00:06:07.789> i'm

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
so yeah this machine still less work i'm

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.110 
so yeah this machine still less work i'm
running<00:06:09.080> windows<00:06:09.110> server<00:06:09.620> 2003<00:06:10.610> on<00:06:10.819> it<00:06:10.970> and

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
running windows server 2003 on it and

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.210 
running windows server 2003 on it and
then<00:06:11.660> i<00:06:11.690> have<00:06:11.960> this<00:06:12.199> linksys<00:06:12.740> WT<00:06:13.190> r<00:06:13.370> WT<00:06:14.330> r

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
then i have this linksys WT r WT r

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.490 
then i have this linksys WT r WT r
wrt54g<00:06:16.220> router<00:06:16.250> i<00:06:16.819> moved<00:06:17.389> it<00:06:17.539> from<00:06:17.750> the

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
wrt54g router i moved it from the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.080 
wrt54g router i moved it from the
location<00:06:18.919> behind<00:06:19.039> my<00:06:19.280> macbook<00:06:19.669> pro<00:06:19.880> over

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
location behind my macbook pro over

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.360 
location behind my macbook pro over
there<00:06:20.240> i<00:06:20.419> moved<00:06:21.020> it<00:06:21.110> over<00:06:21.169> here<00:06:21.500> so<00:06:21.800> it<00:06:22.009> can<00:06:22.190> be

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
there i moved it over here so it can be

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.279 
there i moved it over here so it can be
this<00:06:22.699> thing's<00:06:23.030> internet<00:06:23.479> connection<00:06:23.990> and

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
this thing's internet connection and

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.409 
this thing's internet connection and
also<00:06:24.889> it's<00:06:25.220> still<00:06:25.400> an<00:06:25.520> access<00:06:25.880> point<00:06:26.060> so<00:06:26.240> if<00:06:26.330> i

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
also it's still an access point so if i

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.640 
also it's still an access point so if i
did<00:06:26.660> want<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:26.960> connect<00:06:27.229> to<00:06:27.319> this<00:06:27.440> little

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
did want to connect to this little

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.309 
did want to connect to this little
router<00:06:27.949> i<00:06:28.069> could<00:06:28.580> so<00:06:29.389> it's<00:06:29.660> been<00:06:29.840> set<00:06:30.020> up<00:06:30.050> as<00:06:30.289> a

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 
router i could so it's been set up as a

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.640 
router i could so it's been set up as a
repeater<00:06:31.220> bridge<00:06:31.370> right<00:06:31.819> now<00:06:31.849> so<00:06:32.440> that's<00:06:33.440> that

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
repeater bridge right now so that's that

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.860 
repeater bridge right now so that's that
but<00:06:33.860> anyway<00:06:33.949> yeah<00:06:34.400> i<00:06:34.639> have<00:06:34.910> this<00:06:35.120> set<00:06:35.389> up<00:06:35.419> as<00:06:35.690> an

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
power edge on the network and then we

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.320 
power edge on the network and then we

could do it and I did so you know I can

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.939 
could do it and I did so you know I can
go<00:07:03.050> ahead<00:07:03.169> and<00:07:04.479> go<00:07:05.479> in<00:07:05.630> here<00:07:05.930> there's<00:07:06.500> nothing

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:06.949 
go ahead and go in here there's nothing

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:09.490 
go ahead and go in here there's nothing
but<00:07:07.190> I<00:07:07.430> have<00:07:08.030> full<00:07:08.210> control<00:07:08.389> of<00:07:08.659> the<00:07:08.960> drive<00:07:09.199> so

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:15.289 
guess i can reach it from a mac since it

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:17.950 
guess i can reach it from a mac since it
is<00:07:15.320> an<00:07:15.470> ftp<00:07:15.830> server<00:07:16.039> so<00:07:16.909> yeah<00:07:17.060> that's<00:07:17.389> kind<00:07:17.810> of
