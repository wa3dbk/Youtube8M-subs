I'm Lilian Jones in this slideshow I'm

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.260 
I'm Lilian Jones in this slideshow I'm
going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.609> show<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.029> make<00:00:06.240> a

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
going to show you how to make a

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.930 
going to show you how to make a
cloisonne<00:00:06.899> enamel<00:00:07.250> which<00:00:08.250> starts<00:00:08.700> with<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
cloisonne enamel which starts with a

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.570 
cloisonne enamel which starts with a
pencil<00:00:09.210> sketch<00:00:09.920> and<00:00:10.920> once<00:00:11.160> I'm<00:00:11.340> satisfied

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
pencil sketch and once I'm satisfied

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.480 
pencil sketch and once I'm satisfied
with<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.660> scale<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:13.679> computer<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
with that I scale it on my computer to

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.779 
with that I scale it on my computer to
get<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> size<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.120> want<00:00:15.500> enamel<00:00:16.500> find<00:00:17.430> silver

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
get the size I want enamel find silver

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.510 
get the size I want enamel find silver
you<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.210> use<00:00:18.359> fine<00:00:18.660> silver<00:00:19.310> which<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
you have to use fine silver which you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.730 
you have to use fine silver which you
just<00:00:20.760> wrap<00:00:21.090> alright<00:00:22.020> you're<00:00:22.230> cutting<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
just wrap alright you're cutting the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.790 
just wrap alright you're cutting the
silver<00:00:23.130> wire<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:24.330> close<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.289> silver<00:00:25.619> wire

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
silver wire you close the silver wire

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.540 
silver wire you close the silver wire
into<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> loop<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.820> put<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.750> your<00:00:28.160> block<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
into a loop and put it on your block to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
into a loop and put it on your block to
fuse<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> am<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> rolling<00:00:31.560> mill

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
fuse there I am with the rolling mill

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.170 
fuse there I am with the rolling mill
flattening<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.500> rounding<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.590> out

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
flattening it out and rounding it out

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.920 
flattening it out and rounding it out
now<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.239> put<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.790> tripod<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.120> put<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
now you put it on a tripod and put the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
now you put it on a tripod and put the
magic<00:00:40.079> solution<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.190> fuse<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> from

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
magic solution on and fuse it from

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.590 
magic solution on and fuse it from
underneath<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.860> it'll<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:44.969> fuse<00:00:45.300> into<00:00:45.450> one

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
underneath and it'll all fuse into one

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.990 
underneath and it'll all fuse into one
solid<00:00:46.050> piece<00:00:47.690> that's<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.899> reflective<00:00:50.000> here

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
solid piece that's so reflective here

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.650 
solid piece that's so reflective here
I'm<00:00:52.160> engraving<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> punching<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> hole<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.329> it

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
I'm engraving it punching a hole in it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.520 
I'm engraving it punching a hole in it
doming<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:56.690> making<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> wires<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.469> the

design<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> sift<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> little<00:01:01.320> clear<00:01:01.620> glass

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
design you sift on a little clear glass

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.570 
design you sift on a little clear glass
and<00:01:02.010> fire<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> surface<00:01:03.979> on<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.040> little

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and fire it on the surface on a little

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
and fire it on the surface on a little
kiln<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.600> place<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.290> shaped

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
kiln and then you place all the shaped

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.039 
kiln and then you place all the shaped
wires<00:01:07.860> onto<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.420> design<00:01:11.479> now<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.659> using

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
wires onto the design now I'm using

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.300 
wires onto the design now I'm using
paper<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.710> transfer<00:01:14.280> sections<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.390> foil<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
foil textured foil into the design

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.590 
foil textured foil into the design
that's<00:01:27.060> how<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> texture<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:29.420> there's<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that's how you texture it there's the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.580 
that's how you texture it there's the
cat<00:01:31.310> there's<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> enamel<00:01:33.320> there's<00:01:34.320> little

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
cat there's the enamel there's little

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.920 
cat there's the enamel there's little
sketches<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.100> how<00:01:35.549> things<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:35.939> done<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.420> now

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
sketches of how things are done and now

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
sketches of how things are done and now
I'm<00:01:37.140> washing<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> enamel<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:39.479> apply<00:01:43.909> pour<00:01:44.909> out

enamel on the back fire it again look at
it<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> bunch

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.709 

I've<00:02:05.520> brought<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.000> enamel<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
I've brought the enamel up to the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.449 
I've brought the enamel up to the
surface<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.530> I've<00:02:07.649> got<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> stun<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.280> down

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
surface and now I've got to stun it down

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.640 
surface and now I've got to stun it down
to<00:02:08.700> where<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:08.880> uh<00:02:10.730> even<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:13.020> that's<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
to where it's uh even so that's the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.370 
to where it's uh even so that's the
stone<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.400> stun<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.670> underwater

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
stone you stun it underwater

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.890 
stone you stun it underwater
now<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.440> look<00:02:16.590> at<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.860> some<00:02:17.010> more<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:21.720> sort

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
now you look at it some more it's sort

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.720 
now you look at it some more it's sort
of<00:02:21.959> eggshell<00:02:22.530> when<00:02:22.830> it's<00:02:23.010> been<00:02:23.190> stoned<00:02:23.519> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
of eggshell when it's been stoned and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.420 
of eggshell when it's been stoned and
you<00:02:23.819> have<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> fire<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.360> again<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.830> get<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.040> back

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
you have to fire it again to get it back

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.000 
you have to fire it again to get it back
to<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.980> shiny<00:02:28.980> texture<00:02:29.519> on<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.880> top<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.800> that's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
to a shiny texture on the top so that's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.190 
to a shiny texture on the top so that's
what<00:02:32.160> I'm<00:02:32.280> doing<00:02:32.550> here<00:02:32.970> they're<00:02:33.569> shiny<00:02:33.989> again

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
what I'm doing here they're shiny again

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:44.710 
what I'm doing here they're shiny again
and<00:02:35.130> now<00:02:35.819> we<00:02:36.300> look<00:02:36.450> at<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.720> some<00:02:37.019> more

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720
