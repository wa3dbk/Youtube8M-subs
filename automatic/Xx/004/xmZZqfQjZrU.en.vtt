00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.000 
something I love about dinner in Paris
is<00:00:22.869> that<00:00:22.990> it<00:00:23.110> always<00:00:23.290> seems<00:00:23.650> to<00:00:23.740> be

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
is that it always seems to be

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.700 
is that it always seems to be
spontaneous<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.720> it<00:00:25.840> makes<00:00:26.050> me<00:00:26.200> feel<00:00:26.380> a<00:00:26.410> little

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
spontaneous so it makes me feel a little

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.470 
spontaneous so it makes me feel a little
bit<00:00:26.890> more<00:00:27.160> brave<00:00:27.400> about<00:00:27.610> trying<00:00:28.030> things<00:00:28.300> I've

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
bit more brave about trying things I've

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.870

never<00:00:28.660> tried<00:00:29.020> before<00:00:29.310> I'd<00:00:30.310> really<00:00:30.730> never

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
never tried before I'd really never

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.560

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670

apple<00:00:41.880> tart<00:00:42.150> for<00:00:42.330> dessert<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.560> have<00:00:43.740> some

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
beautiful artichokes so I think this

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.050
