00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.160
 no longer thank God not also the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.319
 blocked potatoes 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.319
 again it is used 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:23.070
 That is a friend but since we are 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.000
 we say to the lady who called marta said 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.220
 marta this month like this 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.689
 the sprouted glasses the ideal is not to eat 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.290
 those that are toxic and this green if 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.650
 you are seeing here this green 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.000
 it is also rust is also toxic 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.620
 then you have to take out the days and 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.990
 that you throw them the rule they study 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.300
 he recounted sprouts he does not give to eat them 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.870
 but if you do not take out the bud you get the part 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.120
 green cupping that part and save 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.180
 the chip if you see it green like this one 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.980
 take out that sometimes this happens and you take 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.080
 well until in the inner part there 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.880
 you see absolutely nothing green because 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.920
 because the green part and the north are 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.470
 toxic you're not going to die and I'll tell you 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.180
 that the pelapapas have a point 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.560
 round that is just to make it 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.560
 equal shoot site 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.210
 not because he has an outbreak or is 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.590
 it's not enough 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.540
 take it out until it is no longer 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.540
 outbreaks or you see that it no longer has more green 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.110
 kisses the rest is how to consume such 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.050
 quality green made obviously not this 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.610
 that is here the sacks either because 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.270
 you calculate at least half 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.439
 centimeter inward do not trust 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.479
 you will not die is not good another 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.390
 important thing to try not to 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.619
 sprout on the one hand consume them point 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.869
 number 1 it is clear that we can not 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.020
 buy potatoes round no no but sometimes 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.929
 happens because in the house below the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.539
 sink there is a plate cited for paper 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.850
 they were today in a basket there they are 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.950
 the potatoes and suddenly one buys imposes 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.439
 On top of what has been bought and arrives 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.539
 a day that you will find if it is your own 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.160
 of the completion of the potato equal to 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.200
 I want to say to achieve that which has just 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.959
 to reach that is key to keep them in a 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.310
 place dark and cold and cool because 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.799
 often faster by note 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.360
 house outside directly to the sun and so on 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.340
 so that is on one side of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.810
 save them as said kallas but at 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.849
 Same time 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.440
 renew when you buy hands put them 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.950
 above, below, they will be apart 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:37.599
 talking about those that are fried in 0 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.599
 seconds and the good thing that we have is coming 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.880
 three things in mind if the bonds are 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.500
 fresh as you realize if the voices 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.450
 it is so frequent food of the famous 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.940
 method of the glass with water then in a glass 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.610
 with water or biden is fine is a goal of 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.750
 half court is equal and egg in the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.750
 site where I'm going to show you 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.400
 position 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:25.630
 cold fresh and so fresh a method 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.580
 very very super simple classes this 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.920
 but as with that water 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.340
 I'm going to say at 13 and grab the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.340
 eggs 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.640
 grab the eggs to see overflow to 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.110
 see what could have overflowed if the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.370
 egg plant is not going 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.830
 fat valverde said clear 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.350
 we can hold 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.170
 if one floats it does not go if the egg is 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.400
 lie as in this case should be 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.730
 do what torrija director yesterday 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.410
 please 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.750
 if you lie down the egg is fresh 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.340
 for a little bit try with three to see 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.790
 what wave is not something that appears some 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.790
 make it half 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.480
 as it is said not so soon I insist 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.390
 fleet discard it already 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.940
 here it tends to stop a little see 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.650
 that this is costly this tends to 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.600
 pay a little more and be a little 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.610
 less good this would be the least cool 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.060
 eye that all are good is less 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.060
 cool 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.729
 coolest of all is clear if you 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.189
 comes to a stop 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:37.339
 the reality I would not use it 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:37.339
 I ran away 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.819
 approximately until Carlos good in 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.830
 reality depends on the origin I put 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.770
 guy unseat him one month quietly 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.659
 you do not know how long ago how much 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.669
 they left the hen the reality is 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.499
 it's good to look at the little house 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.479
 when you buy them, check them 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:59.580
 when you buy do this for 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:03.659
 example just bounces a lot is because it 's 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.430
 a lot of barÃ§a if there's a lot and if there's a lot 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.649
 much much the inside what's going to 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.779
 to pass is just that he has a lot 

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:11.969
 a while ago that came out of the 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.960
 hen or you can have it up to one meter 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.099
 the reality that it is good to go 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.099
 renewing it to one has 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.710
 this was clear the method s 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:32.330
 thank you thanks to the eggs that when 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.669
 you are a hard boiled egg after 10 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.639
 Boiling minutes actually costs you 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:41.060
 peel it there are many people who believe that 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:46.659
 it's because the egg is this old not 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.659
 that's because you 're recontra fresh but 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.500
 basically 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:06:01.120
 because thank you very much my life 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:01.120
 but that seems silly but 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:07.169
 because the shell is porous 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:09.869
 and inside the yolk sac that is 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:16.050
 a very thin membrane and in a 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:18.149
 end has an air bottom when it 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:25.770
 It is getting older every time it goes 

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:27.479
 charging more air and filling the 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.399
 egg instead of getting oval you have left 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.740
 like a good hole that hard egg is 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:35.039
 can eat but had as it says creek in 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.770
 the cabin like the yolk sac had 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.639
 much 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.729
 with distance from the start in bolivia 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:45.150
 he tells you I the Manchester does the 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.150
 cheek 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.540
 almost almost better than he looked for them amazing 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.620
 little mermaid I have to make a 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.960
 preparation that includes egg and I hope 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.880
 they have prisoner I love that 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.620
 quality preparation and sounds in a 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.280
 aspect of position a tape a pint 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:21.140
 beard for your direct line connection the 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.140
 great week possible
