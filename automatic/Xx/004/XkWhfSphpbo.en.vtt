00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
so taking it is so it's a lot different

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.299 
so taking it is so it's a lot different
to<00:00:12.210> other<00:00:12.300> games<00:00:12.630> because<00:00:13.200> your<00:00:13.679> trash<00:00:14.009> pulls

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
to other games because your trash pulls

to other games because your trash pulls
and<00:00:14.610> stuff<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.059> involves<00:00:15.360> more<00:00:15.480> than<00:00:15.540> one

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
and stuff that involves more than one

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.920 
and stuff that involves more than one
mob<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.500> really<00:00:16.920> about<00:00:17.220> controlling<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.300> CC

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
mob is really about controlling and CC

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.689 
mob is really about controlling and CC
rather<00:00:19.260> than<00:00:19.500> aggro<00:00:19.920> because<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.400> only<00:00:20.520> have

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
rather than aggro because you only have

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.400 
rather than aggro because you only have
the<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:20.880> taunt<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.869> give<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.230> sword

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the one taunt you give them the sword

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.960 
the one taunt you give them the sword
and<00:00:22.560> board<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.250> another<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.670> from<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and board there is another one from the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.609 
and board there is another one from the
undaunted<00:00:24.269> line<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> wouldn't<00:00:25.529> really

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
undaunted line but I wouldn't really

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.259 
undaunted line but I wouldn't really
worry<00:00:25.800> about<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.789> effective

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
worry about it it's not that effective

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.450 
worry about it it's not that effective
or<00:00:27.840> any<00:00:28.199> better<00:00:28.439> than<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.279> from

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
group tanking is really about AoE CC and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
group tanking is really about AoE CC and
not<00:00:42.420> about<00:00:42.629> holding<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.260> growth<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.829> abilities

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
some of the harder dungeons you're gonna

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
some of the harder dungeons you're gonna
take<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.650> lot<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.920> damage<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.549> you'll<00:01:29.640> die<00:01:29.790> very

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
take a lot of damage and you'll die very

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.880 
take a lot of damage and you'll die very
very<00:01:30.360> quickly<00:01:30.659> also<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.409> far<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.799> from

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
very quickly also how far you are from

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.740 
very quickly also how far you are from
the<00:01:32.100> mobs<00:01:32.400> does<00:01:32.790> make<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> big<00:01:33.360> difference<00:01:33.390> on

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the mobs does make a big difference on

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.840 
the mobs does make a big difference on
the<00:01:33.869> aggro<00:01:34.229> I've<00:01:34.380> noticed<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.520> bit

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the aggro I've noticed if it's bit

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.030 
the aggro I've noticed if it's bit
difficult<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.360> melee<00:01:36.509> DPS<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
difficult for melee DPS but if you are a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
difficult for melee DPS but if you are a
range<00:01:38.400> DPS<00:01:38.610> especially<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.270> try<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.509> stay

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
range DPS especially just try and stay

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.149 
range DPS especially just try and stay
away<00:01:39.930> from<00:01:39.960> those<00:01:40.200> mobs<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:41.009> them

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
away from those mobs and see see them

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.889 
away from those mobs and see see them
away<00:01:41.340> from<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.600> close

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
away from you because if you are close

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.260 
away from you because if you are close
you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.439> pull<00:01:43.710> aggro<00:01:43.860> very<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:44.549> easily<00:01:44.759> but

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
you can pull aggro very very easily but

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.550 
you can pull aggro very very easily but
the<00:01:45.329> main<00:01:45.509> thing<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:45.720> hanging<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.229> really

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the main thing about hanging is really

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.080 
the main thing about hanging is really
focusing<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.220> blocking<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.820> keeping

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
focusing on that blocking and keeping

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.859 
focusing on that blocking and keeping
enough<00:01:48.240> stamina

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
enough stamina

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
enough stamina
I<00:01:48.899> found<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.740> generally<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.130> be

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I found that you're generally gonna be

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.710 
I found that you're generally gonna be
using<00:01:50.490> stamina<00:01:51.000> pots<00:01:51.180> instead<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.570> health

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
using stamina pots instead of health

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.539 
using stamina pots instead of health
pots<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.619> am<00:01:52.710> actually<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.100> health<00:01:53.310> pots

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
pots like I am actually have health pots

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.249 
pots like I am actually have health pots
on<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> moment<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.020> generally

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
on at the moment but you're generally

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.480 
on at the moment but you're generally
going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.500> using<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:55.799> stamina<00:01:56.009> pots<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
going to be using your stamina pots the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.490 
going to be using your stamina pots the
most<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.079> need<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> have

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
most because you really do need to have

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
most because you really do need to have
stamina<00:01:58.829> otherwise<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.729> not<00:01:59.939> gonna<00:02:00.030> be

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
stamina otherwise it's just not gonna be

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.490 
stamina otherwise it's just not gonna be
effective<00:02:00.479> which<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.750> can't<00:02:00.960> toilet<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
effective which you can't toilet and you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
effective which you can't toilet and you
can't<00:02:01.710> block<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.000> standing<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
can't block it's not really standing a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.389 
can't block it's not really standing a
lot<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.750> other<00:02:03.869> MMOs<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.159> block

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
lot of other MMOs that you have to block

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.910 
lot of other MMOs that you have to block
but<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.719> especially<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
but you really do like especially if you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.650 
but you really do like especially if you
have<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> Stan<00:02:08.640> line<00:02:08.849> that's<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.179> good<00:02:09.330> regen

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
have the Stan line that's a good regen

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.850 
have the Stan line that's a good regen
and<00:02:09.810> stuff<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.619> stand<00:02:10.770> there

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860

and stuff if you can just stand there
blocking<00:02:11.160> constantly<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
blocking constantly and you

the<00:02:12.590> passive<00:02:13.040> ability<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.910> reduces<00:02:14.600> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
the passive ability that reduces the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.600 
the passive ability that reduces the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
shield bash but it does do a lot of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.050 
shield bash but it does do a lot of
damage<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:21.950> boss<00:02:22.220> fights<00:02:22.520> when<00:02:22.760> it's<00:02:22.880> only

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
damage in boss fights when it's only

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.700 
damage in boss fights when it's only
that<00:02:23.270> single<00:02:23.630> target<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.110> really<00:02:24.470> need<00:02:24.590> to

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
that single target you really need to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.350 
that single target you really need to
make<00:02:24.860> sure<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.130> space<00:02:25.430> out<00:02:25.670> those<00:02:25.820> taunts<00:02:26.270> at

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
make sure you space out those taunts at

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.210 
make sure you space out those taunts at
the<00:02:26.450> 15-second<00:02:27.200> intervals<00:02:27.290> because<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:28.070> does

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
the 15-second intervals because it does

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.280 
the 15-second intervals because it does
last<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.640> 15<00:02:28.940> seconds<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.900> really<00:02:30.170> don't

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
last for 15 seconds and you really don't

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.600 
last for 15 seconds and you really don't
want<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.440> be<00:02:30.530> wasting<00:02:30.890> stamina<00:02:31.280> P<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.460> don't

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
want to be wasting stamina P you don't

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.000 
want to be wasting stamina P you don't
need<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.000> waste<00:02:32.210> because<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.200> doesn't<00:02:33.680> cost<00:02:33.830> a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
need to waste because it doesn't cost a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.860 
need to waste because it doesn't cost a
whole<00:02:34.340> lot<00:02:34.700> but<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.150> does<00:02:35.270> use<00:02:35.300> up<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.660> fair

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
whole lot but it does use up a fair

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.000 
whole lot but it does use up a fair
amount<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.350> could<00:02:36.560> be<00:02:36.680> used<00:02:36.890> for

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
amount that you could be used for

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.100 
amount that you could be used for
blocking<00:02:37.550> dodging<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.630> kind<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.900> thing

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
blocking dodging and that kind of thing

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.590 
blocking dodging and that kind of thing
just<00:02:40.070> one<00:02:40.250> thing<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.550> dodging<00:02:40.910> while<00:02:41.150> I'm<00:02:41.330> at

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
just one thing on dodging while I'm at

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.050 
just one thing on dodging while I'm at
it<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:42.080> generally<00:02:42.950> isn't<00:02:43.130> worth<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.850> dodge

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
it it generally isn't worth to dodge

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.300 
it it generally isn't worth to dodge
because<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.900> takes<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.350> huge<00:02:45.770> chunk<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.250> your

because it takes a huge chunk of your
stamina<00:02:46.760> bar<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:47.000> believe<00:02:47.240> its<00:02:47.390> percentage

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
stamina bar I believe its percentage

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.780 
stamina bar I believe its percentage
rather<00:02:48.260> than<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> set<00:02:48.980> amount<00:02:49.100> you're<00:02:49.610> better

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
rather than a set amount you're better

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.860 
rather than a set amount you're better
off<00:02:49.880> just<00:02:50.210> standing<00:02:50.480> there<00:02:50.540> blocking

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
off just standing there blocking

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.450 
off just standing there blocking
whatever<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.410> coming<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.070> taking<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
whatever is coming and just taking the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.310 
whatever is coming and just taking the
damage<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.030> think<00:02:53.390> goes<00:02:53.570> without<00:02:53.840> saying<00:02:54.140> make

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
damage I think goes without saying make

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.480 
damage I think goes without saying make
sure<00:02:54.440> you've<00:02:54.590> got<00:02:54.620> special<00:02:55.040> attacks

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
sure you've got special attacks

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.130 
sure you've got special attacks
especially<00:02:56.030> from<00:02:56.180> bosses<00:02:56.600> because<00:02:56.960> they

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
especially from bosses because they

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.230 
especially from bosses because they
often<00:02:57.320> have<00:02:57.590> special<00:02:57.890> effects<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.610> can

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
often have special effects and can

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.820 
often have special effects and can
sometimes<00:02:59.510> one-shot<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.350> obviously<00:03:00.620> is

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
sometimes one-shot you so obviously is

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.530 
sometimes one-shot you so obviously is
make<00:03:00.950> sure<00:03:01.100> you're<00:03:01.280> blocking<00:03:01.700> them<00:03:02.090> there's

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
make sure you're blocking them there's

magic a stamina and health before each

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.970 
magic a stamina and health before each
fall<00:03:56.630> I<00:03:56.870> know<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.350> can<00:03:57.470> be<00:03:57.500> hard<00:03:57.590> when<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:57.890> can

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
fall I know it can be hard when you can

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.860 
fall I know it can be hard when you can
only<00:03:58.130> see<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.459> health<00:03:58.760> bars<00:03:59.030> because<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.810> the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
only see the health bars because of the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.380 
only see the health bars because of the
changes<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:00.380> ZeniMax<00:04:01.370> did<00:04:01.550> make<00:04:01.760> we<00:04:02.209> don't

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
changes that ZeniMax did make we don't

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.110 
changes that ZeniMax did make we don't
have<00:04:02.720> access<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.740> other<00:04:04.040> players<00:04:04.550> magic

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
have access to the other players magic

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.040 
have access to the other players magic
ahead

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
ahead

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.330 
ahead
so<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.410> makes<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.680> little<00:04:06.740> bit<00:04:06.950> harder<00:04:07.220> cuz

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
so it makes it a little bit harder cuz

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.160 
so it makes it a little bit harder cuz
in<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.520> beer<00:04:07.640> that<00:04:07.760> we<00:04:07.850> could<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:08.690> just<00:04:08.960> make

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
in the beer that we could but just make
