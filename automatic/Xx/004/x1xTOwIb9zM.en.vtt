00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.550 
know a little bit bigger than an iPhone
which<00:02:43.880> is<00:02:44.030> really<00:02:44.540> crazy<00:02:44.840> because<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.230> lot<00:02:45.530> of

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
which is really crazy because a lot of

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.030 
which is really crazy because a lot of
laptop<00:02:46.010> charging<00:02:46.700> cables<00:02:47.060> are<00:02:47.590> pretty<00:02:48.590> big<00:02:48.770> so

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
laptop charging cables are pretty big so

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.270 
laptop charging cables are pretty big so
also<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:50.120> has<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> rubber

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
also it has a rubber

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.720 
also it has a rubber
strap<00:02:52.910> instead<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.360> like<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:54.370> Velcro<00:02:55.370> one<00:02:55.580> that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
strap instead of like a Velcro one that

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.540 
strap instead of like a Velcro one that
really<00:02:55.940> gets<00:02:56.180> worn<00:02:56.630> out<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:57.620> there's<00:02:58.160> the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
really gets worn out so there's the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.100 
really gets worn out so there's the
other<00:02:58.760> thing<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.150> comes<00:02:59.390> with<00:02:59.660> that's<00:02:59.900> just

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
other thing that comes with that's just

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.920 
other thing that comes with that's just
the<00:03:00.230> box<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:01.160> then<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.730> second<00:03:02.120> power<00:03:02.450> strip

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
the box and then the second power strip

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.300 
the box and then the second power strip
so<00:03:03.170> that's<00:03:03.380> everything<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.800> comes<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.100> box

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
so that's everything that comes the box

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.100 
so that's everything that comes the box
as<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.150> see<00:03:05.300> it's<00:03:05.420> empty

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
as you can see it's empty

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.530 
as you can see it's empty

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.960 

so<00:03:16.829> now<00:03:16.950> we're<00:03:17.099> actually

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
itself and out of the packaging and this

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.090 
itself and out of the packaging and this

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
you can see how long it takes to startup

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.950 
you can see how long it takes to startup
and<00:04:46.620> like<00:04:46.890> literally<00:04:47.280> 10<00:04:47.910> seconds<00:04:48.419> it's<00:04:48.660> up

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
have to log in the synapse to do that so

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.409 
have to log in the synapse to do that so
we'll<00:05:13.020> do<00:05:13.260> that<00:05:13.290> really<00:05:13.650> quick<00:05:14.180> all<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.330> have

lit up that took a minute yeah but as
you<00:05:50.040> can<00:05:50.130> see<00:05:50.750> I've<00:05:51.750> already<00:05:51.900> remapped<00:05:52.410> them

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
you can see I've already remapped them

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.740 
you can see I've already remapped them
all<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.950> different<00:05:53.310> things<00:05:53.600> we've<00:05:54.600> got

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
all to different things we've got

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.750 
all to different things we've got
trackpad<00:05:55.410> legalish<00:05:55.920> and<00:05:56.130> csgo

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
trackpad legalish and csgo

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.900 
trackpad legalish and csgo
I<00:05:57.150> believe<00:05:58.080> that's<00:05:58.350> the<00:05:58.410> clock<00:05:58.910> Photoshop

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
I believe that's the clock Photoshop

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.980 
I believe that's the clock Photoshop
YouTube<00:06:00.630> this<00:06:01.440> like<00:06:01.770> manages<00:06:02.490> your<00:06:02.810> CPU<00:06:03.810> and

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
honestly that's about it for the

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.110 
honestly that's about it for the
computer<00:06:13.620> I'm<00:06:14.160> going<00:06:14.310> to<00:06:14.370> put<00:06:14.490> all<00:06:14.640> the<00:06:14.820> links

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
computer I'm going to put all the links

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.820 
computer I'm going to put all the links
and<00:06:15.270> stuff<00:06:15.690> needed<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.260> check<00:06:16.590> out<00:06:16.740> the

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
and stuff needed to check out the

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.440 
and stuff needed to check out the
computer<00:06:17.070> in<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.370> in<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:17.790> description<00:06:18.390> of

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
computer in the in the description of

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.390 
computer in the in the description of
this<00:06:18.510> video<00:06:18.660> so<00:06:18.930> if<00:06:18.990> you<00:06:19.110> want<00:06:19.260> to<00:06:19.320> go<00:06:19.470> you<00:06:20.310> know

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
this video so if you want to go you know

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.640 
this video so if you want to go you know
in-depth<00:06:21.180> with<00:06:21.480> it<00:06:21.690> I<00:06:21.720> guess<00:06:21.990> I'll<00:06:22.320> go<00:06:22.470> through

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
in-depth with it I guess I'll go through

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.330 
in-depth with it I guess I'll go through
the<00:06:22.770> USB<00:06:23.190> ports<00:06:23.580> and<00:06:23.730> stuff<00:06:23.940> it<00:06:24.270> has<00:06:24.860> three<00:06:25.860> USB

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
the USB ports and stuff it has three USB

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.590 
the USB ports and stuff it has three USB
3.0<00:06:27.300> and<00:06:27.830> HDMI<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:29.130> a<00:06:29.190> power<00:06:29.600> supply

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
3.0 and HDMI and a power supply

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.580 
3.0 and HDMI and a power supply
obviously<00:06:31.470> I<00:06:32.250> think<00:06:33.180> that's<00:06:33.510> it<00:06:33.690> and<00:06:34.140> Ethernet

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
obviously I think that's it and Ethernet

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.220 
obviously I think that's it and Ethernet
and<00:06:34.800> then<00:06:35.010> headphone<00:06:35.400> mic<00:06:35.730> jack<00:06:36.030> and<00:06:36.360> there's

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230
