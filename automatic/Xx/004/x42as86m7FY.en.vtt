00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.520
 hi everybody is always on 90 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.740
 and here I am guys back with the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.330
 second episode of the series that i 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.410
 strike with all weapons 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.610
 I'm here today to bring you this with 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.379
 sc 2010 which as you can see is a rifle 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.160
 assault that to find really a lot 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.890
 very strong but it is no longer strong 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.280
 too civil as usual because anyway 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.830
 there was k12 there are other weapons a little more 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.949
 sincerely strong this however it is 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.930
 that was my first though is I have not 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.589
 loaded with the first because in my opinion 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.510
 the key I gave you was more beautiful 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.489
 showed up yesterday so then I have it 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.290
 uploaded that first and now this one 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.180
 here, however, a nun is made but is 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.340
 enough left however will produce a 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.850
 because I couldn't find the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.110
 enemies is still the class 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.759
 nothing the usual with 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.750
 which pedator rapid extraction e 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.539
 political for Milan is faster 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.950
 and also steel which is called if it is 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:32.710
 I do n't remember what it's called 9 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.310
 and then okay specialist anyway I went 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.770
 speak camps or specialist was a must 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.200
 no guys anyway in this video 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.679
 I wanted to talk to you for a moment 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.970
 I don't know if I had already mentioned that it was me 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:51.190
 the publishing channel was closed after 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.869
 having made a ghost stream 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.770
 day before the game is released 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.020
 so they closed the store for me 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.399
 channel I do n't know for what reason also 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.140
 because they had put the category 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.849
 I've done post projects 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.539
 let's say this stream has me the most 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:11.560
 on the canal, however, fortunately there is today 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.569
 yesterday I succeeded is a sick and complaint 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.730
 apple have therefore unblocked surely 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:23.470
 guys today I will do a streaming where 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.959
 maybe I think you turn out I 'll explain a 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.230
 artistic port of this game that does not 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.420
 everyone can understand why in 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.440
 effects is not really not really 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:39.609
 easy to understand, I'll explain respawn and there 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.069
 he will be a special guest that I will not say now 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:45.250
 you will discover it you will discover today with it 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.650
 streaming is nothing we hope to get 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.709
 still a good one 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:56.790
 a city ​​of gears however guys there 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:00.650
 map as you see if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.650
 imported other than English this map 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.150
 let's say a tip I can give you 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.939
 give to send the gems and not go 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.439
 as you see in this gameplay is not 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.970
 go to the map center because also 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.920
 because in the end the enemies were 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.829
 bought more or less on the houses look 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.440
 always center map follow says turn 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.269
 or as you see how I am doing 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.639
 turn around the map you will find more 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.700
 or less always from behind and you have to look 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:33.079
 also to stand in the background and how to 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.720
 now I'm doing nothing the flag 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.879
 the flag is more or less the sponsor 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.040
 water near and above all though 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:46.230
 you are type series horns it takes us to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.280
 good headphones managed to understand from where 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.000
 the enemies come 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.590
 I sometimes sometimes discount type 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.480
 seeds arrive friends from yesterday so 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.639
 very very important above all 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.299
 this game like that of four ad 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:05.239
 very important example to be 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.239
 headset t to understand duties for enemies 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.169
 so this here is some advice that 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.629
 I can give you anyway I can use 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.449
 I repeat, never go to the map center 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.530
 because they almost certainly decide 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.190
 anyway guys 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.090
 this video is finished in a while 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.370
 the Rome that strikes me 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:34.130
 sorry I will take it to 24 million 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.090
 row because we use inflexible 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.760
 especially really very lucky 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.300
 why 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.770
 the m 2 in front of the last exit 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.220
 one of them is immediately after the other 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.340
 kills and mandola ken therefore enough 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:54.380
 a pretty lucky cream 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.900
