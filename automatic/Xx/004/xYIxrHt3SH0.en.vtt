observatory here on our vision city map

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.779 
observatory here on our vision city map
and<00:00:15.890> I<00:00:16.890> thought<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.190> was<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.430> really<00:00:17.580> great

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
and I thought this was a really great

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.849 
and I thought this was a really great
addition<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:19.199> was<00:00:19.350> really<00:00:19.529> pretty<00:00:19.650> much

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
addition that it was really pretty much

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.189 
addition that it was really pretty much
his<00:00:20.039> idea<00:00:20.310> from<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.520> start<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.090> he<00:00:21.900> created

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
his idea from the start and he created

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.200 
his idea from the start and he created
the<00:00:22.500> shell<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.160> came<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.789> did<00:00:23.970> some

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the shell and I came up and did some

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.259 
the shell and I came up and did some
landscaping<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.880> tweaked<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> little<00:00:26.970> bit<00:00:27.210> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
landscaping and tweaked a little bit of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.609 
landscaping and tweaked a little bit of
the<00:00:27.330> inside<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the inside but it was kind of like a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.560 
the inside but it was kind of like a
joint<00:00:28.949> bill<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.609> rainbows<00:00:29.970> idea<00:00:30.330> I

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
joint bill but it was rainbows idea I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
joint bill but it was rainbows idea I
thought<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.410> was<00:00:31.470> really<00:00:31.529> cool<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:31.920> this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
thought it was really cool because this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.610 
thought it was really cool because this
is<00:00:32.369> another<00:00:32.579> great<00:00:32.910> example<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.660> something

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
is another great example of something

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.110 
is another great example of something
that's<00:00:34.770> real<00:00:35.130> life<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> lot<00:00:35.969> of

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that's real life that not a lot of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.760 
that's real life that not a lot of
people<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.540> thought<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> world's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
people have thought about in the world's

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.410 
people have thought about in the world's
I've<00:00:37.860> seen<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> few<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:39.270> have

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
I've seen a few out there these have
been<00:00:39.570> made<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.290> mean<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.800> haven't<00:00:41.100> seen<00:00:41.340> them

been made but I mean I haven't seen them

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
been made but I mean I haven't seen them
a<00:00:41.520> lot<00:00:41.700> personally<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.540> worlds<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.710> just

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829

a lot personally in worlds and it's just
another<00:00:44.010> easy<00:00:44.360> build<00:00:45.360> something<00:00:45.930> real<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
another easy build something real you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.080 
another easy build something real you
know<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.680> are<00:00:46.800> observatories<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.850> they're

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
know there are observatories and they're

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
know there are observatories and they're
pretty<00:00:48.210> simple<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:48.840> i<00:00:49.020> mean<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.800> just

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
pretty simple really i mean it's just

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.279 
pretty simple really i mean it's just
somewhere<00:00:50.579> where<00:00:50.760> telescope<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> housed<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
somewhere where telescope is housed a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.920 
somewhere where telescope is housed a
pretty<00:00:53.100> standard<00:00:53.520> shape<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> design<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
pretty standard shape and design so it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.430 
pretty standard shape and design so it
be<00:00:55.020> easily<00:00:55.789> replicable<00:00:56.870> which<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> really

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
be easily replicable which is really

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.029 
be easily replicable which is really
cool<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.239> when<00:01:00.239> i<00:01:00.270> show<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.539> guys<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.590> little

little maybe these look some

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.810 
little maybe these look some
communication<00:01:09.119> antennas<00:01:10.250> some<00:01:11.250> boosters<00:01:11.640> or

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
communication antennas some boosters or

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.390 
communication antennas some boosters or
something<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.770> little<00:01:13.770> sonar<00:01:14.159> dish

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
something a little little sonar dish

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.070 
something a little little sonar dish
right<00:01:14.610> extra<00:01:15.000> radar<00:01:15.299> dish<00:01:15.509> maybe<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.900> can

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
right extra radar dish maybe they can

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.160 
right extra radar dish maybe they can
look<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.530> some<00:01:16.939> deep<00:01:17.939> gamma<00:01:18.299> rays<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
look at some deep gamma rays with that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
look at some deep gamma rays with that
or<00:01:19.320> something<00:01:19.650> into<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> deep<00:01:20.460> space<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
or something into the deep space and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
or something into the deep space and
we're<00:01:22.049> gonna<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.380> start<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
we're gonna will start here at the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.390 
we're gonna will start here at the
parking<00:01:23.340> lot<00:01:23.570> micro<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.159> i<00:01:26.189> did

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
parking lot micro way up this so i did

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
parking lot micro way up this so i did
just<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.299> little<00:01:28.229> side<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.950> know

coming

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
coming

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.810 
coming
but<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.620> get<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.890> with<00:01:54.010> this<00:01:54.160> one<00:01:54.400> so<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:54.640> did

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
but to get on with this one so I did

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.250 
but to get on with this one so I did
these<00:01:55.030> little<00:01:55.270> steps<00:01:55.510> here<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:55.930> thought<00:01:56.140> it'd

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
these little steps here I thought it'd

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.740 
these little steps here I thought it'd
be<00:01:56.290> cool<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.560> make<00:01:56.860> like<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:58.450> just<00:01:58.630> like<00:01:58.690> a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
be cool to make like a like just like a

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.630 
be cool to make like a like just like a
mountain<00:01:59.140> path<00:01:59.320> so<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.010> actually<00:02:00.190> go<00:02:00.520> up<00:02:00.550> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
mountain path so you actually go up the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.800 
mountain path so you actually go up the
gotta<00:02:03.640> climb<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.090> mountain<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.450> know<00:02:04.600> is

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
gotta climb the mountain you know is

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.420 
gotta climb the mountain you know is
that<00:02:04.960> when<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.440> put<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.710> observatories<00:02:06.400> in

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
that when you put the observatories in

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.580 
that when you put the observatories in
real<00:02:06.640> life<00:02:06.820> they're<00:02:07.030> always<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.630> know<00:02:07.750> they

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
real life they're always you know they

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.410 
real life they're always you know they
try<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.860> get<00:02:09.070> it<00:02:09.130> as<00:02:09.190> high<00:02:09.250> as<00:02:09.460> possible<00:02:09.520> less

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
rainbow farts 117 observatory we should

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.390 
rainbow farts 117 observatory we should
probably<00:02:43.300> give<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.780> another<00:02:44.500> name<00:02:44.770> like<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
maybe and here is just a little detail

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.750 
maybe and here is just a little detail
of<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.800> telescope<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.370> thought<00:02:54.610> this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
of the telescope and so I thought this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.640 
of the telescope and so I thought this
was<00:02:54.940> really<00:02:55.270> cool<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.690> we<00:02:55.900> even<00:02:56.080> set<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.380> up<00:02:56.500> so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
was really cool and we even set it up so

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.830 
was really cool and we even set it up so
you<00:02:56.680> could<00:02:56.910> he<00:02:57.910> wanted<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.239> coming<00:02:58.570> here<00:02:58.720> you

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
you could he wanted you coming here you

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.560 
you could he wanted you coming here you
could<00:02:58.989> go<00:02:59.140> up<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.410> side<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.239> actually<00:03:01.239> sit

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
could go up the side and actually sit

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.360 
could go up the side and actually sit
down<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.080> seat<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.860> can<00:03:03.010> look<00:03:03.160> up

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
down in the seat and you can look up

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.640 
down in the seat and you can look up
there<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.880> can<00:03:04.030> see<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.720> glass<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.590> can

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
there you can see in the glass you can

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.229 
there you can see in the glass you can
see<00:03:05.890> all<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.070> way<00:03:06.250> up<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.520> telescope<00:03:07.000> thought

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
see all the way up the telescope thought

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:07.740 
see all the way up the telescope thought
that<00:03:07.390> was

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
that was

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.110 
that was
cool<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:12.250> out<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.580> how<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.850> get<00:03:13.000> out

cool get out of here how do you get out

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.990 
cool get out of here how do you get out
