bombs left in my hair and then I section

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.490 
bombs left in my hair and then I section
of<00:00:19.800> from<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> front<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:22.199> trying

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
of from the front like just like trying

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.000 
of from the front like just like trying
get<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> middle<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.670> possible<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:25.010> you

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
get in the middle as possible and you

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.679 
get in the middle as possible and you
season<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> razor<00:00:26.550> comb<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.449> cut

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
season the razor comb to that cut

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.960 
season the razor comb to that cut
through<00:00:27.960> sideways<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.550> reason<00:00:29.789> why<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
through sideways and the reason why I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.130 
through sideways and the reason why I
cut<00:00:30.269> through<00:00:30.630> sideways<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:32.390> because<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.870> way

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
cut through sideways is because that way

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.880 
cut through sideways is because that way
when<00:00:35.070> tlie<00:00:35.190> strays<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.820> its<00:00:36.660> straight<00:00:37.140> by

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
when tlie strays out its straight by

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.250 
when tlie strays out its straight by
basically<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> straight<00:00:39.059> line<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.110> then

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
basically I get a straight line and then

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
basically I get a straight line and then
I<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.920> makes<00:00:41.129> sense<00:00:41.340> 1channel

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
I don't think that makes sense 1channel

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.560 
I don't think that makes sense 1channel
not<00:00:42.420> confuse<00:00:43.399> yeah<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.700> me<00:00:44.879> cut<00:00:45.090> sideways

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
not confuse yeah with me cut sideways

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
not confuse yeah with me cut sideways
and<00:00:45.840> then<00:00:45.960> when<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> come<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.620> by<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.610> I
