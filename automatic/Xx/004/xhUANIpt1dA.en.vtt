00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.640
 we had pending the three premieres 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.760
 international we go with them the 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.710
 first is the bicycle boy one 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.860
 co-production that has to do with 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.810
 france belgium italy and above all 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.010
 things with two directors very 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.960
 individuals are two brothers 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.150
 jean-pierre and luc dardenne they are 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.039
 Belgians and are characterized by doing very 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.679
 good movies taking to the screen 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.810
 the most stark reality of what 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.399
 they know of some marginal sectors 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.200
 Belgians in this case a movie 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.120
 rather softer if you want to 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.129
 less visual violence and that puts in 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.739
 screen to that little boy of 11 years 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.219
 that is left by his father in a home 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.230
 for guys and trying to understand how 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.899
 can be with my father does not want to see 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.210
 his son in the middle are on one side 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.160
 feels francis for another being and rangers 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.289
 and the one that covers white elephant next to 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.390
 ricardo darín us images 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.399
 that now show more parts 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.769
 road movie infections 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.570
 directed by emilio estévez and that is 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.540
 starring his mother in life 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.190
 real martin sheen was actually born under 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.290
 the name of Ramon Antonio Estevez and 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.550
 He put that name to act good in 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.930
 this case father said 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.880
 in the same in the fiction that in the life 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.290
 real martin sheen is an ophthalmologist who 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.790
 must travel to France to meet 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.830
 with the corpse of his son so that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.140
 I wanted to make the way of Santiago a 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.090
 very attractive movie with images 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.680
 very beautiful in northern Spain if 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.330
 images are now of the spider man nothing 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.250
 they have to do with martin sheen though 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.780
 actually yes because martin sheen is going to 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.390
 be the role of Peter Parker's uncle 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.430
 we are talking about a return to the beginning 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.350
 If you had seen the four three 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.240
 chapters having a great good year is 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.130
 was the director sam raimi who was the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.540
 protagonist tobey maguire was who 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.310
 this tank was the one that made the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.230
 female counterpart but in reality 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.180
 they changed many things so that nothing 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.190
 change if now it's Andrew Garfield the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.600
 protagonist accompanied by the beautiful 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.520
 with good cristian mazzón 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.140
 as I told you with Martin Sheen as the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.760
 river with salt and filter with the aunt of 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.250
 inter parkers and actually the story 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.650
 go back to zero sheets for you 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.000
 you come back to find out not know why as 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.170
 started the spider man the sting of 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.090
 spider everything we know the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.260
 differences with the first plus that 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.910
 is not living on the role of 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.910
 villain is that the green goblin is not 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.920
 if now the villain is the lizard man 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.200
 many special effects a lot of action 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.300
 two hours and twenty a movie 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.260
 entertaining not much more a thing like that 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.260
 well unclear
