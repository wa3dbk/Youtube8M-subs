Beijing so now I before will hopefully
get<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> six<00:00:38.329> after<00:00:39.329> London<00:00:39.510> there's<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.320> big

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
get to six after London there's a big

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.170 
get to six after London there's a big
target<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.860> her<00:00:40.980> back<00:00:41.040> there's<00:00:41.820> been<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> big

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
target on her back there's been a big

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.319 
target on her back there's been a big
target<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.629> her<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.110> long<00:00:43.260> time<00:00:43.620> but

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
target on her back for a long time but

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.860 
target on her back for a long time but
this<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.910> think<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.210> we're<00:00:48.360> able<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.690> win

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this is I think if we're able to win

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.799 
this is I think if we're able to win
this<00:00:49.050> gold<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> will<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:51.329> some<00:00:51.570> ways

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
this gold I think it will in some ways

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.689 
this gold I think it will in some ways
probably<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.680> even<00:00:52.829> more<00:00:52.980> meaningful<00:00:53.670> for

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
probably be even more meaningful for

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
probably be even more meaningful for
David<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.270> other<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.050> even<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.739> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
David and I other you know even more so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.590 
David and I other you know even more so
than<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> other<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> other

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
than the other two not that the other

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
than the other two not that the other
two<00:00:57.750> weren't<00:00:57.899> extremely<00:00:58.559> meaningful<00:00:58.770> but

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
two weren't extremely meaningful but

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.330 
two weren't extremely meaningful but
this<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> hardest<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:01.340> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
this is going to be the hardest one you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.149 
this is going to be the hardest one you
know<00:01:02.460> there's<00:01:02.670> there's<00:01:03.090> several<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.769> very

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
know there's there's several very very

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.300 
know there's there's several very very
good<00:01:05.430> teams<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.390> really<00:01:06.900> think<00:01:07.110> there's

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
good teams and I really think there's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
good teams and I really think there's
three<00:01:08.310> teams<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> capability<00:01:09.750> of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
three teams there with the capability of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.010 
three teams there with the capability of
all<00:01:10.140> coming<00:01:10.470> home<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> medal<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
all coming home with a medal and and it

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
all coming home with a medal and and it
could<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.439> any<00:01:13.590> color<00:01:13.890> order<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.369> don't

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
could be in any color order I don't

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
could be in any color order I don't
really<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.810> hope<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.380> us

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
