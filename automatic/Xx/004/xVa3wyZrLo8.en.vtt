up here you will find the ether runner

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.850 
up here you will find the ether runner
go<00:03:09.269> ahead<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.600> kill<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.170> get<00:03:10.500> your<00:03:10.680> Grimm

or<00:03:11.010> should<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.519> pretty<00:03:11.670> easy<00:03:11.790> i<00:03:12.000> brought<00:03:12.239> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
or should be pretty easy i brought the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.120 
or should be pretty easy i brought the
broad<00:03:12.810> scorch<00:03:13.110> cannon<00:03:13.470> from<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.769> other<00:03:13.980> thing

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
broad scorch cannon from the other thing

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.170 
broad scorch cannon from the other thing
so<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.340> probably<00:03:14.519> do<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.730> same<00:03:14.760> thing<00:03:15.060> but

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
so you probably do the same thing but

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.310 
so you probably do the same thing but
there<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.420> there's<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.840> eastern<00:03:16.170> runner

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
there you go there's the eastern runner

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.080 
there you go there's the eastern runner

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
remember ever using this path but it

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.760 
remember ever using this path but it
does<00:03:59.610> exist<00:03:59.790> at<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.840> end<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.350> path<00:04:01.590> is

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
does exist at the end of this path is

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.640 
does exist at the end of this path is
the<00:04:02.160> last<00:04:02.430> one<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.300> twisted<00:04:03.750> claw<00:04:04.080> there<00:04:04.590> are

the last one the twisted claw there are
couple<00:04:05.010> vandals<00:04:05.430> back<00:04:05.610> here<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:06.060> think<00:04:06.450> there's

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
couple vandals back here I think there's

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.030 
couple vandals back here I think there's
only<00:04:06.660> one<00:04:06.780> actually<00:04:07.260> called<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.620> twisted

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
only one actually called the twisted

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.590 
only one actually called the twisted
claw<00:04:08.280> actually<00:04:08.910> I've<00:04:09.000> been<00:04:09.150> back<00:04:09.300> too<00:04:09.420> much

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
claw actually I've been back too much

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.760 
claw actually I've been back too much
but<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.780> looks<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.080> there's<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.350> couple<00:04:10.530> of

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
but it looks like there's a couple of

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.250 
but it looks like there's a couple of
them<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.310> there<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.490> go<00:04:11.520> kill<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.090> one<00:04:12.420> get

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
them so there you go kill that one get

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.780 
them so there you go kill that one get
your<00:04:13.380> grimoire<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:13.950> kill<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.310> rest<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.610> twist
