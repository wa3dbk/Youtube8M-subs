another thing i have found bothersome

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.780 
another thing i have found bothersome
was<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> fact<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.010> cannot<00:02:29.220> rearrange

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
was the fact that you cannot rearrange

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.430 
was the fact that you cannot rearrange
the<00:02:30.000> widgets<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.660> widgets<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.079> you<00:02:31.260> add

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the widgets the widgets that you add

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.140 
the widgets the widgets that you add
just<00:02:31.799> get<00:02:31.950> pushed<00:02:32.280> underneath<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:32.760> previous

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
just get pushed underneath the previous

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.759 
just get pushed underneath the previous
widgets<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.019> want<00:02:34.200> something<00:02:34.349> on<00:02:34.560> top

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
widgets so if you want something on top

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.470

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
you just have to delete everything and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.210 
you just have to delete everything and
start<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.959> beginning<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.560> may<00:02:38.010> sound

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
start for the beginning that may sound

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.069 
start for the beginning that may sound
like<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.640> would<00:02:38.730> ruin<00:02:39.180> your<00:02:39.450> experience<00:02:39.900> but
