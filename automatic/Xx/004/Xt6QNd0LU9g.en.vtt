00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 yes, even two today is one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.390
 additional flight started from there 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.580
 because the regular machine was already 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.469
 but otherwise booked out 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.719
 heavy regional airport 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 he is considered very deep by many 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.650
 million grave and now has 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.600
 there is also a plane on the way 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.310
 strayed to start and had to go back 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 they would have thought free to be towed 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.090
 that you on this small airport 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.890
 can be so wrong 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.380
 Kassel calden might have a go 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.710
 to reflect on his beginnings at the end 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.809
 It's what this breakdown wants to tell us 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.300
 it's just before 19 30 in Kassel calden 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.739
 rush hour at the airport one 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.809
 Machine of the airline germania 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.920
 want to calden after the stopover 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.140
 fly to dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.460
 it comes to a problem that us 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.950
 an eyewitness by mail 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.350
 so describes the pilot after the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.210
 terminal was rolled to the right he bent 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.129
 on the zubringer way to start the runway 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.079
 after a few meters prefer to stand 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.969
 now he had noticed that too 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.920
 deliverer not finished yet 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.289
 is and after 200 meters in one 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.219
 Barrier ends so stays for the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.219
 pilot the question 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.710
 Unfortunately, the answer does not have to be called 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.570
 and a plane has a reverse gear 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.100
 the germania had to start again 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.140
 let towed like this 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.640
 amateur video proves and the germania 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.399
 also grants written in Germania 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.200
 confirmed that the cockpit crew 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.960
 entrained vehicle has requested the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.149
 entire process was at no time 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.070
 security relevant why the pilot 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.560
 The man says yes 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.710
 nothing along the way so unsuspecting passers 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.090
 can not do it well have lain would 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.310
 I would say a long time of that 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.860
 short course probably differ 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.090
 yes, the airport operators are 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.250
 no one is aware of it 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.259
 point out that the pilot probably too 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.640
 stupid was packaging that but in nice 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.640
 words and writing 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.420
 Parts of the taxiway is currently still 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.220
 because of rest work this locked 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.259
 Locking was as prescribed to the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.530
 crew of germania flight communicates 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.269
 the entire process was never at the time 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.190
 safety-relevant damage 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.170
 Incidentally, none of the passengers were 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.540
 already got out and it came to luck 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.280
 just no flier for something but too 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.380
 prevent in the future so our advice 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.730
 you should simply calder in kassel calden 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.769
 back to the customs of the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.060
 Jungfernflugs return and the 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.060
 true professionals leave it
