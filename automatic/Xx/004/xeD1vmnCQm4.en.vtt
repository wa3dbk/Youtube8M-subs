00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:22.800
 prepared the crazy watermelons in a way 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:26.010
 easy and fast we have this handle up to date 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 cucumber we have the jicama we have a 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.929
 pineapple we have banderillas 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.770
 these are tamarind banderillas here 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.370
 we call him plugs this is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.460
 here piece peanut japanese lemons 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.920
 here we have streamers these are 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 tamarind inks we have chili mooi 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.219
 macaw and chilito powder this is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.219
 like the tajÃ­n 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.809
 Now let's see how we will prepare 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.879
 these watermelons the first thing we're going to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 to do is split the watermelon in half 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.309
 let's try to stay 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.040
 halves couples of the same size we can 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.830
 mark a line where we're going to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 cut if not if we think we can not 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.030
 take them out as very equal halves 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.280
 we can mark it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.049
 I prefer to mark them because they do not come out 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.299
 same all the time I'm going to use 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.350
 this tool to get me out like this 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.380
 like the zigzag 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.420
 in this way nothing else is attacking 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.509
 trying to keep the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.049
 cuts every time we put the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.049
 tool 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.259
 I'm going to put the knife in after 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.570
 because the tool does not reach 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.479
 go through all the watermelon I will put the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.450
 knife to finish leaving we go to 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.280
 take out of the fruit the watermelon we can 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.039
 remove watermelon balls with the same 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.049
 tool with the snap we can take it out 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.140
 with the knife for the guilt of the 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.610
 watermelon and split it into pictures and you 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.340
 decide if they want to do it this way 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.170
 anyway we are also going to 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.330
 of the rest of the fruits too 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.880
 we're going to lose it in pictures so that 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.459
 watermelon feels good and that we do not know 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.280
 will fall at the time of accepting it to 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.459
 take a little peel from the tip 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.260
 this way is to help the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.989
 Watermelon feels good and it does not fall 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.580
 at the moment of taking out the blame we are going to 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.890
 try not to get to the bottom to 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.049
 not we go out all the juice 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.970
 from the bottom part we start all the 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.190
 fruits in pictures and we also start 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.440
 some strips each of the fruits 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.599
 we leave some strips and the rest 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.250
 we applied in pictures here we put the 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.920
 watermelon but we did not put all the watermelon 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.870
 that we only get one part to one 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.489
 watermelons we got nothing more 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.099
 center and we leave it around 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.840
 so that if you take out only the center 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.930
 of the scene taken from little fruit 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.030
 it can be given in 35 or 40 pesos if 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.310
 they take all the blame on the watermelon is going 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.790
 to have a lot of fruit this would have in 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.040
 than to give it in 60 or 70 pesos we are going to 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.829
 put the fruit we will leave space 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.290

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.650
 the fruit watermelon in pictures and also 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.360
 We put the fruit in strips that 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.640
 stand out from the watermelon we put the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.750

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.280
 let's put the macaw 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.620
 it is optional if they have it and want 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.040
 Put it on then it also gives you a rich 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.590
 taste 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.959

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.140
