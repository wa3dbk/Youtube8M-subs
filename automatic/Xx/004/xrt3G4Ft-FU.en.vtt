familiar<00:00:55.239> layout<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.930> i<00:00:55.989> noticed<00:00:56.350> the

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
familiar layout and i noticed the

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.350 
familiar layout and i noticed the
tutorial<00:00:57.190> here<00:00:57.219> was<00:00:57.730> kind<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.000> leading<00:00:58.210> me

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
tutorial here was kind of leading me

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.970 
tutorial here was kind of leading me
through<00:00:58.450> things<00:00:58.989> so<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.559> just<00:00:59.770> thought<00:00:59.920> I'd

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
through things so I just thought I'd

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.410

play along with you guys and we could

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.330 
play along with you guys and we could
check<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:01.719> out<00:01:01.840> together<00:01:01.989> I<00:01:02.440> would<00:01:02.800> imagine<00:01:02.890> a

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
that that is a tiny little ship that's

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.780 
that that is a tiny little ship that's
like<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.380> little<00:02:05.590> raft<00:02:05.860> but<00:02:06.369> we'll<00:02:06.520> get<00:02:06.729> there

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
like a little raft but we'll get there

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.940 
like a little raft but we'll get there
we'll<00:02:07.240> build<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.570> up<00:02:07.689> right<00:02:08.079> so<00:02:08.409> I<00:02:08.679> don't<00:02:08.890> know

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
we'll build it up right so I don't know

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.949 
we'll build it up right so I don't know
it's<00:02:09.159> going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.369> be<00:02:09.459> interesting<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:10.539> try<00:02:10.569> this

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
it's going to be interesting to try this

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's going to be interesting to try this
out<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.379> see<00:02:11.469> where<00:02:11.799> we<00:02:11.950> go<00:02:11.980> from<00:02:12.129> here<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
out and see where we go from here so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.360 
out and see where we go from here so
right<00:02:14.049> away<00:02:14.079> we<00:02:14.319> can<00:02:14.590> see<00:02:14.620> where<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.069> economy

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
right away we can see where the economy

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.300 
right away we can see where the economy
is<00:02:15.639> based

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
is based

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.490 
is based
you've<00:02:16.370> got<00:02:16.550> gold<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.569> we've<00:02:17.750> got<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.200> dig

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
you've got gold that we've got to dig

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.690 
you've got gold that we've got to dig
out<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.920> ground<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.280> got<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.489> get<00:02:19.550> some

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
out of the ground we got to get some

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.979 
out of the ground we got to get some
gold<00:02:19.940> mines<00:02:20.180> out<00:02:20.420> there<00:02:20.599> so<00:02:20.720> we're<00:02:20.810> going<00:02:20.930> to

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
gold mines out there so we're going to

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.720 
gold mines out there so we're going to
go<00:02:21.080> ahead<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.260> place<00:02:21.470> our<00:02:21.680> first<00:02:22.010> gold<00:02:22.459> mine

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
go ahead and place our first gold mine

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.940 
go ahead and place our first gold mine
down<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.300> was<00:02:23.390> easy<00:02:23.569> enough<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.650> get<00:02:24.830> that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
down that was easy enough and I get that

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.030 
down that was easy enough and I get that
under<00:02:25.310> way<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:26.239> grog<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.500> obviously

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
under way and then grog so obviously

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.440 
under way and then grog so obviously
that<00:02:28.220> kind<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.520> works<00:02:28.730> along<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.239> theme

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that kind of works along with the theme

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.630 
that kind of works along with the theme
of<00:02:29.480> pirates<00:02:30.110> they<00:02:30.290> are<00:02:30.410> motivated<00:02:30.980> by<00:02:31.010> nothing

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
of pirates they are motivated by nothing

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.479 
of pirates they are motivated by nothing
less<00:02:32.270> than<00:02:32.510> grog<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.739> we<00:02:33.890> are<00:02:34.010> going<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.310> get<00:02:34.459> a

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
less than grog so we are going to get a

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.300 
less than grog so we are going to get a
distillery<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.510> grog<00:02:36.110> distillery<00:02:36.739> out<00:02:37.010> here

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
distillery a grog distillery out here

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.850 
distillery a grog distillery out here
and<00:02:37.489> work<00:02:38.239> on<00:02:38.390> getting<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.870> started<00:02:39.410> as<00:02:39.560> well

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
and work on getting that started as well

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.880 
and work on getting that started as well
a<00:02:40.400> very<00:02:40.760> interesting<00:02:41.360> way<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:41.959> motivate<00:02:42.380> the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
a very interesting way to motivate the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.559 
a very interesting way to motivate the
Pirates<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.430> fight<00:02:43.640> for<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.000> guess<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.480> of

away okay we've got to attach it to the
rest<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.870> island<00:02:56.989> here<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.410> makes

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
rest of the island here that makes

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.710 
rest of the island here that makes
complete<00:02:57.980> sense<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:59.390> we're<00:02:59.510> just<00:02:59.540> going

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
complete sense and so we're just going

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.320 
complete sense and so we're just going
to<00:02:59.780> put<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.049> down<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.650> let<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.340> tavern<00:03:01.910> be

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.690 
to put that down and let the tavern be
built<00:03:02.720> as<00:03:02.959> well<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:03.620> we've<00:03:03.769> got<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.190> basics

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
built as well so we've got the basics

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.030 
built as well so we've got the basics
there<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.540> can<00:03:05.690> get<00:03:05.810> some<00:03:05.989> pirates<00:03:06.440> obviously

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
the lines there it looks like you can

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.710 
the lines there it looks like you can
train<00:03:30.620> troops<00:03:30.859> in<00:03:31.100> order<00:03:31.579> so<00:03:32.299> that's<00:03:32.510> pretty

grew up near the ocean so this is gonna
be<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.430> lot<00:03:49.549> of<00:03:49.609> fun<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.389> a<00:03:50.420> check<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.810> out<00:03:51.019> look

be a lot of fun to a check this out look

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.379 
be a lot of fun to a check this out look
at<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.530> size<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.040> map<00:03:52.310> we've<00:03:52.730> got<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> lot

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
at the size of the map we've got a lot

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.289 
at the size of the map we've got a lot
of<00:03:53.420> exploration<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.440> do<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.730> it's<00:03:56.150> going<00:03:56.239> to

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
of exploration to do and it's going to

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.670 
of exploration to do and it's going to
be<00:03:56.420> interesting<00:03:56.569> to<00:03:56.870> kind<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.350> learn<00:03:57.470> the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
be interesting to kind of learn the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.550 
be interesting to kind of learn the
mechanics<00:03:57.829> of<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:59.030> game<00:03:59.060> here<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.440> we're

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
mechanics of the game here and so we're

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.849 
mechanics of the game here and so we're
going<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.739> drag<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.810> explore<00:04:02.810> set<00:04:03.200> sail<00:04:03.530> okay

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
going to drag and explore set sail okay

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.890 
going to drag and explore set sail okay
so<00:04:03.920> there's<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.190> set<00:04:04.400> sail<00:04:04.609> button<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.209> it

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
so there's a set sail button and it

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.420 
so there's a set sail button and it
takes<00:04:06.109> just<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.410> few<00:04:06.560> seconds<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.069> looks<00:04:07.280> like

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
takes just a few seconds it looks like

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.099 
takes just a few seconds it looks like
to<00:04:07.579> explore<00:04:07.940> each<00:04:08.150> new<00:04:08.389> tile<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:09.139> map<00:04:09.829> and

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
to explore each new tile of the map and

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.509 
to explore each new tile of the map and
we're<00:04:12.109> just<00:04:12.560> about<00:04:12.680> going<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.100> arrive<00:04:13.280> there<00:04:13.489> a

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
we're just about going to arrive there a

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.160 
we're just about going to arrive there a
couple<00:04:13.700> more<00:04:13.970> seconds<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.569> maybe<00:04:14.900> it's<00:04:15.049> going

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
couple more seconds and maybe it's going

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.800 
couple more seconds and maybe it's going
to<00:04:15.230> uncover<00:04:15.590> what's<00:04:15.829> around<00:04:16.039> us<00:04:16.280> yep<00:04:17.239> okay

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
to uncover what's around us yep okay

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.960 
to uncover what's around us yep okay
nope<00:04:18.139> alright<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.070> we've<00:04:19.220> got<00:04:19.370> exploration

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
nope alright so we've got exploration

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.460 
nope alright so we've got exploration
points<00:04:20.389> so<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.660> looks<00:04:20.989> like<00:04:21.109> that's<00:04:21.289> going

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
points so that looks like that's going

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.080 
points so that looks like that's going
to<00:04:21.590> be<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.680> critical<00:04:22.100> part<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.400> game<00:04:22.550> there

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
to be a critical part of the game there

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.880 
to be a critical part of the game there
we<00:04:23.270> go<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:23.630> now<00:04:23.660> we<00:04:23.870> can<00:04:24.200> check<00:04:24.500> out<00:04:24.710> the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
we go so now we can check out the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.250 
we go so now we can check out the
surrounding<00:04:25.520> tiles<00:04:26.030> so<00:04:26.539> that<00:04:26.690> kind<00:04:26.960> of<00:04:27.080> makes

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
surrounding tiles so that kind of makes

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.860 
surrounding tiles so that kind of makes
logical<00:04:27.919> sense<00:04:28.270> wherever<00:04:29.270> your<00:04:29.360> ship<00:04:29.599> is<00:04:29.750> you

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
logical sense wherever your ship is you

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.460 
logical sense wherever your ship is you
can<00:04:30.020> see<00:04:30.050> this

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
can see this

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.660 
can see this
rounding<00:04:30.770> tiles<00:04:31.010> there<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:31.370> we've<00:04:31.460> got<00:04:31.550> an

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
rounding tiles there so we've got an

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.760 
rounding tiles there so we've got an
island<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:33.020> looks<00:04:33.170> like<00:04:33.230> something<00:04:33.500> we

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
island and it looks like something we

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.300 
island and it looks like something we
can<00:04:33.950> battle<00:04:34.340> there<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.930> all<00:04:35.930> right<00:04:36.170> so<00:04:36.410> we<00:04:37.070> are

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
can battle there and all right so we are

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.070 
can battle there and all right so we are
yeah<00:04:37.820> there's<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.090> lot<00:04:38.390> of<00:04:38.420> map<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.780> uncover

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
yeah there's a lot of map to uncover

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.290 
yeah there's a lot of map to uncover
that<00:04:39.230> makes<00:04:39.470> sense<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.550> don't<00:04:40.850> know<00:04:40.910> man<00:04:41.120> it

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
that makes sense so I don't know man it

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.820 
that makes sense so I don't know man it
looks<00:04:41.450> like<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.960> going<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.290> be<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.410> deep

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
looks like this is going to be a deep

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.310 
looks like this is going to be a deep
game<00:04:43.190> with<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.520> with<00:04:43.850> a<00:04:43.880> lot<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.270> gameplay<00:04:44.930> and

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
game with a with a lot of gameplay and

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.440 
game with a with a lot of gameplay and
so<00:04:46.250> we've<00:04:46.400> got<00:04:46.640> up<00:04:46.880> we've<00:04:47.060> got<00:04:47.180> our<00:04:47.270> first

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
so we've got up we've got our first

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.810 
so we've got up we've got our first
chance<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.870> fight<00:04:48.230> and<00:04:48.500> we<00:04:49.130> have<00:04:49.250> no<00:04:49.430> idea<00:04:49.760> of

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
chance to fight and we have no idea of

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.400 
chance to fight and we have no idea of
what<00:04:49.970> we're<00:04:50.090> doing<00:04:50.450> so<00:04:50.690> let's<00:04:50.960> get<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.230> there

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
what we're doing so let's get in there
