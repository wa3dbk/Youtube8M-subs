00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
and there's a type of case so it's a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.450 
and there's a type of case so it's a
nice<00:02:21.360> orange<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:22.050> little<00:02:22.890> bit<00:02:22.980> light<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
nice orange a little bit light on the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.310 
nice orange a little bit light on the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
bit darker so and what's the front of

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.900 
bit darker so and what's the front of
the<00:02:28.140> case<00:02:30.230> I'll<00:02:31.230> actually<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:32.220> putting<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.700> vent

a little train that I've just made with

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.790 
a little train that I've just made with

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
the fancy white LED so it's kind of only

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.190 
the fancy white LED so it's kind of only
made<00:03:14.070> things<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.970> bit<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.840> what's<00:03:15.990> gotta<00:03:16.140> be

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
made things a bit so what's gotta be

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.050 
made things a bit so what's gotta be

under this power supply cover here is

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.170 
under this power supply cover here is
the<00:03:18.720> hard<00:03:19.530> drive<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.280> solid<00:03:20.790> state<00:03:20.850> drive

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the hard drive in the solid state drive

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.070 
the hard drive in the solid state drive
I<00:03:22.100> could<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.580> was<00:03:23.880> going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.390> was<00:03:24.570> thinking

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
I could I was going to I was thinking

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.470 
I could I was going to I was thinking
about<00:03:25.140> having<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> hard<00:03:25.800> drive<00:03:26.420> mounted<00:03:27.420> to

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
about having the hard drive mounted to

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.820 
about having the hard drive mounted to
the<00:03:27.540> back<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.960> motherboard<00:03:28.110> but<00:03:28.650> um

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
the back of the motherboard but um

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.760 
the back of the motherboard but um
because<00:03:29.580> actually<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.600> lot<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.870> room<00:03:31.110> behind

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
because actually a lot of room behind

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.860 
because actually a lot of room behind
the<00:03:32.040> mother<00:03:32.280> will<00:03:32.460> try<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.660> was<00:03:33.750> probably

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the mother will try but it was probably

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.310 
the mother will try but it was probably
about<00:03:34.080> three<00:03:34.170> Moo<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:36.060> fit<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.780> unfortunately

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
about three Moo to fit so unfortunately

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.300 
about three Moo to fit so unfortunately
I<00:03:37.410> couldn't<00:03:37.740> um<00:03:39.170> yeah<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.620> little<00:03:41.010> bit<00:03:41.130> air

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
I couldn't um yeah so a little bit air

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.620 
I couldn't um yeah so a little bit air
flows<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.820> we're<00:03:41.910> gonna<00:03:42.090> hear<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:42.420> when<00:03:42.600> I

I've hit up a negative feedback about it
but<00:04:42.620> at<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.889> end<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.100> day<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.340> know<00:04:43.639> this

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
but at the end of the day you know this

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.129 
but at the end of the day you know this
is<00:04:44.510> how<00:04:44.660> it's<00:04:44.810> going<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.050> go<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:48.020> know

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
is how it's going to go and you know

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.900 
is how it's going to go and you know
it's<00:04:48.380> worth<00:04:48.590> with<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.130> bent<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.580> front<00:04:49.610> I

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
it's worth with the bent in the front I

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.330 
it's worth with the bent in the front I
think<00:04:50.120> could<00:04:50.240> be<00:04:50.270> right<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.889> really<00:04:52.190> with

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
think could be right so and really with

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.800 
think could be right so and really with
