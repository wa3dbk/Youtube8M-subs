00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.940
 we are at microsoft on the stage 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.130
 just after the computex keynote and 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.779
 have here the crystal windows phone 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.800
 city ​​from a new partner of 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.330
 microsoft for windows phone the cheap 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.430
 brings devices to the market with the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.080
 operating system of the redmond and here 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.460
 we think we have a 52 model 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.439
 this had to be the display works 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.640
 I can do it for a while 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.750
 Comparison against the others 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.670
 holding candidates 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.629
 this is the first four is not coming 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.500
 luzon milley 47 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.329
 Accordingly , there that the display 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.039
 I think a bit bigger is at 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.480
 You can also do the festival model 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.489
 Be eighth but I think 5 inches 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.910
 the resolution is not necessarily the 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.949
 highest if you look and mine 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 camera is here you can see that 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.920
 which is a bit blurry we have 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.839
 a camera on the front of course the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.460
 speakers the countries around the display 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.199
 are relatively wide that is below 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.540
 other things that now works here 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.450
 because windows 8.1 year 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 these 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.920
 has effects with the black screen 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 background behind the part so that the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.990
 whole is a little wider than it is 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.549
 in fact we have down here 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 physically indicated so capacitive 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.049
 touch buttons including a very 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.880
 small windows logos missing 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.360
 first, of course, have the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.210
 Search function and the back button over 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.890
 The search function I would theoretically 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.960
 Portans get but that goes in here 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.259
 Taiwan of course not the device now 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.380
 looks relatively relatively thick in comparison 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.450
 to ds at least it is a qualcomm 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.890
 Snapdragon 400 or 200 on 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.500
 board that would have to be a quad 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.869
 core sas this in the with 12 to 14 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.459
 or 16 gigahertz runs 1 gb 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.439
 Memory and different 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.849
 There are also lots of flash memory 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.890
 Of course, there is a speaker in the back 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:01.770
 a relatively large logo of prestige and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.539
 a camera that I believe with 8 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.009
 megapixel resolves microsoft has here 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.049
 Unfortunately, no information to the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.429
 there are devices called nearby 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.170
 of course a flash that is very 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.630
 is practical in the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.350
 middle lower middle price range 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.000
 move around it micro micro USB port 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.500
 plus a headphone jack the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.060
 back is likely to be removable and it 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.560
 probably also a micro 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.389
 sd card slot just give this one 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.859
 mid-range and low end devices likely 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.329
 we'll be on board in any case 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:31.889
 have here the on and off switch yet 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:34.470
 and the volume rocker acts naturally 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.760
 Compared to yes has something heavier 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.190
 accordingly probably also one 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.620
 a little longer battery life and more 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.760
 actually not to say that 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.700
 as far as I can see we only have here 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.100
 a sim card or we can even times the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.959
 make fun and the sims no we have 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.880
 actually two sim cards so too 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.010
 the prestigio windows phone is coming 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.769
 definitely with two sim cards on it 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.569
 market 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.510
 yes that was a quick look at the new one 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.379
 prestigio windows phone from the new 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.969
 who is also active in europe and the 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.640
 device is based on security 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.349
 chor com reference design if you like this 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.579
 then we will see each other 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.530
 Soon you subscribed again 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.489
 hopefully this channel and gives us 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.489
 now mike until then
