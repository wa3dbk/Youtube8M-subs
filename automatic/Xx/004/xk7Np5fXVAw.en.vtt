00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.600
 hello, I'm a valtinho teacher, this is the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 channel more here every week 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.460
 we present generation proposals so that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 you can exercise your writing 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.990
 in today's video we will address a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.349
 subject that rita and much the mobility 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.430
 humanity or imaginary that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.370
 one of its largest dimensions 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.800
 would turn the wheel into a nightmare 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.170
 invention was still brought together by two 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.660
 them with this put a wood on 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.539
 with some animal traction was being 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.610
 made the wagon all right since it was 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.039
 very useful in rural and even urban 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.960
 throughout the history of mankind 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.239
 The problem is that time has passed and who 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.250
 essentially lived in the countryside was to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.660
 the city and what was a wagon 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.359
 turned into a car 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.409
 to get an idea in Brazil in 1940 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.880
 31% of the population lived in the city in 2010 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.500
 was 84% and today we have one car for each 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.479
 four people 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 it seems obvious that a structure of roads 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.950
 Urban that changes not slowly 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.750
 will account for so much growth 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.970
 now let's imagine a map of a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 at first small town well if she 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.049
 grows the space she has for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.509
 develop their margins 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.390
 Here is another problem the work 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 usually stays in the center or 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.650
 people need to use 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.049
 transportation to get to work 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.549
 the more the city grows longer 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.070
 takes time to get there 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.259
 there is usually public transport 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.040
 costly and of low quality and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.960
 the variety with all this nothing more 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.450
 logical of what people want 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.119
 move with comfort and nothing more 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.409
 logical than wanting a car well 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.380
 that is where the auto industry 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.750
 come from over and over and over and the streets 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.479
 become fuller and fuller and what 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.420
 prognosis soon we will reach a 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.729
 collapse and the city will stop and there 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.679
 to change all that is precisely what 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.450
 we want to know produce a text 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.600
 argumentative essay with about 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.180
 30 lines over 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.560
 this issue there are outputs for better 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.870
 urban mobility 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.060
 you can do your essay and ask for 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.220
 Your teacher will correct you if you 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.220
