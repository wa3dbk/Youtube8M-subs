how do you see this playing out over the

and<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.019> think<00:03:55.320> we<00:03:55.560> will<00:03:55.680> see<00:03:55.890> filings<00:03:56.430> will<00:03:56.670> see

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
a bit of a lull as briefs are drafted

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.759 
a bit of a lull as briefs are drafted

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
and as court hearings are scheduled I

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.860 
and as court hearings are scheduled I
think<00:04:02.400> that's<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.670> most<00:04:02.880> likely<00:04:03.090> outcome<00:04:03.329> but

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
think that's the most likely outcome but

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.960 
think that's the most likely outcome but
I<00:04:03.930> think<00:04:04.230> there's<00:04:04.440> also<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:05.040> wild<00:04:05.459> card<00:04:05.670> and

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
I think there's also a wild card and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.300 
I think there's also a wild card and
that's<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.630> Donald<00:04:07.109> sterling<00:04:07.170> agrees<00:04:08.130> to

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that's that Donald sterling agrees to

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.759 
that's that Donald sterling agrees to
sell<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.609> team<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.150> he<00:04:09.810> wants<00:04:10.260> probably<00:04:10.650> to

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
sell the team and he wants probably to

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.500 
sell the team and he wants probably to
have<00:04:10.920> some<00:04:11.190> say<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.430> who<00:04:11.670> buys<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.090> team<00:04:12.299> and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
have some say in who buys the team and

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.900 
have some say in who buys the team and
one<00:04:12.989> possible<00:04:13.560> arrangement<00:04:14.100> is<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.370> he<00:04:14.880> gets

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
one possible arrangement is that he gets

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.270 
one possible arrangement is that he gets
to<00:04:15.180> pick<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.630> owner<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.530> NBA<00:04:16.829> approved

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
to pick the owner and the NBA approved

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.599 
to pick the owner and the NBA approved
the<00:04:17.430> owner<00:04:17.609> now<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.989> would<00:04:19.169> be<00:04:19.200> maybe<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.310> fair

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
the owner now that would be maybe a fair

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.460 
the owner now that would be maybe a fair
compromise<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.419> NBA<00:04:21.570> because<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.200> wants

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
compromise to the NBA because it wants

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.740 
compromise to the NBA because it wants
the<00:04:22.530> Sterling's<00:04:23.039> out<00:04:23.280> we<00:04:23.970> don't<00:04:24.090> yet<00:04:24.330> see<00:04:24.570> that

the Sterling's out we don't yet see that

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.930 
the Sterling's out we don't yet see that
happening<00:04:25.200> but<00:04:25.409> the<00:04:26.220> Sterling's<00:04:26.700> have<00:04:26.820> to

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
happening but the Sterling's have to

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.740 
happening but the Sterling's have to
also<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.300> thinking<00:04:27.419> of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
also be thinking of

tax on the difference between what they

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.920 
tax on the difference between what they
bought<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:32.940> about<00:04:33.390> 12<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.900> half

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
bought it for about 12 and a half

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.750 
bought it for about 12 and a half
million<00:04:34.290> what<00:04:34.590> they<00:04:34.680> sell<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:35.010> for<00:04:35.220> which

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
million what they sell it for which

could be one and a half billion paying a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.290 
could be one and a half billion paying a
tax<00:04:37.980> or<00:04:38.220> something<00:04:38.520> like<00:04:38.640> 500<00:04:38.880> million

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300

dollars<00:04:39.720> that<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.140> a<00:04:40.320> huge<00:04:40.860> figure<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:41.340> gives

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
dollars that the a huge figure it gives

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.970 
dollars that the a huge figure it gives
an<00:04:41.700> incentive<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.270> fight<00:04:42.540> but<00:04:43.260> i<00:04:43.530> think<00:04:43.890> the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
an incentive to fight but i think the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.410 
an incentive to fight but i think the
Sterling's<00:04:44.370> may<00:04:44.460> also<00:04:44.610> be<00:04:44.820> thinking<00:04:44.970> if<00:04:45.240> this

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
Sterling's may also be thinking if this

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.630 
Sterling's may also be thinking if this
team<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.780> really<00:04:45.960> worth<00:04:46.320> as<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:47.490> heard

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
team is really worth as we heard

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.580 
team is really worth as we heard
yesterday<00:04:47.850> up<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.540> two<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.900> half<00:04:49.050> billion<00:04:49.320> i

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
yesterday up to two and a half billion i

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.660 
yesterday up to two and a half billion i
don't<00:04:49.740> believe<00:04:49.920> that<00:04:49.980> number<00:04:50.340> but<00:04:50.460> let's<00:04:50.610> just

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
don't believe that number but let's just

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.970 
don't believe that number but let's just
say<00:04:50.850> it's<00:04:51.000> remotely<00:04:51.570> true<00:04:51.960> they<00:04:52.500> may<00:04:52.680> figure

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
say it's remotely true they may figure

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.500 
say it's remotely true they may figure
it's<00:04:53.130> time<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.400> cash<00:04:53.550> out<00:04:53.760> well<00:04:54.210> that's<00:04:54.390> the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
it's time to cash out well that's the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
answer to the NBA I think morally or if

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.220 
answer to the NBA I think morally or if
you<00:05:20.550> look<00:05:20.730> at<00:05:20.850> from<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.120> NBA's<00:05:21.480> when<00:05:21.720> he<00:05:21.960> wants

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
you look at from the NBA's when he wants

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.700 
you look at from the NBA's when he wants
the<00:05:22.350> NBA<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.770> pay<00:05:23.220> is<00:05:23.400> capital<00:05:23.940> gains<00:05:24.120> taxes

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
the NBA to pay is capital gains taxes

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.290 
the NBA to pay is capital gains taxes
well<00:05:25.710> he<00:05:25.860> cites<00:05:26.190> capital<00:05:26.580> gain<00:05:26.730> tax<00:05:26.760> is<00:05:27.210> the

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
well he cites capital gain tax is the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.970 
well he cites capital gain tax is the
reason<00:05:27.600> why<00:05:27.690> he<00:05:27.810> shouldn't<00:05:28.050> be<00:05:28.140> outed<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.740> I

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
reason why he shouldn't be outed and I

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.650 
reason why he shouldn't be outed and I
imagine<00:05:29.250> one<00:05:29.640> argument<00:05:29.940> would<00:05:30.210> be<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.360> the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
imagine one argument would be that the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.540 
imagine one argument would be that the
NBA<00:05:30.990> should<00:05:31.290> reimburse<00:05:31.560> for<00:05:32.010> that<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.250> NBA

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
NBA should reimburse for that the NBA

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.820 
NBA should reimburse for that the NBA
would<00:05:32.760> would<00:05:33.060> look<00:05:33.210> at<00:05:33.330> that<00:05:33.540> with<00:05:34.320> disgust

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
would would look at that with disgust

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.159 
would would look at that with disgust
and<00:05:35.130> I<00:05:35.610> think<00:05:35.850> it<00:05:35.940> would<00:05:36.090> be<00:05:36.240> hard<00:05:36.510> for<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.870> NBA

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
and I think it would be hard for the NBA

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.780 
and I think it would be hard for the NBA
to<00:05:37.290> take<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.650> moral<00:05:37.950> stand<00:05:38.010> to<00:05:38.340> throw<00:05:38.550> them<00:05:38.669> out

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
to take a moral stand to throw them out

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.969 
to take a moral stand to throw them out
for<00:05:39.419> racist<00:05:39.780> comments<00:05:40.200> and<00:05:40.350> then<00:05:40.410> yet<00:05:40.620> pay<00:05:40.830> him

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
for racist comments and then yet pay him

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.920 
for racist comments and then yet pay him
hundreds<00:05:41.310> of<00:05:41.400> millions<00:05:41.760> in<00:05:41.970> reimbursement

hundreds of millions in reimbursement

hundreds of millions in reimbursement
for<00:05:43.080> taxes<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.590> would<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:43.919> would<00:05:43.979> at<00:05:44.160> a<00:05:44.190> minimum

the court process but the NBA will treat

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.210 
the court process but the NBA will treat
