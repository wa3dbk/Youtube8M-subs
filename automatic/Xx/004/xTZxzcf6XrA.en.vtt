 so that's it our leg is ready 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.100
 so here I planned so small 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.520
 cake molds so silicone 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.170
 I will start by filling them out so 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.479
 it's a little more than half 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.710
 no more in the meantime I peeled 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.869
 obvious loved power 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.530
 I'm going to the cuts and so finally 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.960
 neighborhoods and dispose of them directly 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.790
 on my paw 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.710
 so why do I have more pears at 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.540
 last moment it's really for 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.540
 that they avoid to oxidize while farting 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.750
 here I put my oven to preheat to 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.549
 170 Â° and we will bake for about 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.549
 20 minutes still to watch 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.540
 so I tap one last time and there 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.850
 we left for cooking our little ones 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.980
 cakes then fled to check the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.290
 cooking we will insert a pic to 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.310
 the inside if it stands out is that 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.890
 it's cooked 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.350
 so here it's cooked then with this 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.190
 amount of going to be able to achieve twelve 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.670
 little cakes 1 I still have some dough and 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.320
 I'll have them just now 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.530
 pass to the tasting of which I 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.640
 shows the ready little cake is 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.050
