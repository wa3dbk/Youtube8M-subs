00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.309
 hi today i really show you one 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.799
 nice recipes though could go back in 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:16.390
 technical direction and we do it 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:19.000
 Broken and what to say 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.800
 I personally have to say I dare 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.930
 now only to the top league ran 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.560
 because i ate the partner in 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:30.010
 The series so completely soaked with oil 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.630
 and with white that did not taste that 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.649
 I just do it as if you had such a bottle 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.570
 and rain would 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.659
 still has no bitch the whole 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.159
 time not difficult in the stomach 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:40.899
 and now I thought problems 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.989
 man subsequently fought sweetheart within only 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:49.089
 to eat 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:52.269
 and yes I hope it will be neat and 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.809
 jamina just wants to look first 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:01:02.010
 take and so appeared 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.010
 we will remove the approaches here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.049
 drastic too generous because 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:15.450
 we want a lot following romaschina 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:20.109
 have and let us do it now 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.259
 The machine should be in as big as possible 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.060
 Pieces are cut and indeed caught 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:32.619
 I first learn about everything 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:36.840
 in 1 to 2 cm rings of the markets 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:40.350
 develop bigger with the orange rings 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.090
 and I'll be the big new one soon 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 in equally large pieces 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.149
 to cut 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.490
 so our berlin now have it all 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.550
 Cut large enough stems and 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.320
 The secret of aubergines is bin 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.310
 actually need an old boat 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.190
 Do not cheat so fast 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.880
 too tight so four full of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.660
 all fat and from the whole and that 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.920
 I cut that and pieces and 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.920
 that's all about the pan now 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.770
 Give and fry all nice first 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.590
 so now appeared fry a way 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.590
 Onion and the beat we are beautiful 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.920
 when berlin takes on color 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:49.090
 do you want me with everything or even 0 1 im 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:52.690
 tv we watch the leaves of brasilia 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.560
 and keep the stems more elaborate 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.560
 we'll be up soon 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:09.540
 the aubergines just background it 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:09.540
 we let sizzling golden brown 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:20.799
 would be down and swing the 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:24.099
 Eggplant so that no old 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.450
 I can pray black spots 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.450
 lines cut heinz small 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.629
 Now we beat a garlic clove 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.629
 decide 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.250
 that maybe we will come 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.129
 and horror has it through once 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.720
 As you can see , I have captured here now 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.970
 I played it out and drain it 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.420
 let and my olives and live now 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.880
 all as well as meaningful and now all that 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.680
 Follow life and have my goals already 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:30.979
 of course I will mine 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:30.979
 berlin of 2 tablespoons 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.139
 my mother is in the book 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:54.380
 and badly classifies the background 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.230
 higher boiling now beautiful everything at the 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.200
 tig was cooking nicely now and if we were 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.800
 let the process prevail ours 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.490
 tomatoes 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.320
 we take five tomatoes and the 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.560
 cut was big small remove here 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:15.070
 Of course, the stakes surround this 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.070
 everything unscheduled to our calculator 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.659
 so everything is cooking now and the 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:37.639
 cook our tomatoes 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:37.639
 parsley and cut off the 1 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:46.009
 Parsley and raise in ours 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.990
 Cabin and the remaining part 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.569
 then push aside 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.039
 right now there is cooperation with 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.839
 sprinkle as you have already seen here 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.089
 my cap and plate prepared 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:06:01.469
 and now comes that I think 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:06.419
 really a great idea and is 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:13.520
 although we now take care of a chapel 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:13.520
 nice scroll and that's it
