00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.280
 the world is full of cabals and 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.290
 superstitions and in the parabens for 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 unless I ask where are your 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.280
 faces for tomorrow will lose match 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.350
 with some goat there is something that you 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840
 have made a match for the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.090
 triumph of the 'red' that has 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.740
 something happened every game that I 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.740
 I'm asleep in the second half 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:41.329
 and the national with the criterion of 25 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.329
 seconds 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.590
 I'm not the only person that you think 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.930
 has a criminal and if we look to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.979
 put it as typical 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.979
 [Music] 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.789
 I hear many times how we're doing 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.789
 losing there 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 as well 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.210
 the truth is that I do not have either could 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.450
 cover me because I like many horror 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.250
 light spots see all the leak but 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.369
 firm of cabals of some players 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.259
 for example good of these players in 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.700

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.259

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.570

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.490

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.520
 where the whole cove matías fernández 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.439
 it's already when he hits goal in not changing that 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.409
 is this shoe this shoe so 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.190

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.190

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.900
