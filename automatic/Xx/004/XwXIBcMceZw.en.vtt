00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
good is there and so but it kind of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
good is there and so but it kind of
loosens<00:02:00.360> things<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.900> little<00:02:00.990> bit<00:02:01.140> makes<00:02:01.440> you

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
loosens things up a little bit makes you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.240 
loosens things up a little bit makes you
a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.620> more<00:02:01.770> relaxed<00:02:02.250> yeah<00:02:02.670> yeah<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:04.250> well

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
a little more relaxed yeah yeah the well

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.830 
a little more relaxed yeah yeah the well
I<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.240> those<00:02:06.420> are<00:02:06.540> all<00:02:06.660> good

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
I think the so those are all good

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.070 
I think the so those are all good
strategies<00:02:08.030> but<00:02:09.030> ultimately<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.840> way<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
strategies but ultimately the one way to

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.830 
strategies but ultimately the one way to
get<00:02:10.320> through<00:02:10.530> writer's<00:02:10.890> block<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:12.450> just

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
get through writer's block is to just

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.880 
get through writer's block is to just
write<00:02:13.800> something<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:15.410> mean<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> reason<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
write something I mean the reason you
