probably do 28 rows for large you could

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.920 
probably do 28 rows for large you could
probably<00:01:28.460> do<00:01:29.000> three<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.750> four<00:01:30.619> extra-large<00:01:31.930> 36

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
probably do three to four extra-large 36

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.139 
probably do three to four extra-large 36
but<00:01:33.710> you'll<00:01:33.920> know<00:01:34.160> after<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.759> have<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:34.970> done

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
but you'll know after you have it done

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.690 
but you'll know after you have it done
how<00:01:35.330> many<00:01:35.390> rows<00:01:35.869> you<00:01:36.110> need<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.560> then<00:01:37.369> I<00:01:37.399> just

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
how many rows you need and then I just

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.310 
how many rows you need and then I just
placed<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.149> down<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:38.750> brought<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.140> two

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
placed it down and I brought the two

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.590 
placed it down and I brought the two
corners<00:01:39.830> together<00:01:40.100> like<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.240> form<00:01:41.420> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
corners together like this to form the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.859 
corners together like this to form the
sleeves<00:01:41.929> so<00:01:42.670> that's<00:01:43.670> how<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.119> went<00:01:44.360> like<00:01:44.600> that

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
sleeves so that's how it went like that

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.109 
sleeves so that's how it went like that
and<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:46.070> join<00:01:46.310> my<00:01:46.550> sleeves

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
and to join my sleeves

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.230 
and to join my sleeves
I<00:01:47.210> made<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.450> chain<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:47.990> 60<00:01:48.619> stitches<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.820> then<00:01:50.149> I

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
I made a chain of 60 stitches and then I

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.529 
I made a chain of 60 stitches and then I
just<00:01:50.450> passed<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:50.929> through<00:01:52.030> like<00:01:53.030> that<00:01:53.240> and

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
just passed it through like that and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.340 
just passed it through like that and
tied<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.380> in<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.619> bow<00:01:58.390> like<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.899> that<00:02:00.050> form

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
tied it in a bow like that and that form

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.320 
tied it in a bow like that and that form
the<00:02:00.560> sleeves<00:02:00.860> you're<00:02:01.369> working<00:02:01.880> your<00:02:02.060> rows

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
the sleeves you're working your rows

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.180 
the sleeves you're working your rows
it's<00:02:02.750> best<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.140> count<00:02:03.470> your<00:02:03.649> stitches<00:02:03.830> each

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
it's best to count your stitches each

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.969 
it's best to count your stitches each
row<00:02:04.550> because<00:02:05.360> if<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:05.660> don't<00:02:05.929> it's<00:02:06.259> very<00:02:06.739> easy

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
row because if you don't it's very easy

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.309 
row because if you don't it's very easy
to<00:02:07.429> miss<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.670> stitch<00:02:08.060> at<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.360> end<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.170> row

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
to miss a stitch at the end of the row

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.660 
to miss a stitch at the end of the row
so<00:02:10.280> that's<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.640> that's<00:02:11.090> how<00:02:11.630> easy<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.670> to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
so that's it that's how easy it is to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.540 
so that's it that's how easy it is to
make<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.380> fishnet<00:02:15.380> shrug<00:02:15.950> for<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.340> summer

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
make this fishnet shrug for the summer

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.240 
make this fishnet shrug for the summer
and<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.450> can<00:02:17.569> also<00:02:17.720> use<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.319> same<00:02:18.560> rectangle

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
and you can also use the same rectangle
