00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
can get it out of the way and even drive

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.170 
can get it out of the way and even drive
it<00:00:48.020> to<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> safe<00:00:49.350> spot<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.309> you're<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.700> stuck<00:00:51.000> on

right<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:58.370> that's<00:00:59.370> C<00:00:59.699> 220<00:01:00.079> right<00:01:01.079> here

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
right here now that's C 220 right here

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.779 
right here now that's C 220 right here
some<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> them<00:01:02.070> look<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.460> bit

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
some of them look a little bit

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.560 
some of them look a little bit
differently<00:01:03.300> depends<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> dream<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.470> got

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570

we're<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.960> demonstrate<00:01:07.140> how<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:08.040> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
we're going to demonstrate how to do it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.890 
we're going to demonstrate how to do it
but<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.460> hard<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.420> we're<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
but it's hard to see so we're going to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.310 
but it's hard to see so we're going to
take<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.380> apart<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:11.100> case<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.580> cannot

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
take it apart in case you cannot

understand<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> getting<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.549> our<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.180> had

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
understand it getting in our way we had

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
understand it getting in our way we had
to<00:01:15.450> take<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> apart<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.200> actually<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to take it apart to actually do it so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.789 
to take it apart to actually do it so
you<00:01:17.970> open<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> cup<00:01:18.720> folder<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.290> right<00:01:19.500> here

okay as you can see we don't even have
the<00:01:41.340> key<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.200> cannot<00:01:43.500> move<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> at

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the key in you see you cannot move it at

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.340 
the key in you see you cannot move it at
all<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.000> when<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.390> stuck<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.869> stuck<00:01:45.960> like

button is right there okay we push it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.289 
button is right there okay we push it
now<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.689> even<00:01:51.899> shift<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.090> can

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
now and you can even shift it so you can

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
now and you can even shift it so you can
get<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.079> way<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> safe

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
get out of the way and get it to a safe

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.959 
get out of the way and get it to a safe
spot<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.570> need<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.040> cannot<00:01:59.490> reach

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
spot if you need to if you cannot reach

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.649 
spot if you need to if you cannot reach
it<00:02:00.060> there<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> another<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:02.659> plastic

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it there is another way for plastic

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.600 
it there is another way for plastic
think<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.320> broken<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.280> plain

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
think it is broken but you just plain
