00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
instead on getting a 100 gram bundle you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
instead on getting a 100 gram bundle you
will<00:00:50.370> receive<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:51.079> 50<00:00:52.079> gram<00:00:52.230> bundle<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.960> we

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
will receive a 50 gram bundle and we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.200 
will receive a 50 gram bundle and we
might<00:00:55.230> still<00:00:55.530> put<00:00:55.860> 3<00:00:56.219> bundles<00:00:56.670> there<00:00:56.879> because

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
might still put 3 bundles there because

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
might still put 3 bundles there because
we<00:00:57.329> might<00:00:57.480> still<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.899> giving<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> 3<00:00:58.649> bundles

but it's like you can't expect to just
pick<00:02:15.610> $50<00:02:16.260> $60<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> full<00:02:18.340> head<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.579> hair
