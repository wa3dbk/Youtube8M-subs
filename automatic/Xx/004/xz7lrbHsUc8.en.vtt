00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
that I'm using on in the line and I use

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.020 
that I'm using on in the line and I use
those<00:00:57.710> colors<00:00:57.920> throughout<00:00:58.370> all<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.880> these

the Jeff Gordon graphics that I had done
few<00:01:11.800> years<00:01:12.010> back<00:01:12.220> but<00:01:12.730> what<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.120> wanted<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.540> do

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
few years back but what I wanted to do

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.320 
few years back but what I wanted to do
was<00:01:14.530> add<00:01:14.800> that<00:01:14.980> to<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.310> car<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:16.000> then<00:01:16.150> with

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
was add that to this car and then with

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.450 
was add that to this car and then with
the<00:01:16.420> jug<00:01:16.690> you<00:01:17.620> can<00:01:17.740> actually<00:01:17.920> see<00:01:18.250> where<00:01:18.430> I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
the jug you can actually see where I

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.520 
the jug you can actually see where I
extended<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.060> bed<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.840> I<00:01:19.990> wanted<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.260> make<00:01:20.410> it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
extended the bed and I wanted to make it

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.950 
extended the bed and I wanted to make it
so<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.770> could<00:01:20.920> be<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.190> car<00:01:21.400> all<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:22.810> is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
so it could be the car all which is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.149 
so it could be the car all which is
really<00:01:22.990> fun

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.800

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
what I did here is I actually on a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.980 
what I did here is I actually on a
computer<00:02:20.470> cut<00:02:21.130> out<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:22.060> some<00:02:22.270> swirls<00:02:22.750> the

where<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> red<00:02:34.690> was<00:02:34.870> gonna<00:02:35.020> go<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.190> had

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
where the red was gonna go and I had

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.370 
where the red was gonna go and I had
just<00:02:36.550> done<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> quick<00:02:37.060> little<00:02:37.390> blue<00:02:37.540> sketchy<00:02:37.900> I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
just done a quick little blue sketchy I

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.080 
just done a quick little blue sketchy I
didn't<00:02:39.040> know<00:02:39.100> what<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.280> wanted<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:39.790> with<00:02:39.940> it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
didn't know what I wanted to do with it

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.660 
didn't know what I wanted to do with it
it's<00:02:41.050> just<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.350> plain<00:02:41.590> box<00:02:41.800> let<00:02:42.130> me<00:02:42.220> go<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.460> white

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
it's just a plain box let me go it white

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.900 
it's just a plain box let me go it white
and<00:02:42.880> then<00:02:43.000> I'll<00:02:43.090> get<00:02:43.270> an<00:02:43.360> inspiration

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.020 

I<00:02:48.000> wanted<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.570> keep<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.930> almost<00:02:49.170> sinister<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.640> I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
I wanted to keep it almost sinister so I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.990 
I wanted to keep it almost sinister so I
to<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.480> black<00:02:52.080> good<00:02:52.319> but<00:02:53.190> when<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.670> looked<00:02:53.880> at

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
to do a black good but when I looked at

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.800 
to do a black good but when I looked at
I<00:02:54.060> thought

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
I thought

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.960 
I thought
bring<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.020> black<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.640> wanted<00:02:56.849> to

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
bring the black in here but I wanted to

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.150 
bring the black in here but I wanted to
do<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> black<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.750> bottom<00:02:58.050> also<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> get

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
do the black on the bottom also so I get

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.270 
do the black on the bottom also so I get
a<00:02:59.190> real<00:02:59.489> dark<00:02:59.940> charcoal<00:03:00.450> blend<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.010> brings

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
a real dark charcoal blend so it brings

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.979 
a real dark charcoal blend so it brings
that<00:03:02.430> same<00:03:02.700> black<00:03:02.970> back<00:03:03.239> into<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.599> body<00:03:03.750> as

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
that same black back into the body as

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.140 
that same black back into the body as
well

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.089 

that<00:03:08.510> was<00:03:08.720> probably<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.140> most<00:03:09.230> fun<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.680> all<00:03:09.920> of

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
that was probably the most fun of all of

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.899 
that was probably the most fun of all of
them<00:03:10.840> was<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.930> airbrushing<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.829> fire<00:03:13.099> and

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.789 
them was the airbrushing the to fire and
what<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.239> did<00:03:14.450> here<00:03:14.659> is<00:03:14.689> I<00:03:14.900> used<00:03:15.140> white<00:03:15.439> in<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
what I did here is I used white in the

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.100 
what I did here is I used white in the
airbrush<00:03:16.159> and<00:03:16.939> I<00:03:17.030> did<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.329> first<00:03:17.569> layer<00:03:17.870> which

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110

is<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.409> darkest<00:03:18.829> that<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.159> see<00:03:19.360> lighter<00:03:20.360> is

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
is the darkest that you see lighter is

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.289 
is the darkest that you see lighter is
the<00:03:20.870> last<00:03:21.110> layers<00:03:21.439> that<00:03:22.250> we<00:03:22.340> put<00:03:22.549> on<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.180> then

underneath the source right this is a
dark<00:04:24.480> blue<00:04:24.660> but<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.960> actually<00:04:25.110> blends<00:04:25.530> down<00:04:25.770> to

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
dark blue but it actually blends down to

to add with the silver marker the chrome

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:58.549 
to add with the silver marker the chrome
around<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.539> detail<00:04:57.899> you<00:04:58.139> know<00:04:58.199> around<00:04:58.469> the

00:04:58.549 --> 00:04:58.559 
around the detail you know around the

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:01.309 
around the detail you know around the
windows<00:04:58.889> in<00:04:59.489> the<00:04:59.610> back<00:04:59.759> which<00:05:00.239> to<00:05:01.169> me<00:05:01.289> just

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
windows in the back which to me just

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.559 
windows in the back which to me just
kind<00:05:01.649> of<00:05:01.709> finishes<00:05:02.099> it<00:05:02.219> up<00:05:02.339> most<00:05:03.179> fun<00:05:03.419> is

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
kind of finishes it up most fun is

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.300 
kind of finishes it up most fun is
getting<00:05:04.379> small

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
getting small

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.130 
getting small
imagining<00:05:07.270> what<00:05:07.480> we<00:05:07.600> can<00:05:07.780> do<00:05:07.870> with<00:05:08.020> each

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
imagining what we can do with each

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.930 
imagining what we can do with each
vehicle<00:05:08.410> because<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.340> know<00:05:09.400> we<00:05:09.520> pick<00:05:09.700> one

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
vehicle because you know we pick one

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.210 
vehicle because you know we pick one
basket<00:05:10.480> but<00:05:10.720> we<00:05:11.230> could<00:05:11.380> be<00:05:11.500> endless<00:05:11.830> on<00:05:12.070> that

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
basket but we could be endless on that

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.100 
basket but we could be endless on that
we<00:05:12.340> could<00:05:12.460> do<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:12.700> that's<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.600> greatest<00:05:13.840> part

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
we could do it that's the greatest part

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.230 
we could do it that's the greatest part
because<00:05:14.650> they<00:05:14.800> forget<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.280> use<00:05:15.400> your

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
because they forget to use your

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.500 
because they forget to use your
build<00:05:17.229> something
