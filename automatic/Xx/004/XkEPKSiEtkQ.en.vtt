only that but look at when the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.560 
only that but look at when the
PlayStation<00:02:18.680> 3<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.190> xbox<00:02:19.610> 360<00:02:20.060> came<00:02:20.360> out

PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360 came out

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.680 
PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360 came out
like<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.200> like<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:22.000> 512<00:02:23.000> megabyte

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
like it like a 512 megabyte

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.780 
like it like a 512 megabyte
like<00:02:23.780> flash<00:02:24.020> drive<00:02:24.350> was<00:02:24.560> expensive<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.730> you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
like flash drive was expensive so you

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.430 
like flash drive was expensive so you
got<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.390> keep<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.570> in<00:02:26.750> mind<00:02:26.990> when<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> flash

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
got to keep that in mind when the flash

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.840 
got to keep that in mind when the flash
drive<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.890> cartridge<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.640> the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
drive and the cartridge and the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.780 
drive and the cartridge and the
cartridge-based<00:02:29.300> because<00:02:30.290> CDs<00:02:30.740> are<00:02:30.950> like<00:02:31.070> 60

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
cartridge-based because CDs are like 60

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.370 
cartridge-based because CDs are like 60
cents<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.360> manufacture<00:02:32.960> so<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.230> course

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
cents to manufacture so of course

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.360 
cents to manufacture so of course
they're<00:02:33.530> going<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.770> go<00:02:33.860> with<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.040> cheaper

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
they're going to go with the cheaper

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.320 
they're going to go with the cheaper
item<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.020> don't<00:02:36.260> think<00:02:36.440> it'll<00:02:36.650> ever<00:02:36.770> happen

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
item but I don't think it'll ever happen

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.190 
item but I don't think it'll ever happen
because<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:40.730> know<00:02:40.820> game<00:02:41.120> sharing<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.840> pretty

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
because you know game sharing is pretty

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.680 
because you know game sharing is pretty
relevant<00:02:42.500> pretty<00:02:43.270> relevant<00:02:44.270> on<00:02:44.570> the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
relevant pretty relevant on the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.120 
relevant pretty relevant on the
PlayStation<00:02:45.230> Network<00:02:45.260> not<00:02:45.710> so<00:02:45.830> much<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.070> the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
PlayStation Network not so much of the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.950 
PlayStation Network not so much of the
Live<00:02:46.280> Marketplace<00:02:46.550> on<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.330> xbox<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:49.960> I

Live Marketplace on the xbox and I I

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.530 
Live Marketplace on the xbox and I I
think<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.740> would<00:02:51.860> be<00:02:51.980> unfair<00:02:52.490> for<00:02:52.820> consumer

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
think it would be unfair for consumer

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.240 
think it would be unfair for consumer
consumers<00:02:54.170> as<00:02:54.320> well<00:02:54.350> like<00:02:54.680> Steam<00:02:54.980> does<00:02:55.220> a

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
consumers as well like Steam does a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.250 
consumers as well like Steam does a
pretty<00:02:55.460> good<00:02:55.580> job<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:56.180> just<00:02:56.570> doing<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.930> in<00:02:56.990> US

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
pretty good job of just doing it in US

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.770 
pretty good job of just doing it in US
dollars<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.950> if<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.460> have<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.360> know<00:02:59.450> if<00:02:59.630> your

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
dollars and if you have you know if your

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.850 
dollars and if you have you know if your
currency<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.530> Frank<00:03:01.280> or<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:02.630> euro<00:03:03.050> well

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
currency is the Frank or the euro well

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.680 
currency is the Frank or the euro well
they<00:03:03.920> didn't<00:03:04.730> do<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.970> Frank<00:03:05.150> any<00:03:05.420> more<00:03:05.570> would

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
they didn't do the Frank any more would

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
they didn't do the Frank any more would
they<00:03:05.810> because<00:03:05.960> that<00:03:06.050> would<00:03:06.140> be<00:03:06.200> overtaken<00:03:06.680> by

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
they because that would be overtaken by

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.130 
they because that would be overtaken by
the<00:03:06.830> euro<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:08.630> pound<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.650> dollar<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:11.140> ship

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
the euro the pound the dollar the ship

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.760 
the euro the pound the dollar the ship
the<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:13.160> peso<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:14.630> know<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.960> still<00:03:15.230> goes<00:03:15.500> and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
the the peso you know it still goes and

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.530 
the the peso you know it still goes and
translates<00:03:16.310> into<00:03:16.490> u.s.<00:03:16.820> dollars<00:03:17.180> which<00:03:17.360> is

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
translates into u.s. dollars which is

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.120 
translates into u.s. dollars which is
good<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:17.990> then<00:03:18.380> everyone<00:03:18.710> is<00:03:18.920> on<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
good because then everyone is on the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.180 
good because then everyone is on the
equal<00:03:19.430> playing<00:03:19.670> ground<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.210> now<00:03:20.390> we<00:03:20.450> see

we would on steam on origin we have to

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.380 
we would on steam on origin we have to
pay<00:03:36.709> about<00:03:36.890> 80<00:03:37.160> australian<00:03:37.940> dollars<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.300> at

pay about 80 australian dollars in at

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.729 
pay about 80 australian dollars in at
the<00:03:38.480> moment<00:03:38.630> obviously<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.260> australian

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
the moment obviously the australian

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.440 
the moment obviously the australian
dollar<00:03:39.920> is<00:03:40.130> worth<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.640> lot<00:03:40.820> more<00:03:40.850> well<00:03:41.300> not<00:03:41.420> a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
dollar is worth a lot more well not a

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.970 
dollar is worth a lot more well not a
lot<00:03:41.510> more<00:03:41.780> but<00:03:41.959> worth<00:03:42.200> more<00:03:42.470> than<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.709> US

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
lot more but worth more than the US

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.180 
lot more but worth more than the US
dollar<00:03:43.810> which<00:03:44.810> sucks<00:03:45.140> so<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.590> think<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:45.980> there

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.250 
but i'm saying you know if they were to
do<00:05:47.060> that<00:05:47.090> then<00:05:47.420> it<00:05:47.510> would<00:05:47.600> definitely<00:05:47.780> limit

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260

apple<00:06:58.770> and<00:06:59.010> but<00:07:00.000> they<00:07:00.120> would<00:07:00.270> be<00:07:00.390> making

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
apple and but they would be making

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.230 
apple and but they would be making
trillions<00:07:01.110> of<00:07:01.380> dollars<00:07:01.530> of<00:07:01.770> overpriced<00:07:02.640> crap

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
trillions of dollars of overpriced crap

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.090 
trillions of dollars of overpriced crap
anyway<00:07:03.750> so<00:07:03.810> it's<00:07:04.200> not<00:07:04.350> like<00:07:04.560> it<00:07:04.740> matters<00:07:04.770> to

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
anyway so it's not like it matters to

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.610 
anyway so it's not like it matters to
them<00:07:05.630> so<00:07:06.630> that's<00:07:06.810> my<00:07:06.900> thoughts<00:07:07.200> is<00:07:07.410> a<00:07:07.440> very

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
them so that's my thoughts is a very

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.830 
them so that's my thoughts is a very
good<00:07:07.680> question<00:07:07.850> but<00:07:08.850> in<00:07:08.970> short<00:07:09.210> I<00:07:09.420> don't<00:07:09.630> think

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
good question but in short I don't think

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.420 
good question but in short I don't think
you<00:07:09.930> will<00:07:10.020> ever<00:07:10.110> see<00:07:10.400> download<00:07:11.400> only<00:07:12.200> on

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
majority console such as the playstation

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.450 
majority console such as the playstation
or<00:07:15.930> the<00:07:16.020> xbox<00:07:16.410> on<00:07:16.590> live<00:07:16.830> is<00:07:17.070> a<00:07:17.100> little<00:07:17.340> bit

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
or the xbox on live is a little bit

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.690 
or the xbox on live is a little bit
different<00:07:18.050> I<00:07:19.050> mean<00:07:19.410> it<00:07:19.530> would<00:07:19.680> definitely<00:07:19.860> you

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
different I mean it would definitely you

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.700 
different I mean it would definitely you
probably<00:07:21.210> were<00:07:21.510> you<00:07:21.660> seeing<00:07:21.900> it<00:07:22.080> now<00:07:22.110> you<00:07:22.290> have

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
probably were you seeing it now you have

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.580 
probably were you seeing it now you have
both<00:07:23.450> steam<00:07:24.450> is<00:07:24.630> a<00:07:24.660> great<00:07:24.870> example<00:07:25.020> of<00:07:25.320> that<00:07:25.380> if

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
both steam is a great example of that if

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.840 
both steam is a great example of that if
you<00:07:25.680> don't<00:07:25.860> want<00:07:26.100> to<00:07:26.160> get<00:07:26.280> it<00:07:26.370> on<00:07:26.430> Steam<00:07:26.700> you

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:26.850 
you don't want to get it on Steam you

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.880 
you don't want to get it on Steam you
can<00:07:26.970> go<00:07:27.120> to<00:07:27.180> gamestop<00:07:27.690> or<00:07:28.140> whatever<00:07:28.500> and<00:07:28.710> buy

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:28.890 
can go to gamestop or whatever and buy

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:35.030 
can go to gamestop or whatever and buy
it<00:07:29.090> copy<00:07:30.090> in<00:07:30.360> a<00:07:30.480> in<00:07:30.750> a<00:07:30.840> box<00:07:31.140> and<00:07:31.640> I<00:07:32.660> think<00:07:34.040> the

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.040 
it copy in a in a box and I think the

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.800 
it copy in a in a box and I think the
xbox<00:07:35.430> and<00:07:35.520> playstation<00:07:35.670> don't<00:07:36.390> do<00:07:36.660> that

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810 
xbox and playstation don't do that

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.480 
xbox and playstation don't do that
already<00:07:37.050> but<00:07:37.320> they<00:07:37.440> have<00:07:37.590> a<00:07:37.620> delay<00:07:37.920> obviously

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490 
already but they have a delay obviously

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.940 
already but they have a delay obviously
so<00:07:39.390> that's<00:07:39.510> my<00:07:39.600> thoughts<00:07:39.810> on<00:07:39.930> that<00:07:39.960> so<00:07:40.860> what

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:40.950 
so that's my thoughts on that so what

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.530 
so that's my thoughts on that so what
are<00:07:41.010> your<00:07:41.130> thoughts<00:07:41.310> will<00:07:41.550> we<00:07:41.669> ever<00:07:41.850> see<00:07:42.210> the
