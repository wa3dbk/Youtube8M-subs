00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.110
 then this means that I photographed myself or the character 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.520
 of a normal person and I do not have the authorization model writing not 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.869
 I can publish these photos et 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.070
 there are exceptions to the situations they allow 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.880
 disco motard 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.710
 first of all 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.310
 dissimulate easily recognizable recognition to the person 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.939
 and a way in which we all know from experience 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.520
 daily 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.330
 seats re problem of the public utility image image that 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.100
 it means 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950
 means that 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.640
 since what cannot be published and those cool so it is 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.449
 recognizable with the face 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.670
 so recognizable 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.490
 that has shown itself to most people makes known a person that this would not be known 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.030
 means that 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.080
 I can post those fire photos instead 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.240
 whose shooting conditions are such that if I am not 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.889
 Mom I have this person's lover I don't recognize 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.250
 now let me see 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.090
 nunca's photo of the people I love 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.010
 I recognize it 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.680
 it is not so for a photograph made of an illustrious stranger who comes from 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.690
 be published and miss all the elements that serve the dal 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.219
 identification of the person 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.780
 try to think of the mask of the dachshunds and the masks 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.290
 carnival masks cover the eyes I fear recognizable for sale 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.120
 the pitch tact soft strips that you put on the faces once covered 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.500
 her eyes and with this she made her face unrecognizable the sure face 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.430
 people I already knew that person 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.909
 but not recognizable 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.660
 the face to those who did not know that person 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.830
 that the goal 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.200
 our goal 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.689
 approval is required when it is published 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.840
 recognizable of a person does not swim 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.590
 the particular 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.620
 and anatomical llll view ddddd back the face partially covered for example 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.170
 of nature's eye pizzas 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.470
 and I who am a part 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.439
 indispensable for the face recognition 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.990
 those are publishing situations 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.700
 that make the image recognizable to people I already recognize 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.480
 know 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.989
 but this is not why 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.079
 lll to the law 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.499
 and the recognizable 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.839
 not know the image who does not know me quarrel and what I have to 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.639
 to keep 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.109
 make sure that the publication does not make me known to others 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.209
 then 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.260
 dissimulation by the face is sufficient to make public of the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.389
 photography 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.300
 other let's call them exception other situations in which 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.030
 publications may also take place without the model release 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.429
 liberating and when the image the photograph of a 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.419
 event place occurred in public 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.209
 eye what it means 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.870
 if the photograph is a photograph of the place or the event 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.750
 even if there are people in that place that place I made myself. of 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.640
 work done done are recognizable 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.700
 none of them can be published because I'm not 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.000
 photographing their portrait 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.119
 but a public place a public event 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.159
 in these stations, an important weight of a demonstration in the piazza in piazza 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.259
 of the cathedral 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.609
 in each of these cases there are people in the middle of the picture 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.100
 man framing was that thing I was photographing 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.700
 well in this situation 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.960
 the publication of images with recognizable characters too 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.459
 ilicalibera illicit without authorization each 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:38.109
 it would not be so if the image were made in the same place then 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.680
 during a demonstration and in the public place but closing the frame 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.119
 on the character to the point that the portrait lalla the image I'm making not 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.409
 is 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.609
 the photograph of the place of the event 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.909
 elastography of the person and attention this thing can be worth not so much and not 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.309
 only if the image physically closes on the face 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.159
 conceptually the logical weight of the image is all based on 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.939
 person 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.659
 what is the first app the test of the nine windirstat the centimeters but of weight 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:08.280
 logical 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.930
 what is the litmus test imagine that photograph 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.270
 without the subject of these I love talking about whether to remove the image that subject 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.970
 it means killing the photograph that disappears into nothingness - a sense then 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.300
 that photo a portrait photo made maybe in public 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.870
 if instead photography is a photograph 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.460
 of the context of the situation in which the character who passes is the contingent 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.550
 but taken away nothing happens well that a photo of a public event where 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.510
 the character is incidental and can be removed
