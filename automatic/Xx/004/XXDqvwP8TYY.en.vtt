00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.249
 devoted to remote control 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.320
 to the short objective we will introduce you using different products that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.890
 allow takeovers from remote or winger often the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.970
 taste of all or by an affair yes j 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.580
 why remote control by several applications 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 very practical for example record for a remote control take that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.580
 I would call local 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.250
 in an environment of a few meters 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.780
 presented a slideshow for a presentation on their own behalf 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.880
 so use his pda or his pocket pc 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.600
 to take remote control 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.350
 from his pc from his laptop 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.920
 and so thanks to a friend a little bit smaller% and baky that's sure 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.140
 some left of the pd 1 goal I sometimes have so as to scroll through positive 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.960
 first type of remote control 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.130
 reduced environment no need for very high throughput 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.460
 so a reason for everything that is quite suitable 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.100
 you introduce a product called who wants to get 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 other kind of connection one can this time take remote control 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.430
 for them this time far away from a single china and europe 1 you 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.320
 are our determined commitment 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.770

 your smartphone 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.770
 and the plans are being processed on this one 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.790
 you are at home we wanted to consult 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.640
 a program that is at your home 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.160
 take remote control and so you can either this program 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.750
 other case of concrete application 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.270
 in the training course 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.840
 solvay has arrived is precisely as a trainer to actually dispense 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.640
 his training with him students 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.070
 checking my post 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.380
 who was the one connected to the eclectic course present this information 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.380
 on a on a tube screen 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.650
 projected video 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.160
 and so there the students were taking against the boss 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.790
 present their solutions but it can be 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.790
 of all audiences to take advantage of their solution proposals 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.260
 here are many tools in this second case of great cold remote 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.089
 I presented you Sunday second type of products 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.519
 the shop is very well known called bmc that allows for taking 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.540
 remote control 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.600
 which exists on pocket pc also on pc 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:21.229
 the conclusion of this product is not always still not 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:26.339
 per cent well configurable sometimes have to leave openings have flawless 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.219
 role in his counter by I only have I sign 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.230
 hand on a few is also a little slow the products we 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.309
 proposes are relatively fast whatever the version pocket pc 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.039
 here is the pc that the pc tablet pc pc laptop his peers 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.209
 first product so 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.829
 a product that will allow you to take remote control that I 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.289
 would qualify local loop 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:49.139
 a few meters 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.469
 white house viard 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.329
 this product its guiboles 5 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.950
 a percentage never falls 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.849
 the website reaches 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.849
 of this product 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.309
 here 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.059
 and you will be able a little better m 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:09.539
 see the year 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.139
 the decline reached especially for those who asked me some details 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.579
 unfortunately, it is not easy 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:16.979
 when iran 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.910
 in place of this product 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.500
 and these products will allow us to take remote control in e 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.079
 well to your pocket pc of your pc 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.670
 so when it works it works well several collection assets of 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.769
 wifi connections connections for all of us 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.159
 in connection mode adoption ie a local network but 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.119
 also what is very interesting although the 2010 edition 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.809
 so that means what does it mean that many have previously 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.699
 set 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.289
 pocket pc 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:50.469
 so as to be able on this one to establish a connection acti city comes 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.599
 at the end of all 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.939
 I active 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.829
 so what shows the premium of that of ipad 2 2003 appeared quite 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.829
 elisapie pocket pc or automobiles 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.879
 so there he all of you 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.809
 I throw 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.789
 glee manager 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.459
 I see here my active cemetery 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.300
 which is set 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.739
 I throw 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.739
 of the coalition 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.039
 here you have just heard the collection being made 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.430
 and here we see the economy estimated Monday that the elections were 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.360
 made 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.029
 so here is not between them 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:31.400
 to lower it 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.509
 that you see at the bottom of the screen 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.520
 the station like synchronize its doors to wilayas less certain number 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.589
 of information that says movie to see if ever for contacts are up to date and 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.659
 caetera 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.190
 the right think she 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.420
 eric establie 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.070
 now it only remains to launch the software that I previously 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.980
 loaded download from the page you indicate who are working 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.789
 I think products of the nation 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.669
 ap happily a little bit here 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.020
 a window on our different roads percent 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.479
 for the different 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.289
 the active collection he has not yet 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.020
 so if we voted pc 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.080
 I will now go to the software that I also did 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.029
 install 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:25.069
 for the insurers of which I know it needs neither with the package asked 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.069
 from the end of the webpage that I showed you talent 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.349
 so I am the product 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:32.439
 it is tactile 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:35.439
 is what you see on my spanking beauty screen 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.279
 that's what you want on my pc screen 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:39.779
 if I can say 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.779
 outside 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.509
 that's what I can do in the past 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.729
 activated 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:57.869
 here 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.869
 I will launch for example a slideshow 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.490
 here you have the slideshow 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.490
 and moreover double click on it 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.169
 in fact right click 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:23.189
 here you are the slide show these executions 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.349
 and I can not leave 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.339
 for my part I'm trying to see the screen 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.339
 well to scroll well positive 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.710
 in small batches 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.710
 I pass between equals 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.860
 so as we can see 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.909
 I can also directly to the goal it's always nice to hate 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.180
 without having to go 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.180
 by touch screen control 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.439
 we lemagit the winged 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:01.449
 that you are planning a precisely Monday night 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.449
 a correct presentation 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.050
 first stage 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.089
 so I close the product 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:16.490
 I disable 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.300
 my connection 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.300
 acti city 

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:25.089
 reuters 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:27.749
 so there we have 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:29.309
 to take products 

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:31.449
 so it allows the heart 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:34.669
 connect so that locally only a few meters away 

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:37.469
 after 

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:39.199
 pc seems to go down 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.180
 and therefore of being able to 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.529
 they can take control of the latter 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:47.969
 and for the user to progress% and manage the animation of a 

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:49.259
 presentation by a black painting
