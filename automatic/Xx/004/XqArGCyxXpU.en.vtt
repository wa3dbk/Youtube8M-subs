00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
now I know I made the mistake of using

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.430 
now I know I made the mistake of using
my<00:00:32.949> gems<00:00:33.280> at<00:00:33.489> these<00:00:33.699> stages<00:00:34.090> before<00:00:34.449> but<00:00:35.290> my

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
my gems at these stages before but my

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.290 
my gems at these stages before but my
recommendation<00:00:36.100> is<00:00:36.280> do<00:00:36.489> not<00:00:36.640> use<00:00:36.699> your<00:00:37.059> gems

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
recommendation is do not use your gems

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.330 
recommendation is do not use your gems
to<00:00:37.510> finish<00:00:37.780> troops<00:00:38.170> or<00:00:38.410> your<00:00:38.710> buildings<00:00:39.160> at

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
to finish troops or your buildings at

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.430 
to finish troops or your buildings at
this<00:00:39.790> point<00:00:40.090> in<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.300> game<00:00:40.480> because<00:00:41.080> it<00:00:41.260> is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
this point in the game because it is

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.070 
this point in the game because it is
entirely<00:00:41.980> optional<00:00:42.370> so<00:00:43.239> wait<00:00:43.449> until<00:00:43.629> your

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
entirely optional so wait until your

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.229 
entirely optional so wait until your
buildings<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.650> troops<00:00:44.860> actually<00:00:45.100> finish<00:00:45.760> so

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
buildings and troops actually finish so

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.210 
buildings and troops actually finish so
then<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.479> can<00:00:46.600> save<00:00:46.809> your<00:00:46.960> gems<00:00:47.229> now<00:00:47.920> in<00:00:48.070> terms

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220
