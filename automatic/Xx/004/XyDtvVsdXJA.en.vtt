00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
over there it was just he and I at that

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.890 
over there it was just he and I at that
time<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.099> so<00:02:47.489> we<00:02:47.610> did<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.209> turns<00:02:48.599> out

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
time and so we did that and it turns out

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.530 
time and so we did that and it turns out
that<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.470> was<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.040> greatest<00:02:50.540> sailing

experience I think so far or at least

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.539 
experience I think so far or at least
one<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.019> most<00:02:55.200> memorable<00:02:55.470> because<00:02:56.220> that's

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
one of the most memorable because that's

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.300 
one of the most memorable because that's
the<00:02:56.790> day<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:56.970> The<00:02:57.269> Maltese<00:02:57.690> Falcon<00:02:58.310> sailed
