00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
okay so this is another way to deal with

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay so this is another way to deal with

systems<00:00:05.480> optical<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.509> guess<00:00:07.080> ROS<00:00:07.350> makes<00:00:07.830> this

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
systems optical I guess ROS makes this

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.530 
systems optical I guess ROS makes this
but<00:00:08.309> you'll<00:00:08.490> see<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.820> under<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> few<00:00:09.300> different

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
but you'll see it under a few different

but you'll see it under a few different
brands<00:00:09.840> online<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.830> trick<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:12.059> gets<00:00:12.240> it

brands online the trick is it gets it
comes<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.990> spool<00:00:13.469> okay<00:00:14.599> some<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.870> can

comes in a spool okay some of this can

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.029 
comes in a spool okay some of this can
be<00:00:16.350> cut<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.890> some<00:00:17.690> not<00:00:18.690> okay<00:00:19.380> if<00:00:19.619> someone<00:00:19.949> they

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
be cut in some not okay if someone they

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.859 
be cut in some not okay if someone they
have<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:20.699> cutting<00:00:20.939> point<00:00:21.270> the

have like a little cutting point the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.540 
have like a little cutting point the
thing<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.680> really<00:00:22.920> want<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.430> if

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you can is just order the spool and the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.019 
you can is just order the spool and the
length<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.609> know<00:00:26.730> you're<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
length that you know you're going to

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.990

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
want to use in a lot of its a tubular

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.060 
want to use in a lot of its a tubular
type<00:00:30.420> thing<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> lights<00:00:31.260> only<00:00:31.470> face<00:00:31.800> one

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
type thing but the lights only face one

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.100 
type thing but the lights only face one
way<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.669> stick<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.180> it'll<00:00:33.420> twist<00:00:33.690> back

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
way and we stick it up it'll twist back

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020 
way and we stick it up it'll twist back
and<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.559> kind<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> tricky<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> deal<00:00:35.820> with

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and it's kind of tricky to deal with

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.600 
and it's kind of tricky to deal with
this<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.739> need<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.399> kind<00:00:38.579> of

video the thing is those lights are
about<00:01:17.369> 20<00:01:17.759> bucks<00:01:17.909> each<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.110> only<00:01:19.439> gives

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
about 20 bucks each and it only gives

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.670 
about 20 bucks each and it only gives
you<00:01:19.860> about<00:01:20.130> three<00:01:20.549> feet<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.970> light<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:22.560> I'm

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you about three feet of light and I'm

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.899 
you about three feet of light and I'm
going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> say<00:01:22.979> about<00:01:23.220> three<00:01:23.520> feet<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.790> weight

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
going to say about three feet of weight
light<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.840> looked<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.320> metric

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
light because it looked like a metric

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
light because it looked like a metric
thing<00:01:25.979> where<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.280> was<00:01:26.369> under<00:01:26.700> three<00:01:26.909> feet<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
thing where it was under three feet so

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.230 
thing where it was under three feet so
the<00:01:30.439> here<00:01:31.439> we've<00:01:31.829> got<00:01:31.979> 16<00:01:32.460> feet<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> light<00:01:32.970> I

the here we've got 16 feet of light I
don't<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.590> bright<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.220> which

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
don't think it's as bright I don't which

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.069 
don't think it's as bright I don't which
is<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> density<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.240> far<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.659> can't<00:01:36.900> close

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
is a density as far as I can't close

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.950 
is a density as far as I can't close
together<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:38.310> these<00:01:38.729> things<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.630> what

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
together these these things are but what

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.999 
together these these things are but what
I'm<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.829> start

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
I'm going to do is I'm going to start

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
I'm going to do is I'm going to start
adding<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.460> bunch<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.759> these<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.210> trailer<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
adding a bunch of these in a trailer and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
adding a bunch of these in a trailer and
just<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.680> how<00:01:43.710> many<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.220> takes<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.909> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
just see how many it takes to get that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330 
just see how many it takes to get that
thing<00:01:45.329> lit<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.930> inside<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:47.040> other

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
thing lit up on the inside the other

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.719 
thing lit up on the inside the other
thing<00:01:47.759> that's<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.000> cool<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:49.729> although

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
thing that's really cool is although

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
thing that's really cool is although
it's<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.840> more<00:01:52.079> into

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it's going to be a little bit more into

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.310 
it's going to be a little bit more into
the<00:01:52.530> decorative<00:01:53.040> lighting<00:01:53.720> situation<00:01:54.720> is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the decorative lighting situation is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.429 
the decorative lighting situation is
this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.829> fully<00:01:56.070> waterproof<00:01:56.520> okay<00:01:57.119> totally

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
this is fully waterproof okay totally

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.200 
this is fully waterproof okay totally
but<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.950> could<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> good

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
but you you could if you get a good

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.560 
but you you could if you get a good
clean<00:02:00.750> surface<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> outside<00:02:01.939> is<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.420> can

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
clean surface on the outside is you can

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.679 
clean surface on the outside is you can
attach<00:02:03.869> these<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.290> an<00:02:04.380> outside<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.689> think

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
attach these to an outside but I think

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.570 
attach these to an outside but I think
that's<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.469> little<00:02:07.740> bit<00:02:07.860> more<00:02:08.190> in

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
that's going to be a little bit more in

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.490 
that's going to be a little bit more in
the<00:02:08.729> sign<00:02:09.000> making<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.720> decorative<00:02:10.259> lighting

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the sign making and decorative lighting

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.380 
the sign making and decorative lighting
I<00:02:10.830> don't<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.190> don't<00:02:11.310> think<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.730> our<00:02:11.910> marker

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
I don't I don't think it's our marker

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
I don't I don't think it's our marker
lighting

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
lighting

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.650 
lighting
think<00:02:13.730> illuminating<00:02:14.730> an<00:02:14.820> area<00:02:15.180> with<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
think illuminating an area with this is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.710 
think illuminating an area with this is
going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.960> quite<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.440> easy<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.670> I'm<00:02:18.540> going

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
going to be quite as easy but I'm going

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.540 
going to be quite as easy but I'm going
to<00:02:18.780> do<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> little<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.380> experimenting<00:02:19.950> on

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
to do a little bit of experimenting on

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.400 
to do a little bit of experimenting on
putting<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.690> underside<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.170> an

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
putting this on the underside of an

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.490 
putting this on the underside of an
awning<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> little<00:02:25.110> bit<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.410> an

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
awning so this is a little bit of an

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500 
awning so this is a little bit of an
expansion<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> electrical<00:02:26.790> system<00:02:26.850> here

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
expansion of the electrical system here

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.050 
expansion of the electrical system here
as<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.870> add<00:02:28.380> components<00:02:29.220> delete<00:02:29.520> components

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
as I add components delete components

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.790 
as I add components delete components
move<00:02:30.270> them<00:02:30.390> around

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
move them around

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.130 
move them around
yeah<00:02:32.730> I'm<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.210> setting<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.570> this<00:02:33.690> stuff<00:02:33.960> up

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
yeah I'm just setting all this stuff up

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.050 
yeah I'm just setting all this stuff up
in<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.350> same<00:02:34.620> location<00:02:35.220> it's<00:02:35.430> where<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> head

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
in the same location it's where a head

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.940 
in the same location it's where a head
of<00:02:36.210> wires<00:02:36.510> coming<00:02:36.930> through<00:02:37.170> from<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.530> outside

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
of wires coming through from the outside

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.330 
of wires coming through from the outside
for<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> panels<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:40.110> maybe<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:40.920> torn

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
for the panels and just maybe get torn

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.740 
for the panels and just maybe get torn
out<00:02:41.490> redone<00:02:41.910> again<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.210> don't<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.460> these

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
out redone again I don't know but these

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.110 
out redone again I don't know but these
LED<00:02:45.750> strip<00:02:46.230> lights<00:02:46.500> pretty<00:02:47.070> inexpensive<00:02:47.850> I

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
LED strip lights pretty inexpensive I

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.180 
LED strip lights pretty inexpensive I
got<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:48.450> Amazon<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.710> rubberized

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
got on Amazon it's it's a rubberized

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.340 
got on Amazon it's it's a rubberized
type<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.760> our<00:02:50.880> polymeric<00:02:51.690> type<00:02:52.040> stuff<00:02:53.040> here<00:02:53.430> so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
type of our polymeric type stuff here so

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.500 
type of our polymeric type stuff here so
in<00:02:55.350> testing<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.400> looks<00:02:56.640> like<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.970> rows<00:02:57.180> all

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
in testing it looks like the rows all

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.150 
in testing it looks like the rows all
pretty<00:02:57.750> good<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.230> kind<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.500> unspool<00:02:59.010> it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
pretty good you just kind of unspool it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.730 
pretty good you just kind of unspool it
and<00:02:59.310> use<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.270> sticky<00:03:00.630> stuff<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.290> hold<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.620> up

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
and use the sticky stuff to hold it up

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.190 
and use the sticky stuff to hold it up
onto<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.220> metal<00:03:02.700> or<00:03:03.060> painted<00:03:03.450> metal<00:03:03.660> seems<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
onto the metal or painted metal seems to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.430 
onto the metal or painted metal seems to
work<00:03:04.380> okay<00:03:04.770> had<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.520> little<00:03:06.330> bad<00:03:06.660> section<00:03:07.230> and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
work okay had a little bad section and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.110 
work okay had a little bad section and
it<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.680> seems<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.980> bypass<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.880> keep

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it just seems to bypass it and keep

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.440 
it just seems to bypass it and keep
going<00:03:09.480> no<00:03:09.690> problem<00:03:10.050> at<00:03:10.140> all<00:03:10.610> at<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.850> end<00:03:12.090> of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
going no problem at all at the end of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.720 
going no problem at all at the end of
the<00:03:12.570> row<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.140> couple<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.770> more<00:03:13.920> wires<00:03:14.220> here

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
the row is a couple of more wires here

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.630 
the row is a couple of more wires here
and<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:16.230> got<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.620> make<00:03:16.680> sure<00:03:16.860> these<00:03:17.010> don't<00:03:17.280> short

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
and I got to make sure these don't short

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.000 
and I got to make sure these don't short
out<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> metal<00:03:18.390> but<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:19.320> where<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.709> next

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
out on a metal but that's where the next

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.210 
out on a metal but that's where the next
row<00:03:20.190> will<00:03:20.490> get<00:03:20.670> attached<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.380> some<00:03:23.130> of

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
row will get attached in and some of

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.580 
row will get attached in and some of
this<00:03:23.310> glue<00:03:23.520> kind<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.000> wants<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.330> undo<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.410> I'm

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
this glue kind of wants to undo so I'm

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.400 
this glue kind of wants to undo so I'm
going<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:25.770> run<00:03:25.950> some<00:03:25.980> zip<00:03:26.459> ties<00:03:26.490> up<00:03:27.030> around<00:03:27.410> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
going to run some zip ties up around to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.260 
going to run some zip ties up around to
kind<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.709> wrap<00:03:28.920> around<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.580> in<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.790> few<00:03:30.000> spots

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
kind of wrap around that in a few spots

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.030 
kind of wrap around that in a few spots
again<00:03:30.840> kind<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.200> industrial<00:03:32.360> utilitarian<00:03:33.360> but

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
again kind of industrial utilitarian but

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.320 
again kind of industrial utilitarian but
it's<00:03:35.040> definitely<00:03:35.250> more<00:03:35.520> light<00:03:36.030> than

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
it's definitely more light than

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.040 
it's definitely more light than
decorative<00:03:37.400> yeah<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.670> definitely

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
decorative yeah it's definitely

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.180 
decorative yeah it's definitely
definitely<00:03:40.050> more<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.530> decorative<00:03:40.980> light<00:03:41.160> I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
definitely more the decorative light I

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.830 
definitely more the decorative light I
mean<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.520> as<00:03:41.640> useful<00:03:41.850> amount<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.420> light<00:03:42.570> here

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
mean it's as useful amount of light here

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.770 
mean it's as useful amount of light here
and<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:44.310> as<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.980> basically<00:03:46.980> continue<00:03:47.640> kind<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.690> a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
and so as I basically continue kind of a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.010 
and so as I basically continue kind of a
zig-zag<00:03:49.050> pattern<00:03:49.320> working<00:03:50.100> through<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:51.020> the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
zig-zag pattern working through the the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.530 
zig-zag pattern working through the the
roof<00:03:52.760> reinforcements<00:03:53.760> on<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> trailer<00:03:54.390> we'll

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
roof reinforcements on the trailer we'll

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.810 
roof reinforcements on the trailer we'll
get<00:03:54.660> into<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.989> darker<00:03:55.410> section<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:56.040> don't<00:03:56.730> I

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
get into the darker section I don't I

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.850 
get into the darker section I don't I
just<00:03:57.000> want<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.300> go<00:03:57.390> back<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.810> forth<00:03:58.050> across<00:03:58.320> is

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
just want to go back and forth across is

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.650 
just want to go back and forth across is
so<00:03:59.100> instead<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.700> having<00:03:59.910> a<00:04:00.090> single<00:04:00.120> dome

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
so instead of just having a single dome

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.090 
so instead of just having a single dome
light<00:04:00.870> in<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:00.989> middle<00:04:01.230> which<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.410> actually

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
light in the middle which is actually

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.840 
light in the middle which is actually
going<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.310> get<00:04:02.400> pulled<00:04:02.730> all<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.060> way<00:04:03.090> out<00:04:03.360> on

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
going to get pulled all the way out on

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.400 
going to get pulled all the way out on
we're<00:04:05.850> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.510> have<00:04:06.570> pretty<00:04:07.290> decent

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
we're going to have pretty decent

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.949 
we're going to have pretty decent
lighting<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.760> whole<00:04:08.970> ceiling<00:04:09.750> lights

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
lighting just the whole ceiling lights

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.250 
lighting just the whole ceiling lights
up<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.820> think<00:04:11.820> it'll<00:04:12.000> be<00:04:12.090> okay<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.690> think

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
up and I think it'll be okay I think

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.449 
up and I think it'll be okay I think
it's<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.650> think<00:04:13.770> it's<00:04:13.950> going<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.100> work<00:04:14.280> out

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
it's I think it's going to work out

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.920 
it's I think it's going to work out
pretty<00:04:14.610> good<00:04:15.560> it's<00:04:16.560> no<00:04:17.400> single<00:04:18.239> spot<00:04:18.600> is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
pretty good it's no single spot is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.539 
pretty good it's no single spot is
really<00:04:19.200> all<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.590> painful<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:20.130> look<00:04:20.340> at

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
really all that painful to look at

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.060 
really all that painful to look at
except<00:04:21.120> maybe<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.660> right<00:04:21.930> there<00:04:22.200> that's

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
except maybe that right there that's

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.040 
except maybe that right there that's
that<00:04:23.190> natural<00:04:23.789> lighting<00:04:24.000> versus<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.539> blue<00:04:24.780> LED

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
that natural lighting versus a blue LED

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.680 
that natural lighting versus a blue LED
you<00:04:25.800> can<00:04:25.830> kind<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.190> tell

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
you can kind of tell

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.219 
you can kind of tell
power<00:04:28.199> usage<00:04:28.889> is<00:04:29.780> actually<00:04:30.780> kind<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.080> high

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
power usage is actually kind of high

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.510 
power usage is actually kind of high
believe<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.340> or<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:33.020> we're<00:04:34.020> at<00:04:34.110> 1.9<00:04:34.860> amps

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
believe it or not the we're at 1.9 amps

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.900 
believe it or not the we're at 1.9 amps
with<00:04:35.880> both<00:04:36.750> lights<00:04:37.080> going<00:04:37.560> I'll<00:04:38.070> shut<00:04:38.639> this

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
with both lights going I'll shut this

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.360 
with both lights going I'll shut this
system<00:04:39.330> off<00:04:39.570> right<00:04:39.930> here<00:04:40.380> both<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:41.009> those<00:04:41.130> are

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
system off right here both of those are

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.710 
system off right here both of those are
off<00:04:41.600> all<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.810> gals<00:04:43.020> down<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.910> probably<00:04:45.539> go

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
off all the gals down to it probably go

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.629 
off all the gals down to it probably go
down<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.050> 1.6<00:04:46.710> yeah<00:04:46.919> there<00:04:47.220> we<00:04:47.280> go

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
down in 1.6 yeah there we go

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.900 
down in 1.6 yeah there we go
drops<00:04:48.539> down<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.810> 1.6<00:04:49.620> it's<00:04:50.039> being<00:04:50.340> drawn<00:04:50.580> it's

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
drops down to 1.6 it's being drawn it's

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.850 
drops down to 1.6 it's being drawn it's
one<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.509> great<00:04:51.720> parts<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.229> that<00:04:52.620> meter

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
one of the great parts of that meter

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.610 
one of the great parts of that meter
solar<00:04:53.220> thing<00:04:53.520> tells<00:04:53.759> you<00:04:53.850> what's<00:04:54.000> going<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.620> so

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
solar thing tells you what's going on so

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.490 
solar thing tells you what's going on so
what<00:04:56.250> happens<00:04:56.759> here<00:04:56.850> if<00:04:57.150> I'm<00:04:57.360> running<00:04:57.570> this<00:04:58.080> on

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
what happens here if I'm running this on

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.100 
what happens here if I'm running this on
both<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.789> then<00:05:00.720> we<00:05:00.900> shut<00:05:01.199> off<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.560> LED<00:05:03.110> this

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
both and then we shut off the LED this

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.930 
both and then we shut off the LED this
thing<00:05:04.350> actually<00:05:04.710> drops<00:05:04.979> down<00:05:05.190> almost<00:05:05.520> not<00:05:05.910> a

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
thing actually drops down almost not a

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.050 
thing actually drops down almost not a
measurable<00:05:06.389> amount<00:05:07.039> so<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.490> difference

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
measurable amount so the difference

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.060 
measurable amount so the difference
between<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:10.139> know<00:05:10.229> each<00:05:10.590> one<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.949> these

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
between the you know each one of these

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.810 
between the you know each one of these
is<00:05:11.340> probably<00:05:11.490> only<00:05:11.729> equal<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.270> maybe<00:05:13.139> a<00:05:13.820> foot

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
is probably only equal to maybe a foot

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.820 
is probably only equal to maybe a foot
or<00:05:15.060> foot<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.389> a<00:05:15.419> half<00:05:15.570> of<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.050> strip<00:05:16.560> light

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
or foot and a half of the strip light

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.670 
or foot and a half of the strip light
but<00:05:17.610> that's<00:05:17.760> 16<00:05:18.270> feet<00:05:18.599> of<00:05:18.810> strip<00:05:19.080> light<00:05:19.320> so

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
but that's 16 feet of strip light so

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.420 
but that's 16 feet of strip light so
it's<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.160> lot<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:21.560> but<00:05:22.560> that's<00:05:22.740> not<00:05:22.949> bad<00:05:23.160> you

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
it's a lot and but that's not bad you

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.510 
it's a lot and but that's not bad you
know<00:05:23.789> it's<00:05:24.570> not<00:05:24.750> bad<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:25.889> think<00:05:26.130> I'm<00:05:26.370> going

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
know it's not bad so I think I'm going

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.120 
know it's not bad so I think I'm going
to<00:05:26.610> buy<00:05:26.729> some<00:05:27.000> more<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.360> stuff<00:05:27.660> and

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
to buy some more of this stuff and

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.830 
to buy some more of this stuff and
zigzag<00:05:29.130> it<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.460> roughly<00:05:29.789> here<00:05:30.150> be<00:05:30.479> able<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.720> get

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
zigzag it to roughly here be able to get

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.450 
zigzag it to roughly here be able to get
usable<00:05:31.199> light<00:05:31.500> in<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.740> back<00:05:31.919> side<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.250> the

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
usable light in the back side of the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.719 
usable light in the back side of the
trailer<00:05:32.910> and<00:05:34.130> hopefully<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.460> know<00:05:35.550> we're

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
trailer and hopefully you know we're

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.310 
trailer and hopefully you know we're
going<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:35.880> be<00:05:35.970> mobile<00:05:36.419> ready<00:05:36.690> do<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:36.990> bunch<00:05:37.229> of

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
going to be mobile ready do a bunch of

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.439 
going to be mobile ready do a bunch of
