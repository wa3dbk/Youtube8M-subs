the form is ready for action here so
it's<00:01:29.070> closed<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.909> position<00:01:30.150> ready<00:01:31.020> as

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it's closed up in this position ready as

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
it's closed up in this position ready as
soon<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> break<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.009> hands<00:01:32.220> apart<00:01:32.520> there

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
then it starts flowing and because it's

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.380 
then it starts flowing and because it's
already<00:01:35.430> done<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.820> complete<00:01:36.240> revolution

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
already done one complete revolution

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
already done one complete revolution
around<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:37.829> body<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.579> point<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
around your body up to this point and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.780 
around your body up to this point and
now<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.570> now<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.960> starts<00:01:40.320> moving<00:01:40.530> again<00:01:40.829> for

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
now up now it starts moving again for

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.310 
now up now it starts moving again for
activating<00:01:42.240> again<00:01:42.600> rather<00:01:42.780> not<00:01:42.990> moving

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
activating again rather not moving

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
activating again rather not moving
activating<00:01:43.890> again<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.130> should<00:01:44.310> say<00:01:44.430> activating

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
activating again I should say activating

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.149 
activating again I should say activating
so<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.049> point<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.710> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
so when you get to this point here it's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
so when you get to this point here it's
basically<00:01:47.850> stopped<00:01:48.090> activating<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.750> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
basically stopped activating and just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990 
basically stopped activating and just
the<00:01:49.049> normal<00:01:49.380> body<00:01:49.619> where<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.250> should<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.850> in

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the normal body where it should be in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.999 
the normal body where it should be in
your<00:01:51.119> body<00:01:51.299> activation<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:52.200> any<00:01:52.560> time<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
your body activation at any time of the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
your body activation at any time of the
day<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.310> activating<00:01:53.970> normally<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
day is just activating normally but this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870 
day is just activating normally but this
is<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> soon<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.920> start<00:01:56.189> again<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
is you soon as you start again then it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.130 
is you soon as you start again then it
starts<00:01:57.149> activating<00:01:57.390> throughout<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> whole

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
starts activating throughout the whole

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.800 
starts activating throughout the whole
body<00:01:58.380> again<00:01:59.119> so<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.210> start<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.450> left<00:02:00.719> foot

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
body again so you start with left foot

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.399 
body again so you start with left foot
forward<00:02:01.850> again<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.780> same<00:02:03.990> old<00:02:04.170> thing<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
forward again the same old thing that

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.460 
forward again the same old thing that
we're<00:02:04.649> doing<00:02:04.680> before<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> scape<00:02:05.729> July

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.760 

to<00:02:12.470> church<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.110> exaggerate<00:02:15.680> I've

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
to church so this if I exaggerate I've

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.410 
to church so this if I exaggerate I've
done<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:16.250> before<00:02:16.310> what's<00:02:16.760> best<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.270> do

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
done this before what's best is to do

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.390 
done this before what's best is to do
this<00:02:17.600> not<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.200> try<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.590> do<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:18.860> by<00:02:19.010> looking<00:02:19.160> at

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
this not to try and do it by looking at

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.740 
this not to try and do it by looking at
the<00:02:19.490> expression<00:02:19.880> let<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.270> happen<00:02:20.480> that's

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
the expression let this happen that's

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.430 
the expression let this happen that's
how<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.900> got<00:02:21.200> it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
how I got it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.199 
how I got it
I<00:02:21.470> would<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.310> would<00:02:22.580> see<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.880> happening<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
I would I would see this happening I

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.510 
I would I would see this happening I
think<00:02:23.330> all<00:02:23.480> right<00:02:23.569> Jesus<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.050> am<00:02:24.080> i<00:02:24.200> doing<00:02:24.520> I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
think all right Jesus what am i doing I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.670 
think all right Jesus what am i doing I
just<00:02:26.030> it's<00:02:26.510> difficult<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.959> get<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.200> if<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.410> try

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
just it's difficult to get it if you try

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.860 
just it's difficult to get it if you try
and<00:02:27.740> do<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.100> but<00:02:28.520> what's<00:02:28.850> happening<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.300> as

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and do it but what's happening is as

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.150 
and do it but what's happening is as
this<00:02:30.020> hands<00:02:30.260> coming<00:02:30.440> forward<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:30.920> one's

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
this hands coming forward this one's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.820 
this hands coming forward this one's
coming<00:02:31.459> back<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.050> step<00:02:33.320> Euler<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
coming back so the step Euler of the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.380 
coming back so the step Euler of the
left<00:02:34.070> hand<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.310> right<00:02:37.489> one<00:02:37.730> C<00:02:38.209> is

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
left hand is in and the right one C is

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.140 
left hand is in and the right one C is
out<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.080> then<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.709> reverse<00:02:40.010> happens<00:02:40.959> C<00:02:43.150> so

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
out and then the reverse happens C so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.620 
out and then the reverse happens C so
you<00:02:44.209> just<00:02:44.360> took<00:02:44.510> two<00:02:44.690> revolutions<00:02:45.260> 1<00:02:46.780> 1<00:02:49.209> 2<00:02:50.209> and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
you just took two revolutions 1 1 2 and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.840 
you just took two revolutions 1 1 2 and
then<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.260> come<00:02:51.440> back<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.340> you're<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:55.820> a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
then you come back so you're in a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.250 
then you come back so you're in a
position<00:02:56.060> where<00:02:56.390> your<00:02:56.480> right<00:02:56.630> hand<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.019> slight

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
position where your right hand is slight

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.140 
position where your right hand is slight
because<00:02:57.620> if<00:02:57.739> if<00:02:57.860> position<00:02:58.640> your<00:02:58.820> feet<00:02:59.000> your

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
because if if position your feet your

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.250 
because if if position your feet your
right<00:02:59.269> hand<00:02:59.450> will<00:02:59.540> be<00:02:59.570> equal<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.019> your<00:03:00.110> left

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
right hand will be equal to your left

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.780 
right hand will be equal to your left
hand<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.709> in<00:03:00.860> effect<00:03:01.130> it's<00:03:01.340> actually<00:03:01.610> more

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
hand and in effect it's actually more

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.780 
hand and in effect it's actually more
forward<00:03:02.209> because<00:03:02.570> oh<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.950> that's<00:03:04.160> like<00:03:04.340> when

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
forward because oh but that's like when

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.490 
forward because oh but that's like when
when<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.120> start<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.420> race<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.930> know<00:03:06.050> people

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
when you start a race you know people

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.979 
when you start a race you know people
here<00:03:06.890> they're<00:03:07.850> more<00:03:08.180> more<00:03:08.600> forward<00:03:08.959> than

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
here they're more more forward than

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.330 
here they're more more forward than
these<00:03:09.200> people<00:03:09.590> because<00:03:09.830> these<00:03:09.950> people<00:03:10.220> got

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
these people because these people got

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.160 
these people because these people got
shorter<00:03:11.269> distance<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.720> run<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:11.959> it's<00:03:12.080> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
shorter distance to run and it's the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.270 
shorter distance to run and it's the
same<00:03:12.380> when<00:03:12.530> your<00:03:12.650> hands<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.100> hands

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
same when your hands so your hands

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.720 
same when your hands so your hands
actually<00:03:13.610> end<00:03:13.760> up<00:03:15.310> like<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.220> first<00:03:19.519> move

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
actually end up like that so first move

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.509 
actually end up like that so first move
is<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:21.560> take<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:21.829> step<00:03:22.070> with<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.280> left<00:03:22.370> foot

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
is you take a step with the left foot

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.100 
is you take a step with the left foot
the<00:03:22.640> foot<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.180> simply<00:03:23.540> one<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.690> these<00:03:23.870> ones

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
the foot is simply one of these ones

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.789 
the foot is simply one of these ones
again<00:03:24.380> where<00:03:24.530> you're<00:03:24.620> stepping<00:03:24.980> like<00:03:25.130> this

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
again where you're stepping like this

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.650 
again where you're stepping like this
this<00:03:27.799> hand<00:03:28.040> comes<00:03:28.250> up<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:29.030> that's<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.299> sort<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.570> a

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
this hand comes up so that's a sort of a

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.150 
this hand comes up so that's a sort of a
cross<00:03:29.870> hand<00:03:30.140> straightaway<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:30.739> that's<00:03:31.040> not

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
cross hand straightaway but that's not

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.220 
cross hand straightaway but that's not
the<00:03:31.250> main<00:03:31.459> cross<00:03:31.670> hands<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:32.420> first<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:32.870> all<00:03:32.989> it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
the main cross hands so first of all it

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.220 
the main cross hands so first of all it
goes<00:03:36.519> like<00:03:37.519> as<00:03:37.700> if<00:03:37.820> it's<00:03:37.970> doing<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.780> move<00:03:39.049> in

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
goes like as if it's doing that move in

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.250 
goes like as if it's doing that move in
the<00:03:39.260> form<00:03:39.560> but<00:03:39.950> not<00:03:40.100> so<00:03:40.280> big<00:03:44.079> I'll<00:03:45.079> just

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
the form but not so big I'll just

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.380 
the form but not so big I'll just
continue<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:45.860> now<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.430> hands<00:03:46.940> open<00:03:47.060> like

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
continue this now the hands open like

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.190 
continue this now the hands open like
you're<00:03:47.540> doing<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.840> before<00:03:47.959> they<00:03:48.200> turn<00:03:48.440> out<00:03:50.200> you

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
you're doing it before they turn out you

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.240 
you're doing it before they turn out you
put<00:03:51.380> your<00:03:51.500> foot<00:03:51.620> behind<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:52.010> other<00:03:52.100> one

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
put your foot behind the other one

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.130 
put your foot behind the other one
exactly<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.700> same<00:03:52.880> as<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.180> leaping<00:03:53.510> Carter

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
exactly the same as the leaping Carter

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.490 
exactly the same as the leaping Carter
and<00:03:54.320> now<00:03:54.970> you've<00:03:55.970> crossed<00:03:56.150> your<00:03:56.329> hands<00:03:56.660> right

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
and now you've crossed your hands right

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.539 
and now you've crossed your hands right
over<00:03:57.890> left<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.340> let<00:03:58.489> your<00:03:58.640> left<00:03:58.790> foot

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
over left and let your left foot

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.770 
over left and let your left foot
straighten<00:04:01.549> up<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.329> foot<00:04:02.510> should<00:04:02.660> be

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
straighten up so that foot should be

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.289 
straighten up so that foot should be
like<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:02.959> you're<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.290> back<00:04:03.470> city<00:04:03.709> stance

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299

time<00:05:07.520> now<00:05:08.520> on<00:05:08.699> top<00:05:08.909> of<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.120> we've<00:05:09.690> got<00:05:09.870> a

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
time now on top of that we've got a

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.749 
time now on top of that we've got a
fudging<00:05:10.380> movement<00:05:10.770> now<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.970> I'll<00:05:12.060> do<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.300> again

facing<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.819> correct<00:05:15.000> direction<00:05:21.470> so<00:05:22.470> it's

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
facing the correct direction so it's

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.170 
facing the correct direction so it's
very<00:05:22.710> simply<00:05:23.159> when<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.580> get<00:05:23.699> around<00:05:23.969> we'll<00:05:24.090> do

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
very simply when you get around we'll do

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:33.890 
very simply when you get around we'll do
it<00:05:24.240> this<00:05:24.360> way<00:05:28.849> right<00:05:30.139> left<00:05:31.139> right<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:33.570> when<00:05:33.840> you

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
it this way right left right so when you

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.140 
it this way right left right so when you
get<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.169> here<00:05:34.530> good<00:05:35.159> ah<00:05:37.639> other<00:05:38.639> words<00:05:38.880> that

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
get to here good ah other words that

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.939 
get to here good ah other words that
elbow<00:05:39.449> is<00:05:39.509> going<00:05:39.630> out<00:05:40.020> see<00:05:40.289> it's<00:05:40.740> much<00:05:40.919> the

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
elbow is going out see it's much the

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.649 
elbow is going out see it's much the
same<00:05:41.099> as<00:05:41.370> when<00:05:41.490> we<00:05:41.580> did<00:05:41.699> this<00:05:41.820> leaping<00:05:42.300> what

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
same as when we did this leaping what

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.240 
same as when we did this leaping what
that<00:05:42.960> one<00:05:43.110> but<00:05:43.259> it's<00:05:43.380> more<00:05:43.530> on<00:05:43.590> a<00:05:43.740> flat<00:05:43.979> plane

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
that one but it's more on a flat plane

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.529 
that one but it's more on a flat plane
so<00:05:44.729> I<00:05:44.789> was<00:05:44.880> from<00:05:45.030> here

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
so I was from here

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.120 
so I was from here
the<00:05:45.840> elbow<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.229> comes<00:05:46.469> up<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.830> little<00:05:46.889> bit

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
the elbow just comes up a little bit

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.279 
the elbow just comes up a little bit
bang<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.849> back<00:05:48.090> so<00:05:48.569> you<00:05:48.659> first<00:05:48.870> of<00:05:48.990> all<00:05:49.050> turn

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
bang and back so you first of all turn

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.290 
bang and back so you first of all turn
to<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.469> right<00:05:49.680> slightly<00:05:50.400> you<00:05:50.699> see<00:05:50.909> why<00:05:51.090> in<00:05:51.210> a

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
to the right slightly you see why in a

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.570 
to the right slightly you see why in a
minute<00:05:51.389> and<00:05:51.810> then<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:55.229> the<00:05:56.099> hands<00:05:56.460> are

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
minute and then and the hands are

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.520 
minute and then and the hands are
totally<00:05:56.729> loose<00:05:57.120> that's<00:05:57.449> very<00:05:57.719> important<00:05:58.199> to

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
totally loose that's very important to

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.490 
totally loose that's very important to
heavy<00:05:58.710> hands<00:05:58.919> very<00:05:59.219> loose
