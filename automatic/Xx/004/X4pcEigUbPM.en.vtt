the<00:02:31.920> southwest<00:02:32.550> side<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.209> once<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.440> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the southwest side and once I have it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.350 
the southwest side and once I have it
fixed<00:02:34.800> properly<00:02:35.130> because<00:02:35.459> right<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:36.180> so

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
fixed properly because right now not so

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.640

tower<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.500> no<00:03:16.799> no<00:03:17.100> let's<00:03:17.340> exit<00:03:17.820> let's<00:03:18.239> fix<00:03:18.420> this

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
tower so no no let's exit let's fix this

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.440 
tower so no no let's exit let's fix this
so<00:03:19.260> basically<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.459> going<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.880> be<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> high

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
so basically this is going to be a high

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.500 
so basically this is going to be a high
speed<00:03:21.780> version<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.670> me<00:03:23.670> taking<00:03:24.120> out<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
speed version of me taking out the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.220 
speed version of me taking out the
rounded<00:03:24.959> corners<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.790> on<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.510> top<00:03:27.690> side<00:03:27.930> I

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
rounded corners and on the top side I

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.500 
rounded corners and on the top side I
had<00:03:28.350> already<00:03:28.620> adjusted<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.120> top<00:03:30.299> to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
had already adjusted it on the top to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.350 
had already adjusted it on the top to
make<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.780> three<00:03:30.989> pick<00:03:31.200> basically<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:32.150> got<00:03:33.150> rid

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
make it three pick basically I got rid

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.990 
make it three pick basically I got rid
of<00:03:33.390> rounded<00:03:33.810> corners<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.380> favor<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:35.000> keeping

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
of rounded corners in favor of keeping

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.580 
of rounded corners in favor of keeping
the<00:03:36.299> three<00:03:36.540> thick<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.080> see<00:03:37.230> they're

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the three thick you can see they're

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.819 
the three thick you can see they're
