these keys along the top that are
pre-programmed<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.050> can<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.190> modified<00:02:32.520> but

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
pre-programmed and can be modified but

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.610 
pre-programmed and can be modified but
if<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.600> make<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.840> out<00:02:34.230> that's<00:02:34.440> actually

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
if you can make that out that's actually

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.400 
if you can make that out that's actually
a<00:02:34.830> little<00:02:35.040> word<00:02:35.340> weirder<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.360> hit<00:02:37.200> that

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
a little word weirder so if I hit that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.490 
a little word weirder so if I hit that
key<00:02:37.710> while<00:02:38.220> hitting<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.850> blue<00:02:39.270> function<00:02:40.080> key

and off button there and it tracks
pretty<00:03:29.400> well<00:03:29.610> pretty<00:03:29.850> precise<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.110> other

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
pretty well pretty precise and the other

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.449 
pretty well pretty precise and the other
thing<00:03:31.410> that's<00:03:31.530> unique<00:03:31.709> about<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.220> keyboard

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
thing that's unique about this keyboard

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.860 
thing that's unique about this keyboard
is<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.690> guess<00:03:34.680> unified<00:03:35.480> dongle<00:03:36.480> this

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
is the I guess unified dongle this

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.360 
is the I guess unified dongle this
actually<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.590> pull<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.950> out<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.310> is

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
actually if I pull this out this is

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.790 
actually if I pull this out this is
actually<00:03:38.610> in<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.910> USB<00:03:39.360> extender<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:39.870> it's

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
actually in a USB extender so it's

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.290 
actually in a USB extender so it's
really<00:03:41.100> nice<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.430> close<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.790> your<00:03:41.820> keyboard

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
really nice and close to your keyboard

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.500 
really nice and close to your keyboard
for<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.540> good<00:03:42.750> signal<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.920> can<00:03:44.070> see<00:03:44.510> what

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
for a good signal and you can see what

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.000 
for a good signal and you can see what
that<00:03:45.630> looks<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:46.140> there<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.709> device

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
that looks like there and this device

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.070 
that looks like there and this device
essentially<00:03:47.520> can<00:03:47.850> plug<00:03:48.360> into<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.630> USB<00:03:48.660> port

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
essentially can plug into the USB port

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.410 
essentially can plug into the USB port
of<00:03:49.950> your<00:03:50.010> computer<00:03:50.310> or<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:50.940> you're<00:03:51.209> like<00:03:51.390> a
