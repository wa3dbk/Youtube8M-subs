this<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.140> ailing<00:01:17.620> case<00:01:17.860> because<00:01:18.189> of<00:01:18.340> the

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
this the ailing case because of the

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.370 
this the ailing case because of the
design<00:01:18.549> that<00:01:18.939> they<00:01:18.969> put<00:01:19.299> into<00:01:19.450> this<00:01:19.689> case<00:01:19.960> the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
design that they put into this case the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.200 
design that they put into this case the
bumps<00:01:20.680> of<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.799> TPU<00:01:21.189> material<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:22.000> hard

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
bumps of the TPU material and the hard

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.969 
bumps of the TPU material and the hard
shell<00:01:22.450> match<00:01:22.659> is<00:01:22.869> real<00:01:23.110> nice<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.500> show<00:01:23.680> up<00:01:23.860> the

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
shell match is real nice to show up the

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.480 
shell match is real nice to show up the
alien<00:01:24.340> ish<00:01:24.490> look<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.000> case<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:27.189> I<00:01:27.219> also

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
alien ish look of the case now I also

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.100 
alien ish look of the case now I also
want<00:01:27.759> to<00:01:27.790> mention<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.149> this<00:01:28.420> does<00:01:28.689> provide<00:01:29.049> a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
want to mention that this does provide a

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.990 
want to mention that this does provide a
pretty<00:01:29.469> good<00:01:29.649> amount<00:01:29.829> of<00:01:29.979> liam<00:01:30.280> table<00:01:30.700> design

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
pretty good amount of liam table design

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.480 
pretty good amount of liam table design
it's<00:01:31.450> not<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.689> little<00:01:32.110> not<00:01:32.500> too<00:01:32.710> big<00:01:32.890> which

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
it's not that little not too big which

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.080 
it's not that little not too big which
is<00:01:33.610> perfectly<00:01:34.030> fine<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.979> now<00:01:36.789> I'm<00:01:36.880> going<00:01:37.030> to

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
is perfectly fine and now I'm going to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.459 
is perfectly fine and now I'm going to
show<00:01:37.149> you<00:01:37.299> a<00:01:37.390> little<00:01:37.600> demonstration<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.409> how

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
show you a little demonstration on how

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.260 
show you a little demonstration on how
to<00:01:38.740> put<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.100> case<00:01:39.280> on<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.850> all<00:01:39.939> that<00:01:40.119> good

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
to put the case on and all that good

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:58.820 
to put the case on and all that good
stuff

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.230 

and<00:01:59.830> if<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.070> listen<00:02:00.220> closely<00:02:00.490> when<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:00.910> put<00:02:01.150> the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
and if you listen closely when I put the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.580 
and if you listen closely when I put the
phone<00:02:01.450> down<00:02:01.480> you<00:02:01.960> would<00:02:02.230> have<00:02:02.320> heard<00:02:02.410> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
phone down you would have heard the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.380 
phone down you would have heard the
noise<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.160> was<00:02:03.280> actually<00:02:03.520> pretty<00:02:03.850> hard

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
noise that it was actually pretty hard

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.050 
noise that it was actually pretty hard
it's<00:02:04.900> not<00:02:05.110> one<00:02:05.290> of<00:02:05.320> those<00:02:05.500> regular<00:02:06.220> TPU<00:02:06.760> case

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
it's not one of those regular TPU case

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.910 
it's not one of those regular TPU case
that<00:02:07.420> automatically<00:02:08.020> stretches<00:02:08.530> out<00:02:08.649> this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
that automatically stretches out this

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.440 
that automatically stretches out this
one<00:02:09.070> is<00:02:09.190> pretty<00:02:09.369> durable<00:02:09.640> which<00:02:10.119> will<00:02:10.330> give

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
one is pretty durable which will give

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.300 
one is pretty durable which will give
you<00:02:10.570> enough<00:02:10.840> shock<00:02:11.080> protection<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.890> all<00:02:12.100> that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
you enough shock protection and all that

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.940 
you enough shock protection and all that
good<00:02:12.460> stuff<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> camera<00:02:14.260> hole<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.740> does

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
good stuff in the camera hole it does

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.620 
good stuff in the camera hole it does
have<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.250> black<00:02:15.580> ring<00:02:15.880> around<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.570> you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
have that black ring around it so you

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.750 
have that black ring around it so you
won't<00:02:16.780> get<00:02:16.959> any<00:02:17.110> flash<00:02:17.410> back<00:02:17.680> issues<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.340> so

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
won't get any flash back issues and so

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.490 
won't get any flash back issues and so
that's<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.180> for<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.450> video<00:02:19.600> guys<00:02:19.810> thanks<00:02:20.440> for
