like<00:01:42.670> that<00:01:42.820> fire<00:01:43.270> just<00:01:43.540> killer<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.800> got

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
like that fire just killer so you got

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.859 
like that fire just killer so you got
one<00:01:45.460> ladder<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.000> it's<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.300> corner<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
one ladder and it's in the corner of the

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.320 
one ladder and it's in the corner of the
room<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.890> then<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.280> have<00:01:48.640> another<00:01:49.030> ladder

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
room and then you have another ladder

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.090 
room and then you have another ladder
and<00:01:49.690> straight<00:01:50.050> ahead<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.830> switch

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
and straight ahead this is the switch

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.130 
and straight ahead this is the switch
that's<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.970> fire<00:01:52.240> off<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.900> think

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
that's just the fire off and I think

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.890 
that's just the fire off and I think
it's<00:01:53.260> trucks<00:01:53.530> off<00:01:53.890> fire<00:01:54.280> off<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:55.570> shooting

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
it's trucks off fire off that shooting

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.840 
it's trucks off fire off that shooting
