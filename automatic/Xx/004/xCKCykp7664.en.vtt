00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello and welcome to a new 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.460
 test then revives in this video I 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.560
 will test the ears 90 become train 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.630
 so as its name indicates it is on 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.920
 an isolate of euros and proteins measure the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 90% protein 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.359
 that's already a positive point since 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.380
 90% protein for a scented isolate 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.939
 it's still pretty rare 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.830
 so we're really on a product that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 is very well endowed with protein 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.489
 it has virtually no carbohydrates or 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.190
 lipids since we at 2% 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.140
 in addition it is important to libya then 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.160
 it will be interesting for those 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.469
 who are in a bag who want to master 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 at best their carbohydrate intake and 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.219
 lipids but also for those who have a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.690
 small sensitivity for laptop since 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.320
 the blow will give very little in this product 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.940
 in addition and even because and especially the point 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.270
 the most important for me in this 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.730
 product 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.870
 it is denisot the cfm so its 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.460
 business is a process of extraction 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.920
 it is currently the best method 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.629
 extraction that exists it allows for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.430
 not denature the protects the proteins 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.019
 it is made cold without adding 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.760
 chemicals and that produces so 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.500
 a protein of excellent quality in 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.630
 more to be well focused as 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.420
 indicate it earlier after burial 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.939
 ingredients we will find 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.680
 883 mg of colostrum then colostrum 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.210
 it is a product that is subject to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.830
 controversy some say they 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.200
 interesting others not but there of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.369
 anyway with 883 mg but on a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.659
 use too weak for that one 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.259
 any consequence 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.810
 so I will now do the test of 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.119
 mix and and humor so a pod 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.990
 a serious loss in 100 milliliters 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.990
 chocolate scented water 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.270
 so we have small dots on the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.760
 beautiful shaker just like 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.550
 often with rents zola is by 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.970
 against a lot of moss here I'm going 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.190
 wait a little while it settles 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.020
 here you will clear up ah that's it 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.490
 now the most liquid cosmos 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.590
 various reducing it ago when 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:09.680
 even a lot of foam we will receive 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:12.060
 now on the taste the taste is good 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.820
 for me it may be too sweet and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.930
 to hug chocolate load so we go 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.970
 rather advise him to those who had 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.940
 sweet product milk then gradually dosed 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.710
 chocolate cocoa is against you 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.840
 see there is still a lot of foam and 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.520
 then small dots so on it 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.500
 had perhaps an effort to make at 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.360
 he drags on this mix aspect so 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.310
 to summarize on this product the big 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.190
 strong point for me of this product is 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.110
 we are on 90% wailly zola cfm 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.090
 so it's really a wade 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.530
 excellent quality, and then suddenly it 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.800
 saw the baseball wants to be the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.120
 mixture we have normal foam 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.650
 so I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.610
 if that's the case do not hesitate to do a 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.230
 little chick yesterday on youtube 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.430
 it's always fun and then 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.660
 do not hesitate to subscribe to
