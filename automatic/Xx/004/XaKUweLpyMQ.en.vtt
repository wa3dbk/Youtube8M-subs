I<00:00:02.330> wanted<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.510> try<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.780> come<00:00:04.589> up<00:00:04.740> with

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
I wanted to try to come up with

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.920 
I wanted to try to come up with
something<00:00:05.069> very<00:00:05.370> different<00:00:05.609> than<00:00:06.000> just<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
something very different than just the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.650 
something very different than just the
normal<00:00:07.259> monster<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.010> one<00:00:08.519> idea<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.880> had<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.480> my

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
normal monster so one idea I had on my

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.730 
normal monster so one idea I had on my
trip<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.929> Mary<00:00:10.320> Belle<00:00:10.559> France<00:00:11.450> at<00:00:12.450> DC's<00:00:13.230> area

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
trip to Mary Belle France at DC's area

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.519 
trip to Mary Belle France at DC's area
43<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.610> went<00:00:14.969> there<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.299> basically<00:00:15.630> just

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
43 I went there and basically just

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.080 
43 I went there and basically just
seeing<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.980> mountainscapes<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.760> kind<00:00:18.000> of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
seeing the mountainscapes I kind of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.939 
seeing the mountainscapes I kind of
envisioned<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.350> mountains<00:00:19.740> all

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
envisioned like the mountains all

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.560 
envisioned like the mountains all
talking<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.550> each<00:00:20.580> other<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.119> being<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
talking to each other and being like a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
talking to each other and being like a
crew<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> kind<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.250> thought<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
crew and so I kind of thought of the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.300 
crew and so I kind of thought of the
idea<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.269> doing<00:00:24.750> my<00:00:24.990> monsters<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> new

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
idea of like doing my monsters but a new

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.050 
idea of like doing my monsters but a new
version<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.939> version<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.510> would<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:28.039> all<00:00:29.060> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
version of version that would be all a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 
version of version that would be all a
huge<00:00:30.480> mountain<00:00:30.840> scape<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> bunch<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.160> dudes

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
huge mountain scape so a bunch of dudes
