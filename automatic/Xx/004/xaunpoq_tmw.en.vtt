00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.360
 that shows when people are 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.039
 using or not a personal chest is very 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.230
 simple very basic same as you 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.969
 You see, he touched a block of four more 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.430
 could be with any kind of item i 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.079
 I'm just going to put it where mine is where 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 Excused the items, right? 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.620
 and there are already people going to see some of these 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.420
 ascending fights you are seeing here 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.580
 he has come he got here too right 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.200
 because this or that is from travel 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.000
 explain to you how everything works 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.040
 here already arrived was not to have arrived 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.689
 So let's get you guys going to see this 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.890
 value that is already fully filled you 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.229
 already has already been fully 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.200
 used then it will move to that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.030
 next to akp just as you are seeing 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.229
 So, personal beauty, I think. 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.759
 Now we can go there for us. 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.979
 tutorial because it is very simple and well 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.750
 so then it's good, then beauty 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.640
 to start here in our system of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.860
 auto ferry is just that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.900
 People are going to make us go and start. 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.670
 placing and alternating normal chances 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.310
 normal jobs and chests that emit a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.200
 antonio signal are placed plus the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.579
 good sign that emit no more jackson 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.450
 two goals that give off a signal are already 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.220
 Very well. 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.960
 if you want people because there are two 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.790
 model types if you want 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.200
 identify your chest when you start 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.030
 arrive and had that you will have to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
 to do is first you are going to put 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.020
 these have to be aware that the line 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.700
 of Roberson's being placed here 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.189
 behind neighborhoods or you will put 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.689
 clothes on to the chests and here you 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.430
 will arrive for example you want 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.930
 whether the last balance sheet is used 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.270
 will put another robbery up here 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.619
 so he linked these 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.869
 clothes to each other with you too 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.890
 here the bottom are connected in the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.390
 break another one 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.710
 Now for us to identify these good ones. 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.900
 When we use it, we'll go. 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.330
 put a comparator out of the neighborhood 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.340
 here a game in front of it a network 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.220
 Tony Todd here another block upstairs 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.550
 of this totti network attitude and another is 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.110
 tok network will put a doc and your 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.090
 lamp you can put here at the time 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.890
 movies or because there are no 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.510
 difference puts blocks up here 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.700
 this way since now we're going to 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
 put two repeaters this way 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.300
 so every time an item arrives that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.010
 in this bucket for example the net stone he 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.320
 will send a signal and will say that it is 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.890
 with ballack beauty right're a doll 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.350
 with item 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.670
 but now if you want to do is a 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.320
 when the sun is setting. 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.660
 totally full he passes the items 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.880
 next time you want to be paulo 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.650
 is completely full right you know the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.090
 light is constantly on 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.769
 You're going to have to change that a little bit. 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.019
 project this project is to repeat it 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.340
 here, how and how do you say it would repeat 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.380
 and in the same way as for all 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.330
 others but now I'll show you when you 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.730
 will know that you are using 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.140
 really the 100% good box is a little bit 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.150
 What's different that we're going to do? 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 We're going to put a block behind 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.350
 ball will put a comparator going out 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.810
 of this funnel here I put a block 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.820
 here in this way a torch of stone one 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.310
 another block here and another 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.340
 I swear they 're here with a repeater 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.200
 right here on top of his break for 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.850
 the lamp and beauty now every time 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.440
 get between them stick together here 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.540
 it will light only when clothes and 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.820
 leave all items here in the chest he 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.470
 will end up erasing the light should ask 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.209
 but as the automatic does not want this 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.670
 say that every time you have voted ditem 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.440
 here is this opera that has arrived and has 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.930
 It will end up being constant. It will pass. 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.610
 next to young only then was that 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.200

 use staircases on the head staircase 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.120
 It does not interfere with 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.519
 open the chests there you can come here 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.049
