transferring settings from a dx6i to a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.050 
transferring settings from a dx6i to a
dx8<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.860> tells<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.250> what<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.430> conversions

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
dx8 it tells you what the conversions

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.730 
dx8 it tells you what the conversions
are<00:03:11.240> on<00:03:11.330> how<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.510> do<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:11.900> there's<00:03:12.560> really

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
are on how to do it so there's really

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.160 
are on how to do it so there's really
some<00:03:13.010> good<00:03:13.250> information<00:03:13.570> dry<00:03:14.570> reading<00:03:14.870> what<00:03:15.140> I

the menu system works well and it does
just<00:04:05.240> as<00:04:05.330> well<00:04:05.540> on<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:06.200> dx8<00:04:06.830> we<00:04:07.550> can<00:04:07.730> see<00:04:07.880> that

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
just as well on the dx8 we can see that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.120 
just as well on the dx8 we can see that
they've<00:04:08.240> upgraded<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.840> lot<00:04:09.020> of<00:04:09.170> things<00:04:09.380> the

the auxiliary channels flaps and idle up

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.700 
the auxiliary channels flaps and idle up
now<00:04:40.580> have<00:04:40.820> three<00:04:41.120> positions<00:04:41.690> whereas<00:04:42.470> on<00:04:42.680> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
now have three positions whereas on the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.490 
now have three positions whereas on the
dx6i<00:04:43.310> they<00:04:43.760> only<00:04:43.910> had<00:04:44.120> two<00:04:44.330> so<00:04:44.600> that's<00:04:45.080> another

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
dx6i they only had two so that's another

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.250 
dx6i they only had two so that's another
bonus<00:04:45.860> another<00:04:46.820> notable<00:04:47.060> changes<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:48.080> they've

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
bonus another notable changes is they've

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.380 
bonus another notable changes is they've
moved<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.710> trainer<00:04:49.040> switch<00:04:49.460> from<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.180> back

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
moved the trainer switch from the back

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.420 
moved the trainer switch from the back
to<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.690> front<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.320> think<00:04:51.890> that's<00:04:52.070> going<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.280> be

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
to the front I think that's going to be

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.060 
to the front I think that's going to be
a<00:04:52.460> good<00:04:52.730> change<00:04:52.970> as<00:04:53.240> well<00:04:53.500> overall<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.740> lot<00:04:54.950> of

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
a good change as well overall a lot of

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.340 
a good change as well overall a lot of
redesign<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.760> they<00:04:56.480> did<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> nice<00:04:56.930> job<00:04:56.990> on

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
redesign and they did a nice job on

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.340 
redesign and they did a nice job on
listening<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.370> what<00:04:58.610> people<00:04:58.640> said<00:04:59.210> this<00:05:00.170> is

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
listening to what people said this is

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.150 
listening to what people said this is
about<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.950> same<00:05:01.190> size<00:05:01.250> as<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.910> dx6i<00:05:02.980> DXM<00:05:03.980> was

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
about the same size as the dx6i DXM was

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.070 
about the same size as the dx6i DXM was
a<00:05:04.190> little<00:05:04.460> bit<00:05:04.580> larger<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.240> like<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.810> way<00:05:05.900> this

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
a little bit larger I like the way this

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.170 
a little bit larger I like the way this
feels<00:05:06.380> in<00:05:06.680> my<00:05:06.710> hand<00:05:06.830> just<00:05:07.280> as<00:05:07.460> much<00:05:07.670> as<00:05:07.970> the

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
feels in my hand just as much as the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.780 
feels in my hand just as much as the
dx6i<00:05:08.960> as<00:05:09.410> matter<00:05:09.710> of<00:05:09.770> fact<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:10.640> a<00:05:10.670> little

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
dx6i as matter of fact like it a little

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.760 
dx6i as matter of fact like it a little
bit<00:05:10.970> more<00:05:11.120> because<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.480> like<00:05:11.660> that<00:05:11.840> rubber<00:05:12.230> the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
bit more because I like that rubber the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.770 
bit more because I like that rubber the
rubber<00:05:12.980> feel<00:05:13.280> of<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.610> grips<00:05:13.850> in<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.180> back<00:05:14.390> so

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
rubber feel of the grips in the back so

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.630 
rubber feel of the grips in the back so
now<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.620> we've<00:05:15.740> gotten<00:05:15.950> a<00:05:16.070> closer<00:05:16.340> look

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
now that we've gotten a closer look

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.790 
now that we've gotten a closer look
let's<00:05:17.210> go<00:05:17.390> upstairs<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:17.840> well<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:18.320> have<00:05:18.470> a<00:05:18.500> few

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
let's go upstairs and well I have a few

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.130 
let's go upstairs and well I have a few
final<00:05:19.130> words<00:05:19.160> about<00:05:19.550> this<00:05:19.760> radio<00:05:22.510> ok<00:05:23.510> so<00:05:23.840> we

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
final words about this radio ok so we

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.320 
final words about this radio ok so we
run<00:05:24.350> box<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:24.950> we've<00:05:25.160> taken<00:05:25.400> a<00:05:25.580> closer<00:05:25.880> look

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
run box that we've taken a closer look

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.360 
run box that we've taken a closer look
one<00:05:27.140> thing<00:05:27.320> that<00:05:27.350> we're<00:05:27.650> not<00:05:27.770> going<00:05:27.980> to<00:05:28.100> do<00:05:28.220> is

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
one thing that we're not going to do is

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.440 
one thing that we're not going to do is
we're<00:05:28.610> not<00:05:28.640> going<00:05:28.910> to<00:05:28.970> go<00:05:29.060> through<00:05:29.240> the

we're not going to go through the
screens<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.140> try<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.380> show<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:30.710> how<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.040> use

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
screens and try to show you how to use

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.430 
screens and try to show you how to use
this<00:05:31.550> thing<00:05:31.610> that's<00:05:32.360> not<00:05:32.600> what<00:05:32.750> this<00:05:32.930> video<00:05:33.290> is

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
this thing that's not what this video is

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.010 
this thing that's not what this video is
for<00:05:33.710> and<00:05:34.070> there<00:05:34.610> are<00:05:34.730> plenty<00:05:35.000> of<00:05:35.210> really<00:05:35.750> good

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
for and there are plenty of really good

for and there are plenty of really good
how<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.350> videos<00:05:37.040> on<00:05:37.310> this<00:05:37.820> which<00:05:38.060> i'll<00:05:38.270> be

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
how to videos on this which i'll be

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.320 
how to videos on this which i'll be
using<00:05:38.630> as<00:05:39.230> well<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:39.950> really<00:05:40.730> this<00:05:40.880> is<00:05:41.030> just<00:05:41.210> the
