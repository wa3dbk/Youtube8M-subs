00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
 I apologize, however, there are draws of 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.519

 the video was this here in the mantras 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.360

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.300
 I had decided to put those 10 up for grabs 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.520
 millions that were fruitful to me say of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.100

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.010
 fallen into the sea they stick orders of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.780
 sighted stories there will be one I had 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.820
 told to join the second channel 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.979
 therefore we must be registered vesco 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.830
 give as a single comment loud 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.010
 correct i would say to make verses wins the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.140
 wind in less we do the news 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.939
 of a now and video control 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 there is a great year mistake you should 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.790
 be this is copy paste no no 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.000
 this ok should be right me 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.369
 they call right place no one writing ok 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.619
 we must redo obviously we aim 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.900
 still no writing will take years 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.259
 because often we don't make mistakes 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.259
 we want 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.560
 technically speaking now there is 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.490
 putting so much we should find him and us 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.290
 we continue to vote 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.710
 two minutes have passed but it is not yet 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.020
 success nothing I don't think goes in fact 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.780
 writing person we leave does not know that not 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.200
 it works more smile but someone you are 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.200
 signed up 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:06.000
 by no boys it's possible no one is 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.340
 written as a second channel thanks 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.690
 very kind and nobody is written let's see 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.380
 if at least my first was described 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.870
 youtube channel and instead now finds it 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.090
 immediately then I hope it's a bug because 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.310
 it's not possible that out of 10,000 is one 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.290
 no one person if he wrote in the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.570
 second channel then the winner is 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.450
 luigi boriello let's go and see the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.230
 profile and we write this channel 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:41.300
 there is no excellent marco ventrone we see 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:43.470
 if at least his profile does not exist but say so 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.990
 boys i mean i want to put two 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.300
 minutes we are here for a quarter of an hour will be 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:57.720
 official tub we see but it is not human not 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:01.410
 may not exist no see if the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.050
 davide has a Swiss profile since 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.840
 fake average late guys won 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.390
 so since I wanted to miss a little 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.390
 we go directly to do but it is that 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.160
 that he won the other time is impossible 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.420
 to win someone else do me against 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.670
 the second won again 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.380
 no guys it's a photograph won 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.730

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 he 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.020
