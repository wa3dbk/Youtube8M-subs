00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's right now I'm copying so little

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.050 
it's right now I'm copying so little
just<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> hard<00:01:11.729> drive

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
just so you know this is the hard drive

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.420 
just so you know this is the hard drive
two<00:01:12.299> terabytes<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> external<00:01:14.280> hard

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
two terabytes this is a external hard

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.940 
two terabytes this is a external hard
drive<00:01:14.760> controller<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.680> friend

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
drive controller and this little friend

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.010 
drive controller and this little friend
here<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.400> generic<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> Western

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
here is not generic so it's a Western

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.260 
here is not generic so it's a Western
Digital<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> does<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.850> writes

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
Digital and what it does is as it writes

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.560 
Digital and what it does is as it writes
information<00:01:21.869> onto<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.200> hard<00:01:22.409> drive<00:01:22.530> Baker

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
information onto this hard drive Baker

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.820 
information onto this hard drive Baker
encrypts<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.229> sort<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.470> Western

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
encrypts it into some sort of Western

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.539 
encrypts it into some sort of Western
digital<00:01:26.159> encryption<00:01:26.939> thing<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> also<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
digital encryption thing so also as I

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.730 
digital encryption thing so also as I
found<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:29.909> from<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> company<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.530> miss

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
found out from the company if you miss

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.929 
found out from the company if you miss
the<00:01:31.860> password<00:01:32.250> five<00:01:32.430> times

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the password five times

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
the password five times
apparently<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.780> erases<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.259> entire<00:01:34.530> high

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
apparently it erases your entire high

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.149 
apparently it erases your entire high
drive<00:01:34.979> okay<00:01:35.640> great<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.409> took<00:01:37.710> my<00:01:37.829> hard<00:01:38.009> drive

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
drive okay great so took my hard drive

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
drive okay great so took my hard drive
apart<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.680> figured<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.860> or<00:01:41.930> pretty

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
apart and figured out that or pretty

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.899 
apart and figured out that or pretty
much<00:01:42.990> figured<00:01:43.409> out<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.520> thing<00:01:44.729> was

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
much figured out that this thing was

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.060 
much figured out that this thing was
fried<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> looks<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.439> fried<00:01:46.740> but

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
fried now it looks like it's fried but

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190 
fried now it looks like it's fried but
then<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.310> bought<00:01:47.610> another<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:49.079> not

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
then I bought another one and it's not

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.609 
then I bought another one and it's not
that's<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> way<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.130> looks<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.610> okay

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
that's just the way it looks like okay

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.109 
that's just the way it looks like okay
so<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.979> took<00:01:53.899> threw<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.200> garbage

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
so I took threw this in the garbage

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.569 
so I took threw this in the garbage
went<00:01:57.119> down<00:01:57.270> took<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.500> part<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> hard<00:01:59.310> drive

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
went down took this part the hard drive

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.330 
went down took this part the hard drive
down<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.149> local<00:02:00.570> computer<00:02:01.049> shop<00:02:01.259> great<00:02:02.130> guys

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.779 
work they couldn't read it there's stuff
on<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:07.890> they<00:02:07.979> couldn't<00:02:08.250> read<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
on there but they couldn't read it and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580 
on there but they couldn't read it and
the<00:02:08.910> reason<00:02:09.179> why<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:10.289> little

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the reason why is because this little

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.229 
the reason why is because this little
friend<00:02:10.830> encryption<00:02:11.340> groups<00:02:12.090> all<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
friend encryption groups all the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.809 
friend encryption groups all the
information<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.989> puts<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.349> there<00:02:13.819> okay

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
information as it puts it on there okay

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:15.860 
information as it puts it on there okay
fair<00:02:15.269> enough

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
fair enough

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.890 
fair enough
