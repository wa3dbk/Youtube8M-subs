walking you through the el capitan d
tape<00:00:07.080> echo<00:00:07.470> there's<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.460> quite<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> lot<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.690> cover

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
tape echo there's a quite a lot to cover

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.879 
tape echo there's a quite a lot to cover
so<00:00:10.230> I'm<00:00:10.650> going<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.880> play<00:00:11.880> some<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.740> turn<00:00:13.740> some

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
so I'm going to play some and turn some

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.650 
so I'm going to play some and turn some
knobs<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.400> explained<00:00:14.760> what<00:00:15.150> some<00:00:15.510> of<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
knobs and explained what some of the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.010 
knobs and explained what some of the
features<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.410> functions<00:00:17.280> are

in turning the knob so on the while and
flutter<00:01:36.759> we<00:01:37.759> have<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.380> tape<00:01:39.590> friction

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
flutter we have the the tape friction

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.100 
flutter we have the the tape friction
component<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:42.550> mechanical<00:01:43.550> influence<00:01:44.110> on

component of the mechanical influence on
the<00:01:45.289> tape<00:01:45.470> speed<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:45.979> I'm<00:01:46.399> going<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.580> turn<00:01:46.759> the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
the tape speed so I'm going to turn the

the tape speed so I'm going to turn the
wild<00:01:47.210> flutter<00:01:47.420> 20<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:49.720> turn<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.960> tape

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200

wild flutter 20 and turn the tape
friction<00:01:51.649> which<00:01:52.130> we<00:01:52.280> call<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.149> tape<00:01:53.450> crinkle<00:01:53.929> in

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
friction which we call a tape crinkle in

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.279 
friction which we call a tape crinkle in
the<00:01:54.619> in<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.039> labs<00:01:55.550> here<00:01:55.789> 20<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:56.840> now<00:01:56.960> we've<00:01:57.110> got

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
the in the labs here 20 so now we've got

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.130 
the in the labs here 20 so now we've got
a<00:01:57.530> delay<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:59.420> know<00:01:59.539> tape<00:01:59.720> machine<00:01:59.960> that

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
a delay that you know tape machine that

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.169 
a delay that you know tape machine that
shows<00:02:00.319> no<00:02:00.530> no<00:02:00.920> sort<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.340> mechanical<00:02:01.610> defect

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.090 

and<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:08.299> I<00:02:08.390> turn<00:02:08.569> up<00:02:08.630> just<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.259> friction

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
and if I turn up just the friction

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.650 
and if I turn up just the friction
component

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.509 

we<00:02:18.660> hear<00:02:18.840> some<00:02:19.140> there's<00:02:19.470> actually<00:02:19.800> taped

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
we hear some there's actually taped

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.000 
we hear some there's actually taped
splices<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.709> know<00:02:22.739> tape

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010

tape when you have full bandwidth that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.500 
tape when you have full bandwidth that
becomes<00:02:30.950> more<00:02:31.950> noticeable

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.970 

we'll<00:02:37.510> go<00:02:37.630> into<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.930> other<00:02:38.200> function<00:02:38.740> a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
we'll go into this other function a

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.250 
we'll go into this other function a
little<00:02:39.160> bit<00:02:39.250> more<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.610> at<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.900> slow<00:02:41.080> down

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
little bit more of it at we slow down

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
little bit more of it at we slow down
the<00:02:41.380> tape<00:02:41.620> speed<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:43.380> aspect<00:02:44.380> tracks<00:02:45.100> as

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
the tape speed the that aspect tracks as

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:57.600 
the tape speed the that aspect tracks as
well<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:55.710> secondary<00:02:56.710> function<00:02:57.340> on<00:02:57.490> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
well the secondary function on the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.210 
well the secondary function on the
repeats<00:02:58.000> knob<00:02:58.240> is<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.900> tape<00:02:59.170> bias<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.830> that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
repeats knob is the tape bias and that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.300 
repeats knob is the tape bias and that
allows<00:03:00.550> us<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:01.080> vary<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.170> dynamic<00:03:02.740> range<00:03:02.920> and

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
allows us to vary the dynamic range and

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.290 
allows us to vary the dynamic range and
the<00:03:04.270> Headroom<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.960> repeats<00:03:05.430> based<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.800 
bias the more the bias signal kind of
takes<00:03:11.800> up<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.130> available<00:03:12.790> Headroom<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.750> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
takes up the available Headroom of the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.110 
takes up the available Headroom of the
tape<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.320> end<00:03:14.530> up<00:03:14.620> with<00:03:14.880> repeats<00:03:15.880> that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
tape and you end up with repeats that

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.770 
tape and you end up with repeats that
that<00:03:16.990> end<00:03:17.170> up<00:03:17.640> saturating<00:03:18.640> at<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.450> reduced

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
that end up saturating at a reduced

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.080 
that end up saturating at a reduced
volume<00:03:20.020> what's<00:03:20.410> nice<00:03:20.590> about<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.920> is<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.760> can

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
volume what's nice about that is you can

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.000 
volume what's nice about that is you can
set<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:23.130> delay<00:03:24.130> for<00:03:25.320> for<00:03:26.320> oscillation

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
set the delay for for oscillation

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.040 
set the delay for for oscillation
repeats<00:03:27.550> that<00:03:27.730> don't<00:03:27.970> actually<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.960> know

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
repeats that don't actually you know

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.660 
repeats that don't actually you know
give<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.350> big<00:03:29.740> volume<00:03:30.100> increase<00:03:30.400> oh<00:03:30.520> we'll

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
give you a big volume increase oh we'll

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.650 
give you a big volume increase oh we'll
set<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.240> bias<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.750> maximum<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:33.600> set<00:03:34.600> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
set the bias to maximum and set the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:48.350 
set the bias to maximum and set the
repeats<00:03:34.960> pretty<00:03:35.230> high<00:03:35.440> here

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.510 

so<00:03:49.360> here<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.590> repeats<00:03:50.920> continue<00:03:51.370> their

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
so here that the repeats continue their

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.950 
so here that the repeats continue their
saturated<00:03:52.210> but<00:03:53.080> they're<00:03:53.230> not<00:03:53.380> acting<00:03:54.960> they're

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
saturated but they're not acting they're

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.870 
saturated but they're not acting they're
not<00:03:56.080> at<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> higher<00:03:56.500> volume<00:03:56.800> than<00:03:57.190> in<00:03:57.520> what<00:03:57.760> I'm

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
not at a higher volume than in what I'm

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:10.180 
not at a higher volume than in what I'm
playing<00:03:58.450> even<00:03:58.690> toyed

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.520 

there<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.300> can<00:04:11.480> hear<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.960> characteristics

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
there you can hear the characteristics

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.509 
there you can hear the characteristics
of<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.740> tape<00:04:13.160> saturation<00:04:14.800> so<00:04:15.800> that's<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.220> nice

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
of the tape saturation so that's a nice

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.240 
of the tape saturation so that's a nice
feature<00:04:16.700> now<00:04:16.970> we<00:04:17.030> can<00:04:17.269> by<00:04:17.950> pressing<00:04:18.950> them<00:04:19.070> down

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
feature now we can by pressing them down

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.720 
feature now we can by pressing them down
and<00:04:19.519> going<00:04:19.970> back<00:04:20.180> here<00:04:20.600> we're<00:04:21.080> at<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.730> much

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
and going back here we're at a much

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.130 
and going back here we're at a much
higher<00:04:22.760> Headroom<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.730> give<00:04:25.730> it<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.780> repeats

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
higher Headroom so give it the repeats

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.690 
higher Headroom so give it the repeats
have<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.350> little<00:04:27.500> more<00:04:27.650> dynamics<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.610> them

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
have a little more dynamics to them

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.450 
have a little more dynamics to them
they're<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:28.910> little<00:04:29.090> bit<00:04:29.800> lively<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.250> if<00:04:31.340> I

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
they're a little bit lively and if I

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:44.610 
they're a little bit lively and if I
were<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.670> turn<00:04:32.000> up<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:33.640> repeats<00:04:34.640> accordingly

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.850 

we<00:04:45.620> hear<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:47.150> reducer<00:04:47.780> experience<00:04:48.740> the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
we hear that the reducer experience the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.290 
we hear that the reducer experience the
the<00:04:49.130> volume<00:04:49.460> increase<00:04:49.760> because<00:04:49.970> of<00:04:50.180> the

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
the volume increase because of the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.390 
the volume increase because of the
increased<00:04:50.930> dynamic<00:04:51.410> range<00:04:51.890> of<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.070> repeats

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
increased dynamic range of the repeats

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.970 
increased dynamic range of the repeats
so<00:04:52.970> it's<00:04:53.150> nice<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.540> can<00:04:53.720> kind<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.440> tailor<00:04:54.710> that

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
so it's nice you can kind of tailor that

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.470 
so it's nice you can kind of tailor that
you<00:04:55.430> know<00:04:55.520> how<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.670> want<00:04:56.000> if<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:56.180> want<00:04:56.420> to

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
you know how you want if you want to

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.170 
you know how you want if you want to
play<00:04:56.600> with<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:57.230> know<00:04:57.320> washed<00:04:57.560> out

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
play with you know washed out

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.250 
play with you know washed out
oscillating<00:04:59.180> repeats<00:04:59.510> you<00:04:59.660> can<00:04:59.810> kind<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.080> set

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
oscillating repeats you can kind of set

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.220 
oscillating repeats you can kind of set
the<00:05:00.290> level<00:05:00.650> through<00:05:00.860> adjusting<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.700> bias<00:05:02.230> on

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
the level through adjusting the bias on

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.530 
the level through adjusting the bias on
the<00:05:03.290> tape<00:05:03.560> age<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.160> secondary<00:05:04.880> function<00:05:05.330> is

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
the tape age the secondary function is

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.130 
the tape age the secondary function is
