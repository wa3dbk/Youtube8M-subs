00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.620
 one of the most important in a wireless mouse is battery life in of a so 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.540
 blue r7 with this everyone but the good news does not end there 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.699
 Let's watch this wireless option above tel 7 that is, the form is 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.680
 but there are still differences if you take the appearance of the coating has not changed 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.630
 There is no soft-touch plastic but there are already no rezinochek on the buttons and this is part of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 now, without illumination, I hold it with my finger not so convenient 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.870
 all she use soft-touch is all the same slippery but should give him 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.940
 The due practically does not get dirty without a doubt, the mouse became heavier because 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.190
 that wireless means you need a battery 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.239
 it just plugs in here like this usb adapter that plugs into usb 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.800
 extension cord is needed to keep the mouse as close as possible to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.379
 adapter because it saves battery power 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.000
 buttons 8 if you hold the mouse with the finger grip that the side ones are easy to reach 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
 thumb and a bowl of this complex well, and the top few people use it once 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.710
 configured in order to under the main buttons switches 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.470
 Huana with a resource to press them 10 million at stake is quite loud mikriki but their course 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 and a clear click I like the scroll remained unchanged 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 rubberized go easy sensor avago 3050 hd same as wafa blondy r3 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.369
 but there is no such glitch as it was in r3 if you remember there if for 400 dipia 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.930
 do here and so the sensor started to lag but true it 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.470
 it was just at my home and here on the news at work there wasnâ€™t such a thing 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.270
 equal glitch was here this glitch is not and the mouse works well both in shooters and in 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.310
 new games the most important thing is that there is no input of the log because it would be a complete failure 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.630
 but even on the lowest battery charge, there is no leg delay 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.490
 Aluminum has not already become a hallmark for the series of blade they drive well 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.060
 on all types of surfaces but I advise using them on rags 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.319
 because on plastic they would strap the bloody v5 soft 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.490
 about the possibility of setting returns in shooters, and so on, I have already told and 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.200
 I repeat once again that this is a cheat and forget about this software does not end there 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.370
 here you can adjust the dipiai in 100 steps to set the speed of the gyrus by the way 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.250
 maximum 500 hertz calibrate the sensor under the surface 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.569
 to adjust the breakaway frequency, of course, you can reassign buttons and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.770
 create their profiles there may be three and each of them will have its own color 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.730
 logo backlight; the harp tab allows you to adjust the signal stability 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.530
 there you activate all sorts of things so that there is no delay except for this you can 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.940
 set the time after which the mouse will fall asleep and click wake up method or 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.830
 movement and at the very bottom the brightness of the backlight from the battery the mouse works 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.590
 somewhere 3-4 days this is if you play not 12 hours a day for 3 that is you there 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.799
 played up to three o'clock then do some other kind of activity 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.450
 active badly just if the battery sits the mouse is not behind 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.709
 use in wired mode no, of course there is such a micro usb 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.310
 the charging cable that comes with it and you can 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.470
 connect the company's mouse so that the receiver is active or even into an outlet in 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.579
 In principle, this should not happen if you put it on one night for two days. 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.890
 charging in general we have a gaming mouse that works wirelessly 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.239
 it is not very expensive, especially if you take the version where the cheat kernels of the software 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.430
 blocked the most important thing here is the stable operation of the sensor absence 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.380
 input lava and good autonomy on it all with you was an online store f and 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.519
 my name is max subscribe to our YouTube channel and you will never have 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.239
 input log
