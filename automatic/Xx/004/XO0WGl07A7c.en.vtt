00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.590 
over a huge amount of climbing
opportunities<00:01:47.430> lots<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.790> areas<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.240> for

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
opportunities lots of areas also for

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.690 
opportunities lots of areas also for
sheltering<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.829> hiding<00:01:50.189> away<00:01:50.310> that's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
sheltering and for hiding away that's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.140 
sheltering and for hiding away that's
quite<00:01:50.939> an<00:01:51.030> important<00:01:51.570> behavior<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
quite an important behavior for it

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.640 
quite an important behavior for it
and<00:01:53.630> we'll<00:01:53.810> be<00:01:53.900> able<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.170> provide<00:01:54.440> them

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
and we'll be able to provide them

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.530 
and we'll be able to provide them
enrichment<00:01:55.190> every<00:01:55.490> single<00:01:55.850> day<00:01:56.000> whether

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
enrichment every single day whether

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.320 
enrichment every single day whether
that's<00:01:56.840> through<00:01:57.190> hiding<00:01:58.190> bits<00:01:58.370> of<00:01:58.550> food<00:01:58.730> low

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
that's through hiding bits of food low

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.150 
that's through hiding bits of food low
on<00:01:59.480> the<00:01:59.600> ground<00:01:59.750> or<00:02:00.230> much<00:02:00.530> higher<00:02:00.830> up<00:02:00.980> to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
on the ground or much higher up to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.490 
on the ground or much higher up to
encourage<00:02:01.550> natural<00:02:02.210> climbing<00:02:02.630> behaviors<00:02:03.110> so

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
encourage natural climbing behaviors so

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.100 
encourage natural climbing behaviors so

a<00:02:10.640> lot<00:02:10.820> more<00:02:10.880> in-depth<00:02:11.390> they're<00:02:11.660> looking<00:02:11.960> at

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
a lot more in-depth they're looking at

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.350 
a lot more in-depth they're looking at
two<00:02:12.740> targets<00:02:13.160> here<00:02:13.310> at<00:02:13.370> our<00:02:13.490> zoo<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.240> they're

two targets here at our zoo but they're

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.080 
two targets here at our zoo but they're
also<00:02:14.480> learning<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.230> lot<00:02:15.470> about<00:02:15.850> threats<00:02:16.850> to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
also learning a lot about threats to
