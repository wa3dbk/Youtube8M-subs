00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
then when we switch gravity Boop let me

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.350 
then when we switch gravity Boop let me
actually<00:01:35.189> collect<00:01:35.579> ourselves<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.000> redstone

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
actually collect ourselves the redstone

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.450 
actually collect ourselves the redstone
block<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> idea<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:38.009> need<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> try<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
block so the idea is we need to try and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
block so the idea is we need to try and
collect<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.790> many<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.299> redstone<00:01:39.750> blocks

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
collect as many of these redstone blocks

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.740 
collect as many of these redstone blocks
as<00:01:40.110> possible<00:01:40.530> ooh<00:01:40.650> steady<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:42.180> course<00:01:42.509> these

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
as possible ooh steady of course these

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
as possible ooh steady of course these
chorus<00:01:43.079> fruits<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.590> gonna<00:01:44.130> try<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.549> get<00:01:44.790> us

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
interface isn't on but when it is on it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.340 
interface isn't on but when it is on it
looks<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.270> bit<00:02:36.360> like<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.020> kind<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.200> in

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
thinking i might try and take this a

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.970 
thinking i might try and take this a
little<00:03:11.640> bit<00:03:12.090> slower<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.080> just<00:03:13.740> kind<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
little bit slower and just kind of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.340 
little bit slower and just kind of
really<00:03:14.520> watch<00:03:14.790> where<00:03:15.330> these<00:03:15.570> blocks<00:03:16.080> and
