00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
so they're gonna get to see all facets

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090 
so they're gonna get to see all facets
of<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.630> happens<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:55.619> tragic

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

of what happens when one of these tragic
DUI<00:01:56.369> crashes<00:01:56.670> happened<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.479> try<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> make

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
DUI crashes happened and we try to make

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.200 
DUI crashes happened and we try to make
it<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.200> real<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.500> possible<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
it as real as possible so that the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.550 
it as real as possible so that the
students<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> teens<00:02:01.079> they<00:02:01.290> really

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
students and the teens they really

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
students and the teens they really
understand<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.790> know<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.360> real

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
understand you know this is for real

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.030 
understand you know this is for real
this<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.990> does<00:02:04.200> happen<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this really does happen and that's the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.429 
this really does happen and that's the
whole<00:02:05.189> program<00:02:05.640> when<00:02:06.299> when<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> grant<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
whole program when when the grant and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.499 
whole program when when the grant and
the<00:02:07.500> program<00:02:07.799> was<00:02:07.950> created<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:09.000> statistic

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the program was created the statistic

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
the program was created the statistic
was<00:02:09.750> every<00:02:10.560> 15<00:02:10.920> minutes<00:02:11.099> someone<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.790> killed

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
was every 15 minutes someone is killed

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.760 
was every 15 minutes someone is killed
or<00:02:12.180> seriously<00:02:12.330> injured<00:02:12.660> injured

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
or seriously injured injured

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.180 
or seriously injured injured
and<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.070> DUI<00:02:14.220> related<00:02:14.580> incident<00:02:15.240> so

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and a DUI related incident so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.410 
and a DUI related incident so
fortunately<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.340> us<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.790> statistics<00:02:17.970> are<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
fortunately for us the statistics are a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.210 
fortunately for us the statistics are a
little<00:02:18.690> bit<00:02:18.810> better<00:02:18.960> now<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.770> not<00:02:19.950> at

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
little bit better now it's it's not at

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.100 
little bit better now it's it's not at
every<00:02:20.430> 15<00:02:20.730> minutes<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.120> gone<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:21.570> because

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
every 15 minutes it's gone up because

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.080 
every 15 minutes it's gone up because
we've<00:02:22.530> lowered<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.100> grade<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> little<00:02:23.700> bit<00:02:23.850> I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
we've lowered that grade a little bit I

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.660 
we've lowered that grade a little bit I
think<00:02:24.420> through<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:24.930> program<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:26.040> that's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
think through this program but that's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.070 
think through this program but that's
the<00:02:26.850> reality<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.330> somewhere<00:02:27.720> across<00:02:27.960> the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
the reality is somewhere across the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.570 
the reality is somewhere across the
United<00:02:28.440> States<00:02:28.500> people<00:02:28.950> are<00:02:29.040> dying<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.430> DUI

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
United States people are dying in DUI

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.940 
United States people are dying in DUI
related<00:02:30.120> incidents<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:31.260> really<00:02:31.500> great<00:02:31.710> for

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
related incidents it's really great for

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.350 
related incidents it's really great for
the<00:02:32.010> students<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.610> get<00:02:32.760> involved<00:02:33.210> we<00:02:33.330> have

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the students to get involved we have

11 of them through Modesto CHP and it's

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.460 
11 of them through Modesto CHP and it's
really<00:02:50.820> been<00:02:51.030> fun<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.810> work<00:02:51.990> with<00:02:52.050> all<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
students and see how involving into it

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.910 
students and see how involving into it
they<00:02:54.330> get<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:54.870> they<00:02:55.050> take<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.440> back<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
they get and then they take it back and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.530 
they get and then they take it back and
hopefully<00:02:56.430> if<00:02:56.640> they're<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.940> party<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.450> they
