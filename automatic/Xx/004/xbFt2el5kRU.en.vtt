this<00:01:08.130> pond<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.850> were<00:01:08.970> at<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.450> pond<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this pond we were at the back pond and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.760 
this pond we were at the back pond and
they<00:01:10.920> almost<00:01:11.070> made<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:15.770> that's

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
they almost made it to this one that's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
they almost made it to this one that's
not<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.659> ten<00:01:18.659> deal<00:01:18.960> she<00:01:19.530> goes<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> town<00:01:20.659> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
not a ten deal she goes the town and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:37.320 
not a ten deal she goes the town and
it's<00:01:21.869> usually<00:01:23.000> right<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.299> head

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.790 

I<00:01:37.450> think<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.080> might<00:01:38.230> have<00:01:38.320> learned<00:01:38.500> something

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
I think you might have learned something

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.550 
I think you might have learned something
on<00:01:39.040> this<00:01:39.190> flight<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.600> commit<00:01:43.900> herself<00:01:44.020> and

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
on this flight not to commit herself and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.660 
on this flight not to commit herself and
not<00:01:44.680> lose<00:01:44.920> all<00:01:45.160> her<00:01:46.440> all<00:01:47.440> right<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:48.220> think<00:01:48.430> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
not lose all her all right I think the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.730 
not lose all her all right I think the
first<00:01:48.940> one<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.450> first<00:01:49.660> was<00:01:49.870> a<00:01:49.900> big<00:01:49.930> long<00:01:50.350> pawn

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
first one the first was a big long pawn

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.030 
first one the first was a big long pawn
not<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:51.310> one<00:01:51.960> started<00:01:52.960> going<00:01:53.290> she<00:01:53.440> sorta

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
not this one started going she sorta

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.770 
not this one started going she sorta
came<00:01:54.250> down<00:01:54.580> but<00:01:54.910> she<00:01:55.060> didn't<00:01:55.240> come<00:01:55.390> down<00:01:55.570> all

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
came down but she didn't come down all

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.500 
came down but she didn't come down all
the<00:01:55.900> way<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:56.470> she<00:01:56.650> stayed<00:01:56.920> high<00:01:57.330> but<00:01:58.330> she

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
then gave up which was good and then

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.130 
then gave up which was good and then
it's<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:12.310> starting<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.730> now<00:02:12.850> fly<00:02:13.420> high<00:02:13.810> above

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
it's just starting to now fly high above

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.460 
it's just starting to now fly high above
them<00:02:14.560> as<00:02:14.710> they<00:02:14.890> circle<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.340> water<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.940> then

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
them as they circle the water and then

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.350 
them as they circle the water and then
when<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.830> can<00:02:18.010> keep<00:02:18.220> them<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.910> go<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:24.360> then

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
when I can keep them to go out then

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.620 
when I can keep them to go out then
basically<00:02:26.080> go<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.709> eats<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.340> beak<00:02:30.630> this

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
basically go for it eats the beak this

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.480 
basically go for it eats the beak this
now<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.140> with<00:02:32.320> no<00:02:32.590> iris<00:02:34.110> autofocus<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:36.310> is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
now is with no iris autofocus this is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.790 
now is with no iris autofocus this is
basically<00:02:37.360> just<00:02:37.450> automatic<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.590> would<00:02:38.680> be

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
basically just automatic but it would be

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.600 
basically just automatic but it would be
doing<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.220> was<00:02:39.400> automatic<00:02:41.280> looks<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.370> almost

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
doing it was automatic looks like almost

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.370 
doing it was automatic looks like almost
like<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.880> blue<00:02:43.180> wing

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.100 

it's<00:02:47.380> incredible<00:02:48.160> detail
