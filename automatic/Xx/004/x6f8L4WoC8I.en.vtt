floating<00:01:41.210> above<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:41.720> now<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.620> were<00:01:42.770> showing

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
floating above it now we were showing

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.280 
floating above it now we were showing
this<00:01:43.190> image<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.790> panel<00:01:44.299> about<00:01:44.420> concept<00:01:45.080> art

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
and the creation of destiny almost a

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.210 
and the creation of destiny almost a
year<00:01:47.600> ago<00:01:47.630> now<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.500> soon<00:01:48.650> as<00:01:48.770> people<00:01:48.950> saw

year ago now and as soon as people saw

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.890 
year ago now and as soon as people saw
this<00:01:49.340> image<00:01:49.549> they<00:01:49.820> start<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.180> speculate<00:01:50.720> are

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
this image they start to speculate are

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.030 
this image they start to speculate are
we<00:01:51.020> going<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.229> be<00:01:51.320> able<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.530> see<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.770> darkness

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
we going to be able to see the darkness

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.730 
we going to be able to see the darkness
in<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.430> game<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.690> on<00:01:53.870> we<00:01:54.320> also<00:01:54.500> got

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
in this game and so on we also got

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.260 
in this game and so on we also got
another<00:01:55.040> piece<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.400> concept<00:01:55.610> art<00:01:55.940> from<00:01:56.120> that

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
another piece of concept art from that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.750 
another piece of concept art from that
same<00:01:56.510> panel<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.110> it's<00:01:57.619> these<00:01:57.770> onyx<00:01:58.250> pyramid

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
same panel and it's these onyx pyramid

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.120 
same panel and it's these onyx pyramid
ships<00:01:59.060> now<00:01:59.869> of<00:01:59.990> course<00:02:00.049> in<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.530> image<00:02:00.710> we<00:02:00.830> saw

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
ships now of course in that image we saw

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.800 
ships now of course in that image we saw
the<00:02:01.190> darkness<00:02:01.670> figure<00:02:02.000> with<00:02:02.119> triangles<00:02:02.600> above

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
the darkness figure with triangles above

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.690 
the darkness figure with triangles above
his<00:02:02.900> head<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.770> people<00:02:03.950> assume<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.580> these

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
his head so people assume that these

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.640 
his head so people assume that these
other<00:02:05.000> ships<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.570> darkness<00:02:05.900> will<00:02:06.320> use

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
other ships that the darkness will use

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.339 
other ships that the darkness will use
to<00:02:06.680> travel<00:02:07.340> around<00:02:07.659> so<00:02:08.659> are<00:02:08.899> we<00:02:08.929> going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.259> be

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
to travel around so are we going to be

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.989 
to travel around so are we going to be
seeing<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.739> darkness<00:02:10.159> in<00:02:10.310> destiny<00:02:10.759> well

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:10.999 
seeing the darkness in destiny well

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.970 
seeing the darkness in destiny well
people<00:02:11.450> assume<00:02:12.049> that<00:02:12.200> we<00:02:12.290> are<00:02:12.469> gonna<00:02:12.709> see<00:02:12.829> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
people assume that we are gonna see the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.530 
people assume that we are gonna see the
darkness<00:02:13.249> in<00:02:13.519> this<00:02:13.670> game<00:02:13.909> and<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.359> of<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
darkness in this game and one of the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.040 
darkness in this game and one of the
main<00:02:14.719> thing

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
main thing

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.290 
main thing
of<00:02:15.350> how<00:02:15.500> we're<00:02:15.680> going<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.860> see<00:02:16.010> them<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.310> inside

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
of how we're going to see them is inside

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.270 
of how we're going to see them is inside
enemies<00:02:17.780> we've<00:02:17.990> already<00:02:18.200> fought<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.160> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
enemies we've already fought so the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.850 
enemies we've already fought so the
Fallen<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.880> vex<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.360> Cabal<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.900> hive<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
Fallen the vex the Cabal the hive the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.470 
Fallen the vex the Cabal the hive the
theory<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.340> they<00:02:22.760> are<00:02:22.940> all<00:02:23.150> going<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.390> be

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
theory is that they are all going to be

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.570 
theory is that they are all going to be
consumed<00:02:24.020> by<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.380> darkness<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.100> you'll<00:02:25.430> have

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
consumed by the darkness and you'll have

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.730 
consumed by the darkness and you'll have
variations<00:02:26.420> on<00:02:26.630> those<00:02:26.960> which<00:02:27.440> will<00:02:27.620> be

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
variations on those which will be

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.290 
variations on those which will be
consumed<00:02:28.220> by<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.400> darkness<00:02:28.730> may<00:02:29.000> be<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.120> little

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
consumed by the darkness may be a little

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.790 
consumed by the darkness may be a little
bit<00:02:29.420> harder<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.960> I<00:02:30.140> believe<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.770> the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
bit harder and I believe this is the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.680 
bit harder and I believe this is the
most<00:02:31.070> likely<00:02:31.310> explanation<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:32.300> how<00:02:32.510> we're

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
most likely explanation of how we're

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.360 
most likely explanation of how we're
going<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.870> fight<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.200> darkness<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:34.010> game

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
going to fight the darkness in this game

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.790 
going to fight the darkness in this game
mainly<00:02:35.150> because<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.840> speculated<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
mainly because it's speculated that the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.440 
mainly because it's speculated that the
darkness<00:02:37.220> has<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.550> ability<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:37.970> control

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
darkness has the ability to control

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.510 
darkness has the ability to control
other<00:02:38.720> life<00:02:38.960> forms<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.500> use<00:02:39.860> them<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.130> fight

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
other life forms and use them to fight

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.310 
other life forms and use them to fight
now<00:02:41.420> there's<00:02:41.600> another<00:02:41.690> interesting<00:02:42.290> thing

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
now there's another interesting thing

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.110 
now there's another interesting thing
that's<00:02:42.680> been<00:02:42.860> found<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.550> on<00:02:43.730> one<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
that's been found and it's on one of the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880 
that's been found and it's on one of the
helmets<00:02:44.630> for<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.990> type<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.530> helmets

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
helmets for the type and the helmets

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.250 
helmets for the type and the helmets
called<00:02:46.100> helm<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.610> st.<00:02:46.940> 14<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.810> interesting

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
called helm of st. 14 the interesting

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.720 
called helm of st. 14 the interesting
thing<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.500> when<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.920> look<00:02:49.100> at<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.280> upgrades

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
thing is when you look at the upgrades

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.730 
thing is when you look at the upgrades
and<00:02:50.510> one<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.840> upgrades<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:51.500> called

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
and one of the upgrades is called

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.040 
and one of the upgrades is called
inverse<00:02:52.250> shadows<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.270> says<00:02:53.480> increased

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
inverse shadows and it says increased

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.500 
inverse shadows and it says increased
super<00:02:54.500> energy<00:02:54.860> gained<00:02:55.190> from<00:02:55.550> killing<00:02:55.940> minions

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
super energy gained from killing minions

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.600 
super energy gained from killing minions
of<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.750> darkness<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.650> does<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.040> confirm<00:02:58.460> we

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
of the darkness so does this confirm we

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.980 
of the darkness so does this confirm we
are<00:02:58.790> going<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.030> be<00:02:59.090> fighting<00:02:59.300> at<00:02:59.690> least

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
are going to be fighting at least

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.320 
are going to be fighting at least
minions<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.710> the<00:03:00.740> darkness<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.400> if<00:03:01.820> we<00:03:02.300> are
