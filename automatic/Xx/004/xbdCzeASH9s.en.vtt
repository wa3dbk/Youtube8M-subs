anyways so back to the kanita so we're

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.070 
anyways so back to the kanita so we're
gonna<00:04:42.139> script<00:04:42.500> that<00:04:42.620> up<00:04:42.740> for<00:04:43.009> me<00:04:43.039> yes<00:04:44.020> isn't<00:04:45.020> it

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
gonna script that up for me yes isn't it

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.200 
gonna script that up for me yes isn't it
much<00:04:45.289> easier<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.740> do<00:04:45.949> this<00:04:46.039> at<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.370> end<00:04:46.400> yeah

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
much easier to do this at the end yeah

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.529 
much easier to do this at the end yeah
then<00:04:47.840> instead<00:04:48.259> of<00:04:48.470> every<00:04:49.370> half<00:04:49.759> an<00:04:49.940> hour<00:04:50.120> and

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
then instead of every half an hour and

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.210 
then instead of every half an hour and
then<00:04:50.599> skipping<00:04:51.050> up<00:04:51.289> I<00:04:51.409> think<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:52.039> same

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
then skipping up I think it's the same

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.790 
then skipping up I think it's the same
texture<00:04:52.759> right<00:04:52.970> yeah<00:04:53.419> look<00:04:54.289> at<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.470> that's

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
texture right yeah look at that that's

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.309 
texture right yeah look at that that's
beautiful

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:04.239 

you're<00:05:00.319> doing<00:05:00.529> a<00:05:00.559> great<00:05:00.769> job<00:05:02.739> is<00:05:03.739> it<00:05:03.889> hard<00:05:04.069> work

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:04.249 
you're doing a great job is it hard work

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:10.089 
you're doing a great job is it hard work
yeah<00:05:07.479> it'll<00:05:08.479> be<00:05:08.689> even<00:05:08.809> harder<00:05:08.929> work<00:05:09.439> if<00:05:09.709> ever

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
yeah it'll be even harder work if ever

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.789 
yeah it'll be even harder work if ever
you<00:05:10.279> happen<00:05:10.779> right<00:05:11.779> then<00:05:12.289> you<00:05:12.409> have<00:05:12.529> to<00:05:12.649> keep

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:12.799 
you happen right then you have to keep

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:14.349 
you happen right then you have to keep
paying<00:05:13.009> attention<00:05:13.549> to<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.759> I<00:05:13.849> think<00:05:13.879> my<00:05:14.179> ways

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:14.359 
paying attention to it I think my ways

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:16.419 
paying attention to it I think my ways
easier<00:05:14.659> by<00:05:15.559> just<00:05:15.769> putting<00:05:16.009> it<00:05:16.159> in<00:05:16.309> the

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:16.429 
easier by just putting it in the

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:19.089 
easier by just putting it in the
frigerator<00:05:16.669> and<00:05:17.389> then<00:05:18.289> we<00:05:18.469> just<00:05:18.619> do<00:05:18.769> it<00:05:18.799> at<00:05:18.949> the

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
frigerator and then we just do it at the

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.539 
frigerator and then we just do it at the
end<00:05:19.899> because<00:05:20.899> you<00:05:21.529> still<00:05:21.799> get<00:05:21.979> that<00:05:22.009> same

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:22.549 
end because you still get that same

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:27.459 
end because you still get that same
beautiful<00:05:22.969> flaky<00:05:23.599> texture<00:05:25.479> right<00:05:26.479> we're
