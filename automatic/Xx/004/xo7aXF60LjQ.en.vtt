00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 go guys if i'm talking to you diapers 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.319
 when it says something to you when 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.480
 not even but seriously 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.980
 high poe ning technology equips them 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 intel processors since at least ten 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.400
 years must be aware anyway ok 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.599
 I see like most people you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.949
 do not really know what it is 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.359
 so let me enlighten you 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.010
 let's start with an analogy is 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.869
 commonly used let's say you are 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 a processor a beautiful at the foil in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.849
 nine the blian processor will be good ben 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.800
 if you want and try trial 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.869
 it's food or like 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.149
 some people the call eat at 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 maximum you can eat east 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.329
 german what your mouth little chewed 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.980
 and can contain 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.420
 if you have more mouth you 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.969
 could eat more so 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.770
 by analogy calculate more that's it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.270
 we call the multicore good there 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.129
 assuming that only one 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.760
 mouth what's up you'll tell me that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.440
 makes sense 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.270
 I will be able to use my hand to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.730
 to eat to bring it to the mouth 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 eat and then while my mouth 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.550
 is chewing using my hand 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.870
 to take another piece but 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.250
 what happens if I finish 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.510
 machines before my hand is ready 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.190
 to give me another piece of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.420
 food has the final I want my mouth 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.010
 just wait without doing anything in it 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.150
 gilding the pill and if only I 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.590
 could use the tomorrow for 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.570
 prepare for the advanced ruptures my 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.979
 mouth even if I do not walk fast enough 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.080
 the order is obvious between each bite 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.000
 so what can I do ah yes you can 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.470
 and it's not easy 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.610
 and the task planning that makes 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.810
 your processor must still 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.259
 working and never getting 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.290
 rest 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.110
 no no to slaves slaves never do you 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.869
 rests hahahaha 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.549
 yeah perfidy is not very useful 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 on mono-core tasks that is to say 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.310
 the tasks you can work that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.540
 on one thing at a time a little 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.460
 as if you had an ice cream cone 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.689
 you can not eat the clown without 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.690
 will have eaten the balls that had known 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.980
 panacea 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.990
 and tried but it went wrong 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.550
 is there clearly no benefit of 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.380
 fight more mouth or more hands 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.650
 to keep your buddy going no more 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.270
 quick 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.340
 the poet that's the multicore tasks 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.380
 and it will be like eating a bowl of 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.750
 dragibus caught eating a diet do not 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.860
 does not depend on finishing the journey from 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.480
 find that I already have in the mud 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.100
 the excuse of friends to finish the ball 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.780
 you can clearly video in 2d 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.220
 left over tomorrow and register to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.140
 Hyperthreading can really be 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.790
 helpful but let's get back from pixels and at 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.770
 world and she the tasks that will pull 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.119
 great advantage of trading are afraid 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.850
 usually heavy tasks it's up to 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.760
 say video editing 3d modeling 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.410
 games and other multicore tasks to 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.240
 it's quite complicated take the example 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.620
 of video editing an image can be 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.310
 calculated while the next and in 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.140
 the waiting line 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.370
 the pc does not need to guess what is 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.710
 what comes after the image yet 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.570
 to be calculated he's directly a 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.590
 video is already counted another example 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.120
 maybe one of the hearts of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.130
 processor can turn all the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.210
 light applications in the background of the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.800
 skype style like firefox or so or 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.420
 things like that how 2d channels 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.970
 heart of your processor is running 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.450
 in the foreground the game you are 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.770
 playing 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.030
 you have to know that partners are only 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.130
 not included in all processors 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.360
 intel and goat how to choose if 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.580
 better buy an intel processor 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.930
 having it or not having it rock nor good 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.130
 that having fear trading is not the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.690
 all the same as doubling your 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.280
 number of hearts in your processor 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.810
 it's more like a manager who will 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.220
 succeed in organizing more efficiently 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.050
 tasks and planning things to 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.280
 to make calculate more in less time 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.010
 thanks to better management 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.180
 intel precursor of lean management that 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.100
 will also increase the power 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.660
 consumed by the processor and the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.220
 heat but the benefit in 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.540
 ball so the first thing to do 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.610
 find out about software that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.690
 you use the most but know if the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.460
 hyper threading will really bring 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.260
 something to its software in term 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.220
 of execution speed to summarize to 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.300
 see their hyper technique is better 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.610
 than not to have it but it's not 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.710
 as well as adding hearts 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.970
 physical processor brief that's all 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.740
 for this video about the breakthroughs of 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.670
 I hope you enjoyed it I hope 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.080
 that you will have learned something 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.950
 do not hesitate to share what you 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.020
 think that it can be useful to 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.820
 someone liquefied gnl who distinguish there 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.440
 if you have 10 eric and leave a 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.950
 short comment on this month thursday at 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.630
 cheo good evening that a show also divides into 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.709
 several levels the level is there that 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.850
 is almost as fast as the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.740
 registers were directly 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.510
 implemented in the processor the level 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.510
 l2 which has a speed between the level
