00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
but you can do whatever and so I'm just

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.200 
but you can do whatever and so I'm just
saying<00:00:30.029> most<00:00:30.240> people<00:00:30.539> play<00:00:30.689> halo<00:00:30.929> 2<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.769> um

saying most people play halo 2 so um

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.200 
saying most people play halo 2 so um
this<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.390> their<00:00:33.570> main<00:00:33.690> website<00:00:33.899> right<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
this is their main website right now and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.069 
this is their main website right now and
first<00:00:36.210> thing<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> probably<00:00:36.600> want<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> going

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
first thing you probably want to going

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.619 
first thing you probably want to going
to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.500> make<00:00:37.710> an<00:00:37.860> account<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.629> I'll

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to do is make an account and I'll

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
to do is make an account and I'll
actually<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> list<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> most

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
actually make like a list of the most

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
actually make like a list of the most
like<00:00:42.239> dedicated<00:00:42.750> players<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.649> have

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
like dedicated players and you can have

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.549 
like dedicated players and you can have
30<00:00:44.340> buddies<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.410> when

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
30 buddies and so you can see when

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
30 buddies and so you can see when
they're<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.399> not<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.300> guess

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
they're on in what not and so I guess

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
they're on in what not and so I guess
I'm<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> 30<00:00:49.890> most

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
dedicated players like on my list and so

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.770 
dedicated players like on my list and so
we<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.219> run<00:00:53.430> games<00:00:53.699> things<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.600> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the same network like I have my setup is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.249 
the same network like I have my setup is
my<00:01:47.340> ethernet<00:01:48.060> goes<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:48.540> xbox<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.140> my

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
my ethernet goes for my xbox to my

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.230 
my ethernet goes for my xbox to my
router<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.799> my<00:01:50.070> computer<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:50.610> router<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
router and my computer to my router and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.170 
router and my computer to my router and
so<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.439> how<00:01:52.829> mine<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.250> set<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.939> used

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
so that's how mine is set up and I used

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.230 
so that's how mine is set up and I used
to<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.570> my<00:01:55.200> xbox<00:01:56.189> Ethernet<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> my<00:01:56.969> laptop

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
to have my xbox Ethernet to my laptop

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.969 
to have my xbox Ethernet to my laptop
which<00:01:57.780> was<00:01:58.680> connected<00:01:59.240> wirelessly<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
which was connected wirelessly to the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.959 
which was connected wirelessly to the
internet<00:02:01.979> there's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> lot<00:02:02.490> there's<00:02:02.759> other

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
internet there's a lot there's other

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.209 
internet there's a lot there's other
configurations<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:03.899> those<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> ones<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
configurations but those are the ones I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.270 
configurations but those are the ones I
views<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.180> um<00:02:06.659> if<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.740> don't<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.069> those

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
views and so um if you don't have those

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.729 
views and so um if you don't have those
exactly<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.149> there<00:02:09.810> are<00:02:09.989> other<00:02:10.200> ways<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.470> do

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
exactly then there are other ways to do

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.680 
exactly then there are other ways to do
it<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.160> hopefully<00:02:11.340> everyone<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.030> find<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> way

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
it so hopefully everyone will find a way

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.430 
it so hopefully everyone will find a way
to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
