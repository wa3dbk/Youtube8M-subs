00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.440 
stuff with this
now<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.800> Grenadier<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.370> three<00:02:02.240> bursts

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
now it is a Grenadier so three bursts

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.220 
now it is a Grenadier so three bursts
see<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.960> three<00:02:03.530> bursts<00:02:03.980> each<00:02:04.760> bullet<00:02:05.230> shoots

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
see that three bursts each bullet shoots

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.710 
see that three bursts each bullet shoots
three<00:02:06.620> grenades<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.640> when<00:02:08.119> they<00:02:08.270> explode

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
three grenades and when they explode

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.670 
three grenades and when they explode
they<00:02:09.590> each<00:02:09.770> get<00:02:10.130> child<00:02:10.550> grenades<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.650> is

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
they each get child grenades so it is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.170 
they each get child grenades so it is
crazy<00:02:12.980> i<00:02:13.190> think<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:13.490> be<00:02:13.610> pretty<00:02:13.820> good<00:02:13.970> for

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
crazy i think this be pretty good for

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.790 
crazy i think this be pretty good for
like<00:02:14.270> taking<00:02:14.390> out<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> big<00:02:15.050> group<00:02:15.290> enemies<00:02:15.650> if

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
like taking out a big group enemies if

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.750 
like taking out a big group enemies if
you<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:16.130> spray<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.520> around<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.940> stuff

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
you just like spray it around and stuff

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.510 
you just like spray it around and stuff
now<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:21.050> red<00:02:21.200> text<00:02:21.530> i<00:02:21.770> love<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.250> smell<00:02:22.459> of

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
now the red text i love the smell of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.060 
now the red text i love the smell of
popcorn<00:02:22.910> in<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.480> morning<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.410> means<00:02:24.740> there's

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
popcorn in the morning it means there's

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.340 
popcorn in the morning it means there's
high<00:02:25.220> accuracy<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.790> damage<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.480> an<00:02:27.080> improved

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
high accuracy and damage and an improved

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.770 
high accuracy and damage and an improved
capacity<00:02:28.010> fires<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.030> three<00:02:29.060> grenades<00:02:29.330> at

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
capacity fires the three grenades at

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.930 
capacity fires the three grenades at
horizontal<00:02:30.560> speed<00:02:30.860> which<00:02:31.340> bounced<00:02:31.670> off<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
horizontal speed which bounced off the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.340 
horizontal speed which bounced off the
surface<00:02:32.270> twice<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.550> think<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.930> had<00:02:35.930> enough<00:02:36.110> close

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
surface twice I think I had enough close

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.020 
surface twice I think I had enough close
enough<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.770> my<00:02:36.830> mechromancer<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.790> may<00:02:37.970> be

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
enough on my mechromancer so it I may be

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.640 
enough on my mechromancer so it I may be
able<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.270> bounce<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.660> few<00:02:38.780> more<00:02:38.930> times<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.500> I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
able to bounce it a few more times but I

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.000 
able to bounce it a few more times but I
don't<00:02:39.890> know<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.190> didn't<00:02:41.000> really<00:02:41.030> test<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.020> but

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
don't know I didn't really test that but

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.850 
don't know I didn't really test that but
once<00:02:43.190> they<00:02:43.400> bounce<00:02:43.910> twice<00:02:44.150> or<00:02:44.810> hit<00:02:45.470> somebody

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
once they bounce twice or hit somebody

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.949 
once they bounce twice or hit somebody
they<00:02:46.070> explode<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.000> spawned<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.300> number<00:02:47.420> number

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
they explode and spawned a number number

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.280 
they explode and spawned a number number
of<00:02:48.230> child<00:02:48.440> grenades<00:02:48.830> which<00:02:48.980> already<00:02:49.190> told<00:02:49.640> you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
it is a Grenadier its best use of

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.289 
it is a Grenadier its best use of
short-range<00:03:13.040> even<00:03:13.519> though<00:03:13.580> it<00:03:13.670> has<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> pretty

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
short-range even though it has a pretty

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.390 
short-range even though it has a pretty
good<00:03:14.390> accuracy<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.290> accuracies<00:03:15.739> messed

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
good accuracy but that accuracies messed

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.490 
good accuracy but that accuracies messed
up<00:03:16.610> by<00:03:16.760> its<00:03:16.910> spread<00:03:17.209> since<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.600> grenades<00:03:18.320> good

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
up by its spread since the grenades good

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.390 
up by its spread since the grenades good
bounce<00:03:18.650> everywhere<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.739> spawns<00:03:22.010> child

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
bounce everywhere and it spawns child

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.270 
bounce everywhere and it spawns child
grenades<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.060> like<00:03:23.450> as<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.750> said<00:03:24.049> it's<00:03:24.680> more

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
grenades so like as I said it's more

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.250 
grenades so like as I said it's more
it's<00:03:25.880> like<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.420> know<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.600> use<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.959> for<00:03:27.079> more

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
it's like you know you use it for more

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.390 
it's like you know you use it for more
than<00:03:27.290> your<00:03:27.500> having<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.769> grenade<00:03:28.070> or<00:03:28.100> could<00:03:28.370> you

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
than your having a grenade or could you

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.280 
than your having a grenade or could you
get<00:03:28.640> like<00:03:28.810> lay<00:03:29.810> down<00:03:29.989> like<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.170> little

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
get like lay down like a little

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.110 
get like lay down like a little
minefield<00:03:30.920> use<00:03:31.250> for<00:03:31.400> crowd<00:03:31.640> control<00:03:31.670> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
minefield use for crowd control and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.440 
minefield use for crowd control and
stuff<00:03:32.450> like<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.579> since<00:03:35.090> Maya<00:03:35.299> is

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
stuff like that so since Maya is

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.479 
stuff like that so since Maya is
technically<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.049> crowd<00:03:36.500> control<00:03:36.829> character

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
technically a crowd control character

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.280 
technically a crowd control character
not<00:03:37.760> technically<00:03:38.209> she<00:03:38.390> pretty<00:03:38.540> much<00:03:38.600> is<00:03:38.840> this

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
not technically she pretty much is this

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.900 
not technically she pretty much is this
would<00:03:39.440> probably<00:03:39.530> be<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.769> good<00:03:39.829> weapon<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.700> pop

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
would probably be a good weapon to pop

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.810 
would probably be a good weapon to pop
on<00:03:41.120> her<00:03:42.370> but<00:03:44.860> here<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:45.890> go<00:03:46.100> down<00:03:46.280> its<00:03:46.519> that's

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
on her but here I go down its that's

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.220 
on her but here I go down its that's
