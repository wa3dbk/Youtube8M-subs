00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.990
 For the first time to Leverkusen comes the Höhner rockin 'Roncalli Schaub 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.750
 those in the background are running the last preparations and we want to do that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.060
 but just take a look behind the scenes with a little luck 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.889
 Henning Krautmacher is also the front man of the coach 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.889
 also native Leverkusen 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.439
 e For more than a week, 30 people have been working at the Circus Roncalli start-up 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.739
 on the show 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.630
 Time is getting scarcer in two days is more primary 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.589
 the scenes are still honed to the last costume 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.589
 discovered in the ring is on two artists at the rehearsal 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.610
 I stand by Aleks and Marko perceive 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 the two go on the show that the so-called death wheel it was not even 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.960
 percent 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.250
 how do you operate on good ideas as hobby as Toaster Spanish Eyes now 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.249
 must be unusual yet not completely harmless 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.169
 that's not a hobby is our profession and yes my referral 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.790
 Artists tested by the state with a training in Berlin 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.670
 or you thought there must be something more like it has been going on since Easter 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.370
 turn and then we have chosen an extraordinary prop 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 just the death wheel and have built that and then started again to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.440
 train between percent are quoted there 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.920
 you've done a lot already before, that's what I do for artistry 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.070
 understood correctly 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.300
 what is that effort and so would train for the death rate 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.869
 in the search when you feel there 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.039
 like the men by the eyes and in a hurry you can not be anyone 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.490
 Start small You just have to get started with the same and you have to start immediately 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.790
 without the other one 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.500
 And if you just have to overcome his fear of heights again and again 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.870
 So you can take blows like percent and you fall and you 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.390
 feels like that happens more and more normal 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.970
 the flaw that you were there when the death 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.680
 that's our plan we time 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.940
 Goal of 15 years already and until now their distribution 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.160
 that is not normal that she had to shake the mandate one stumbles is crazy 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.540
 that bothers her that that's the time it's a few sticky situation right now 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.780
 but until now everything has gone well and still exists here 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.410
 we still exist 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.520
 what is the most dangerous trickster i have death wheel 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.280
 it's not all very dangerous what they do so you always have to be very 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.149
 Being focused on the matter every day is always his best 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.070
 watch out 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.509
 because the German people also look what they do because how are they on it and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.609
 then go to the situation professionally 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:13.879
 would have moved today 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.519
 in order to make it possible that I also set up and surfaces essentially 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.500
 I can trust Traud 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.609
 sure, of course 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.579
 but there are the finances 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.579
 will say he's trying out the open los angeles 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.599
 I want to get in. I wonder if I'll be mine again 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.839
 Did not overestimate the project 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:39.190
 well that's what I want to do in federal states would be a so-called 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.190
 Eyes grew better at being organic 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.609
 what I wholeheartedly interviewees have become among the professionals like one 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:09.449
 walk 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.369
 After that, as if the guys were already well prepared for the case 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.369
 thanks not only to watch in amazement 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.349
 Finally I meet Henning Krautmacher at the tent entrance 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.809
 but who have just seen what spectacular artists and expect in 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.739
 the show, of course, belong to the very same rockin 'Roncalli show 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:30.270
 citizens 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.769
 the rock was stored 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.919
 to sign the Israeli Teva twelve players 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.979
 it did not set their first eleven followed by 9% which will become that 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.319
 Weather again nice 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.679
 play and learn ZNL's criticism 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:48.829
 "Jersey Shore," Asbeck said of the cool things Wartner naturally stopped 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.559
 Death Wheel as one of the highlights but that is allowed and I call alone there 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.839
 still quite a lot of other highlights and percent especially such highlights 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.910
 Percent that does not seem so spectacular at first 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.730
 however, the percentages are still quite different in terms of their sustainability 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.279
 are on you 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:06.649
 little things 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:10.819
 he is then keyword Rego Logo, the magic word is a human being 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.009
 at the end of the show, which does quite a lot of work and that is 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.430
 at least as exciting and beautiful and memorable 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.120
 like the death wheel 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.040
 now comes the show for the first time again it comes in a city what is 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.029
 that for a feeling 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.319
 Thank you 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.699
 Finally 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.229
 He is now, after all, oblations. Percent of fatalities is a very special one 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.789
 Stadthalle of the music of Schlebuscher Jung she the friends of 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.659

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.780

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.730

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.470
 because there but done right percent and 50 years for Kathrin 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.690
 So be Steinbichler 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.689
 Class percent 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.349
 Debug had to become very difficult to become a tradition 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.120
 how did you imagine that you can maybe there is 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.419
 a13 beginning green circus fits that together what is there exactly there twins 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.980
 the hardest thing to explain is there are people who believe 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.650
 Percent the Höhner rockin 'Roncalli show is percent of Zurich in potassium 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.710
 During the break or before or after the performance the Höhner play before the 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.120
 Tent or knows the devil is far from it so it's part of him that so 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.879
 the Höhner

 Endangered percent, we give ourselves about an all-around percent rose try us 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:24.710

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.449
 to attach to the artists the atheists this 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.229
 Percent on 4 5 cents of this tact robotics had to grab some rhythm as well 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.820
