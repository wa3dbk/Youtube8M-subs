00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:08.300
 hello friends about how to care for the 

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:10.580
 first you have to have a piece like 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.130
 this one because commonly to fish 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.900
 petals have started spherical and that 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.199
 it's not good because in it within 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.510
 the betanzos fish of emb o rosso and 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.730
 they may be blinded by interest 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:28.130
 and you can unfortunately come back 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.860
 we do not really want to have feet of 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.559
 views and plants plants for time 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.800
 so that your pc is different relaxed and 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.469
 can hide 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.800
 your water is not changed once in the 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.610
 week not every day because there are people who 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.610
 give it 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.200
 the water temperature has to be 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.790
 between 3 20 21 22 degrees centigrade 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.900
 because these prisoners come from waters 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.420
 tempered good there are also some there 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.030
 some people who come to your well 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.560
 search for water up here and 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.200
 our life 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.840
 because they evolutionarily start a 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 labyrinth where they can climb to the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.860
 surface and take oxygen and then lower 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.979
 but what happens if they fill it up 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.720
 that can cause you to die 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.939
 because they are going to have to go up 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.420
 up and then down can be hooked 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.700
 and in one of those you can upload 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.390
 not reach to get to take your oxygen 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.200
 and I can die 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.100
 feeding 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.950
 it has to be twice in the morning and 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.270
 I give myself a perfect milk 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.939
 flakes and barely 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.820
 because my dog ​​does not like 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.920
 same dogs sell a lot in the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.659
 aquariums or schools because they do not 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.770
 star if you have to put your 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.780
 name to your case what would be your decision 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.340
 which is called glup 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.160
 love his name because he looks he is 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.780
 blue here you know why the camera 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.190
 I'm taking black 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.350
 to this 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.160
 that was all I hope you liked 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.160
 and good bye
