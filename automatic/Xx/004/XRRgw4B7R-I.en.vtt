when it comes to choosing the motor oil
there<00:00:05.730> are<00:00:05.850> hundreds<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.359> choices

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.140 
when it comes to choosing a filter
there's<00:00:17.160> only<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:20.000> gram<00:00:22.669> then<00:00:23.669> as<00:00:23.849> for<00:00:24.090> the

there's only one gram then as for the
standard<00:00:24.599> Napa<00:00:28.880> this<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.059> has<00:00:30.239> 45<00:00:30.869> pleats

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.200 

it's<00:00:34.649> actually<00:00:34.980> glued<00:00:35.309> instead<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.940> metal

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it's actually glued instead of a metal

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.410 
it's actually glued instead of a metal
strip<00:00:38.870> pretty<00:00:39.870> good<00:00:40.050> amount<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.350> glue<00:00:41.420> until

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
strip pretty good amount of glue until

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.779 
strip pretty good amount of glue until
you<00:00:42.600> got<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.960> opening<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:46.859> your<00:00:47.339> bypass

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you got one opening and then your bypass

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.389 
you got one opening and then your bypass
valve<00:00:48.649> on<00:00:49.649> your<00:00:49.890> map<00:00:50.070> bus<00:00:50.339> which<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.609> a<00:00:50.789> wicks

valve on your map bus which is a wicks
slides<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> you'll<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.390> drain

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
slides in and you'll have your drain

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
slides in and you'll have your drain
back<00:00:55.140> valve<00:00:56.929> and<00:00:57.929> then<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.289> top<00:00:59.179> they<00:01:00.179> also

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
back valve and then your top they also

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
back valve and then your top they also
have<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.659> spring<00:01:01.229> that<00:01:01.409> sits<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.769> very

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
have a spring that sits on the very

have a spring that sits on the very
bottom<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.550> them<00:01:03.409> it<00:01:04.409> presses<00:01:04.800> them<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.220> like

bottom of them it presses them up I like
the<00:01:05.550> spring<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.000> lot<00:01:06.120> better<00:01:06.390> than<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.960> other

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
the spring a lot better than the other

nothing helps you do it better than the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.940 

just<00:03:04.330> seems<00:03:04.510> like<00:03:04.629> much<00:03:05.080> more<00:03:05.409> high-quality

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
just seems like much more high-quality

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.809 
just seems like much more high-quality
of<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.549> filter<00:03:06.939> the<00:03:07.629> casing<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:09.220> lot<00:03:09.549> thicker

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
of a filter the casing is a lot thicker

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.399 
of a filter the casing is a lot thicker
than<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.390> NAPA<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.780> only<00:03:13.900> thing<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.110> don't<00:03:14.170> like

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
than a NAPA the only thing I don't like

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.679 
than a NAPA the only thing I don't like
about<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.950> km<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.939> their<00:03:16.209> spring<00:03:16.540> at<00:03:16.659> the

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
about the km is their spring at the

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.960 
about the km is their spring at the
bottom<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:17.680> does<00:03:17.890> have<00:03:18.069> very<00:03:18.220> good<00:03:18.400> tension<00:03:18.670> I

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
bottom it does have very good tension I

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.190 
bottom it does have very good tension I
just<00:03:19.209> prefer<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> standard<00:03:20.049> spring<00:03:21.900> my<00:03:22.900> pass

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
just prefer a standard spring my pass

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.020 
just prefer a standard spring my pass
valve<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.860> real<00:03:24.069> similar<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.730> Napa's<00:03:28.230> yeah<00:03:30.030> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
valve is real similar to Napa's yeah the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.640 
valve is real similar to Napa's yeah the
only<00:03:31.180> thing<00:03:31.269> they're<00:03:31.629> good<00:03:31.840> for<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.200> target

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
only thing they're good for is target

00:03:32.650 --> 00:04:02.570
