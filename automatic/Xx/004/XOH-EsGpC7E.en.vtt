00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello today i will you 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.320
 present how to use the panoply 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.940
 number 16 that we released there are 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.490
 some time because we come from 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.619
 go out but change the buffer the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.630
 collection number 30 which will serve you 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.609
 to furnish the parts you have 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:26.199
 cut with what they say die on the 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:26.199
 machine our paper over the beach 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:33.230
 and the machine at the first pass is not going 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:35.440
 cut one of the parts of the form 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.440
 final 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.190
 it's now up to you to choose which 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.570
 finish where you give them choose you 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.820
 between the four possible variants 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.010
 to test no matter 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.750
 you will now place both 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.300
 small rounds of cut in both 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.460
 parts that have been cut previously 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.380
 you can evict them using a 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.440
 little spear or punch in order to 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.640
 facilitate the maneuver 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.060
 she gets inside that's it 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.690
 who will do that both parties 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.540
 match perfectly 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.170
 little trick that I do very often 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.200
 take a piece of mass type better than 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.539
 ordinary Scotch since it does not have 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.520
 torn after the paper to be sure 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:23.960
 the plate is well laid down 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:26.569
 everything goes back into the machine and 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:40.460
 this time the machine will test the 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:42.469
 second part so you get a 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.869
 logo with a good right 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:50.770
 you can also depending on what you 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:55.609
 want to get a bomb as if 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.630
 an arrow where a bomb like this 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.520
 rather jam 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.079
 now we have released the buffers 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.659
 our presence to put to you to play 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.670
 have fun with several possibilities 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.130
 buffers can be buffered have 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.010
 full with the little edges that come 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.110
 to stand on the sides or do 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.700
 the central part in full and this 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.110
 this time it's laurent who comes as 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.940
 behind I show you some 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.470
 examples that we have done here by 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.090
 example we held we complained 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.610
 inside even though it is hidden behind 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.500
 the paper you can see and that's 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.360
 the round that seems to be put behind by 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.190
 the dot tones after we had fun 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.660
 to have dropped cup and other papers 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.620
 etc. 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.930
 you can also do the opposite 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.000
 that is to say the full purr and the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.280
 little coty bombs that have been 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.480
 added to you to have fun with 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.400
 long passages of tuna plume 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.079
 clearest classics of the most 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.549
 dark but of course nothing to limit 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.829
 only your imagination 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.170
 we can also have fun with ten 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.840
 others to come put inside for 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.590
 give relief effects always of 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.590
 long passages et cetera et cetera 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.209
 no limit except your imagination 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.970
 so I told them with a single fund 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.040
 a single base you will already be able to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.750
 create four different shapes and the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.230
 thousands of different logos thanks to 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.230
 your imagination
