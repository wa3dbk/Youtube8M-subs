00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.340
 Today we come to one of the very 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.710
 nice book the art of pics by anita 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.009
 midi the foreword is by john lasseter 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.119
 written and made this beautiful book 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.210
 The publisher Chronicle Buch is a 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.760
 ramble out of the last 25 years of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.429
 pixar pixar movies are mostly the ones 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.730
 most important animated film with time 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.130
 accepted 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.190
 from the bankruptcy estate from the divorce 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.000
 Mass of george lucas has steve jobs 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.969
 which was flown out at apple at that time 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.180
 bought pixel wanted hardware first 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.420
 Selling 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.520
 but yes the hardware business with the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.149
 picturemaxx processor has not 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.739
 worth it and the pixar team has 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.949
 on the siggraph again and again 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.480
 short films shot 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.260
 Above all, we know the lamp luxury 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.359
 Here we see you this lamp that was 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.360
 then the breakthrough for pixar the then 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 yes very very strong in the film industry 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.280
 have gone in animated films 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.479
 areas in the 3d movie area were like that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.680
 strong that disney at some point pixar 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.580
 had to buy and John lasseter or jon 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.580
 lester today the chef of the creative director 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.869
 Steve has been working at Disney 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.840
 yes, yes, yes, too 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.470
 the largest single shareholder then in the board 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.229
 from disney back to the books the art 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 of pixar is a nice ramble through 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.759
 25 years of film history 25 years old pixar 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:51.450
 story started from the first 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:54.090
 pixar movie toy story to 7 25 years 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.780
 later to the last pixar films here 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.670
 is in there as the last fix pixar movie is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.409
 here cars 2 included 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.079
 it is and you can see it all here 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.990
 Clearly it is a kind of picture book 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.080
 is the storyboards the callas 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.530
 scripts mapped the movie tells 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.000
 on the basis of the pictures very very nice 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.610
 very nice you can see 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.990
 really exactly the style of the individual 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:26.209
 films here monster incorporated great 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.250
 great things you can do very well 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.989
 see how is a story at pixar 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.450
 is tells a story constructed 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.420
 and how does it become visual and visual? 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.450
 implemented 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.050
 that shows the enormous creativity like her 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.390
 brings pixar to the day and how 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.140
 different also the single pixar 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.300
 movies are 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.470
 that is very beautiful, of course 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.090
 you say 25 years forever many movies 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.769
 there are individual films from each film 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.550
 volley ab ratatouille incredibles nemo k 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:05.630
 s 1 s 2 and so on toy story 3 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.100
 yes, also a single kind of books and you often 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.050
 could say yes then I buy myself 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.660
 just this and needs the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.209
 others not no, of course, behave like that 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.500
 I had not every single book 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.829
 his special strengths very much 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.600
 wallpapers very much 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.970
 Wallpaper as very much sketches 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.950
 very many drawings from the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.890
 Of course, they are not here 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.400
 what the publisher promises us 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.600
 I have to complete the kallas scripts 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.730
 say it's a lie 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.860
 it is just a lie if you have the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.930
 you can find individual books 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.840
 other pictures you can find other kallas 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.780
 scripts that's not the complete one 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.400
 color stripped are the complete ones 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.560
 complete storyboards but in the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.340
 books there is more to me 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.010
 noticed 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.280
 because leafing through enemies finds 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.019
 nemo and jakob finding nemo who is now in 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.030
 soon will be released on blu ray 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.950
 there have to say who the publisher and 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.329
 led astray 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.350
 nevertheless it is a great book i can 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.320
 recommend it to everyone 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.900
 As I said with the films with 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.500
 the feature films and of course 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.530
 behind 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.650
 the respective shorts the respective ones 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.799
 short films also there shows the enormous 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.229
 Creativity as it fixes the day 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.560
 and yes, the competition far and wide 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:30.289
 La Luna leaves behind him the last one 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.139
 short film about our beautiful Scottish 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.680
 fairy tale what last year in the cinema 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.250
 were allowed to see 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.099
 I liked these pictures at the end 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.860
 then every one of them here too 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.090
 the chalk drawings partly the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.729
 the beatings drawings 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.150
 it is in the movie nonsense in the book 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:56.120
 no pictures to find what also 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.460
 of course the whole story of 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.330
 corresponds to Jacob 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.250
 here are just drawn pictures and 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.520
 my absolute favorite movie in the 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.979
 Drawing is the style of the red 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.379
 Devils for me a very big one 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.900
 Thrown from the sixties the design 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:17.080
 wonderfully realized in the 60s 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.479
 Let's see if I can find them right away 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.599
 Everyone in the company owns us 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.430
 favourite movie 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:27.340
 I can not say what is that 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.449
 best pixar movie graphically had yes 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.819
 incredibles liked the most 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:35.270
 but every movie as I said has, of course 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:38.150
 his own style his own world 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.460
 for me, the most interesting was the one 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.069
 incredibles but i believe that 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.590
 most famous with the most important movie for 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:49.729
 The people outside when I see my children 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.409
 Look it is the most important 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.729
 pixar movie if you like 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.770
 for me, of course, was great story 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.659
 when i saw that at the cinema 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.240
 have remained the spit away 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:05.690
 as have heard that 's all animated 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.810
 That's from the computer for me 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.870
 madness insanity here of course the 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.969
 Drawings just like the storyboard 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.539
 movie was planned as the movie made 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.940
 has been 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.810
 really great stuff so clear 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.879
 Purchase recommendation for the adolf pixar 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.729
 but we are not dealing with that 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.599
 completely kallas trips but there are 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.580
 extracts 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:32.180
 there are still books in the individual books 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.130
 It is also worth a lot to read there 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.030
 it's not a bit in the book here 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.970
 foreword by john 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.510
 but it is a picture book and so shall 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.830
 be it 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.830
 a lot of fun is worthwhile
