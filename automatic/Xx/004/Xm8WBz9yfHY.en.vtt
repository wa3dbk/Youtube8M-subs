00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.530
 one of the most amazing phenomena of quantum physics this is the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.469
 entanglement 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.090
 Entanglement means 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.090
 that two particles communicate with each other 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.869
 even if they are spatially separated 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.489
 A laser beam will be sent through a suitable crystal 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.510
 Pairs of phantom 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.590
 the two photons of a pair are deflected 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.300
 and each shot in the opposite direction 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.249
 not so that they are away from each other 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:55.019
 then they meet a measuring station and become one of the two 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.019
 measured certain property 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.260
 one measures the same property with the others 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.970
 A property that you can eat leads to the example of polarization 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.420
 a photon so its orientation 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 To do this, set polarization filter off 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.670
 this is the angle position of the filter identical to the orientation of the filter 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.720
 photons 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.640
 go through the filter by percent the green light comes on 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.609
 is the left position of the filters normal to the alignment of the photons 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.770
 So these will have to complete and the red light will shine 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.840
 the special thing is 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.250
 that the quantum theory assumes 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 that the photons do not carry the value of polarization with them 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.160
 carry 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.390
 until it is measured 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 Year that we did not exist before 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.659
 it is the same phenomenon as in the trial-and-error experiment 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.740
 even there 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.550
 the photons do not land at one point on the tecton screen 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.550
 can be predicted 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.319
 the photons themselves do not know this place 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 Vici striking 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.949
 What points it is at which they land the game coincided 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.389
 so it is with the Polaris Action Press Photo Reuters 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.799
 chance is their value 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.799
 at the moment of the fair 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 the photo itself is not known before 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.259
 that is surprising 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.669
 if both fathers are alike, the fortunes behave as well 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.349
 Either fair they either go through 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.549
 the green males ranged 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.419
 or both are not going to flash through the red lights 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:06.699
 they are mysteriously connected 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.559
 but if only chance decides 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.809
 How then knows that no entangled photons like that 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.689
 has different behavior 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.439
 is it possible that the particles somehow communicate with each other 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.790
 that one form of information from the fisherman to go to the other 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.010
 sends an occurrence 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.239
 what this behaves the same 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.810
 the decision whether the Fortunen go through the filters or not 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.810
 simultaneously 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.649
 that would mean 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:46.189
 that the information between the photons are exchanged so fast 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.019
 that would not have any time in vain 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.379
 that would require an infinitely high speed 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.870
 But this contradicts the theory of relativity 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.900
 after the the highest safety speed here is nothing fixed 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.019
 even information can 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.729
 not be transmitted faster 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.899
 even if only a few for the short distance from the first to the second photons 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:13.009
 Billionths of a second are possible 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.789
 No, it takes a while to exchange the message 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:24.289
 However, the information transfer separates from the decision 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.289
 both photons take place simultaneously 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:35.929
 another possible explanation would be that the two photons are the same 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:39.199
 Properties are born in the crystal 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.639
 in the moment in which they will emerge in the same properties 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.659
 given and behave like a pair of twins the identical genes 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.650
 have 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.680
 but also this explanation has a catch 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.860
 The Danes must find a solution for every possible situation 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.289
 ready 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.240
 for each left position of the two polarizing filters and for each of the 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.240
 For both photons, they would have to indicate whether it passes or not 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.400
 but many test series have proven 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 that these solutions do not exist 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.869
 there are no genes, the fortunes are not targets 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.080
 but what then 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.870
 the hitherto unequivocal explanation for the phenomenon 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.520
 in the entanglement 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.259
 the two photons that appear separated to us are not separated 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.779
 in truth, they form a unity 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.300
 thus a quantum system remains 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.590
 that consists of two or more particles a whole 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.259
 but even if they are far apart 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.259
 even over light years away 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.249
 this view changes our idea of â€‹â€‹space 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.360
 or from the spatial separation in principle 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:01.439
 and it shows that quantum mechanical phenomena are also on 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.469
 the historical dimensions in our everyday life 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.349
 and not limited to the smallest dimensions of nature 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:09.800
 stay
