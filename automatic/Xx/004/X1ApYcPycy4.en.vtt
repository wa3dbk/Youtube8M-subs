00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.410
 We're on our way and the man who 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.420
 is going to give his life for by is not anymore 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.279
 I'm tense but I take it as a 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.599
 release I'm going to release I feel like 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.599
 to arrive and jump 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.960
 I'm watching the little trees look 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.100
 they seem bushes no vision trees is 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.739
 a sure death 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.570
 the nerve or nothing at random anymore is always 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.710
 what I'm going to scream when I jump 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.710
 the truth 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.910

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.040
 clock 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.040
 megan josÃ© joselito left the phone 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.530
 and nothing more 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.530
 Let's go there 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.880
 to deny what is happening now I was thrown 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.409
 back what would happen because I see it very high 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.409
 the truth I see it very high 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.260
 to the souls that I want to lightning Vallecano 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.900
 so if I die the Vallecano beam will remain 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.890
 at first and that is already 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.890
 he wants them from the plane 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.780
 careful what's 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:47.240
 and it's done, it's been four seconds 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.240
 of authentic winter 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.560
 about / mounted like this 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.670
 I think he has cried but it has been 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.670
 impressive and impressive
