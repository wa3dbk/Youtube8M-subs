not<00:05:17.130> long<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:18.180> reckon<00:05:18.780> we<00:05:18.870> can<00:05:19.050> do<00:05:19.230> this<00:05:19.860> first

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
not long I reckon we can do this first

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.750 
not long I reckon we can do this first
level<00:05:21.000> because<00:05:22.070> this<00:05:23.070> was<00:05:23.250> really<00:05:23.370> easy

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
so I recommend do this without him

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.420 
so I recommend do this without him

yeah so that actually the later levels
to<00:06:45.780> get<00:06:45.990> pretty<00:06:46.260> can<00:06:47.070> get<00:06:47.220> quite<00:06:47.460> difficult

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
to get pretty can get quite difficult

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.230 
to get pretty can get quite difficult
but<00:06:48.660> like<00:06:49.230> I<00:06:49.260> said<00:06:49.500> this<00:06:49.650> first<00:06:49.950> one

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.900 
but like I said this first one
so<00:06:51.990> and<00:06:52.400> yeah<00:06:54.440> it's<00:06:55.440> a<00:06:55.560> funny<00:06:55.830> game<00:06:56.100> it's<00:06:56.520> it's

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
so and yeah it's a funny game it's it's

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.490 
so and yeah it's a funny game it's it's
a<00:06:57.060> bit<00:06:57.240> it<00:06:57.600> doesn't<00:06:57.900> take<00:06:58.050> itself<00:06:58.229> seriously

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
a bit it doesn't take itself seriously

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:08.499 
a bit it doesn't take itself seriously
it's<00:06:59.400> pretty<00:06:59.880> cool<00:07:00.090> I<00:07:00.330> like<00:07:00.990> it<00:07:01.020> I<00:07:01.259> like<00:07:01.440> it

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.080 

it's<00:07:09.509> a<00:07:09.780> classic<00:07:10.259> in<00:07:10.889> my<00:07:11.099> opinion<00:07:11.490> and<00:07:11.699> but

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
it's a classic in my opinion and but

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.550 
it's a classic in my opinion and but
like<00:07:12.419> I<00:07:12.449> said<00:07:12.690> no<00:07:12.870> one's<00:07:13.020> ever<00:07:13.139> heard<00:07:13.229> of<00:07:13.349> it<00:07:13.470> as

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
like I said no one's ever heard of it as

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.749 
like I said no one's ever heard of it as
if<00:07:13.680> you<00:07:13.770> didn't<00:07:13.919> get<00:07:14.009> home<00:07:14.160> upset<00:07:14.490> on<00:07:14.639> this

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 
if you didn't get home upset on this

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.390 
if you didn't get home upset on this
level<00:07:15.090> but<00:07:15.690> I<00:07:16.169> think<00:07:16.740> it's<00:07:16.860> probably<00:07:17.039> cuz<00:07:17.250> if

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
level but I think it's probably cuz if

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.309 
level but I think it's probably cuz if
you<00:07:17.430> do<00:07:17.669> this<00:07:17.910> stuff<00:07:18.120> in<00:07:18.210> the<00:07:18.300> fridge<00:07:18.509> first<00:07:18.870> in

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 
you do this stuff in the fridge first in

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.740 
you do this stuff in the fridge first in
the<00:07:19.500> kitchen<00:07:20.280> first<00:07:20.490> you<00:07:20.699> do<00:07:20.819> better<00:07:21.090> you<00:07:21.599> get

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
the kitchen first you do better you get

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.560
