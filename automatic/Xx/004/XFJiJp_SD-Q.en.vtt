00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
going straight try to do this with your

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.750 
going straight try to do this with your
head<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.930> drop<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.379> head<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> side<00:01:02.129> you

head just drop your head on the side you
will<00:01:02.910> realize<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.989> bike<00:01:04.199> will<00:01:04.710> turn<00:01:05.070> in

will realize that the bike will turn in

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.219 
will realize that the bike will turn in
the<00:01:05.549> direction<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> head<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the direction that's because the head is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.830 
the direction that's because the head is
really<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.189> heavy<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.330> need<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> use

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
really really heavy and we need to use

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.490 
really really heavy and we need to use
it<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.229> order<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.830> turn<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> bike<00:01:11.580> correctly

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
it in order to turn the bike correctly

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.800 
it in order to turn the bike correctly
now<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> car<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:15.509> need<00:01:15.540> to

now when we are on the car we need to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.679 
now when we are on the car we need to
try<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.409> lower<00:01:16.860> our<00:01:17.159> head<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.880> much<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
try to lower our head as much as we can

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.899 
try to lower our head as much as we can
to<00:01:18.960> lower<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.500> center<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> gravity<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.640> not

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
to lower the center of gravity and not

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.660 
to lower the center of gravity and not
do<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.090> wrong<00:01:21.420> thing<00:01:21.950> which<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> keep<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the track is the following when they get

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
the track is the following when they get
to<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> turn<00:01:49.829> let's<00:01:50.189> say<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to a turn let's say that they want to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.109 
to a turn let's say that they want to
take<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.590> left-hand<00:01:52.590> turn

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
take a left-hand turn

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.080 
take a left-hand turn
what<00:01:54.119> they<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:54.960> draw<00:01:55.740> their<00:01:56.130> body<00:01:56.490> onto

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
what they do they draw their body onto

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090 
what they do they draw their body onto
the<00:01:57.540> bike<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.710> leave<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the bike like this and they leave the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.749 
the bike like this and they leave the
head

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
head

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.240 
head
like<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.329> doing<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.070> see

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
like I'm doing right now as you can see

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.889 
like I'm doing right now as you can see
right<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.460> my<00:02:02.789> head<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.030> still<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> center

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
right now my head is still in the center

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.899 
right now my head is still in the center
of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> bank<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.340> imagine<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
of the bank but if you can imagine the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.210 
of the bank but if you can imagine the
bike<00:02:06.090> leaning<00:02:06.630> down<00:02:06.869> my<00:02:07.409> head<00:02:07.649> would<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:08.069> on

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
bike leaning down my head would be on

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.100 
bike leaning down my head would be on
the<00:02:08.340> opposite<00:02:08.729> side<00:02:09.060> than<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> direction<00:02:09.690> I'm

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the opposite side than the direction I'm

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.410 
the opposite side than the direction I'm
turning<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:11.310> means<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.819> basically<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
turning this means that basically the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.509 
turning this means that basically the
bike<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:13.019> getting<00:02:13.200> pushed<00:02:13.560> outside<00:02:13.830> by<00:02:14.340> my

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
bike is getting pushed outside by my

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.790 
bike is getting pushed outside by my
head<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> spearing<00:02:15.599> me<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.110> recipe<00:02:16.590> for<00:02:16.769> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
head and spearing me in the recipe for a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.270 
head and spearing me in the recipe for a
high<00:02:17.040> side<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.230> incorrect<00:02:19.709> I'm

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
high side so this is incorrect I'm

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.430 
high side so this is incorrect I'm
pushing<00:02:20.849> my<00:02:21.000> knee<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.480> basically<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
pushing my knee down basically but the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.920 
pushing my knee down basically but the
heavy<00:02:22.650> staying<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.250> why<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.390> head<00:02:24.569> staying

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
heavy staying up why is the head staying

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.339 
heavy staying up why is the head staying
up<00:02:25.760> well<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:27.030> an<00:02:27.150> instinct<00:02:27.630> we're<00:02:28.049> talking

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
up well it's an instinct we're talking

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.289 
up well it's an instinct we're talking
about<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.860> primordial<00:02:29.280> instinct<00:02:30.060> we're

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
about the primordial instinct we're

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.839 
about the primordial instinct we're
going<00:02:30.569> fast<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.349> our<00:02:31.560> head<00:02:31.890> wants<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> stay<00:02:32.670> as

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
going fast and our head wants to stay as

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.850 
going fast and our head wants to stay as
far<00:02:33.060> away<00:02:33.209> from<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.720> fast<00:02:33.959> moving<00:02:34.380> thing<00:02:34.620> as

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
far away from the fast moving thing as

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.449 
far away from the fast moving thing as
it<00:02:34.980> came<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:36.440> basically<00:02:37.440> our<00:02:37.560> habitants<00:02:38.430> to

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
it came so basically our habitants to

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.400 
it came so basically our habitants to
run<00:02:38.730> away<00:02:38.880> from<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> earth<00:02:39.599> spot<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.200> body

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
run away from the earth spot the body

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.020 
run away from the earth spot the body
we're<00:02:40.829> pushing<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.280> body<00:02:41.430> down<00:02:41.670> where<00:02:41.910> were

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
we're pushing the body down where were

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.780 
we're pushing the body down where were
to<00:02:42.390> shave<00:02:42.630> our<00:02:42.870> head<00:02:43.049> up<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:44.370> causes<00:02:44.760> a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
to shave our head up and that causes a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.699 
to shave our head up and that causes a
problem<00:02:45.380> now

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
problem now

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.640 
problem now
when<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.250> move<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:47.459> body<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.930> basic<00:02:49.440> thing

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
when you move your body the basic thing

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.160 
when you move your body the basic thing

they're<00:03:04.170> straight<00:03:04.859> forward<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.660> not

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
they're straight forward and that's not

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.319 
they're straight forward and that's not
the<00:03:07.109> important<00:03:07.590> thing<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:07.889> to<00:03:07.920> bend<00:03:08.519> your<00:03:09.000> arms

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
to linear body forward and again I'm

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.910 
to linear body forward and again I'm
twisting<00:03:30.569> my<00:03:30.720> spine

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
twisting my spine

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.240 
twisting my spine
that's<00:03:32.069> not<00:03:32.250> correct<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:33.330> first<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.349> all<00:03:34.470> when

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
that's not correct so first of all when

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.740 
that's not correct so first of all when
we<00:03:35.430> are<00:03:35.490> on<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.849> straightaway

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
we are on a straightaway

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.350 
we are on a straightaway
we're<00:03:37.110> down<00:03:37.380> then<00:03:38.160> like<00:03:38.520> we<00:03:38.670> said<00:03:38.910> we<00:03:39.090> need<00:03:39.239> to

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
we're down then like we said we need to

I'm not even twisting with the thing so

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.719 
I'm not even twisting with the thing so
let's<00:04:41.370> say<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.729> RAM<00:04:41.880> on<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.150> turn<00:04:42.479> I<00:04:43.400> am<00:04:44.400> leaning

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
let's say the RAM on a turn I am leaning

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.210 
let's say the RAM on a turn I am leaning
down<00:04:45.090> like<00:04:45.390> this<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:46.200> I'm<00:04:46.680> pushing<00:04:47.039> down<00:04:47.190> on

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
down like this and I'm pushing down on

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.740 
down like this and I'm pushing down on
this<00:04:47.490> trip<00:04:47.729> back<00:04:47.940> this<00:04:48.120> foot<00:04:48.330> like<00:04:48.539> like<00:04:48.720> I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
this trip back this foot like like I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.010 
this trip back this foot like like I
said<00:04:49.080> comes<00:04:49.890> loose<00:04:50.130> naturally<00:04:50.880> now<00:04:51.720> I'm

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
said comes loose naturally now I'm

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.750 
said comes loose naturally now I'm
getting<00:04:52.320> ready<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.560> open<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.130> throttle<00:04:53.280> so

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
getting ready to open the throttle so

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.340 
getting ready to open the throttle so
the<00:04:53.880> bike<00:04:54.060> will<00:04:54.330> naturally<00:04:54.479> push<00:04:55.050> wide

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
the bike will naturally push wide

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.920 
the bike will naturally push wide
because<00:04:55.800> my<00:04:56.130> Forks<00:04:56.760> extend<00:04:57.210> like<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.570> xpac

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
because my Forks extend like the xpac

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.710 
because my Forks extend like the xpac
last<00:04:58.200> time<00:04:58.440> well<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.610> open<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.180> throttle<00:05:00.390> I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
last time well I open the throttle I

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.540 
last time well I open the throttle I
drop<00:05:01.020> my<00:05:01.229> head<00:05:02.900> so<00:05:03.900> basically<00:05:04.350> in<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:05.190> moment

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
drop my head so basically in the moment

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.640 
drop my head so basically in the moment
I<00:05:05.640> make<00:05:05.820> bike<00:05:06.030> starts<00:05:06.570> going<00:05:06.930> wide<00:05:07.200> I

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
I make bike starts going wide I

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.370 
I make bike starts going wide I
compensate<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.970> going<00:05:09.270> wide<00:05:09.450> by<00:05:09.810> dropping<00:05:10.260> my

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
compensate the going wide by dropping my

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.820 
compensate the going wide by dropping my
head<00:05:10.620> further<00:05:10.979> down<00:05:11.340> that's<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.570> key<00:05:12.830> when

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
head further down that's the key when

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.730 
head further down that's the key when
when<00:05:14.789> you<00:05:14.880> are<00:05:14.940> in<00:05:15.120> an<00:05:15.240> extreme<00:05:15.660> situation<00:05:15.740> and

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
when you are in an extreme situation and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.320 
when you are in an extreme situation and
you<00:05:16.830> see<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.160> your<00:05:17.310> bike<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.729> running<00:05:17.940> wide

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
you see that your bike is running wide

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.090 
you see that your bike is running wide
do<00:05:19.320> not<00:05:19.530> panic

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
do not panic

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.400 
do not panic
do<00:05:20.250> not<00:05:20.460> chop<00:05:20.700> off<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.120> throttle<00:05:21.410> absolutely

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
do not chop off the throttle absolutely

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.300 
do not chop off the throttle absolutely
not<00:05:22.830> just

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
not just

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.160 
not just
there<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:24.880> drop<00:05:25.150> your<00:05:25.300> head<00:05:25.390> because<00:05:25.990> your

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
there and drop your head because your

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.740 
there and drop your head because your
head<00:05:26.380> changes<00:05:27.280> everything<00:05:27.970> in<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.180> geometry

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
head changes everything in the geometry

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.070 
head changes everything in the geometry
makes<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.260> bike<00:05:29.440> turn<00:05:29.740> wider<00:05:30.010> so<00:05:30.520> again<00:05:34.080> slide

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
makes the bike turn wider so again slide

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.700 
makes the bike turn wider so again slide

throttle drop my head down and then I

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.100 
throttle drop my head down and then I
can<00:05:41.590> come<00:05:41.920> back<00:05:42.040> up<00:05:42.690> same<00:05:43.690> thing<00:05:43.900> on<00:05:43.990> the

can come back up same thing on the
opposite<00:05:44.350> side<00:05:44.650> only<00:05:45.010> you<00:05:45.100> need<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.850> know

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
opposite side only you need to you know

opposite side only you need to you know
hold<00:05:46.240> on<00:05:46.390> on<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:47.020> throttle<00:05:47.440> hand<00:05:47.650> but<00:05:48.070> you're

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
hold on on the throttle hand but you're

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.720 
hold on on the throttle hand but you're
down<00:05:49.140> open<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.170> throttle<00:05:50.530> drop<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.550> head

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.330 
down open the throttle drop the head
further<00:05:52.000> down<00:05:52.560> but<00:05:53.560> this<00:05:53.710> is<00:05:53.890> the<00:05:54.130> way<00:05:54.280> the

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
further down but this is the way the

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.690 
further down but this is the way the
chair<00:05:54.610> to<00:05:54.850> do<00:05:54.970> a<00:05:55.000> remember<00:05:55.800> your<00:05:56.800> head<00:05:57.160> needs

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
chair to do a remember your head needs

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.590 
chair to do a remember your head needs
to<00:05:57.850> be<00:05:58.090> on<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.690> inside<00:05:58.840> side<00:05:59.590> of<00:05:59.860> the<00:06:00.010> bike

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
to be on the inside side of the bike

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.580 
to be on the inside side of the bike
compared<00:06:01.600> to<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.020> turn

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
compared to the turn

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.410 
compared to the turn
so<00:06:03.100> remember<00:06:03.490> and<00:06:03.640> now<00:06:03.730> the<00:06:03.790> bike<00:06:04.030> is<00:06:04.240> now

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
so remember and now the bike is now

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.850 
so remember and now the bike is now
leaning<00:06:04.630> down<00:06:04.900> because<00:06:05.230> it's<00:06:05.380> locked<00:06:05.620> on<00:06:05.830> a

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
leaning down because it's locked on a

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.580 
leaning down because it's locked on a
stand<00:06:06.190> but<00:06:06.430> if<00:06:06.970> you<00:06:07.180> do<00:06:07.330> this<00:06:07.570> my<00:06:07.930> head<00:06:08.440> is

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
stand but if you do this my head is

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.250 
stand but if you do this my head is
going<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.800> be<00:06:08.950> on<00:06:09.610> the<00:06:09.850> side<00:06:10.180> although<00:06:10.780> turning

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
going to be on the side although turning

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.090 
going to be on the side although turning
this<00:06:11.410> way<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.870> is<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.230> correct<00:06:14.590> way<00:06:14.650> to<00:06:14.800> do

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
this way this is the correct way to do

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.540 
this way this is the correct way to do
it

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
it

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.320 
it
the<00:06:16.450> like<00:06:16.810> in<00:06:17.020> Spain<00:06:17.380> your<00:06:17.560> elbow<00:06:18.330> kissa

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
the like in Spain your elbow kissa

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.990 
the like in Spain your elbow kissa
basically<00:06:20.080> this<00:06:20.770> is<00:06:20.920> what<00:06:21.100> you<00:06:21.280> want<00:06:21.460> to<00:06:21.550> do<00:06:21.700> to

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
basically this is what you want to do to

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.030 
basically this is what you want to do to
obtain<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.480> best<00:06:22.630> body<00:06:22.930> position<00:06:23.470> lower<00:06:23.680> your

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
obtain the best body position lower your

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.580 
obtain the best body position lower your
center<00:06:24.280> of<00:06:24.520> gravity<00:06:24.970> as<00:06:25.030> much<00:06:25.240> as<00:06:25.420> you<00:06:25.510> can<00:06:25.720> the

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
center of gravity as much as you can the

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.000 
center of gravity as much as you can the
Sun<00:06:26.860> can<00:06:27.130> get<00:06:27.280> extended

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.610 

so<00:06:30.640> this<00:06:31.120> is<00:06:31.360> all<00:06:31.600> as<00:06:31.990> far<00:06:32.200> as<00:06:32.380> body

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
so this is all as far as body

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.800 
so this is all as far as body
positioning<00:06:33.310> I<00:06:33.490> think<00:06:33.730> that<00:06:34.000> I'm<00:06:34.570> in<00:06:34.720> the

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
positioning I think that I'm in the

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.080 
positioning I think that I'm in the
clear<00:06:35.020> what<00:06:35.290> we're<00:06:35.440> trying<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.830> talk<00:06:36.010> about

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
clear what we're trying to talk about

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.730 
clear what we're trying to talk about
the<00:06:37.090> head<00:06:37.330> we<00:06:37.630> need<00:06:37.780> to<00:06:37.900> keep<00:06:38.080> as<00:06:38.260> low<00:06:38.470> as<00:06:38.530> we

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
the head we need to keep as low as we

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.710 
the head we need to keep as low as we
can<00:06:38.890> to<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.100> ground<00:06:39.220> I<00:06:39.760> know<00:06:40.000> that<00:06:40.300> is<00:06:40.420> scary

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
can to the ground I know that is scary

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.020 
can to the ground I know that is scary
you<00:06:41.410> know<00:06:41.470> it's<00:06:41.710> hard<00:06:42.550> to<00:06:42.670> do<00:06:42.850> at<00:06:42.940> the

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
you know it's hard to do at the

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.270 
you know it's hard to do at the
beginning<00:06:43.450> but<00:06:43.990> once<00:06:44.200> you<00:06:44.440> will<00:06:44.620> try<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:44.920> do

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
beginning but once you will try to do

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.100 
beginning but once you will try to do
this<00:06:45.490> movement<00:06:45.790> with<00:06:46.240> your<00:06:46.270> body<00:06:46.660> even<00:06:47.080> when

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
you're just doing a slight turn on the

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.920 
you're just doing a slight turn on the
street<00:06:49.090> just<00:06:50.430> mean<00:06:51.430> your<00:06:51.640> hand<00:06:51.880> into<00:06:52.150> it<00:06:52.420> you

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
will see a much more naturally the bike

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.740 
will see a much more naturally the bike
will<00:06:55.120> turn<00:06:55.360> and<00:06:56.310> yes<00:06:57.310> that's<00:06:57.550> a<00:06:57.700> remember<00:06:58.240> next

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
will turn and yes that's a remember next

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.350 
will turn and yes that's a remember next
time<00:06:58.900> the<00:06:59.050> bike<00:06:59.200> goes<00:06:59.410> wide<00:06:59.730> drop<00:07:00.730> your<00:07:00.910> head
