00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.089
 I greet you on the super dish channel 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.210
 Today I offer to cook you the most 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.730
 delicious cherry pie 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.420
 we need 400 grams of cherry 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.830
 250 grams flour 130 grams cream 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.380
 butter 4 eggs 1 tsp baking powder 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.650
 two three tablespoons of cream and 1 cup 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.650
 Sahara 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.420
 spread the softened butter 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.200
 add cream and then fall asleep all 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.480
 sugar 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.230
 if you don't have cream you can 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.250
 just replace one pack of creamy 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.110
 in the end should be 200 grams of fat 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 beat with a mixer to obtain 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.410
 homogeneous mass 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.440
 now we have to drive one by one 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.200
 an egg 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.149
 we drive 1 egg 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.149
 and mix it with mixin 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.350
 we drive in 2 eggs and continue to beat 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.650
 we do the same with the third of 4 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.650
 egg 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.509
 so the mass became liquid 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.020
 Now you need to add flour 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.640
 first mix flour with baking powder 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.640
 then through the sieve 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.690
 you 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.770
 lightly stir with a spatula so that the flour does not 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.130
 spread beyond capacity 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.590
 I pour the second part of the flour 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.200
 Now you need to beat the dough thoroughly. 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.340
 with a mixer 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:26.629
 it will not become homogeneous 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:26.629
 and the last stage of adding flour 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.710
 again well beat and get 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.900
 thick enough dough 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.180
 the dough should be thick because 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.180
 we are very juicy stuffing 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.030
 Generally this dough is very good yourself 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.950
 shows the baking process thanks 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.800
 baking powder and she raise 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.300
 and becomes porous gentle and straight 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.690
 melts in your mouth 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.720
 this dough is also called personally butter 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.690
 most butter and most eggs 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.320
 by the way with the filling can 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.440
 experiment very well 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.710
 any berries and fruits are suitable and even their 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.490
 the mixture can be used as fresh so 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.410
 and frozen 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.600
 the dough should be like this 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.290
 consistency 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.510
 I turned on the oven and set it up 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.510
 temperature of 180 degrees 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.390
 and now I spread the dough I always 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.480
 I use parchment to make it convenient 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.030
 take out the finished cake from the mold 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.220
 you can just smear the shape or 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.810
 use silicone mold and generally 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.710
 no need to lubricate 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.150
 so our baking dish is ready 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.150
 now we are filling it 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.960
 I spread the cherry in a beautiful circle 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.260
 gently then necessarily press it 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.520
 so that it penetrates as deep as possible 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.520
 then the cake will be juicier 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.590
 pushing cherries and send bake 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.280
 pie in the oven at 180 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.430
 degrees for 20-30 minutes depending on 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.229
 form volume 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.509
 well dear friends we are with you 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:31.750
 cooked the most tender and delicious 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:34.620
 cherry cake is very fragrant and very 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.620
 mouthwatering 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.849
 handsome is not it? 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:53.069
 and at the end I suggest to sprinkle our 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.099
 delicious icing sugar cake I always 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:58.400
 I use a strainer so that she 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:00.430
 spread evenly 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.430
 but 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.790
 It remains to put the kettle and call for everyone 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.720
 to the table 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.720
 have a nice tea party
