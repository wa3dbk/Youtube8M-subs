 I'm can you over there I to the pulley I Te 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.189
 In that pulley, you'll see 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.150
 Packed in a dirt bag 7 or 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:35.260

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.330
 Well Gen Tanaka 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.290
 Rat machines usually or hypo 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:57.970
 This train the training strategy of the back or that I was off to such a play 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.970
 Because I would have to go with my bare hands, I was also doing training such as grip evaluation evaluation 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.190
 It is often said that the muscles in the back will wait 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.870
 Ah 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:13.819
 That kind of martial arts or that kind of thing that punch power or something like that 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.810
 It is said that the muscles of the back are very important in order to exert the power of the moment 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:21.349
 So they have a good song and a good song 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.569
 For combat in order to manipulate freely this 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.569
 I was working hard on training for reinforcements 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.950
 Neko Nee Ryoma's back training 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.230
 In fact , it is in Ryoma-den of nhk Takawa drama 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.180
 It is one scene 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:43.560
 Probably in fact they are luck way Kedomo is Well drama 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.330
 It seems that you want to teach training , so that kind of hey rich 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.580
 I even without a barbell and money machine such, 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.910
 Such or as I Toka wood stone 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.220
 Use something like that 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.220
 They want to use something 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.720
 Beneath try the Indri 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.670
 I wonder if you'll do that together are the benefits it to train roots back in 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.000
 One eyes There are three broadly divided into 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.060
 At first it is a matter of internal pressure 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.239
 I will prevent the back of the cat and the posture will be very good 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.739
 The second 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:26.770
 You can create an inverted triangle sounding rate and it looks cool 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.800
 Even if you are wearing that dress with the back of the inverted triangle in the large back 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.040
 Wearing 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.000
 Very echo 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:37.540
 Shuetto is cool amazing eyes that line have seen is I emphasized the body 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.860
 And although three Ekore is we're the biggest 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.360
 It will be the prevention of back pain This is 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.169
 It is said that the cause of low back pain 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.279
 It is said that it originates from the imbalance of muscle strength of the abs and muscles 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:58.009
 It is proud of people who become middle aged people and so on 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:58.440
 People who are very concerned at the enemy area will do their best to restore 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.530
 that 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.370
 Abdominal muscles are expected and muscle imbalance is expected if you do not expect reinforcements, which is the cause of back pain 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.750
 Do 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.750
 So say to be the prevention of Melling back pain this soak exhaust rice is very large 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:20.469
 That's 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:24.920
 Those of salaried workers are quite busy I do not go to scrub those who do not go their own 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:32.410
 What kind of person like that would be good 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.410
 It is recommended to take a roll-up exercise using the table at the table 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:43.200
 Well, how is it actually? If you ask for the diagonal suspension of the guy at the table, that 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.320
 I think whether I have done elementary school or junior high school age or experience 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.760
 But 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.289
 In the manner of diagonal suspension 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:55.230
 That slow training 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:56.490
 I am able to make a deep tail and I will go through my back very much 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.100
 that 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:05.820
 If you say that your muscle strength is a bit weak, that 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:10.820
 There is a sufficient effect can it be asked to do while with the ass sleeping now on the floor 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.600
 Selfish say made that far in the video actually Hey Here Yes 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.600
 I thought 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:25.430
 First of all, I will put it in that table . 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.500
 Dive in and grab the end of the table 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.820
 And that 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:36.900
 In the park there's an iron dog that 's a licking dog, just like you do it 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.529
 Bending slowly I 10 Byokuri and slowly elbow body 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.990
 Pull towards the cable 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:46.620
 And 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:53.729
 As soon as you pull it close, slowly extend the elbow over 10 seconds 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:55.550
 Do not stretch the elbow completely and stop its pulling motion in front of it and move it up to the next over the food 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.540
 To 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.470
 Have 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:06.289
 I about Well 3 times because it is this or Nari it tight event um 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:09.289
 At first I think it would be nice if I could do it 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.780
 People who say it's too light put on that clothes already 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:16.170
 Ummm 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.170
 It is okay if you try to protect something or go 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.750
