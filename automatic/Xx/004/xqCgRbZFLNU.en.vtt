00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.010
 hear how it's done let's prepare a 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.930
 rich mold bread like this we see 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.090
 here in our image 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.400
 first of all let's prepare the pre 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.980
 fermented that is nothing other than 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.380
 prepare an old dough one day before 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.990
 make our bread for it 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.720
 we will need flour a little yeast 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.450
 and water and these three products we're going 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.480
 to mix all over the flour and 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.460
 we chopped our yeast a bit and what 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.460
 we mix with our flour 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.560
 then we pour the water 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.540
 you have everything at the end and 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.060
 we also mix we can start with 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.840
 a spoon and then we would go to 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.840
 do it with your hand 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.940
 then we make some folds towards the 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.140
 typical center kneaded in truth this is 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.140
 milled flame but good 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.250
 we are winning the whole line that we have 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.890
 loose and when we see that it has 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.330
 unified everything that was integrated then 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.060
 Now we can 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 save our mass first of all the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.370
 we will cover so that it does not acquire any 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.100
 type of flavor since this dough goes to the 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.409
 fridge we will have 24 hours saving 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.020
 it's been 24 hours now and then now 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.590
 We are going to prepare the mass of the mold that 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.780
 we have the salt the water yeast flour and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.150
 the old dough that we had in the fridge 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.920
 what we did the day before 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.740
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.340
 chop up our old dough and the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.880
 we incorporate in the flour 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.770
 bits 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.500
 since the dough is cold then what 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.290
 We want you to acquire more or 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.380
 less room temperature 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.870
 I also took the water from the tap 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.210
 but a little hot at the temperature 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.210
 Appropriate can be about 40 degrees 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.569
 then we mix the yeast too 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.430
 we chop all this that we have in the 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.450
 table we are simply incorporating 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.709
 we're starting it right 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.709
 we will knead 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.800
 the salt 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.340
 mixing 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.000
 and finally the water as I was saying 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.000
 drying on the hot tap 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.319
 and now we keep mixing until it 's 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.569
 all our mass is compacted and 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.140
 then we will go to the table to 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.739
 knead first we mix all the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.739
 product 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.750
 since we have it all well mixed 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.940
 let's move on to kneading 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.780
 then we do soft kneading does not 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.780
 lack of strength 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.710
 as we see here in the video as we can 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.870
 go kneading gently 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.450
 we will see that after eight or ten 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.150
 minutes our mass is going to be like 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.520
 silky that is the mass that we 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.520
 we look for a silky skin 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.970
 as we see the afterlife is taking this 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.240
 texture 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.300
 it is very soft we almost have our mass 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.670
 completed 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.870
 we follow a little bit more until we see 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.870
 that gluten does not break 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.520
 since we have it well kneaded we're going 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.560
 to let stand about 10 minutes the 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.340
 we cover with a cloth and leave it 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.040
 rest 10 minutes 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.860
 we'll see that the mass will have stayed more 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.890
 silky than previously 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.480
 here we have it then now that 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.390
 we have our prepared dough what 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.990
 let's do is with a weight to a 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.420
 balance let's make balls of about 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.760
 300 grams approximately and what 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.480
 we will move to a mold then we go 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.480
 cutting up 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.880
 and we will look to make a few balls in 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.080
 my case then they will leave me 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.629
 about 4 or 5 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.139
 the weight of each ball because in my case I 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:53.749
 they have left 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:56.840
 the four balls about 320 330 grams that 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:59.569
 work first when we release them 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.969
 what we do is wear it for it 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.990
 we press down as we see for 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:10.150
 take out all the air we make a few folds 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.150
 and then we will make a small ball 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.530
 when we have the ball we will look for 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:20.420
 give tension to our mass for it 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.420
 We press hard with one hand 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.540
 and as we see in the video 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.110
 we are generating force and tension 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.860
 and since we have it then we will pass it to 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.860
 our mold 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.429
 and so we will do all our balls 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:51.419
 since we have them we put a little bit of 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:54.029
 flour on top of our dough because 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.589
 now let's cover it and so on that 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.019
 way with the with the flour because I do not know 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:01.939
 we have left and we will have approximately 

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:01.939
 one hour resting 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.370
 between 50 and 60 minutes that is depends 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.440
 also of 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.930
 if it's winter if it's summer or the 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.810
 temperature that we have at home already 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.580
 we have then with a finger if 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.160
 we press in 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.169
 we see that the mass if it regains its state 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.880
 natural we can already say that we have 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.639
 our mass prepared to put it in 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.310
 the oven we have put the oven to 220 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:32.000
 degrees up and down we introduce 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:35.040
 our our mass and we will have it 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.440
 between 25 and 30 minutes 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.840
 watch the grill if we see that we are 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.320
 too is above before 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.490
 finish the time we remove the grill from 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.500
 above we leave it only in the 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.120
 work now we would only be left 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.190
 unmold what we have here 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.710
 disassembled and this is the end result 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.230
 It is a very rich bread for our 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.790
 breakfasts and we can put a little 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.520
 butter and jam whatever we want 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.140
 we like our videos subscribe and 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.470
 we encourage you to give to the little hand of me 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.470
 like
