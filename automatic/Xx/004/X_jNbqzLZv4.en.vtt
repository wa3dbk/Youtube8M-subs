these<00:00:03.990> are<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.500> blocks<00:00:04.680> we're<00:00:04.950> gonna<00:00:05.040> be

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
these are the blocks we're gonna be

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.150 
these are the blocks we're gonna be
using<00:00:05.810> the<00:00:06.810> first<00:00:06.839> piece<00:00:07.319> comes<00:00:07.770> down<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
using the first piece comes down in the

are<00:00:56.160> different<00:00:56.640> types<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.059> blocks<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.780> this

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
are different types of blocks and this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.670 
are different types of blocks and this
scale<00:00:58.829> helps<00:00:59.070> runners<00:01:00.440> memorize<00:01:01.440> their

blocks all right Zacks numbers our 20

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.080 
blocks all right Zacks numbers our 20
and<00:01:14.369> his<00:01:14.700> left<00:01:15.659> foot<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> 35<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.520> his<00:01:17.850> right

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and his left foot and 35 on his right

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
and his left foot and 35 on his right
foot<00:01:18.950> notice<00:01:19.950> how<00:01:20.280> his<00:01:20.430> left<00:01:20.759> leg<00:01:21.049> is<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.470> front

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
foot notice how his left leg is in front

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.880 
foot notice how his left leg is in front
of<00:01:23.009> his<00:01:23.100> right<00:01:23.340> leg

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
of his right leg

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
of his right leg
Zacks<00:01:25.890> dominant<00:01:26.490> leg<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.330> his<00:01:27.689> left<00:01:27.900> foot<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
Zacks dominant leg is his left foot and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.280 
Zacks dominant leg is his left foot and
therefore<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.909> dominant<00:01:30.329> leg<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:31.079> in

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
therefore the dominant leg will be in

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.600 
therefore the dominant leg will be in
the<00:01:31.409> front<00:01:33.290> this<00:01:34.290> will<00:01:34.470> change<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:35.430> every

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the front this will change for every

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.840 
the front this will change for every
running

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
if you have long legs your numbers going

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.280 
if you have long legs your numbers going
to<00:01:39.790> be<00:01:39.850> high<00:01:40.060> actually<00:01:40.240> back<00:01:40.690> more<00:01:40.960> if<00:01:41.170> you

to be high actually back more if you

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.150 
to be high actually back more if you
have<00:01:41.380> shorter<00:01:41.710> legs<00:01:41.860> will<00:01:42.490> be<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> front

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.940 
have shorter legs will be in the front

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
if a runner has right foot dominant then

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.240 
if a runner has right foot dominant then
the<00:01:48.100> right<00:01:48.250> side<00:01:48.460> will<00:01:48.940> be<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.180> front<00:01:50.250> that's
