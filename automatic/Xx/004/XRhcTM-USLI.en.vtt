00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 how about you guys welcome to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 configurarequipos dotcom I am an angel 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.030
 vÃ­lchez and this is the first video of 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.280
 2015 so the news could not 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.139
 be otherwise more interesting 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 that never so in the next 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.260
 minutes we will show you the most relevant 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.260
 we started 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.119
 to start the year we could not talk to you 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.279
 from other than one of the more terminals 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.169
 expected it seems 2015 we talk about the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.029
 galaxy s is this samsung 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.190
 you will see they have leaked in the network two 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.500
 images that seem to be the first 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.829
 real photographs of the new vessel 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.750
 logo that prepares samsung ls 6 in the 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.059
 two images we can see details very 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.909
 interesting to begin with we see a 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.909
 comparative of this new that 6 with its 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.949
 predecessors that is with the s 5 and the s 4 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.799
 and as we see the size of the terminal 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.439
 grows in inches with respect to them 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.659
 but if we look at the other image we see more 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.790
 interesting details although for 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.610
 start saying that there will be three models 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.009
 three color variants the color white 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.590
 silver gray and gold but something more 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.530
 interesting is that we can finally see the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.350
 expected metal housing a housing 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.750
 that has a sanding metal frame and 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.970
 which is good includes within the block 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.490
 also the metallic edges 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.010
 what's interesting is that it's very 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.080
 thin we talk about a thickness of 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.870
 we calculate no more than 5 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.330
 mmm something that was expected for 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.010
 long you know that the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.680
 launch that the presentation has 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.750
 postponed by design changes but 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.550
 that we will see it officially during the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.980
 mobile world congress so nothing 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.170
 we will be pending and we will talk to you 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.120
 we will tell more about him 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.030
 we continue with another one of the terminals more 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.590
 expected for this 2015 but today I do not 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.840
 we speak neither of a rumor nor of a 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.120
 filtering but from a tweet that has 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.150
 published qualcomm in your account 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.360
 official twitter about the flagship 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.330
 of lg we assume that it is the lg that 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.190
 4 or instead of the boss flex 2 the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.740
 evolution of the first smartphone with 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.930
 curved screen of the company what 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.720
 public qualcomm for them is that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.570
 will integrate a new component of your 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.160
 snapdragon family to 800 but we 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.040
 what really has called us the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.190
 attention is that evolution in the already 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.980
 classic and symbolic back button that 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.380
 they have the lg flagship fixed 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.660
 that with regard to axis 3 there has been 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.740
 some changes for example the button 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.620
 on and off 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.410
 happens to be round of the g3 to square 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.660
 in this terminal that publishes qualcomm 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.970
 but the most interesting thing is maybe that 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.270
 the volume buttons would happen to be 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.820
 mechanics to a touchpad something that 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.580
 tells us that the axis is working on 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.620
 evolve that component is to say the 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.480
 rear pushbutton there is another thing that we 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.550
 has drawn attention is that the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.280
 carcass material using seems 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.530
 be the same one that used the lg that flex 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.320
 a material that comes from aeronautics 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.870
 and that is capable of self-regeneration before 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.850
 scratches and scratches nothing else that yes 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.520
 this time we will not have to wait so long 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.490
 because according to the tuit this terminal already 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.530
 be the g4 walker flex 2 will be presented 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.050
 during the ces de las vegas that is 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.960
 within a few days another of the 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.120
 terminals that is highly expected but not 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.820
 It is officially marketed in 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.010
 West is the next flagship 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.110
 from yao ming as you know xiaomi has already 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.150
 become the third largest manufacturer of 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.190
 mobile of the world and that for now 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.900
 it is officially operated as we said 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.329
 in Asia well 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.390
 they have been published in the social network weibo 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.720
 two photographs of what appears to be the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.000
 tsja omni mi5 you already know that mi 3 and in 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.489
 my four have been supermentos at level 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.560
 worldwide and that has made all the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.239
 expectation within the sector center 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.829
 a lot without knowing what this will do 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.810
 manufacturer of 2015 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.019
 some realists even dare to 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.790
 say that if still and will be launched at 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.769
 world interesting thing about this terminal 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.659
 good that there will be two versions two 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.849
 black and white colors as we can see 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.590
 in the images and that the same as 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.989
 publish these photos also publishes 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.180
 some of its benefits more 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.870
 general for example that it included a 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.210
 snapdragon processor 805 3 gb ram and 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.639
 connectivity 4 that nothing else for now 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.130
 we will wait to see what happens if 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.380
 announce during the cessation or on the mobile 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.570
 world congress to finish let's change 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.449
 of third because we come to talk about 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.370
 gta 5 a game that you already know will arrive 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.169
 the next January 27 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.150
 to perfect a game that has been made 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.250
 wait but how good that for the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.680
 lifelong gamers is one of the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.050
 great releases of the year what 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.330
 with us is the possible list of 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.539
 minimum requirements to play this 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.940
 game on a pc because you already know that 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.100
 all computers can pull with 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.110
 These next - generation games or 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.660
 you know to think if your team is 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.789
 able to shoot with this title because rim 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.979
 Attentive because we are going to read the list 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.130
 of minimum requirements to make you 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.949
 com I'm going to see my chop to start 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:18.440
 we will need an intel core 2 processor 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:20.990
 duo and 8,200 or 1m of feng a 2 x 2 545 in 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.509
 about the graphics card an nvidia 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.210
 geforce gt 530 no data from your 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.830
 alternative in nobody in terms of memory 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.860
 Ram good the minimum that the 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.590
 game are 4 GB of ram memory in addition to 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.449
 20 gigabytes of hard disk space and 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.910
 as a good operating system say that 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.639
 it will only be compatible with windows 7 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.680
 onwards but if you want to play with 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.259
 all features with graphics 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.389
 butt and others you will need perhaps a 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.009
 much more powerful hardware list 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.160
 you want to know if you get to point 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:57.770
 we will need an intel corp processor 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:01.070
 2500 tea or one m 2 x 4 975 card 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.450
 graphic nvidia geforce gtx 480 or an amd 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.910
 radeon hd 6970 6 gigs of ram 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.410
 the same 20 gb of free space in 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.900
 hard drive and how not the system 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.450
 operative windows7 onwards as you see 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.850
 the list is quite demanding but already 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.190
 you know that games on pc are 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.920
 adaptable to the hardware is to say that 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.170
 the more hardware we have the more quality 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.690
 we can give in the final configuration 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.790
 so guys if you do not have these 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.370
 requirements you already know that you have to go 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.860
 starting to save and update your 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.990
 pc we leave the list of requirements 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.760
 in the link of the description nothing more 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.760
 until the next day a greeting
