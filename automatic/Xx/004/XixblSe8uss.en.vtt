like I was really you know on the fence
about<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.820> I'd<00:01:11.909> rather<00:01:12.090> summon<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> character

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
about that I'd rather summon a character

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.490 
about that I'd rather summon a character
than<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.830> wait<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:15.590> minute<00:01:16.590> ride<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:18.000> um

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
than you know wait a minute ride but um

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.140 
than you know wait a minute ride but um
so<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> always<00:01:19.890> preferred<00:01:20.369> regular<00:01:20.759> summons

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so I always preferred regular summons

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.490 
so I always preferred regular summons
but<00:01:21.570> um<00:01:22.490> today<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:24.290> confirmed<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
but um today it was confirmed that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
but um today it was confirmed that
summons<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.189> actually<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> separate<00:01:26.939> thing

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
summons are actually a separate thing

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.569 
summons are actually a separate thing
from<00:01:27.210> attraction<00:01:27.960> flow<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.770> attraction<00:01:29.400> flow

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
from attraction flow so attraction flow

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.569 
from attraction flow so attraction flow
is<00:01:29.909> not<00:01:30.240> considered<00:01:31.020> an<00:01:31.200> actual<00:01:31.890> summon<00:01:32.430> it's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
is not considered an actual summon it's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.420

the extra party member but there's no

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.410 
the extra party member but there's no
way<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.490> confirm<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:46.030> because<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.270> know<00:03:46.300> she

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
way to confirm that because you know she

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.970 
way to confirm that because you know she
can<00:03:46.600> use<00:03:46.720> her<00:03:46.750> frying<00:03:47.110> pan<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.410> then<00:03:47.650> all<00:03:47.830> her

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
can use her frying pan and then all her

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.220 
can use her frying pan and then all her
magic<00:03:48.370> based<00:03:48.550> attacks<00:03:48.700> could<00:03:49.150> be<00:03:49.209> her<00:03:49.990> hair

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
magic based attacks could be her hair

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.260 
magic based attacks could be her hair
attacks<00:03:50.590> like<00:03:50.860> Roy<00:03:51.040> Conley<00:03:51.520> sort<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.880> hinted

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
attacks like Roy Conley sort of hinted

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.840

at<00:03:52.450> or<00:03:52.630> whatever<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:54.160> that's<00:03:54.220> besides<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
at or whatever but that's besides the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.540 
at or whatever but that's besides the
point<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.209> Rapunzel<00:03:55.660> could<00:03:56.080> be<00:03:56.230> a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
point so Rapunzel could be a

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.740 
point so Rapunzel could be a
hypothetical<00:03:57.550> party<00:03:57.820> member<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.209> detangled
