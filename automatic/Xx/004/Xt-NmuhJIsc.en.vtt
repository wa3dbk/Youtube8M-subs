say two or three tablespoons that's
going<00:05:40.950> to<00:05:41.010> make<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.220> nice<00:05:41.640> a<00:05:42.980> little<00:05:43.980> bit<00:05:44.310> of

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
going to make a nice a little bit of

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.800 
going to make a nice a little bit of
crispy<00:05:44.940> finish<00:05:45.180> on<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.660> top<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:51.210> then<00:05:51.570> we

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
crispy finish on the top and then we

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.700 
crispy finish on the top and then we
stick<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.260> into<00:05:52.410> a<00:05:52.650> preheated<00:05:53.630> 375<00:05:54.710> degree

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
stick it into a preheated 375 degree

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.340 
stick it into a preheated 375 degree
oven<00:05:55.950> until<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:57.060> top<00:05:57.360> is<00:05:57.630> just<00:05:57.660> starting<00:05:58.320> to

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
oven until the top is just starting to

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.350 
oven until the top is just starting to
turn<00:05:58.650> golden<00:05:58.950> brown<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.730> juices<00:06:00.210> are

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
turn golden brown the juices are

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.470 
turn golden brown the juices are
bubbling<00:06:00.570> through<00:06:01.200> and<00:06:01.760> that<00:06:02.760> tends<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.360> be

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
bubbling through and that tends to be

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.320 
bubbling through and that tends to be
around<00:06:03.990> 35<00:06:04.920> minutes<00:06:05.490> or<00:06:05.640> so<00:06:05.910> but<00:06:06.180> you'll<00:06:06.300> just

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
around 35 minutes or so but you'll just

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.540 
around 35 minutes or so but you'll just
want<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.780> check<00:06:07.050> it<00:06:07.260> at<00:06:07.470> around<00:06:07.890> that<00:06:08.130> 20

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
want to check it at around that 20

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.110 
want to check it at around that 20
minute<00:06:08.850> mark<00:06:09.000> just<00:06:09.300> to<00:06:09.450> see<00:06:09.660> how<00:06:09.810> it's<00:06:10.020> doing

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
minute mark just to see how it's doing

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.450 
minute mark just to see how it's doing
so<00:06:12.120> you<00:06:12.690> pull<00:06:13.020> it<00:06:13.200> out<00:06:13.380> after<00:06:13.950> about<00:06:14.100> 30

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
so you pull it out after about 30

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.460 
so you pull it out after about 30
minutes<00:06:14.910> when<00:06:15.510> it's<00:06:15.660> kind<00:06:15.900> of<00:06:16.020> golden<00:06:16.350> brown

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
minutes when it's kind of golden brown

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.250 
minutes when it's kind of golden brown
on<00:06:16.800> top<00:06:16.860> and<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:18.030> juices<00:06:18.450> are<00:06:18.600> bubbling<00:06:18.780> and

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
on top and the juices are bubbling and

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.570 
on top and the juices are bubbling and
there<00:06:19.590> you<00:06:19.710> go<00:06:19.920> Wilma's<00:06:20.580> peach<00:06:20.970> cobbler
