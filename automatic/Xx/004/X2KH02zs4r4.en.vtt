seeing what humans can achieve on these
devices<00:00:50.929> so<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:51.379> think<00:00:52.039> we<00:00:52.190> can<00:00:52.309> do<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.429> lot<00:00:52.640> today

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
devices so I think we can do a lot today

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.969 
devices so I think we can do a lot today
if<00:00:53.329> picks<00:00:53.870> up<00:00:54.049> and<00:00:54.199> we're<00:00:54.289> going<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.469> blow<00:00:54.769> some

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
if picks up and we're going to blow some

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:10.170 
if picks up and we're going to blow some
minds

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.150 

the<00:01:10.750> criteria<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.320> basically<00:01:11.770> we're<00:01:12.070> looking

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
the criteria is basically we're looking

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.780 
the criteria is basically we're looking
for<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.550> figure<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.150> so<00:01:13.930> it's<00:01:14.080> 70%<00:01:14.500> height<00:01:15.460> and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
for a figure and so it's 70% height and

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.360 
for a figure and so it's 70% height and
then<00:01:16.240> there's<00:01:16.510> a<00:01:16.600> 20%<00:01:16.900> technical<00:01:17.800> difficulty

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
then there's a 20% technical difficulty

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.620 
then there's a 20% technical difficulty
that's<00:01:18.610> being<00:01:18.820> judged<00:01:19.060> we're<00:01:19.420> going<00:01:19.570> to

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
that's being judged we're going to

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.090 
that's being judged we're going to
really<00:01:19.840> look<00:01:20.080> for<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.560> guys<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.950> are<00:01:21.070> just

and every trick you see like it's
growing<00:01:50.580> step<00:01:51.000> by<00:01:51.180> stack<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.720> no<00:01:52.380> guys<00:01:52.650> are

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
growing step by stack and no guys are
pushing<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:54.000> what's<00:01:54.120> making<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
pushing it and that's what's making it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.820
