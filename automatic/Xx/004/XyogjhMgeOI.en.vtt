fantastic<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.750> way<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> dice<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.380> gone

fantastic the way the dice has gone

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.959 
fantastic the way the dice has gone
about<00:00:31.710> constructing<00:00:32.250> them<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.850> they're

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
about constructing them is that they're

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
about constructing them is that they're
very<00:00:33.030> similar<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.690> size<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> cast<00:00:34.410> importer<00:00:34.860> or

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
very similar in size to cast importer or

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.370 
very similar in size to cast importer or
operation<00:00:35.610> firestorm<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:37.079> into<00:00:37.260> this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
operation firestorm and going into this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.530 
operation firestorm and going into this
I<00:00:37.590> kind<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> assumed<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.610> meant<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.969> action

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
I kind of assumed that meant that action

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
I kind of assumed that meant that action
itself<00:00:39.870> would<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.620> little<00:00:40.890> slower<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.399> was

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
itself would be a little slower it was

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.830 
itself would be a little slower it was
going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.790> would<00:00:41.910> take<00:00:42.059> me<00:00:42.210> longer<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> get

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
going to it would take me longer to get

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.510 
going to it would take me longer to get
from<00:00:43.020> point<00:00:43.170> A<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> point<00:00:43.530> B<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.160> would<00:00:44.250> take<00:00:44.370> me

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
from point A to point B it would take me

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.790 
from point A to point B it would take me
longer<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.940> find<00:00:45.210> an<00:00:45.450> enemy<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> kill<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.590> that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
longer to find an enemy to kill but that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.490 
longer to find an enemy to kill but that
is<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.550> experienced<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.840> dice<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
is not what I experienced at all dice is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170 
is not what I experienced at all dice is
constructed<00:00:50.160> these<00:00:50.219> maps<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.670> such<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> way

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
constructed these maps in such a way

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.450 
constructed these maps in such a way
that<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.510> flowed<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.469> such<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> manner<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.219> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that they flowed in such a manner that I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000 
that they flowed in such a manner that I
always<00:00:53.940> felt<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.020> was<00:00:55.199> engaged<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
always felt like I was engaged in a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.470 
always felt like I was engaged in a
firefight<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.430> always<00:00:56.699> felt<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.329> was

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
firefight I always felt like I was

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
firefight I always felt like I was
engaged<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> battle<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> while<00:00:58.739> it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
engaged in the battle and while it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.490 
engaged in the battle and while it
wouldn't<00:00:59.670> revolve<00:01:00.120> around<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.809> capture<00:01:01.289> point

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
wouldn't revolve around a capture point

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
wouldn't revolve around a capture point
all<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> time<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> does<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.699> casting

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
all the time like it does on casting

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
all the time like it does on casting
which<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.449> usually<00:01:03.780> hilltop<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.920> in

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
which is usually hilltop it was in

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
which is usually hilltop it was in
between<00:01:05.630> objectives<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.229> was<00:01:07.350> cool

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
between objectives and what was cool

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.039 
between objectives and what was cool
about<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> felt<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.510> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
about it is that felt like I was in it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.810 
about it is that felt like I was in it
felt<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.380> i<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.590> playing<00:01:10.890> battlefield<00:01:11.549> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
felt like i was playing battlefield is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
felt like i was playing battlefield is
gonna<00:01:12.150> sound<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.540> silly<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.020> stupid

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
gonna sound a little silly and stupid

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
gonna sound a little silly and stupid
but<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:14.010> having<00:01:14.340> nostalgic<00:01:15.000> moments<00:01:15.450> on

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
but I was having nostalgic moments on

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.929 
but I was having nostalgic moments on
these<00:01:16.110> new<00:01:16.320> maps<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.130> I've<00:01:17.310> never<00:01:17.670> played

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
these new maps that I've never played

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
these new maps that I've never played
before<00:01:18.150> simply<00:01:18.720> because<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.530> felt<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.400> was

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
before simply because it felt like I was

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760 
before simply because it felt like I was
playing<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.180> battlefield<00:01:21.780> game<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
playing a battlefield game which is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.080 
playing a battlefield game which is
something<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:23.909> I've<00:01:24.060> never

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
something I have which I've never

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.749 
something I have which I've never
experienced<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.229> any<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> previous<00:01:26.310> DLCs

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
experienced on any of the previous DLCs

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.539 
experienced on any of the previous DLCs
and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> contributing

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
and I think that one of the contributing

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
and I think that one of the contributing
reasons<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> feeling<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.840> infantry

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
reasons to this feeling is that infantry

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.880 
reasons to this feeling is that infantry
and<00:01:31.950> vehicle<00:01:32.400> combat<00:01:32.610> mix<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:34.200> well<00:01:34.409> if

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and vehicle combat mix really well if

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.050 
and vehicle combat mix really well if

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
motorcycle you can do so and be really

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
motorcycle you can do so and be really
effective<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> isn't<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
effective with it but that isn't at the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
effective with it but that isn't at the
expense<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.670> infantry<00:01:44.670> combat<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.299> like

expense of infantry combat it's not like

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.539 
expense of infantry combat it's not like
everything<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.380> wide<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.189> open

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.550 
everything is really wide out and open
and<00:01:47.700> you're<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.210> sniping<00:01:48.450> infantry<00:01:49.290> left

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and you're just sniping infantry left

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.350 
and you're just sniping infantry left
and<00:01:49.710> right<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.430> way<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:50.850> designed<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and right the way that they designed the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.389 
and right the way that they designed the
maps<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.079> want<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.649> play<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.159> an

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
to objective and I never really felt

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.960 
to objective and I never really felt
like<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.380> was<00:02:07.560> out<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.099> open<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.640> exposed

capture the flag and at first I was a
little<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.709> fence<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.459> gonna<00:02:23.580> like

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
little on the fence if I was gonna like

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.180 
little on the fence if I was gonna like
it<00:02:23.910> or<00:02:24.000> not<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.900> after<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> couple<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.680> rounds<00:02:26.099> I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190

essentially what happens is that both
teams<00:02:30.480> get<00:02:30.870> really<00:02:31.230> hunker<00:02:31.470> down<00:02:31.590> they<00:02:31.980> get

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
teams get really hunker down they get

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.100 
teams get really hunker down they get
really<00:02:32.370> defensive<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.090> both<00:02:33.390> sides<00:02:33.660> kind<00:02:33.959> of

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
really defensive and both sides kind of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.869 
really defensive and both sides kind of
have<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> fortress<00:02:34.709> going<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.099> but<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.760> was

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
have a fortress going on but that was

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.070 
have a fortress going on but that was
okay<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.209> me<00:02:36.360> because<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.629> was<00:02:36.900> always

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080

don't really experience on many other of

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190 
don't really experience on many other of
the<00:02:53.610> other<00:02:53.790> game<00:02:54.120> modes<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.540> what's<00:02:54.959> cool

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the other game modes and what's cool

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.900 
the other game modes and what's cool
about<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.099> they're<00:02:56.700> always

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
about it is that the they're always

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.509 
about it is that the they're always
spawning<00:02:57.360> behind<00:02:57.870> their<00:02:58.620> flag<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.400> it's

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
spawning behind their flag and it's

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.210 
spawning behind their flag and it's
always<00:02:59.910> like<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> continuous<00:03:00.810> flow<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.220> enemies

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
always like a continuous flow of enemies

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.250 
always like a continuous flow of enemies
flowing<00:03:02.970> into<00:03:03.150> try<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> offend<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.079> there's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
flowing into try to offend it so there's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.080 
flowing into try to offend it so there's
just<00:03:04.440> continuous<00:03:05.069> action<00:03:05.280> all<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.610> time<00:03:05.910> when

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
just continuous action all the time when

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.729 
just continuous action all the time when
you're<00:03:06.120> playing<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.510> offense<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.140> another

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
you're playing on offense and another

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
people that were on the points and also

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.960 
people that were on the points and also
placing<00:03:31.380> down<00:03:31.530> spawn<00:03:31.889> beacons<00:03:32.430> because

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
placing down spawn beacons because

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.849 
placing down spawn beacons because
you're<00:03:33.120> only<00:03:33.239> one<00:03:33.690> spot<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.139> behind<00:03:34.440> your<00:03:34.680> flag

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
you're only one spot is behind your flag

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.309 
you're only one spot is behind your flag
so<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.160> always<00:03:35.639> wanted<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.569> forward

spawn with those spawn beacons it really

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.180 
spawn with those spawn beacons it really
seemed<00:03:39.569> like<00:03:39.959> all<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.319> classes<00:03:40.739> had<00:03:40.980> their

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
seemed like all the classes had their

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.059 
seemed like all the classes had their
distinct<00:03:41.579> role<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.780> was<00:03:42.989> worked<00:03:43.680> really

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
distinct role and it was worked really

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.250

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
don't seem to be as fast those things

don't seem to be as fast those things
just<00:04:10.200> fly<00:04:10.410> across<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.859> screen<00:04:11.130> but<00:04:11.819> there<00:04:11.940> are

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
just fly across the screen but there are

just fly across the screen but there are
a<00:04:12.060> lot<00:04:12.269> more<00:04:12.299> agile<00:04:13.139> you<00:04:13.380> can<00:04:13.590> turn<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> lot

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
a lot more agile you can turn a lot

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.740 
a lot more agile you can turn a lot
faster<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.760> can<00:04:14.790> pretty<00:04:14.970> much<00:04:15.060> stop<00:04:15.329> on<00:04:15.720> a

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
faster you can pretty much stop on a

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.750 
faster you can pretty much stop on a
dime<00:04:15.870> there<00:04:16.709> can<00:04:16.829> be<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.950> great<00:04:17.160> way<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.370> move

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
dime there can be a great way to move

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.810
