Charlie

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.970 

there's<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.860> point<00:03:38.220> there<00:03:39.830> there's<00:03:40.830> going

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
there's that point there there's going

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.710 
there's that point there there's going
to<00:03:41.040> be<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.190> t-shape<00:03:41.820> mark<00:03:42.210> on<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> flywheel

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
to be a t-shape mark on the flywheel

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.750 
to be a t-shape mark on the flywheel
they<00:03:43.290> have<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.620> spin<00:03:43.860> around<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.280> line<00:03:44.490> up<00:03:44.730> with

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
they have to spin around to line up with

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.120 
they have to spin around to line up with
that<00:03:44.940> point<00:03:45.500> I'll<00:03:46.500> show<00:03:46.770> what<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:46.950> looks

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
that point I'll show what that looks

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.620 
that point I'll show what that looks
like<00:03:47.460> when<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.760> find<00:03:48.090> out<00:03:48.240> what<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.570> looks

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
like when I find out what that looks

00:03:48.630 --> 00:04:09.790 
like when I find out what that looks
like

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.930 

but<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.700> closest<00:04:11.150> I've<00:04:11.330> been<00:04:11.540> able<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.840> get<00:04:12.050> it

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
but the closest I've been able to get it

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.330 
but the closest I've been able to get it
it's<00:04:13.940> about<00:04:14.560> maybe<00:04:15.560> an<00:04:15.770> eighth<00:04:15.920> of<00:04:16.130> an<00:04:16.250> inch

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
it's about maybe an eighth of an inch

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.760 
it's about maybe an eighth of an inch
off<00:04:19.330> that<00:04:20.330> should<00:04:20.630> be<00:04:20.780> ok<00:04:21.170> imagine<00:04:23.650> takes<00:04:24.650> a

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
off that should be ok imagine takes a

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.480 
off that should be ok imagine takes a
lot<00:04:24.920> of<00:04:25.010> messing<00:04:25.340> around<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.790> get<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.090> there<00:04:27.490> as

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
lot of messing around to get it there as

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.460 
lot of messing around to get it there as
a<00:04:28.550> tendency<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.210> just<00:04:29.390> keep<00:04:29.630> going<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.320> go

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
a tendency to just keep going and go

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.850 
a tendency to just keep going and go
another<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:32.240> know<00:04:32.300> few<00:04:33.290> degrees<00:04:33.440> off<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:34.310> it

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
another you know few degrees off of it

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.050 
another you know few degrees off of it
alright<00:04:36.860> well<00:04:37.010> ruin<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.490> video<00:04:37.790> of<00:04:37.910> me

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
alright well ruin the video of me

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.900 
alright well ruin the video of me
actually<00:04:39.100> adjusting<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.190> valves<00:04:40.400> already

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
actually adjusting the valves already

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.390 
actually adjusting the valves already
adjusted<00:04:41.270> they<00:04:41.860> hardly<00:04:42.860> needed<00:04:43.130> anything

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
adjusted they hardly needed anything

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.300 
adjusted they hardly needed anything
they're<00:04:43.700> just<00:04:43.970> about<00:04:44.180> perfect<00:04:44.660> as<00:04:44.810> they<00:04:44.960> were

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
they're just about perfect as they were

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.690 
they're just about perfect as they were
anyway<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.610> won't<00:04:46.760> get<00:04:46.910> your<00:04:48.430> your<00:04:49.430> feeler

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
anyway so you won't get your your feeler

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.780 
anyway so you won't get your your feeler
gauge<00:04:50.000> right<00:04:50.210> in<00:04:50.390> there<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:52.370> it's<00:04:52.520> kind<00:04:52.760> of

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
gauge right in there so it's kind of

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.320 
gauge right in there so it's kind of
hard<00:04:52.940> to<00:04:53.300> show<00:04:54.970> exactly<00:04:55.970> but<00:04:56.120> there's<00:04:56.270> a

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
hard to show exactly but there's a

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.760 
hard to show exactly but there's a
little<00:04:56.420> gap<00:04:57.460> in<00:04:58.460> there<00:04:59.390> yet<00:04:59.660> see<00:05:00.200> that<00:05:00.350> nicer

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
little gap in there yet see that nicer

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.050 
little gap in there yet see that nicer
there<00:05:00.950> right<00:05:01.880> in<00:05:02.030> their<00:05:03.490> nature<00:05:04.490> feeler<00:05:04.850> gauge

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
there right in their nature feeler gauge

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
there right in their nature feeler gauge
in<00:05:05.330> there<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.620> see<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.830> just<00:05:06.890> barely<00:05:07.340> rubs<00:05:08.080> but

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
in there and see I just barely rubs but

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.450 
in there and see I just barely rubs but
how's<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.650> both<00:05:10.100> of<00:05:10.130> them

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.170 

then

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.689 

you<00:05:20.780> loosen<00:05:21.259> off<00:05:21.380> on<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:21.919> nut<00:05:22.220> with<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.400> ten

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
you loosen off on that nut with a ten

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.950 
you loosen off on that nut with a ten
millimeter<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:25.460> once<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:25.880> loosened<00:05:26.449> off<00:05:26.600> you

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
millimeter and once I loosened off you

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.420 
millimeter and once I loosened off you
can<00:05:27.139> adjust<00:05:27.789> that<00:05:28.789> common<00:05:29.570> screwdriver<00:05:30.430> and

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
can adjust that common screwdriver and

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.249 
can adjust that common screwdriver and
then<00:05:31.550> while<00:05:31.729> holding<00:05:32.000> that<00:05:32.270> back<00:05:32.870> while

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
then while holding that back while

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.840

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
holding the screwdriver in place you

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.790 
holding the screwdriver in place you
tighten<00:05:35.180> back<00:05:35.300> up<00:05:35.600> on<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.930> nut<00:05:36.110> not<00:05:36.380> supposed

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
tighten back up on the nut not supposed
