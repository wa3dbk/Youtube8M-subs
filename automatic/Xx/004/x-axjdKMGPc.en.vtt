great all the guys and you know I think

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920 
great all the guys and you know I think
all<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> guys<00:01:29.070> are<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.930> offensively

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
all the guys are going to offensively

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.620 
all the guys are going to offensively
all<00:01:31.200> five<00:01:31.530> guys<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.159> play<00:01:32.540> offensively<00:01:33.540> I

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
all five guys can play offensively I

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.330 
all five guys can play offensively I
think<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> biggest<00:01:34.110> transition<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
think the biggest transition for all the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.300 
think the biggest transition for all the
guys<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:36.290> defensively<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:38.189> that's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
guys will be defensively I think that's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.679 
guys will be defensively I think that's
the<00:01:38.460> biggest<00:01:38.640> transition<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.600> high

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the biggest transition for a lot of high

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
the biggest transition for a lot of high
school<00:01:39.930> kids<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.009> colleges<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
school kids going to colleges on the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
school kids going to colleges on the
defensive<00:01:42.180> end<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> very<00:01:43.649> good

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
defensive end but this is a very good

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.069 
defensive end but this is a very good
offensive<00:01:44.610> class<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.689> coming<00:01:45.930> in

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
offensive class that we have coming in

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.440 
offensive class that we have coming in
guys<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.860> score<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.090> shoot<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
guys that can score that can shoot the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.200 
guys that can score that can shoot the
basketball<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.280> score<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.060> variety

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
basketball that can score in a variety

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.910 
basketball that can score in a variety
of<00:01:51.570> ways<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.649> that's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
of ways and I think that's that's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.469 
of ways and I think that's that's
important<00:01:53.430> especially<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.119> enter<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
important especially as we enter to the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.170 
important especially as we enter to the
big<00:01:54.720> east<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.740> class<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> historic

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
class because it's the first one that

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
class because it's the first one that
enters<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.340> that<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.240> playing<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
going to be a static about it so you

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.750 
going to be a static about it so you
know<00:02:51.320> you've<00:02:51.470> got<00:02:51.500> him<00:02:51.890> again<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.220> tremendous

score I think he gets under rate of his

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.140 
score I think he gets under rate of his
passing<00:02:54.860> ability<00:02:55.040> because<00:02:55.370> he<00:02:55.610> has<00:02:55.850> two<00:02:56.000> he

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
passing ability because he has two he

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.270 
passing ability because he has two he
had<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.270> score<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.660> AAU<00:02:56.900> ball<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.770> on<00:02:58.040> his<00:02:58.160> high

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
this because he used both hands so well

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.610 
this because he used both hands so well
his<00:05:25.250> left<00:05:25.490> hand<00:05:25.729> and<00:05:25.909> his<00:05:26.569> right<00:05:26.599> and<00:05:27.080> that's
