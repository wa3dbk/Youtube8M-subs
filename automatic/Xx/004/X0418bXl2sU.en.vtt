00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
set it down that way I'm not you know

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.819 
set it down that way I'm not you know
getting<00:02:04.950> woken<00:02:05.189> up<00:02:05.430> by<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.360> looks<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.600> a

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
getting woken up by what looks like a

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.889 
getting woken up by what looks like a
air-raid<00:02:07.829> alert<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> ceiling

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.390 
air-raid alert going off on the ceiling
with<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.890> don't<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> worry<00:02:11.310> about

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
with this I don't have to worry about

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.620 
with this I don't have to worry about
the<00:02:12.360> screen

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
the screen

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.380 
the screen
touching<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.550> table<00:02:15.550> or<00:02:15.790> anything<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.300> I'm

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
touching the table or anything that I'm

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.410 
touching the table or anything that I'm
setting<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.720> down<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:18.940> nice<00:02:19.150> thing

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
setting it down on one of the nice thing

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.570 
setting it down on one of the nice thing
about<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.750> case<00:02:20.020> is<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.920> corners<00:02:21.430> are

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
about this case is the corners are

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.030 
about this case is the corners are
completely<00:02:22.120> wrapped<00:02:22.390> around<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.560> typically

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
completely wrapped around so typically

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.490 
completely wrapped around so typically
when<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.400> drop<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> smartphone<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:26.260> if<00:02:26.380> you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
when you drop a smartphone and if you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.960 
when you drop a smartphone and if you
look<00:02:26.620> at<00:02:26.740> any<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.950> these<00:02:27.070> drop<00:02:27.490> tests<00:02:27.760> you'll

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
look at any of these drop tests you'll

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.640 
look at any of these drop tests you'll
see<00:02:28.150> if<00:02:28.300> we<00:02:28.420> often<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.780> land<00:02:28.960> on<00:02:29.050> their<00:02:29.230> corners

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
see if we often to land on their corners

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.030 
see if we often to land on their corners
and<00:02:29.950> hopefully<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:30.670> will<00:02:30.910> help<00:02:31.080> absorb<00:02:32.080> some

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
and hopefully this will help absorb some

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.940 
and hopefully this will help absorb some
of<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.190> shock<00:02:33.490> hair<00:02:33.880> now<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.690> case<00:02:34.960> is<00:02:35.170> fairly

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
of the shock hair now the case is fairly

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.270 
of the shock hair now the case is fairly
easy<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.520> put<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.150> take<00:02:37.480> off<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:38.140> little<00:02:39.130> bit

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
easy to put on and take off a little bit

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.340 
easy to put on and take off a little bit
of<00:02:39.400> pressure<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.060> corner<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.900> can<00:02:41.050> snap<00:02:41.320> it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
of pressure in a corner you can snap it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.030 
of pressure in a corner you can snap it
off<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:43.770> if<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.830> slot<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.520> volume<00:02:45.820> rocker

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
off and if you slot in the volume rocker

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.010 
off and if you slot in the volume rocker
it'll<00:02:48.040> snap<00:02:48.280> right<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.270> that's<00:02:49.750> another

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
it'll snap right in so that's another

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.350 
it'll snap right in so that's another
