to style keeping hair extensions

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.960 
to style keeping hair extensions
I've<00:00:04.259> already<00:00:04.529> got<00:00:04.799> mine<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.009> obviously<00:00:05.700> and

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
I've already got mine in obviously and

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.760 
I've already got mine in obviously and
if<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.600> want<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.870> see<00:00:07.020> how<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> put<00:00:07.470> them<00:00:07.649> in

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
if you want to see how to put them in

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.980 
if you want to see how to put them in
I've<00:00:07.950> done<00:00:08.099> another<00:00:08.309> video<00:00:08.490> previously<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.510> put

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
I've done another video previously I put

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.499 
I've done another video previously I put
them<00:00:10.110> into<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.500> then<00:00:11.130> though<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:12.030> think<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
them into that then though I think the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.330 
them into that then though I think the
best<00:00:12.660> way<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.900> start<00:00:13.290> convinced<00:00:13.830> because<00:00:14.070> you

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
best way to start convinced because you

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.430 
best way to start convinced because you
do<00:00:14.549> tend<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> get<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.269> bit<00:00:15.480> which<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.170> to

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
do tend to get to this bit which is to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.080 
do tend to get to this bit which is to
have<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> little<00:00:16.830> bit<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.160> volume<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.730> some

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
have a little bit of volume and some

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.000 
have a little bit of volume and some
power<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.810> rather<00:00:19.109> than<00:00:19.260> dead<00:00:19.680> straight

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
power going on rather than dead straight

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.010 
power going on rather than dead straight
so<00:00:20.580> let's<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.029> back<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> start<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.840> I'll

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
so let's go back to the start and I'll

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.259 
so let's go back to the start and I'll
show<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.230> what<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> did<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:23.939> your<00:00:24.060> real

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269

show you what I did so as with your real
hair<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.689> you're<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.050> using<00:00:25.439> any

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
hair if you're going to be using any

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.679 
hair if you're going to be using any
kind<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> heated<00:00:26.519> hair<00:00:26.820> tool<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.510> need<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
kind of heated hair tool you need to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
kind of heated hair tool you need to
make<00:00:27.810> sure<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.140> protect<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.619> hair<00:00:28.830> fast<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
make sure you protect your hair fast and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.550 
make sure you protect your hair fast and
real<00:00:30.359> hair<00:00:30.599> extensions<00:00:31.080> tend<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.439> quite

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
real hair extensions tend to be quite

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290 
real hair extensions tend to be quite
expensive<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.430> well<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> want<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> make

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
expensive as well so you want to make

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.209 
expensive as well so you want to make
sure<00:00:33.329> you're<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.170> damaging<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.800> every<00:00:35.040> time

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
sure you're not damaging them every time

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.119 
sure you're not damaging them every time
I<00:00:35.250> star<00:00:35.579> them<00:00:35.760> I'm<00:00:36.480> using<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> v-fib<00:00:37.380> protect

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I star them I'm using the v-fib protect

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.220 
I star them I'm using the v-fib protect
and<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.210> see<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.510> spritz<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and as you can see I just spritz that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.470 
and as you can see I just spritz that
all<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:40.800> through<00:00:41.040> length<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.700> through

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
all the way through length and through

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.520 
all the way through length and through
the<00:00:42.690> hair<00:00:42.870> extensions<00:00:43.379> as<00:00:43.559> well<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.379> I'm

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
taking my tongs and just creating really

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:58.279 
taking my tongs and just creating really
really<00:00:49.020> nice<00:00:49.260> waves<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.030> around<00:00:57.289> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
really nice waves all the way around and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
really nice waves all the way around and
then<00:00:58.500> once<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.859> finished<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.370> just<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
then once I'm finished I'm just going to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.689 
then once I'm finished I'm just going to
run<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.780> fingers<00:01:01.020> through<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:02.340> reg'ment

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.330 

and<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.530> might<00:01:07.800> find<00:01:07.980> with<00:01:08.160> your

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980 
and what you might find with your
extensions<00:01:08.820> especially<00:01:09.300> if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.480> start<00:01:09.630> them

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
extensions especially if you start them

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200 
extensions especially if you start them
quite<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.230> few<00:01:10.470> times<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.980> you<00:01:11.460> don't<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.790> quite

quite a few times is you don't get quite
the<00:01:12.240> same<00:01:12.630> machine<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.470> had<00:01:13.650> when<00:01:13.830> they're

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
the same machine as you had when they're

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.560 
the same machine as you had when they're
brand<00:01:14.130> new<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:14.940> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.180> run<00:01:15.330> through<00:01:15.510> a

brand new so I'm going to run through a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
brand new so I'm going to run through a
little<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.020> serum<00:01:16.410> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> Tony<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
little bit of serum this is a Tony a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.730 
little bit of serum this is a Tony a
guy's<00:01:17.760> shine<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:18.270> zero<00:01:21.350> just<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.410> few<00:01:22.620> drops

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
guy's shine back zero just a few drops

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.280 
guy's shine back zero just a few drops
into<00:01:23.220> pants<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.730> hands<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:26.930> really<00:01:27.930> really

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
into pants my hands just really really

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.000 
into pants my hands just really really
lightly

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
lightly

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.100 
lightly
it<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:29.970> best<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> add<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.660> bit<00:01:30.900> more

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it was best to add all this bit more

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.990 
it was best to add all this bit more
rather<00:01:31.380> than<00:01:31.620> put<00:01:31.830> too<00:01:32.010> much<00:01:32.160> on<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.940> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
rather than put too much on in the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500 
rather than put too much on in the
beginning

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
beginning

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.610 
beginning
so<00:01:35.510> what<00:01:35.660> we<00:01:35.750> really<00:01:35.990> try<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.200> do<00:01:36.410> with<00:01:36.530> the

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
so what we really try to do with the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.370 
so what we really try to do with the
style<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.250> just<00:01:37.570> disguise<00:01:38.570> these<00:01:38.930> ridges<00:01:39.350> here

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
style is just disguise these ridges here

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.020 
style is just disguise these ridges here
by<00:01:39.680> adding<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:40.040> little<00:01:40.190> bit<00:01:40.370> of<00:01:40.550> volume<00:01:40.760> and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
by adding a little bit of volume and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.110 
by adding a little bit of volume and
texture<00:01:41.360> rather<00:01:41.990> than<00:01:42.320> other<00:01:42.470> thing<00:01:42.740> too<00:01:43.520> wild

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
texture rather than other thing too wild

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.910 
texture rather than other thing too wild
it's<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:44.570> really<00:01:44.780> sick<00:01:45.080> it's<00:01:45.380> not<00:01:45.530> super

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
it's just really sick it's not super

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.100 
it's just really sick it's not super
straight<00:01:46.190> so<00:01:47.120> if<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.300> wanted<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.690> add<00:01:47.840> a

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
straight so if you wanted to add a
