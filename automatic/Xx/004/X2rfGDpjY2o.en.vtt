00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.570
 well today I'll spheres paper or 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.670
 creative cardboard these I got them in 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.020
 a supermarket and I thought they were great 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.020
 to share with you 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.450
 here are several samples worth here we go 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.869
 to open a hole in the center and in 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.500
 each corner of each cardboard strip or 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.900
 cardboard tape 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.050
 We have a 15 cm wire 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.050
 long 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.579
 some paper stars 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.579
 or cardboard 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.390
 They can be big size two centimeters 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.160
 and a half or a half centimeter 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.160
 sphere of various sizes and colors 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.690
 an ornament 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.960
 13 small transparent spheres several 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.320
 spheres and some little glitter ornaments 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.020
 as well 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.240
 let's use a clamp to bend and 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.240
 cut the wire this one had to husband 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.240
 well we started we grabbed the wire and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.320
 we bend the tip in a circle of this 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.540
 shape 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.540
 How to make an arito is worth it 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.690
 we are going to place a sphere and a 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.690
 cardboard star 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.470
 ok now let's place the cardboard 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.610
 15 centimeters wide by 30 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.810
 centimeters long 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.810
 let's place 3 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.800
 then we will place the cards 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.420
 2 centimeters wide by 30 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.110
 centimeters long we're also going to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.110
 place 3 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.650
 thus 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.810
 now we are going to place 13 spheres 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.940
 small transparent ones that are the ones 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.479
 they will give the body to our sphere 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.479
 of paper 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.020
 well so she will give us the height 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.590
 necessary for our Christmas sphere 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.740
 then now let's grab a ribbon 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.740
 of cardboard or cardboard strip in the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.540
 points where we open the holes we're going 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.540
 to place it on the wire 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.960
 and the same strip of cardboard or ribbon 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.540
 cardboard the other end we put the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.780
 tip also in this way 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.329
 and so on with the other two 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.329
 remaining cards of the same model 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:10.830
 we will always go from the first to the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.690
 last we have in the group is worth 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.690
 well in this way we are already giving 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.620
 shape our sphere so now we go with 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.620
 the other three strips 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.920
 we will accommodate it in this way between 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.920
 the two between two strips of the previous 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.520
 We put the wire through the tip where 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.270
 is the hole drilled 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.020
 and from the same tape or from the same strip 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.020
 the other extreme 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.640
 and so we're going to do with the other two 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.000
 remaining strips 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.900
 we put the ends of the same strip of 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 one end and the other 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.530
 and here we have the shape of the sphere 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.810
 so it's going to be left 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.060
 now let's give them 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.970
 the last details let's put the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.420
 loop we place the strip of one centimeter 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.160
 by 30 centimeters in this way 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.410
 like resembling a tie 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.750
 we put in the center 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.510
 then we drill a point after the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.680
 another and so we have left now we are going to 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.030
 place the cardboard star and two 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.849
 large spheres 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.150
 and a little smaller 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:46.120
 ok we cut with our tweezers 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.390
 and we bend in a circle we squeeze 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.560
 so that the sphere does not come out 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.540
 and here we have our paper sphere 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.610
 in other countries it is said ball of 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.919
 Christmas here we can have it 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.730
 in our little tree or in a decoration 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.730
 at home 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.470
 I placed it on a cherry 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.200
 here you have another model 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.330
 and here you have another model 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.220
 as you happen to buy the cards 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.960
 that you want what you want to design 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.960
 to the measurements and make your spheres 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.810
 I hope you liked it if you liked it
