how to work out what size lawn Bowl to
use<00:00:08.660> now<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.719> would've<00:00:10.260> heard<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.559> few

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
use now you would've heard this a few

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.320 
use now you would've heard this a few
times<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> little<00:00:11.940> bit<00:00:12.030> tricky

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
times and it is a little bit tricky

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.509 
times and it is a little bit tricky
sometimes<00:00:12.540> most<00:00:13.530> bowlers<00:00:13.799> go<00:00:14.070> out<00:00:14.250> there<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
sometimes most bowlers go out there and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.770 
sometimes most bowlers go out there and
buy<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.670> biggest<00:00:14.969> bowl<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:15.599> hold

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
buy the biggest bowl they can hold

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.970 
buy the biggest bowl they can hold
because<00:00:16.080> they<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.590> they're<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
because they think that they're going to

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.410 
because they think that they're going to
have<00:00:17.100> an<00:00:17.220> advantage<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> bowl<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
have an advantage with the bowl in the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.179 
have an advantage with the bowl in the
wind<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.260> hold<00:00:19.439> us<00:00:19.560> line<00:00:19.740> better<00:00:20.010> or

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
wind it's kind of hold us line better or

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.290 
wind it's kind of hold us line better or
it's<00:00:20.340> not<00:00:20.400> going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.670> move<00:00:20.760> around<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.270> much

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
it's not going to move around as much

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.349

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
can do that and you can hold it upside

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.000 
can do that and you can hold it upside
down<00:02:40.099> gently<00:02:40.750> key<00:02:41.750> word<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.200> gently<00:02:42.680> because

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
down gently key word is gently because

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.199

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
you're squeezing it the tension runs

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.380 
you're squeezing it the tension runs
through<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.340> ligaments<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.819> tendons<00:02:46.910> in

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
your arm and you're going to be

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.580 
your arm and you're going to be
inconsistent<00:02:49.310> with<00:02:49.549> weight<00:02:49.930> right<00:02:50.930> most

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
inconsistent with weight right most

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.390 
inconsistent with weight right most
important<00:02:51.920> thing<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.100> this<00:02:52.220> comes

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
important thing is this comes

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.420 
important thing is this comes
consistency<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.299> weight<00:02:53.690> control<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.739> go

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
consistency it is weight control so I go

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.370 
consistency it is weight control so I go
for<00:02:55.609> a<00:02:55.670> smaller<00:02:56.030> Bowl<00:02:56.329> if<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:56.959> can<00:02:57.079> hold<00:02:57.260> it

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.420 
right the best thing you can do with
sizing<00:03:18.169> up<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.440> hold<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.709> bowl<00:03:18.859> upside<00:03:19.040> down

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
sizing up is hold the bowl upside down

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.490 
sizing up is hold the bowl upside down
and<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.299> can<00:03:20.450> try<00:03:20.599> different<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.079> know<00:03:21.169> try<00:03:21.470> a

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
and you can try different you know try a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.470 
and you can try different you know try a
few<00:03:21.709> different<00:03:22.040> sets<00:03:22.220> go<00:03:22.489> out<00:03:22.639> there<00:03:22.849> have<00:03:23.180> ten

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
few different sets go out there have ten

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.120 
few different sets go out there have ten
ends<00:03:23.720> whatever<00:03:24.470> feels<00:03:24.739> more<00:03:24.919> comfortable

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130

it's<00:03:40.489> obviously<00:03:40.790> going<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.060> take<00:03:41.120> some<00:03:41.389> more

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480
