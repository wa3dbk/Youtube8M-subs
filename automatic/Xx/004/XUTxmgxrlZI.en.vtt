00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.870
 I welcome you with love thank you very much 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.429
 I welcome you with glory to God Amen 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.429
 you eat first 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.260
 I eat later 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.950
 glory to god to life me equally 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.950
 glory god 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.060
 the foundation is born of the spirit of several 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.430
 people in sharing humanity of the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.720
 hand of a panela water and a bread 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.720
 a language of love 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.700
 at the moment that each school of 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.620
 distribute a little love and joy 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:00.390
 here and wait for someday things 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.390
 they remain in Caracas 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.720
 the motivation is basically transforming 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 the reality the reality of our 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.010
 city ​​the reality of the inhabitant of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.270
 streets the reality of their stigmatization 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.180
 of his prejudices of the lack of love 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.720
 who live daily and then to panelists 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.470
 at 10 o'clock at night with much joke 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.440
 it's a cashier flavor here since I do not 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.350
 forget one do not forget it because the bread and 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.110
 panela water is let's call it an excuse 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.600
 or a means to give love to 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.970
 street dweller I think this work 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.980
 contributes to peace starting from the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.460
 inclusion not seeing the inhabitant of 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.640
 street as a problem but as the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.430
 as a consequence of drug trafficking and 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.780
 the micro-traffic in the city although the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.729
 social now as a problem I do not 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.430
 they see it as a problem but they do not see the way 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.130
 of life as a problem will not change 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.850
 well but if we can accompany them such 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.720
 once also having in hand and 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.240
 helping them get out of the problem of 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.220
 drug addiction and returning them to 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.520
 integrate society because it is not 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.070
 it is only to take away the drug but 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.290
 also give them a trade that is in the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.120
 society are important are also 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.430
 people who are trained to do 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.460
 any position the training 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.790
 we are going bad 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.790
 it is one when selfishness exists 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.110
 they are 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.290
 and we reach in what we feel I think that 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.390
 the world needs people who love what 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.060
 what they do and I think those of us here 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.269
 we do this with too much love and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.909
 too much solidarity and I think that's 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.209
 what the world needs that at the end of 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.209
 peace
