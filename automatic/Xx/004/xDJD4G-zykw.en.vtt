think<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.470> before<00:01:10.680> move<00:01:11.100> left<00:01:11.729> trigger

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
think of this before move left trigger

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.580 
think of this before move left trigger
and<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:12.360> trigger<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:13.020> correspond<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and right trigger now correspond to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.030 
and right trigger now correspond to
Spidey's<00:01:13.920> left<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.220> right<00:01:14.340> hands<00:01:16.009> like<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
Spidey's left and right hands like that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859 
Spidey's left and right hands like that

on the left

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.780 
on the left
use<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> left<00:01:19.799> trigger<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> latch<00:01:20.490> onto<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
use the left trigger when I latch onto a

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.830 
use the left trigger when I latch onto a
building<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> right<00:01:21.360> use<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> right

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
building on the right use the right

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.649 
building on the right use the right
trigger<00:01:22.020> flip<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:24.030> there's<00:01:24.210> no<00:01:24.330> building

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
trigger flip and if there's no building

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.300 
trigger flip and if there's no building
around<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.080> nothing<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> attach<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.950> well
