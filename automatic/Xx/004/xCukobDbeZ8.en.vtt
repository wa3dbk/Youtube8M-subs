the<00:03:50.000> worst<00:03:50.450> video<00:03:50.780> on<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.230> channel<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.799> I'm

ironic title that's sarcasm because the

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.229 
ironic title that's sarcasm because the
whole<00:04:09.110> idea<00:04:09.140> was<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.920> was<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.250> prank<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:11.000> was

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
whole idea was it was a prank that was

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.780 
whole idea was it was a prank that was
set<00:04:11.480> up<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.630> be<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.959> failed<00:04:12.290> prank<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:12.950> then

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
set up to be a failed prank and then

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.550 
set up to be a failed prank and then
there's<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.090> lot<00:04:14.299> of<00:04:14.329> wasted<00:04:15.019> time<00:04:15.049> within<00:04:15.440> the

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560

one person sends that video to another

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.130 
one person sends that video to another
person<00:04:22.669> then<00:04:23.180> that<00:04:23.210> kind<00:04:23.599> of<00:04:23.630> makes<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.960> like
