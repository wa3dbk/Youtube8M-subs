00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
going to be able to interpret it in a

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.630 
going to be able to interpret it in a
really<00:02:37.850> good<00:02:38.060> way<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:39.310> another<00:02:40.310> piece<00:02:40.610> that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
really good way and another piece that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.370 
really good way and another piece that
we've<00:02:40.880> been<00:02:41.000> working<00:02:41.060> our<00:02:41.480> way<00:02:41.540> for<00:02:41.870> some<00:02:42.140> time
