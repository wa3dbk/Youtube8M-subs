00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:08.870
 hello, let's make these decorative pineapples 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.640
 to hang on our tree for that 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.100
 we are going to need some pineapples that we have 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.710
 picked up here so close the washing the 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.480
 drying and now we are going to paint them with 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.360
 acrylic paint let's make one of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.280
 each color to make four models not 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.070
 help daniela this time is like 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.470
 You see I take the paint with a brush or 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.210
 we are placing like this 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.039
 I'm going to put the paint in 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.780
 inside the pineapple so it looks good 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.100
 you can do it only by the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.930
 part of outside if you want 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.149
 and well let's spend a little time here 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.600
 painting pineapples on paper 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.600
 Newspaper 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.680
 and make several colors in light green in 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 White 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.820
 in dark green 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.550
 and the golden 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.100
 Well now that we have them days 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.329
 I'm going to make decorations for the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.670
 top part I'm going to do the four 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.710
 different for the first one with a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 die-cutter in the shape of a star or 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.790
 you do not remember a few stars 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.280
 double so that it looks on both sides 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.280
 well I'm going to hit two sides 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 and worked to place on the pineapple 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.180
 golden in this case 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.479
 You see, I'm going to talk the little points towards 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.479
 down 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.120
 you have to hit the ends well I do not 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.120
 I've pasted them well 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.869
 and I paste them I'm using as you see 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.240
 a silicone gun to go more 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.829
 fast because it dries very quickly but with 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.600
 any type of glue you can 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.820
 do now I'm going to do a little hole in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.219
 the means to pass the string with which 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.109
 let's fasten our ornament alarte yo 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.969
 I have this cord cited gold you can 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.820
 put any transparent thread or and what 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:54.979
 normal a piece of wool what you have 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.960
 I'm going to pass the two bits the two 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.790
 ends to make a knot that is 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.200
 from the inside 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.200
 here and so you will not see 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.860
 and we would stay to hang 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.140
 with this enough size more or less 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.959
 with this scourge was with the gun of 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.609
 silicone your glue we are going to paste 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.099
 is asleep at the top of the 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.379
 pineapple as if it were a cluster of 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.530
 uruguay we press well until it 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.090
 dry and ready we have our adornment 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.040
 maybe here you have to use a 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.480
 strong glue but as I tell you a 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.359
 silicone gun or serves 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.359
 perfectly for oven number 2 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.050
 pick up also a glossy paper and I'll 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.050
 to draw a few leaves 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.480
 that I'm going to cut out with silver in this 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.430
 case to make several models I'm going to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.690
 cut the two in two because then 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.690
 I'm going to stick the two sides 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.370
 I'm going to do it with a serrated scissors 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.500
 like the sheet form and those to do 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.780
 lake directly if you do not draw it is 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.480
 as you have seen cut two by two 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.700
 so that when I paste it, I was exactly 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.060
 and I'm going to make several sheets 4 or 5 now 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.060
 we will see 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.750
 the two pieces better first and now 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.750
 cut 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.400
 You can also do it with a scissor 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.110
 normal and make these triangles 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.239
 optionally to simulate in the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.470
 holly but a few smooth leaves too 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.630
 they can serve us 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.970
 thus preparing my cord with the knot 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.730
 same as before to be able to hang up and what 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.580
 placed in the pineapple in this case 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.959
 and I will be placing the sheets so that 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.599
 have a little bit of volume I'm going to 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.640
 fold them in half to half 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.270
 nothing more along and I do them this 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.950
 small double 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.580
 just like the normal leaves are a 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.930
 little rotated a little bent and the part 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.060
 from behind the one that is not bent I'll 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.620
 cut it a little 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.300
 to leave it flat which is the part that 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.110
 dance up the pineapple 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.180
 Now, with the silicone, we stick it 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.650
 we are gluing one on top of another 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.140
 are a little bit overlapped are very 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.740
 juntitas 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.740
 you see 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:14.099
 silicone advice because it dries very 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:14.099
 fast and hits very well pretty strong 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.940
 is ready seen a better sheet and 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.940
 last I will tell 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.300
 well here we have our second 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.940
 ornament 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.110
 and we go with the third the ornament number 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.110
 3 for our life 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.960
 in this case I will use cardboard 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.030
 green 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.830
 I'm going to hit one against the other to 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.410
 do the forms in this case I'm going to 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.389
 make a circle that will give for both 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.449
 sides because put bright paper by 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.449
 the two sides 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.419
 I make a circle of 24 centimeters 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.409
 diameter more or less and now without getting 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.900
 until the center I will be doing 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:57.539
 baseball flequitos cutting small 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.490
 rays without reaching the center because 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.340
 if they would not fall 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.330
 It's very easy like that, like some 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.129
 fringes 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.370
 that once folded will be very 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.590
 pretty on the pineapple 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.110
 you see in the central part is uncut 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.760
 I fold the fringes down or some 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.980
 up if you want 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.090
 and I paste it we put our cord cited 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.090
 as always and we stick it 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.230
 in this case as it covers all the part of 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.540
 above the pineapple we will make a little hole 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.610
 in the adornment and we will pass our cord 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.500
 here 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.950
 as before you pass it first and then to 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:38.370
 that book whatever it is more comfortable 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.110
 and we paste it for the ornament number 4 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.910
 I'm going to do the same color with red 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.770
 I'll double again 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.129
 and I stick it 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.520
 and now I'm going to make some smooth sheets 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.520
 As before 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.180
 I will place on my pineapple folding the 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.500
 in half baby as before throughout 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.500
 the series side to the hook 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.110
 Well once placed the string 

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:18.699
 milestone as always was placing the 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.699
 objects as well as you see down 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.490
 it's another idea and a very easy way 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.490
 also to decorate the pineapple 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.860
 so we would almost have our room here 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.349
 adornment ready 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.420
 to place on the tree here are 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.310
 our four pineapples 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.490
 You can do them all the same and you're in 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.020
 the tree or colors as you want you see 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.580
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.590
 do not forget to visit the web to see 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.330
 other ideas today there is no cole dot and 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.920
 Here I leave you a couple with the crackers and 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.750
 a Christmas wreath also made with 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.680
