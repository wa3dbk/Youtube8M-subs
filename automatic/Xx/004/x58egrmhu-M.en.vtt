00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.460
 tour 5 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.989
 hello you on channel for 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.540
 lattice and re-watch the transfer of top 5 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.219
 remind for all being visitors 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.469
 our group in contact you can 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.539
 detect at the beginning of each week 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.210
 voting in which you choose 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:41.219
 heroes of each release and today we have 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:50.070
 the best game in the genre of survival fifth 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:52.890
 place developed by an independent studio 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.440
 space punch and play times famous for being 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.200
 has become one of the best selling games in 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.899
 incentive because she bought more than 1 million 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.730
 players in just a month and by no means 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.040
 just because it was developed 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.259
 Gary Newman who once created 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.600
 garry's mod 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.310
 but rather due to the fact that will put 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.609
 players in a harsh survival 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.289
 where is a stone hit on the head or a shot at 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.959
 back completely normal 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.539
 which make survival in this world still 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:26.359
 more difficult and dangerous for what to play 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.359
 gets top 5 openings 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.229
 fourth place 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.550
 probably every lover of indie games 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.590
 tried released last year dan 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.630
 start whose main purpose is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.060
 surviving the unusual and pretty 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.520
 the intimidating world of some maxwell that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.650
 locks us in him as the game is in progress 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.930
 a hero which by the way will be somewhat 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.520
 do all that survival helps 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.920
 and to survive in this world is not so easy 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.290
 after nightfall darkness thickens 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.330
 above us and only fire will be weak 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.970
 hope for dying away under the yoke 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.070
 terrible creatures of reason apparently therefore 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.289
 our subscribers and awarded so 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.289
 unusual game fourth place in the top 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.890
 3rd place 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.500
 deep forest released recently in 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.020
 early access steam and even from the very first 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.480
 trailers were breathtaking because wild forest 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.680
 which is inhabited by natives cannibals that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.710
 with great pleasure a treat 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.300
 the main character is not a place to rest in it 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.330
 need to constantly survive 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.010
 seek food kill or be killed what 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.960
 obviously not make you sit still 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.960
 constantly looking at every rustle 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.940
 that can only presage trouble and here 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:59.530
 on such pleasant thoughts, we give the game 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:59.530
 third place second place 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.200
 rather unusual what's certain 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.630
 record holder in the genre Survival minekravt 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.550
 Only ranked second but maybe 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.430
 that a few years after the appearance 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.470
 online brainchild of Marcus person somebody yes 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.720
 tired though watch the trends 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.000
 game development and themes that mahjong studio 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.010
 you bought microsoft unwittingly think that 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.560
 the game will be quite long 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.210
 life because even our subscribers 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.210
 identified her in second place in the top 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.810
 first place 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.980
 I think no one would be surprised to hear that 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.680
 jay-z is the best live game as well as not 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.410
 I was surprised because initially she was only 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.210
 amateur mods for arma 2 which 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.950
 very quickly found popularity with 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.710
 players subsequently becoming 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.540
 independent game in which to this 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.610
 a day to play a lot of people 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.860
 and this despite the fact that the game is still 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.120
 requires major refinement and indeed 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.130
 at least go to release 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.470
 but none the less prevented her 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.050
 look up from all other games 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.050
 and take gold first place 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:25.980
 here 5 on this I have all thanks for
