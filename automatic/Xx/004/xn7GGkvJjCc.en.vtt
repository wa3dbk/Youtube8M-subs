00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.469 
this one here what do we do you hit the
start<00:01:44.759> button<00:01:45.079> that's<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.320> press<00:01:46.500> go<00:01:47.479> you

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
start button that's it just press go you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.910 
start button that's it just press go you
press<00:01:48.689> collection<00:01:49.079> press<00:01:49.229> close<00:01:49.439> second<00:01:49.740> time

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
press collection press close second time

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.320 
press collection press close second time
mm-hmm

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
mm-hmm

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.580 
mm-hmm
and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.140> burning<00:01:52.440> right<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and it's burning right and this is this

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.220 
and it's burning right and this is this
has<00:01:55.800> about<00:01:56.310> eleven<00:01:56.790> minutes<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.120> music<00:01:57.240> mm<00:01:57.960> so

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
has about eleven minutes of music mm so

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.160 
has about eleven minutes of music mm so
this<00:01:59.190> will<00:01:59.400> probably<00:01:59.610> take<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.720> media<00:02:01.020> we

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
this will probably take the media we

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.830 
this will probably take the media we
have<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.470> here<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.370> sort<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.480> in<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.660> middle

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
have in here is is sort of in the middle

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
have in here is is sort of in the middle
so<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.140> should<00:02:04.290> burn<00:02:04.470> in<00:02:04.680> about<00:02:04.770> 30<00:02:05.250> seconds

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so this should burn in about 30 seconds

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.790 
so this should burn in about 30 seconds
yeah<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:07.230> of<00:02:07.260> bands<00:02:07.740> who

the<00:02:19.320> beauty<00:02:19.650> about<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:20.040> machine<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.580> that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
the beauty about this machine is that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.760 
the beauty about this machine is that
you<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.150> continue<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.720> use<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:22.140> as<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.560> goes

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
you can continue to use this as it goes

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.390 
you can continue to use this as it goes
as<00:02:23.160> quick<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.660> most<00:02:25.560> duplicators<00:02:26.220> come

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
as quick and the most duplicators come

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.190 
as quick and the most duplicators come
with<00:02:26.520> one<00:02:26.670> fan<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.420> all<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.780> neurons<00:02:28.050> or
