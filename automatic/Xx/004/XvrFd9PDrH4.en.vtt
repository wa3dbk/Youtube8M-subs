00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:06.300
 hello today we are going to present from tech 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.220
 nautas the technology section of 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.769
 confidential the new device 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.920
 blackberry the cv 10 at the beginning of the year 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.480
 the technology announced the z10 that is a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.060
 phone that clearly supports the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.230
 screen and the touch keyboard but has not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.089
 wanted to forget about those users 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.409
 who prefer a physical keyboard what 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.539
 first that draws attention nothing more 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.669
 hold the blackberry phone is your 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.710
 any design that has put special 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.839
 attention the company the phone more 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.780
 similar it has in the market is the 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.730
 q5 let's say it's the lower-end one is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.090
 higher however the two have the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.260
 Same size 3.1 inch screen 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.750
 and yet they have practically the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.050
 same thickness and width of weight walk 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.690
 also a bit like that 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.840
 the cv 10 we see that we have here in the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.980
 right part the volume buttons 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.579
 up we have the on and off 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.999
 and the headphone input 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.990
 and microUSB and micro hdmi input by 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:03.150
 below we now have the speaker 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.070
 unlike many phones that do not 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.220
 can be opened for example change 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.180
 the battery q 10 can be opened from a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.670
 very simple way 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.470
 simply pressing with your fingers 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.020
 inside we will see that they have the battery 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.630
 that you can easily be the entrance 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.270
 for the sim card and the entry for 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.310
 microsd card up we have the camera 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.500
 of photos and the flash place the casing 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.150
 it's very simple, you just have to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.730
 finger press 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.500
 if we compare it with the z10 we will see that 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.540
 the differences are also pretty 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.340
 obvious the phone that he presented to 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.740
 early in the year blackberry is a lot 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.530
 highest has the entire touch screen 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.210
 with touch keyboard although the thickness is 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 practically the same we will see that all 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.070
 its sides practically coincide with 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.630
 the same inputs the weight however 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.520
 I would dare say that maybe it's a 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.230
 little older to turn on the device 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.550
 so just press the button 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.220
 ignition placed on top 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.380
 and move the screen of your finger 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 unlocking we will find the interface 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.940
 of the operating system user of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.280
 Blackberry is exactly the same as 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.210
 used in this workshop so that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.810
 inside does not change anything 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.360
 we have the services they offer us 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.910
 messaging service notifications of 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.340
 Blackberry calls different utilities 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.670
 if we move by light by the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.170
 right we will have the main menu and if 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.120
 we keep moving around all the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.080
 applications that the system has 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.640
 operative 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.200
 if we want to enter any of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.550
 them how can the watch be 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.170
 example 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.270
 it's just we have to push on the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.820
 icon and move around the different 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.470
 units if we want to go back to the menu 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.020
 not only do we have to move 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.420
 up the finger and handle us in 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.420
 another such as time 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.580
 photo camera of q 10 has 8 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.670
 megapixels exactly like the z10 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.470
 but more than the q5 that only has 5 for 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.080
 access to it we have to go to 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.760
 utilities we have an access here 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.890
 right here on this button 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.689
 to take any photo simply 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.680
 you have to press the screen we have a 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:11.530
 shooting mode 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.459
 that focuses on faces and allows you to shoot 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.459
 many times 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.400
 and choose the photo that interests us most 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.579
 once we have made any 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.500
 photography we can retouch the with 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.230
 different tools and templates to 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.390
 instagram style like for example the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.180
 that we have old sepia loin defect 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.360
 that we have others, even adjust the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.150
 Shine or crop the photo 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.740
 we also have other utilities that we 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.050
 shows this other browser how to rotate 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.430
 the photo edit it or share it 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.090
 different social networks also the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.280
 we can eliminate 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.830
 to go back to the main menu just 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.319
 we have to move the finger and go back to 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.180
 manage by the different pages that 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.430
 we have another user interface in 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.470
 the utilities that the widget incorporates 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.910
 it's blackberry balance a tool 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.299
 that creates two profiles one for the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.310
 work and another for personal use 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.360
 blackberrymessenger and blackberrys 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.250
 remember what helps to manage 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.140
 quickly in the tasks thanks to a 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.370
 new way of collecting organize and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.440
 use all the information of 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.600
 device 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.280
 in short the q 10 is a good 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.340
 alternative to z10 for those who 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.720
 prefer the physical keyboard on your mobile 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.249
 and also incorporates the operating system 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.259
 last of the company 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.519
 In short this has been all for 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.239
 techniques we will see in the next 

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:35.239
 presentation
