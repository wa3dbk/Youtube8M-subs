more than I wanted to I think all
shipped<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.390> done<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.900> was<00:02:34.190> 94<00:02:35.190> dollars

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
shipped and done it was 94 dollars

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.960 
shipped and done it was 94 dollars
shipped<00:02:35.910> from<00:02:36.060> Japan<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:38.069> this<00:02:38.370> box<00:02:38.579> is<00:02:38.790> pretty

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
shipped from Japan so this box is pretty

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.180 
shipped from Japan so this box is pretty
cool<00:02:39.239> it's<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.079> gonna<00:02:40.319> live<00:02:40.530> its<00:02:40.709> life<00:02:40.799> in<00:02:41.069> my

cool it's just gonna live its life in my

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.120 
cool it's just gonna live its life in my
closet<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> time<00:02:42.060> being

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.120 

so<00:02:48.820> let<00:02:49.030> me<00:02:49.060> crack<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.600> controller<00:02:50.350> open<00:02:50.800> and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
so let me crack this controller open and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.580 
so let me crack this controller open and
I'll<00:02:51.250> show<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.550> what<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.060> inside<00:02:52.630> looks<00:02:52.660> like

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.210 

okay<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:56.670> here<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.510> case<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.740> I've<00:02:59.920> gone

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
okay so here is the case and I've gone

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.770 
okay so here is the case and I've gone
ahead<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.640> removed<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.930> six<00:03:02.650> little<00:03:03.100> screws

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
ahead and removed the six little screws

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.990 
ahead and removed the six little screws
that<00:03:04.780> are<00:03:05.110> holding<00:03:05.610> this<00:03:06.610> thing<00:03:06.850> together

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
that are holding this thing together

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.290 
that are holding this thing together
there's<00:03:07.480> two<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.140> front<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:09.060> then<00:03:10.060> there's

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
there's two up front and then there's

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.580 
there's two up front and then there's
four<00:03:11.290> out<00:03:11.620> back<00:03:11.980> here<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.570> they're<00:03:14.050> diagonal

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
four out back here so they're diagonal

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.080 
four out back here so they're diagonal
right<00:03:14.800> here<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:15.250> then<00:03:15.520> it<00:03:15.700> has<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.880> little

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
right here and then it has a little

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.450 
right here and then it has a little
grommet<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.660> holds<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.200> cable<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.590> place<00:03:17.740> go

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
grommet that holds the cable in place go

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.900 
grommet that holds the cable in place go
ahead<00:03:18.490> and<00:03:18.880> remove<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.520> said<00:03:21.760> before

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
ahead and remove that like I said before

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.390 
ahead and remove that like I said before
I'm<00:03:22.330> not<00:03:22.570> too<00:03:22.900> happy<00:03:23.200> with<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.740> response<00:03:24.070> of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
I'm not too happy with the response of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.990 
I'm not too happy with the response of
the<00:03:24.520> buttons

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
the buttons

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.360 
the buttons
I<00:03:25.120> think<00:03:25.930> there's<00:03:26.170> nicer<00:03:26.650> buttons<00:03:26.980> out<00:03:27.160> there

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
I think there's nicer buttons out there

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.690 
I think there's nicer buttons out there
that<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:28.120> know<00:03:28.770> will<00:03:29.770> conform<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.490> color

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
that you know will conform to the color

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.850 
that you know will conform to the color
palette<00:03:30.970> here<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.600> I<00:03:31.630> could<00:03:31.720> just<00:03:32.380> drop<00:03:32.620> in

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
palette here that I could just drop in

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.590 
palette here that I could just drop in
an<00:03:33.610> easily<00:03:34.060> replace<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:37.150> let<00:03:37.270> me<00:03:37.360> show<00:03:37.540> you

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
an easily replace so let me show you

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.040 
an easily replace so let me show you
this<00:03:37.810> here's<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.800> bottom<00:03:39.130> panel<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:40.020> has<00:03:41.020> a

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
this here's the bottom panel that has a

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.990 
this here's the bottom panel that has a
little<00:03:41.320> bit<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.560> rust<00:03:41.830> on<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.100> now<00:03:42.820> I've<00:03:42.970> uh

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
little bit of rust on it now I've uh

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.780 
little bit of rust on it now I've uh
I've<00:03:43.570> restored<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.410> bunch<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.740> coin<00:03:45.040> doors<00:03:45.400> for

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
I've restored a bunch of coin doors for

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.470 
I've restored a bunch of coin doors for
arcade<00:03:46.150> machines<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:48.180> usually<00:03:49.180> what<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.390> like

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
arcade machines and usually what I like

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.260 
arcade machines and usually what I like
to<00:03:49.900> do<00:03:50.020> is<00:03:50.200> powder<00:03:50.470> coat<00:03:50.830> metal<00:03:51.220> parts<00:03:51.550> but

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
to do is powder coat metal parts but

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.180 
to do is powder coat metal parts but
seeing<00:03:52.570> as<00:03:52.780> it's<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.530> bottom<00:03:53.890> area

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
seeing as it's just the bottom area

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.180 
seeing as it's just the bottom area
that's<00:03:54.430> affected<00:03:54.550> and<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:56.470> could<00:03:56.830> do<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:56.950> pretty

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
that's affected and I could do a pretty

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.100 
that's affected and I could do a pretty
good<00:03:57.310> job

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
good job

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.750 
good job
priming<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.200> painting<00:03:59.470> I'm<00:04:00.190> just<00:04:00.460> gonna<00:04:00.550> go

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
priming and painting I'm just gonna go

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.020 
priming and painting I'm just gonna go
that<00:04:00.940> route<00:04:02.310> there's<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.400> little<00:04:03.640> bit<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.790> rust

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
that route there's a little bit of rust

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.120 
that route there's a little bit of rust
but<00:04:04.240> it's<00:04:04.660> not<00:04:04.840> in<00:04:04.960> bad<00:04:05.080> shape

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.040 

so<00:04:11.130> with<00:04:11.250> this<00:04:11.430> piece<00:04:14.510> let<00:04:15.510> me<00:04:15.600> show<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.870> how

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.050 
so with this piece let me show you how

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.760 
so with this piece let me show you how
this<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.410> set<00:04:16.560> up<00:04:17.180> they<00:04:18.180> have<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.420> PCB<00:04:19.260> here

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
this is set up they have the PCB here

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.740 
this is set up they have the PCB here
which<00:04:19.950> has<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.160> little<00:04:20.370> microcontroller<00:04:21.330> and

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
which has a little microcontroller and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.290 
which has a little microcontroller and
it<00:04:22.710> looks<00:04:22.920> like<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.280> controls<00:04:23.940> all<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
it looks like it controls all the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.420 
it looks like it controls all the
functions<00:04:24.750> from<00:04:25.020> these<00:04:25.200> this<00:04:25.740> little<00:04:26.010> turbo

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
functions from these this little turbo

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.260 
functions from these this little turbo
board<00:04:26.730> which<00:04:27.510> snaps<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.230> of<00:04:28.350> place<00:04:29.270> it's

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
board which snaps out of place it's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.880 
board which snaps out of place it's
really<00:04:30.330> in<00:04:30.690> there<00:04:30.810> there<00:04:31.590> we<00:04:31.680> go<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.890> this

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
really in there there we go so this this

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.530 
really in there there we go so this this
little<00:04:35.100> board<00:04:35.460> just<00:04:35.700> controls<00:04:36.210> all<00:04:36.510> the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
little board just controls all the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.350 
little board just controls all the
little<00:04:37.020> turbo<00:04:37.740> functions<00:04:41.000> sits<00:04:42.000> right<00:04:42.210> in

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
little turbo functions sits right in

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.530 
little turbo functions sits right in
there<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:43.130> then<00:04:44.130> it<00:04:44.280> also<00:04:44.430> like<00:04:45.390> I<00:04:45.510> said

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
there and then it also like I said

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.870 
there and then it also like I said
before<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.470> soldered<00:04:46.770> directly<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.730> each

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
before it's soldered directly to each

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.290 
before it's soldered directly to each
button<00:04:48.360> lead<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.460> which<00:04:50.460> i<00:04:50.640> think<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:50.970> kind<00:04:51.210> of

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
button lead and which i think is kind of

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.660 
button lead and which i think is kind of
ridiculous<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:52.050> know<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.380> could<00:04:53.130> see<00:04:53.310> why<00:04:53.460> they

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
ridiculous you know I could see why they

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.520 
ridiculous you know I could see why they
did<00:04:53.880> that<00:04:54.060> rather<00:04:54.330> than<00:04:54.630> having<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.080> wire<00:04:55.290> up

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
did that rather than having to wire up

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.410 
did that rather than having to wire up
the<00:04:55.710> additional<00:04:56.190> wires<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.850> then<00:04:56.940> making<00:04:57.240> a

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
the additional wires and then making a

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.420 
the additional wires and then making a
little<00:04:57.600> harness<00:04:57.840> just<00:04:58.230> soldering<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.310> the

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
little harness just soldering it to the

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.630 
little harness just soldering it to the
PCB<00:04:59.870> you<00:05:00.870> know<00:05:01.040> it's<00:05:02.040> really<00:05:02.280> simple<00:05:02.750> well<00:05:03.750> I

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
PCB you know it's really simple well I

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.340 
PCB you know it's really simple well I
already<00:05:05.640> took<00:05:06.000> them<00:05:06.180> apart<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:06.870> actually

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
already took them apart and actually

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.250 
already took them apart and actually
cleaned<00:05:07.680> them<00:05:07.830> with<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.040> plastic<00:05:08.670> cleaner

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
cleaned them with a plastic cleaner

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.670 
cleaned them with a plastic cleaner
called<00:05:10.260> Novus<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.660> they<00:05:12.660> shined<00:05:12.990> up<00:05:13.110> really

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
called Novus and they shined up really

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.860 
called Novus and they shined up really
nice<00:05:13.860> here<00:05:14.220> let's<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.120> see<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.450> reflection

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
nice here let's you see that reflection

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.230 
nice here let's you see that reflection
so<00:05:16.680> it's<00:05:16.830> pretty<00:05:17.040> good<00:05:17.190> I<00:05:17.250> also<00:05:17.430> worked<00:05:17.970> on<00:05:18.090> the

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
so it's pretty good I also worked on the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.580 
so it's pretty good I also worked on the
ball<00:05:18.390> top<00:05:18.660> too

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.090 

but<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.250> overall<00:05:23.580> I'm<00:05:23.850> very<00:05:24.030> happy<00:05:24.870> with<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.100> I

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
but so overall I'm very happy with it I

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.090 
but so overall I'm very happy with it I
actually<00:05:26.610> had<00:05:27.200> overpaid<00:05:28.200> on<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.530> shipping<00:05:28.830> by

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
actually had overpaid on the shipping by

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.030 
actually had overpaid on the shipping by
twenty<00:05:29.460> dollars<00:05:30.410> that<00:05:31.410> left<00:05:31.620> me<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.770> little

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
twenty dollars that left me a little

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.110 
twenty dollars that left me a little
bummed<00:05:32.220> but<00:05:32.550> you<00:05:33.360> know<00:05:33.830> for<00:05:34.880> something<00:05:35.880> that's

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
bummed but you know for something that's

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.480 
bummed but you know for something that's
as<00:05:36.300> rare<00:05:36.540> as<00:05:36.750> this<00:05:36.960> in<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.290> United<00:05:37.680> States<00:05:37.980> and

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
as rare as this in the United States and

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.390 
as rare as this in the United States and
don't<00:05:38.790> mind<00:05:39.060> paying<00:05:39.270> a<00:05:39.420> little<00:05:39.450> extra<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:40.400> I

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
don't mind paying a little extra and I

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.010 
don't mind paying a little extra and I
know<00:05:41.850> it's<00:05:42.090> something<00:05:42.390> I'm<00:05:42.510> probably<00:05:42.780> gonna

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
know it's something I'm probably gonna

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.410 
know it's something I'm probably gonna
hold<00:05:43.680> on<00:05:43.830> to<00:05:43.950> for<00:05:44.220> a<00:05:44.280> long<00:05:44.430> time<00:05:46.880> so<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:47.940> hope<00:05:48.270> you
