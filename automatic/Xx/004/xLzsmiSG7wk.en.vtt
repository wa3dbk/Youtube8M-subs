00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
jump eventually there will be cursed to

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:33.300 
jump eventually there will be cursed to
be<00:04:09.520> bad<00:04:09.850> jumpers<00:04:30.750> diamonds<00:04:32.100> I'm<00:04:33.100> actually

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
be bad jumpers diamonds I'm actually

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.230 
be bad jumpers diamonds I'm actually
doing<00:04:33.580> fine<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.540> have<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:39.060> honor<00:04:40.060> and

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
doing fine you have the honor and

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.540 
doing fine you have the honor and
literally<00:04:40.870> was<00:04:41.530> on<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.980> ladder<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.460> I

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
literally was on the ladder and I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.370 
literally was on the ladder and I
slipped<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:46.030> was<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.540> regular<00:04:47.170> conversation

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
slipped that was a regular conversation

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.520 
slipped that was a regular conversation
while<00:04:48.250> playing<00:04:48.490> Minecraft<00:04:48.970> with<00:04:49.390> my<00:04:50.050> friends

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
while playing Minecraft with my friends

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.890 
while playing Minecraft with my friends
and<00:04:51.310> we<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.580> we<00:04:51.820> have<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.000> lot<00:04:52.180> of<00:04:52.270> fun<00:04:52.480> and

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
and we just we have a lot of fun and

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.770 
and we just we have a lot of fun and
I've<00:04:53.410> also<00:04:53.560> learned<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:54.100> lot<00:04:54.250> about<00:04:54.750> talking<00:04:55.750> to

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
I've also learned a lot about talking to

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.590 
I've also learned a lot about talking to
the<00:04:56.080> phone<00:04:56.290> people<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.400> used<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:57.910> be<00:04:57.970> terrible

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
the phone people I used to be terrible

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.930 
the phone people I used to be terrible
at<00:04:59.080> calling<00:04:59.590> people<00:04:59.919> I<00:05:00.100> dreaded<00:05:00.460> calling

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
at calling people I dreaded calling

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.480 
at calling people I dreaded calling
people<00:05:01.300> because<00:05:01.830> just<00:05:02.830> talking<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.250> phone<00:05:03.370> is

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
people because just talking the phone is

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.430 
people because just talking the phone is
different<00:05:03.640> than<00:05:04.180> talking<00:05:04.690> with<00:05:05.050> people<00:05:05.350> in

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
different than talking with people in

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.480 
different than talking with people in
real<00:05:05.470> life<00:05:05.620> because<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.040> don't<00:05:06.190> have<00:05:06.310> the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
real life because you don't have the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.210 
real life because you don't have the
whole<00:05:06.669> body<00:05:06.970> language<00:05:07.380> dimension<00:05:08.380> but<00:05:09.160> I

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
whole body language dimension but I

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.090 
whole body language dimension but I
learned<00:05:09.669> a<00:05:09.760> lot<00:05:09.880> about<00:05:10.590> just<00:05:11.590> talking<00:05:12.010> with

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
learned a lot about just talking with

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.680 
learned a lot about just talking with
people<00:05:12.310> without<00:05:12.640> actually<00:05:13.300> being<00:05:13.600> there<00:05:13.720> so

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
people without actually being there so

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.170 
people without actually being there so
the<00:05:16.690> next<00:05:16.840> benefit<00:05:17.380> is<00:05:17.770> problem<00:05:18.550> solving<00:05:19.030> and

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
the next benefit is problem solving and

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.940 
the next benefit is problem solving and
the<00:05:19.390> first<00:05:19.600> thing<00:05:19.750> here<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.260> redstone

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
the first thing here is redstone

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.150 
the first thing here is redstone
technology<00:05:21.580> now<00:05:22.450> redstone<00:05:23.380> when<00:05:23.740> it<00:05:23.950> pretty

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
technology now redstone when it pretty

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.340 
technology now redstone when it pretty
much<00:05:24.280> act<00:05:24.520> it's<00:05:24.730> like<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:25.150> wire<00:05:25.419> which<00:05:26.050> a

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
much act it's like a wire which a

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.980 
much act it's like a wire which a
current<00:05:26.800> passes<00:05:27.370> through<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:28.300> redstone

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
current passes through and redstone

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.439 
current passes through and redstone
torches<00:05:29.380> and

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
torches and

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.290 
torches and
and<00:05:30.930> buttons<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.469> also<00:05:31.830> pressure<00:05:32.189> plates<00:05:32.550> can

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
and buttons and also pressure plates can

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.269 
and buttons and also pressure plates can
all<00:05:33.479> send<00:05:33.870> a<00:05:33.960> current<00:05:34.289> to<00:05:34.439> their<00:05:34.590> redstone<00:05:35.039> and

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
all send a current to their redstone and

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.279 
all send a current to their redstone and
that's<00:05:35.729> a<00:05:35.849> picture<00:05:36.029> of<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.479> current<00:05:36.779> being<00:05:36.930> sent

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
that's a picture of a current being sent

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.409 
that's a picture of a current being sent
through<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:38.669> redstone<00:05:39.089> wire<00:05:39.949> and<00:05:41.419> the

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
through the redstone wire and the

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.200 
through the redstone wire and the
redstone<00:05:42.870> can<00:05:43.169> activate<00:05:43.680> Pistons<00:05:44.639> which<00:05:44.969> can

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
redstone can activate Pistons which can

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.360 
redstone can activate Pistons which can
push<00:05:45.419> blocks<00:05:45.749> and<00:05:46.289> dispensers<00:05:46.919> which<00:05:47.189> can

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
push blocks and dispensers which can

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.459 
push blocks and dispensers which can
dispense<00:05:47.669> blocks<00:05:47.999> and<00:05:48.300> TNT<00:05:48.569> which<00:05:48.990> explodes

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
dispense blocks and TNT which explodes

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.829 
dispense blocks and TNT which explodes
and<00:05:49.919> they<00:05:50.039> can<00:05:50.159> also<00:05:50.279> activate<00:05:50.639> doors<00:05:51.240> and

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
and they can also activate doors and

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:55.459 
and they can also activate doors and
gates<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.680> trap<00:05:52.860> doors<00:05:52.889> and<00:05:53.520> lamps<00:05:54.089> and<00:05:54.689> you

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
gates and trap doors and lamps and you

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.429 
gates and trap doors and lamps and you
can<00:05:55.620> create<00:05:55.830> some<00:05:55.919> really<00:05:56.430> cool<00:05:57.439> mechanisms

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:58.439 
can create some really cool mechanisms

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.079 
can create some really cool mechanisms
with<00:05:59.249> redstone<00:05:59.909> and<00:06:01.189> if<00:06:02.189> if<00:06:02.729> you<00:06:02.759> spend<00:06:03.060> enough

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.089 
with redstone and if if you spend enough

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:04.820 
with redstone and if if you spend enough
time<00:06:03.270> working<00:06:03.810> with<00:06:03.960> the<00:06:04.080> redstone<00:06:04.469> and<00:06:04.499> you

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
time working with the redstone and you

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.290 
time working with the redstone and you
have<00:06:05.189> enough<00:06:05.400> knowledge<00:06:05.550> about<00:06:05.909> how<00:06:06.089> Reds

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
have enough knowledge about how Reds

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.209 
have enough knowledge about how Reds
don't<00:06:06.509> works<00:06:06.839> you<00:06:07.560> can<00:06:07.740> create<00:06:07.949> really<00:06:08.129> cool

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
don't works you can create really cool

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:10.339 
don't works you can create really cool
things<00:06:08.669> and<00:06:08.999> I'm<00:06:09.599> going<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:09.870> show<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.080> a

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
things and I'm going to show you a

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.769 
things and I'm going to show you a
lighting<00:06:10.979> system<00:06:11.370> that<00:06:11.580> I<00:06:11.909> set<00:06:12.150> up<00:06:12.180> in<00:06:12.509> a

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
lighting system that I set up in a

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:30.580 
lighting system that I set up in a
minute

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.470 

so<00:06:31.100> all<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:31.400> lights<00:06:31.610> in<00:06:31.790> the<00:06:31.880> theater<00:06:32.210> can

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
so all the lights in the theater can

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.060 
so all the lights in the theater can
actually<00:06:32.870> turn<00:06:33.020> on<00:06:33.350> and<00:06:33.530> off<00:06:33.620> with<00:06:33.680> a<00:06:33.950> switch

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
actually turn on and off with a switch

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.730 
actually turn on and off with a switch
and<00:06:34.730> I<00:06:35.300> had<00:06:35.450> to<00:06:35.570> set<00:06:35.780> up<00:06:35.900> all<00:06:36.110> of<00:06:36.260> the<00:06:36.350> redstone

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
and I had to set up all of the redstone

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.340 
and I had to set up all of the redstone
for<00:06:36.950> that<00:06:37.070> myself<00:06:37.250> and<00:06:38.000> I'm<00:06:38.660> about<00:06:38.840> to<00:06:38.900> go<00:06:39.169> out

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
for that myself and I'm about to go out

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.170 
for that myself and I'm about to go out
and<00:06:39.650> show<00:06:40.070> you<00:06:40.130> what<00:06:40.430> all<00:06:40.550> the<00:06:40.639> redstone<00:06:41.000> looks

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
and show you what all the redstone looks

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.750 
and show you what all the redstone looks
like<00:06:41.389> and<00:06:41.900> there<00:06:42.500> is<00:06:42.650> a<00:06:42.680> lot<00:06:43.100> of<00:06:43.130> redstone<00:06:43.520> took

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
like and there is a lot of redstone took

00:06:43.760 --> 00:07:15.460 
like and there is a lot of redstone took
me<00:06:43.880> a<00:06:43.910> long<00:06:44.060> time<00:06:44.120> to<00:06:44.360> get<00:06:44.510> all<00:06:44.570> threads<00:06:44.960> down

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.080 

and<00:07:16.040> these<00:07:16.220> are<00:07:16.370> the<00:07:16.460> lights<00:07:16.610> that<00:07:16.700> are<00:07:16.790> under

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
and these are the lights that are under

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.330 
and these are the lights that are under
the<00:07:17.210> stage<00:07:17.450> so<00:07:18.380> I<00:07:18.410> had<00:07:18.560> to<00:07:18.800> actually<00:07:19.220> make

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
the stage so I had to actually make

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.430 
the stage so I had to actually make
towers<00:07:19.850> that<00:07:20.420> brought<00:07:20.780> the<00:07:20.900> redstone<00:07:21.230> wire

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
towers that brought the redstone wire

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.520 
towers that brought the redstone wire
all<00:07:21.680> the<00:07:21.800> way<00:07:21.890> up<00:07:22.010> to<00:07:22.130> the<00:07:22.220> top

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:36.970 

so<00:07:29.530> these<00:07:29.650> are<00:07:29.860> better<00:07:30.490> quality<00:07:30.880> pictures

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:36.980 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.070 

so<00:07:37.550> most<00:07:37.790> of<00:07:37.910> you<00:07:37.970> probably<00:07:38.330> thought<00:07:38.780> that

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 
so most of you probably thought that

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.590 
so most of you probably thought that
video<00:07:39.320> games<00:07:39.710> have<00:07:40.340> little<00:07:40.820> to<00:07:41.030> no<00:07:41.180> benefit

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.600 
video games have little to no benefit

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.660 
video games have little to no benefit
for<00:07:42.020> your<00:07:42.200> future<00:07:42.530> life<00:07:42.560> but<00:07:43.280> I<00:07:43.310> hope<00:07:43.640> that

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:43.670 
for your future life but I hope that

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.580 
for your future life but I hope that
today<00:07:44.030> I<00:07:44.060> change<00:07:44.450> your<00:07:44.570> mind<00:07:44.750> even<00:07:45.140> just<00:07:45.530> a

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:45.590 
today I change your mind even just a

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.830 
today I change your mind even just a
little<00:07:45.620> bit
