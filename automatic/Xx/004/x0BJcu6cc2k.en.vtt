good didn't way we looked at Aachen
England<00:01:56.430> team<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.640> bothered<00:01:57.000> would<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.329> swap

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
England team was bothered would you swap

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.660 
England team was bothered would you swap
sterling<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.380> Rooney<00:01:58.740> over<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> mean<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.369> know

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
sterling for Rooney over I mean I know

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.130 
sterling for Rooney over I mean I know
they<00:01:59.790> interchanged<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.479> lot<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.780> saw<00:02:00.960> them

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
they interchanged a lot we saw them

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.690 
they interchanged a lot we saw them
interchange<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.619> lot<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.829> times<00:02:01.860> rabbit<00:02:02.460> was<00:02:02.579> up

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
interchange a lot at times rabbit was up

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.910 
interchange a lot at times rabbit was up
front<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.060> he<00:02:03.149> was<00:02:03.270> wide<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:04.079> Rooney<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:04.649> far

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
front and he was wide but Rooney was far

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.620 
front and he was wide but Rooney was far
too<00:02:04.950> often<00:02:05.310> don't<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.210> he<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.329> needs

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
too often don't you think he just needs

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.150 
too often don't you think he just needs
to<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.780> put<00:02:07.049> up<00:02:07.259> front<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.829> let<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> other

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
to be put up front and let the other

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.740 
to be put up front and let the other
three<00:02:08.429> change<00:02:08.670> around<00:02:08.879> yeah<00:02:09.300> generally<00:02:09.539> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
three change around yeah generally you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.990 
three change around yeah generally you
could<00:02:09.929> probably<00:02:10.080> put<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.950> way<00:02:11.099> stories<00:02:11.640> plays

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
could probably put the way stories plays

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.100 
could probably put the way stories plays
he<00:02:12.150> doesn't<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.720> play<00:02:12.870> off<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
he doesn't like that we play off the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.730 
he doesn't like that we play off the
last<00:02:13.260> man<00:02:13.440> does<00:02:13.590> he

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
last man does he

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.830 
last man does he
not<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> proper<00:02:14.490> number<00:02:14.730> nine<00:02:14.910> really<00:02:15.150> so

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
not like a proper number nine really so

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.450 
not like a proper number nine really so
yeah<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.500> might<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.860> right<00:02:16.980> there

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
yeah you might be right there

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.910 
yeah you might be right there
maybe<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.630> really<00:02:19.350> needs<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.650> be<00:02:19.740> more

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
maybe that really needs to be more

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.400 
maybe that really needs to be more
central<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.610> then<00:02:21.510> storage<00:02:21.840> come<00:02:22.200> off<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
central and then storage come off the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.630 
central and then storage come off the
back<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.590> him<00:02:22.800> maybe<00:02:23.010> instead<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.580> other

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
back of him maybe instead of the other

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.170 
back of him maybe instead of the other
way<00:02:23.790> around

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
way around

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.700 
way around
Rooney<00:02:24.570> can't<00:02:24.750> play<00:02:24.930> out<00:02:25.050> wide<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.470> might<00:02:25.590> be

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
Rooney can't play out wide that might be

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.110 
Rooney can't play out wide that might be
the<00:02:25.770> only<00:02:25.860> thing<00:02:25.950> I'd<00:02:26.220> change<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.610> all<00:02:26.730> honesty

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the only thing I'd change in all honesty

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.430 
the only thing I'd change in all honesty
he's<00:02:27.510> probably<00:02:27.630> not<00:02:27.840> gonna<00:02:27.990> switch<00:02:28.260> out

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
he's probably not gonna switch out

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.050 
he's probably not gonna switch out
Gerard<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.040> Henderson's<00:02:29.520> we<00:02:29.670> fare<00:02:29.820> because

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
Gerard and Henderson's we fare because

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.100 
Gerard and Henderson's we fare because
we've<00:02:30.210> got<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> lack<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.540> options

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
we've got a lack of options

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.920 
we've got a lack of options
it<00:02:32.010> wasn't<00:02:32.280> about<00:02:32.460> performance<00:02:33.000> there<00:02:33.780> was<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
it wasn't about performance there was a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.300 
it wasn't about performance there was a
bit<00:02:34.050> more<00:02:34.200> clinical<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.740> us<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.100> think

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
bit more clinical in us and I think

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.090 
bit more clinical in us and I think
defensively<00:02:35.760> especially<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:37.560> center<00:02:37.800> out<00:02:37.950> in

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
defensively especially to center out in

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.980 
defensively especially to center out in
the<00:02:38.190> keeper<00:02:38.550> didn't<00:02:39.240> really<00:02:39.450> cover<00:02:39.600> himself

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
the keeper didn't really cover himself

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.320 
the keeper didn't really cover himself
in<00:02:40.110> glory<00:02:40.230> tonight<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.070> as<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.060> said<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
in glory tonight and as I said the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.370 
in glory tonight and as I said the
midfield<00:02:42.660> was<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.780> little<00:02:42.990> bit<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.200> almost

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
midfield was a little bit and I almost

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.260 
midfield was a little bit and I almost
put<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.860> forward<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.820> looked<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.090> most

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
put going forward we we looked the most

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.700 
put going forward we we looked the most
potent<00:02:45.660> all<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.990> way<00:02:46.080> through<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.380> game<00:02:46.530> and

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
potent all the way through the game and

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.860 
potent all the way through the game and
we're<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:48.000> setting<00:02:48.210> up<00:02:48.270> Mario<00:02:48.420> Bobbitt
