00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.910
 in this video we will see how the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.309
 coordinator or head teacher 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.350
 can manage the board in the phase of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.490
 ballot 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.350
 first of all we need a certain beauty 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.090
 through the billboard scrutiny menu 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.330
 of the class through the icon 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.679
 ballot class board 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.390
 select the reference ballot 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.150
 for example, they scrutinize according to four months 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.589
 of the first and click on the proceed button 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.060
 the ballot can be done in 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:38.399
 consequential way we can 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.859
 first use the features 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.199
 that we are immediately below the key 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.820
 proceed to point 1 we find some 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.800
 instructions that you should read before 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.289
 start clicking opens the fencing in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.179
 overlay we can close 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.500
 little through the or button 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.170
 simply through the button 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 of the keyboard 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.769
 then we have a second feature 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.940
 some proposals once you leave 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.399
 with the class council 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 so close the proposals this will take 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.840
 say that the single teacher cannot 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.320
 more change the proposals in his 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.180
 area 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.290
 clearly you want to reopen bastari 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.939
 click on the button we have the data for 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.759
 the prints the board that we will see in the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.950
 video for printing the scoreboard data 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.869
 for the record then we can start 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.409
 to buy data with the date on which 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.420
 of the ballot which can start 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.130
 be selected or written 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.000
 quietly the end time of the classroom 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.920
 president secretary coordinator others 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.079
 data is always the list of teachers present 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 clicking on enter recent names there 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.250
 class automatically will be inserted 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.469
 all teachers who belong to that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.759
 class we must clearly specify 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.860
 which are the absent teachers 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.680
 which are the 100 more replaced 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.810
 we have various fields these fields can 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.820
 offer will end up in our document 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.759
 customized for the minutes in the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.930
 position that we have clearly chosen 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.090
 once we have entered all the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.130
 data we need that we can 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.920
 insert a part immediately and maybe 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.960
 some then we can close this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.520
 this screen simply 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.200
 through the apply and close button 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.690
 which is found both below and above 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.250
 then we go directly to the board 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.860
 then maybe we'll see the others too 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.360
 functionality in the board if it was 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.800
 configured as we have 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.180
 recommended in the video for the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.370
 configure the ballot in the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.590
 primary we will find ourselves directly 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.000
 votes for the card they were 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.890
 then entered by individual teachers 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.110
 we can modify the individual votes 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.769
 simply by clicking and ea 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.269
 change it is important to note some 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.519
 things for example we find ourselves the outcome already 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.880
 calculated automatically for the moon sees 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.790
 silvia sings at least sufficient the outcome 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.160
 is already allowed for the white pupil instead 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.880
 patrician who has two shortcomings 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.500
 the outcome is automatic and not allowed 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.540
 clearly if we go to change the votes 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.459
 therefore to bring all of you superior 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.959
 at 6 the outcome automatically becomes 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.060
 then admitted the result if it comes 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.709
 calculated automatically you can 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.680
 act morally by going to 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.209
 click and change if needed 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.639
 we have the total absence column 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.560
 and we have, among other things, decided to maybe 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.139
 calculate them with days just click 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.920
 on the automatic 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.920
 we will find the number of absences 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.139
 finally important for primary school 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.389
 the possibility to insert the 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:43.620
 final evaluation to insert it enough 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:45.690
 the dog on the pupil's name will appear to us 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.950
 the overlay screen where 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.500
 for example we have the screen a for 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.180
 the result is the ticket for the free text 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.889
 one that our final operation where 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.269
 we can go to write or through 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.720
 the phrase book if we used the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.819
 to insert the final evaluation 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.410
 just click on apply for the student 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.420
 important to emphasize that what 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.180
 insert in the free text by clicking on 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.440
 Pupil's name when we click 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.540
 apply is not saved 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.489
 automatically but to save the data 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.530
 always inserted on the students 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.870
 save the board 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.099
 in fact if by chance we try to get out 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.830
 from the board 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.419
 let's try going to another screen there 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.159
 confirmation is always requested if 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.120
 we are sure to abandon this 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.670
 page 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.220
 if we are not sure we have saved 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.880
 so it's good to stay on the redo page 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.470
 a rescue and then maybe exit 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.690
 returning our free texts if 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.120
 we have inserted the free text for a 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.400
 pupil we will see under the name of the pupil 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.050
 the wording for example t1 ie we have 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.850
 while the free text 1 this there 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.990
 immediately indicates that for the one along the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.360
 text of for one that has been entered 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.630
 once then entered all the votes e 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.010
 maybe all the final evaluations 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.820
 we can clearly go to save the 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.340
 our board to conclude we return 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.500
 to our functionalities we find the 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.540
 buttons for viewing the 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.190
 these board allow us to be able to 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.920
 work a little more 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.930
 clean because we can hide that 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.320
 that we don't need to see exactly 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.270
 moment for example we find ourselves the 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.830
 subjects with the short name with the buttons 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.500
 for the creation of the scoreboard 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.080
 we can put it as we hope below 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.030
 subjects with the extended name rather than 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.890
 maybe see the subjects vertically if 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.290
 we like them more or they turn out better 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.270
 comfortable as we can put the 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.770
 date of birth for each student maybe 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.460
 in the classic we have two students 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.380
 homonyms can be useful as a birth 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.300
 I distinguish the other buttons there 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.730
 then allow you to change the 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.950
 display we will see more way 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.660
 thorough and these buttons in the video 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.130
 for the prints the scoreboard because there 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.290
 will allow you to have prints 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.060
 customized 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.430
 we close the fencing in overlay 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.530
 always or that button open and close or 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.990
 with the keyboard key and let's go 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.820
 forward with our fine features 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.380
 we close and stop the scrutinizing one 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.240
 time we are sure we have entered 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.560
 all the data that these are correct 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.420
 maybe we did the press of 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.910
 we have also printed the scoreboard badly 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.500
 feature tabs and we'll see in the video 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.730
 precisely for printing the scoreboard in the 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.780
 video for printing cards 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.120
 we can block the poll once 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.770
 that the close e button is clicked 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.930
 block it this cannot be 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.730
 reopened by the coordinator or by 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.010
 manager in the teaching area but only 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.170
 the ballot can be opened by 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:41.670
 administration 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:45.940
 therefore before blocking the ballot 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:48.040
 make sure that everything is in place 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.120
 new button number 9 gives us the 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.070
 information on the ballot for example 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.390
 tells us that for the total absences that 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.740
 we went to calculate comes 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.360
 considering the period from the first 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.360
 February to 20 June
