then<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:09.600> hydrates<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.260> powder<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:10.920> it

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
then it hydrates the powder so it

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.340 
then it hydrates the powder so it
doesn't<00:05:11.400> have<00:05:11.580> such<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.240> powdery<00:05:12.720> look<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.200> it
