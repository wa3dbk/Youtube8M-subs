00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
app but from what I understand what I

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.939 
app but from what I understand what I
read<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.480> evaders<00:00:21.480> have<00:00:21.720> removed<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
read is that evaders have removed the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.310

and music box does work now I'm gonna

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.069 
and music box does work now I'm gonna
try<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.299> my<00:01:27.420> iPhone<00:01:27.570> 5c<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.990> hopefully<00:01:30.990> it

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
works if it doesn't I guess then the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.640 
works if it doesn't I guess then the
jailbreak<00:01:34.829> doesn't<00:01:35.159> work<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:35.850> say<00:01:36.090> so
