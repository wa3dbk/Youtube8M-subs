00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
squeezing in towards the center of the

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.689 
squeezing in towards the center of the
bench<00:00:52.559> basically<00:00:53.010> trying<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> match<00:00:53.489> your

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

hands together you're not pushing up

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.639 
hands together you're not pushing up
you're<00:00:56.210> squeezing<00:00:57.210> inward<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:58.050> tends<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you're squeezing inward which tends to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
you're squeezing inward which tends to
move<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.670> that's<00:00:59.969> how<00:01:00.090> you're

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
move you up because that's how you're

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.369 
move you up because that's how you're
having<00:01:00.629> works<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.050> what's<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
having works that's what's going to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.160 
having works that's what's going to
happen

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
happen

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.419 
happen
keep<00:01:02.649> that<00:01:02.800> in<00:01:02.890> mind<00:01:03.010> you're<00:01:03.190> doing<00:01:03.339> the

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
keep that in mind you're doing the

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.810 
keep that in mind you're doing the
exercise<00:01:03.820> here<00:01:03.969> it<00:01:04.210> looks<00:01:04.360> like<00:01:04.420> basically

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
exercise here it looks like basically

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:26.320 
exercise here it looks like basically
thumbs<00:01:06.820> on<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.000> top<00:01:07.180> hands<00:01:07.600> wrapped<00:01:07.900> around

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.540 

now<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.990> reason<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.380> say<00:01:27.410> with<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:27.920> one<00:01:28.160> to

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
now the reason I say with this one to

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.000 
now the reason I say with this one to
rest<00:01:29.240> your<00:01:29.360> chest<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.840> bench<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.620> that<00:01:30.920> we

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
rest your chest on the bench is that we

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.410 
rest your chest on the bench is that we
actually<00:01:31.040> want<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.490> take<00:01:31.670> away<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.000> elastic

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
actually want to take away the elastic

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.610 
actually want to take away the elastic
tension<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:32.930> we<00:01:32.990> want<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.200> take<00:01:33.320> away<00:01:33.440> the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
tension and we want to take away the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.190 
tension and we want to take away the
tricep<00:01:34.040> tension<00:01:34.460> from<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.150> exercise<00:01:35.720> if<00:01:36.080> you

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
tricep tension from the exercise if you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.110 
tricep tension from the exercise if you
just<00:01:36.260> do<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.740> like<00:01:37.490> be<00:01:37.670> touching<00:01:38.000> and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
just do it like be touching and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.760 
just do it like be touching and
maintaining<00:01:38.570> tension<00:01:38.990> people<00:01:39.380> find<00:01:39.650> that

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
maintaining tension people find that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.920 
maintaining tension people find that
your<00:01:39.860> triceps<00:01:40.280> attempt<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.610> kick<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:41.150> lot

a<00:01:43.310> closed<00:01:43.550> curve<00:01:43.700> push-up<00:01:44.120> so<00:01:44.330> by<00:01:44.930> doing<00:01:44.990> this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
a closed curve push-up so by doing this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.220 
a closed curve push-up so by doing this
rest<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.670> your<00:01:46.760> chest<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.300> bench<00:01:47.480> relaxing

inwards and squeezing the cats together

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.460 
inwards and squeezing the cats together
you'll<00:01:53.180> get<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> massive<00:01:53.810> contraction<00:01:54.050> in
