00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.810
 this is something cheaper than real 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.769
 the Spanish supercopa because doing two 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.860
 matches at the start of the league does not have 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.990
 meaning in the final is a final are not 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.060
 two final but good surely that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.130
 pay television and all the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.490
 conveniences that generate having two 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.050
 final 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.689
 as a result of it last year 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.670
 we were close they became two big 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.830
 matches and good now we will have to 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.830
 make a major effort 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.720
 to balance tomorrow's match and 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.090
 good and then have the possibility of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.870
 the next in the pilot 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.780
 but surely I hope it arrives 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.880
 some more and it will surely come out some 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.680
 the guys that we have the structure of 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.500
 team will not change will not vary 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.140
 within the intensity of intention 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.260
 from the aggressiveness in the game 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.870
 because obviously the base of the with 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.050
 fran miranda godín and tiago mario gabi 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.890
 koke arda raúl remains and that what 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.200
 gives us the stability of power being of 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.030
 to be able to keep in the same 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.800
 game idea it is clear that the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.740
 characteristics of machu that are not 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.660
 of are not those of coast and those of 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.050
 Griezmann can get a little closer to the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.800
 of coast without being forward 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.400
 unique jiménez is an intermediate where 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.370
 can be the most similar without being 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.720
 acosta 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.280
 but you can also play the second 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.409
 point so we 'll have to go see 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 in the game 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.609
 how we better exploit the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.520
 characteristics of each of the 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.900
 front we have is clear that 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.140
 play the one who 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.000
 make us feel more comfortable more 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.090
 comfortable to the team and that the team 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.220
 find the potential much quicker 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.900
 of the striker who has more minutes in 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.170
 the championship 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.940
 I do not think it improved better or better or because 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.720
 what we have seen the presence of cross 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.220
 it surely gives it an even greater potential 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.540
 who had the rival in the middle of the field 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.510
 much more stability much more 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.129
 much more balanced game 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.069
 and obviously from what we've seen of 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.510
 bail is much better than at the beginning and 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.439
 that gives you much more offensive power in 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.959
 the three attackers 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:31.879
 so undoubtedly it is a team 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.879
 superior to last year
