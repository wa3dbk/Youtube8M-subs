00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.350
 acupuncture acupuncture is one 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.260
 millennial discipline that is part of the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.770
 traditional Chinese medicine founds 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.480
 its origins from the Taoist philosophy and is 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.190
 a medical discipline to all 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.890
 effects is practiced by 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.180
 subcutaneous insertion of needles into 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.770
 points chosen ad hoc on the basis of 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.540
 diagnosis that was made on the basis 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.390
 of therapist inventions here in 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.340
 those cases are addressed to a doctor 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.200
 acupuncturist then acupuncture a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.219
 countless innumerable applications 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.700
 indications has a reputation for being excellent 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.679
 pain therapy therefore many types of 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.229
 almost almost all types of pain 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.209
 pain are approachable and solvable 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.869
 with acupuncture 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:37.509
 this is the fame of acupuncture in 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.139
 Actually the application fields are 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:44.319
 multiple say them all is impossible 

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:48.130
 but I can mention the field of 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:51.880
 allergies to anxiety syndromes 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 the depressions menstrual disorders 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.709
 menopause disorders 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.229
 I could go beyond the times 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.420
 of the transmission are really and in 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.170
 which cases is particularly effective 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.349
 well the cases I mentioned are cases in 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.099
 whose acupuncture rarely fails his 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.620
 targets 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:18.040
 regarding cycle disorders 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.160
 menstrual in particular the syndrome 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.180
 menstrual no to all pains all 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.980
 disturbances that the woman around the stage 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.410
 flow generally respond a lot 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.390
 good allergies have an excellent one 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.900
 response in both adults and children 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.120
 children the menopausal syndrome than not 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.080
 it's only the hot flashes when a woman 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.380
 is going into menopause responds a lot 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.799
 insomnia is good for acupuncture 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.450
 headaches and anxiety at the depressions are 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.610
 all areas in which acupuncture gives 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.629
 much satisfaction the conjuncture is one 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.900
 eu or integral alternative therapy 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.700
 conventional therapies 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.730
 let me say that in Italy 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.160
 especially the acupuncture is 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.290
 therefore it is considered a medical act 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.360
 practicable only by graduate in 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.629
 medicine authorized to practice 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.629
 profession 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.930
 my opinion is that the doctor 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.079
 acupuncturist should never forget to 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.510
 be a doctor and therefore never 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.760
 forget that he has his own 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.530
 cultural background that also derives from it 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.720
 from our universities and therefore from the 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.670
 western medicine 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.489
 in this sense acupuncture is one 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.920
 tool that has its indications e 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.849
 which in some cases definitely works 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.840
 better than conventional medicine in 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.139
 some cases work very well integrated 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.980
 with conventional medicine and 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:55.300
 unfortunately in some cases it has limits 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.580
 can only be overcome with doctors 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.330
 there are contraindications 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.950
 acupuncture then real 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.740
 no contraindications or even effects 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:12.310
 collateral known at least in 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.310
 literature the few cases of 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.829
 unpleasant events that can be 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.350
 delivered concern their own 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.680
 the infission of the lake but the thing more 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.900
 tour because a patient can happen a 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.919
 bruise at the point of which the duration 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.590
 the duration of an acupuncture therapy 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:38.310
 I told her about a twenty-minute session 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.280
 half an hour the duration of the therapy then 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.740
 how many sessions are needed to solve the 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.930
 problem depends a lot on the problem that 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.950
 we need to deal with type problems 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.230
 orthopedic as can be 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.970
 a scapular humerus periarthritis not a 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.240
 shoulder height 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.280
 or problems with cervical osteoarthritis and 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.910
 lumbar 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.370
 on average, patients respond 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.020
 within 4 5 sessions always if not there 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.120
 are complications that make 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.490
 need more than 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:21.040
 sessions for problems like syndromes 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.040
 anxious the sessions are some more 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.190
 they can reach 7 to 8 sessions also 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.020
 10 depends precisely on the entity 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.460
 of the syndrome from what is old from 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.460
 how the patient responds 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.770
 rarely goes beyond the ten sessions 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.010
 I'd say he has it 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.480
 the pathology that engages the most 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.820
 sitting headache is a very pathology 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.800
 complex that is difficult to deal with 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.050
 Also all the senses by 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.030
 and can be acupuncture 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.030
 still needed a senior professor
