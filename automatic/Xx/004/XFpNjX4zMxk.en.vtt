00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Tell me guys, I'm from Eiko and I 'm 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:15.480
 Mateus 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:18.060
 welcome to physical idea is is is is good 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.160
 personal day of physics is today we go 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 it is a relevant issue since 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.130
 are simple machines 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.650
 the first simple machine that people 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 go take a look is the look you too 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 You can know this, I'm giving it all 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.769
 per day it is widely used in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.140
 construction and some workshops 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.180
 mechanical to lift very late 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.809
 and my subscription raise very 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.430
 heavy 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.149
 First we'll take a look at this. 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.000
 Here O fixed here with a fixed - player 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.070
 rolling as it is attached to a 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 wall but the wood for anything 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.160
 who keeps there 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.379
 What is the function of this here many times? 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.300
 You need to raise pasta or in case 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 here I have an object of five grams 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.859
 You know I want to make him come up. 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.230
 From here on, they'll tell you what's going on. 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.120
 happen here in general if I only had 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.790
 a rope I would need with this object 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.600
 this right from the bottom up and was going to be 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.700
 a very large effort however is is the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.130
 Guys know it's more practical shaw of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.259
 Up down to make this move. 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.500
 more comfortable room in the so 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.780
 use it if you could fix it and see that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.140
 this object is being pulled down 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.689
 by a force weight 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.439
 ok you can attack this module 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.780
 weight strength 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.640
 see the mass of the object that is 5 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.960
 kilograms I also have the acceleration 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 of gravity according to the square in new 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.579
 weight and mass times 10 of this 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.549
 way I can say that the weight of the 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.409
 object is 50 thousand tons apply for 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.240
 keep this object in balance 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.369
 make it go up and speed 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.610
 At least I need to have a 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:09.060
 force is equal to his directly to 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.400
 from top to bottom and from top to bottom 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.560
 under the same force 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.800
 so the force that I'm going to apply 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.200
 will have the same 50 microns but I 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.280
 I will give a much more comfortable position is 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.050
 much easier 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.090
 the boss then with the function 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.880
 of the police in the end 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.250
 will change the direction and direction of the force 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.140
 applied because the force down right 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.630
 and on arriving here on the blog she was 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.260
 They had been feeling up and this 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.150
 facilitates the use and a lift of 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.030
 some beauty objects 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.330
 the second example now that the revelry 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.330
 mobile ok 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.230
 Good guys, let 's go back here now. 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.030
 here as an example of certain mobile foliage 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.950
 It is worth remembering that you are 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.099
 I will inevitably need 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.290
 It could also fixed everything and fixed and 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.510
 mobile that will happen here I have 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.540
 same box of course the same object of this 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.030
 kilograms and 75 kilograms then I 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.150
 suffered a weighty force here down to 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.160
 50 minutes beauty between our way 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.870
 company continues 150 meters 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.140
 the goal of the mobile daughter of the sesi is a 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.420
 slightly different it will decrease the force 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.890
 I need this block 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.930
 continue to carry out a force to 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.019
 down by the police who reversed 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.780
 sense of direction by having that 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.690
 community to pull down but I 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.780
 I'll still have a better advantage now 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.640
 I can pull that same block 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.220
 performing less force because here it has 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.410
 a weight of 50 thousand just that I have 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.269
 two handles think that as a kind of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.220
 bags sure then someone is holding 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.290
 on one side and another person holding the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.810
 another in this case here is the wall itself 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.819
 up here is holding the realizing 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.650
 a force in this cup then you have a 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:06.660
 force here to call the fmi beauty and an f 2 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:11.069
 here these two forces are holding 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:14.690
 this block that object and well see 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.900
 object you will not need to perform 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.510
 The third is to perform only f2 then the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.520
 your strength here f2 we'll see the 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.540
 following the weight of 50 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.740
 if gil two then is to have 25 newton heath 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.200
 25 minutes pref 2 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.990
 this way you will only need 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.240
 of 25 thousand tubes for him and with the block 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.130
 which would weigh 50 liters 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.170
 It is interesting to note here that for 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.060
 every mobile phone you add to the system 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.130
 I'm going to halve the force 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.640
 needed to use the object 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.710
 because on the other hand I'm going to increase the 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.330
 Wire size I'll have to pull through 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.580
 example if I had to pull a 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.810
 method of fiuk in the province for him 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.930
 this object 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.300
 here I would have to use two meters 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.390
 because I now have a theory 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.720
 move beauty that we can do right 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:09.230
 I have the formula here is what is more or 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.630
 less the following applied force 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:18.530
 Okay, in case this force is going to be here. 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:20.419
 equal to the weight of the beauty object tac / 2 is 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.690
 taken to pn 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.510
 right s / n here staff is the number of 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.880
 mobile police in the case here we have 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.770
 only one could mobile then how is it there? 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.700
 Let's go and replace it here. 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:41.540
 This is equal weight worth 50 beauty / 2 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:46.130
 raised to 12 and take it himself 2 150 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.300
 about two that results from our 25 thousand 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.300
 All right. 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.160
 so here is how to work with 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.870
 beauty mobile police 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.030
 Just remembering is used a lot to 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.560
 then raise objects very much 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.720
 because they are associated with several 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.320
 theories a necessary effort will be 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.990
 so cool 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.100
 It was then trust of our videos 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.660
 thank you guys see you later 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.010
 Tell me the professor here to collect 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.750
 for this our video do not forget to 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.250
 give there and enjoy our part in twitter 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.020
 and also on facebook 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.449
 Let's follow if you sign up for the channel. 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.809
 hug 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.930
 but the one of eight dead ronicley the fuck 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.930
 to
