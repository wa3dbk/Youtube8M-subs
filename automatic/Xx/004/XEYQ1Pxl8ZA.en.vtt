00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
belts through then they actually go

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.620

to 33 pounds then you can flip it around
and<00:02:24.940> they<00:02:25.510> can<00:02:25.690> go<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.080> about<00:02:26.260> 65<00:02:26.950> pounds<00:02:27.250> so

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and they can go up to about 65 pounds so

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.460 
and they can go up to about 65 pounds so
