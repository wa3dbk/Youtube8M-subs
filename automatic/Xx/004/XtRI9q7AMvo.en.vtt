Davis Cup in a bit setback last week in
Washington<00:00:04.980> but<00:00:05.339> wonder<00:00:05.609> how<00:00:05.640> difficult<00:00:06.150> is

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
Washington but wonder how difficult is

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.789 
Washington but wonder how difficult is
it<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.899> time<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.259> year<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.440> sort<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.680> make

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
it this time of year to sort of make

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.680 
it this time of year to sort of make
that<00:00:07.980> transition<00:00:08.280> after<00:00:08.670> so<00:00:08.970> long<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
that transition after so long on the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.180 
that transition after so long on the
clay<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> grass<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.320> switching<00:00:11.040> back<00:00:11.160> to

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
clay in the grass and switching back to

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.539 
clay in the grass and switching back to
the<00:00:11.340> hard<00:00:11.490> courts<00:00:11.700> yeah<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.690> think<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.440> not<00:00:13.620> so

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the hard courts yeah I think it's not so

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.550 
the hard courts yeah I think it's not so
difficult<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.540> get<00:00:15.690> used<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.960> timing<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> ball

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
difficult to get used to timing the ball

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.320 
difficult to get used to timing the ball
again<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.039> hard<00:00:17.220> course<00:00:17.520> that's<00:00:17.850> one<00:00:18.210> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
again on the hard course that's one of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.550 
again on the hard course that's one of
the<00:00:18.449> easier<00:00:18.720> things<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.230> because<00:00:19.380> it's

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the easier things to do because it's

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.230 
the easier things to do because it's
obviously<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.949> true<00:00:20.460> balance<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.029> just

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
obviously a true balance but just

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.320 
obviously a true balance but just
physically<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.970> demanding<00:00:23.970> playing<00:00:24.240> on

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
physically it is demanding playing on

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
physically it is demanding playing on
the<00:00:24.390> hard<00:00:24.600> courts<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.500> tough<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> joints

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the hard courts it's tough on the joints

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.920 
the hard courts it's tough on the joints
it's<00:00:26.490> hard<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> body<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.269> obviously<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it's hard on the body and obviously the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.419 
it's hard on the body and obviously the
grass<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.470> clear<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> little<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.279> more

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
grass and the clear a little bit more

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370 
grass and the clear a little bit more
forgiving<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.119> that's<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.170> thing<00:00:31.349> that

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
forgiving and that's the thing that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.350 
forgiving and that's the thing that
takes<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.859> little<00:00:32.009> bit<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> time<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.239> body

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
takes a little bit of time for your body

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.319 
takes a little bit of time for your body
to<00:00:33.630> get<00:00:34.110> used<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.610> yeah<00:00:35.760> last<00:00:36.239> week

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

have a good run here you'll been asking

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.759 
have a good run here you'll been asking
about<00:02:24.450> actually<00:02:24.810> bit<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.230> interest<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.680> it

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
about actually bit of interest of it

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.770 
about actually bit of interest of it
that<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.010> sort<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.280> mid<00:02:27.060> season<00:02:27.299> break<00:02:27.480> them

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
that that sort of mid season break them

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.850 
that that sort of mid season break them

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
I guess it's kind of important to have

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.680 
I guess it's kind of important to have
the<00:02:29.010> rest<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.819> find<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.209> balance<00:02:30.360> of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
the rest but to find that balance of

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.300 
the rest but to find that balance of
rest<00:02:30.900> also<00:02:31.200> kind<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.620> keeping<00:02:31.829> up<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.129> sort

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
rest also kind of keeping up this sort

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.890

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
you do to sort of keep fit also resting

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.539 
you do to sort of keep fit also resting
that<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.299> that<00:02:36.390> little<00:02:36.629> break<00:02:36.810> there<00:02:37.549> well

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
after that and looking at here in Canada

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.830 
after that and looking at here in Canada
is<00:03:14.639> not<00:03:14.819> been<00:03:14.940> particularly<00:03:15.209> kind<00:03:15.389> to<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
last few years and that perhaps a sign

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.860 
last few years and that perhaps a sign
of<00:03:17.489> sort<00:03:17.699> of<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.970> guess<00:03:18.150> some<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.690> guess

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
of sort of I guess some I guess

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.300 
of sort of I guess some I guess
emotionally<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:19.410> physically<00:03:19.680> draining<00:03:20.010> sort

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
emotionally and physically draining sort

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.530 
emotionally and physically draining sort

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
don't know why it is it could be partly

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.630 
don't know why it is it could be partly
because<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.410> also<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:38.370> know<00:03:38.490> I've
