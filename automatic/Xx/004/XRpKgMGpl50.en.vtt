instant<00:04:23.300> occurred<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.199> me<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.860> might

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
instant occurred to me that I might

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.219 
instant occurred to me that I might
actually<00:04:25.280> be<00:04:25.490> here<00:04:25.760> doing<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.210> myself<00:04:26.690> and

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
because it's not something I ever

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.280 
because it's not something I ever
dreamed<00:04:31.130> about<00:04:31.280> it's<00:04:31.580> beyond<00:04:31.910> that<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.389> I

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290
