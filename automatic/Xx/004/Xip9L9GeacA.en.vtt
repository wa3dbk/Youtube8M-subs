another card and then destroy it so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.840 
another card and then destroy it so
that's<00:03:11.880> why<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:13.320> card<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.830> decided<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.459> use<00:03:14.489> in

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
that's why this card I decided to use in

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.770 
that's why this card I decided to use in
here<00:03:15.560> 3<00:03:16.560> pot<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.920> duality<00:03:17.040> because<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.540> deck

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
here 3 pot of duality because the deck

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.350 
here 3 pot of duality because the deck
is<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.410> little<00:03:19.799> bit<00:03:19.890> slow<00:03:20.280> well<00:03:20.970> pot<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.269> duality

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
is a little bit slow well pot of duality

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.229 
is a little bit slow well pot of duality
it<00:03:21.810> really<00:03:22.049> helps<00:03:22.290> because<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:23.700> don't<00:03:23.970> get

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
it really helps because you don't get

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.090 
it really helps because you don't get
anything<00:03:24.540> too<00:03:24.900> fast<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.380> when<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.620> do<00:03:25.830> you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
anything too fast so when you do you

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.590 
anything too fast so when you do you
don't<00:03:26.370> need<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.610> pot<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.910> duality<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.480> you

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
don't need the pot of duality so you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.620 
don't need the pot of duality so you
could<00:03:27.780> wait<00:03:27.989> for<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:29.100> helps<00:03:29.370> out<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> lot

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
could wait for it so it helps out a lot

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.240 
could wait for it so it helps out a lot
if<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.810> run<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.140> book<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.470> lies<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.860> book<00:03:32.130> of
