short<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.920> final<00:01:41.520> answer<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
short the final answer about this one is

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
short the final answer about this one is
that<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.170> has<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> big<00:01:43.649> knock<00:01:43.829> against<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.369> and

when you put those two together they end
up<00:01:55.680> looking<00:01:56.040> terrible<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> did<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
up looking terrible so what I did to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.399 
up looking terrible so what I did to
make<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.509> look<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:57.899> bit<00:01:58.110> better<00:01:58.229> is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
make this look a little bit better is

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.260 
make this look a little bit better is
that<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> ended<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.979> using<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.640> gold<00:01:59.880> gundam

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that I ended up using just a gold gundam

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.510 
that I ended up using just a gold gundam
marker<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:01.500> over<00:02:01.619> any<00:02:01.920> parts<00:02:02.280> that's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
marker and going over any parts that's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.999 
marker and going over any parts that's
exposed<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.840> try<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> make<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.619> lustrous

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
exposed to try to make the lustrous

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.490 
exposed to try to make the lustrous
parts<00:02:05.460> match<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.909> little<00:02:06.210> bit<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.540> even<00:02:06.899> but

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
parts match a little bit more even but

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
parts match a little bit more even but
that<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.220> an<00:02:08.310> issue<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.789> with

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
that is going to be an issue here with

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.600 
that is going to be an issue here with
the<00:02:09.090> perfect<00:02:09.479> grade<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.250> hope<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.400> comes

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the perfect grade I hope this comes

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.140 
the perfect grade I hope this comes
through<00:02:11.760> clearly<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.450> your<00:02:12.480> screen

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
through clearly on your screen

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.420 
through clearly on your screen
but<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.900> guess<00:02:14.200> which<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:14.829> these<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.340> get

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
but can you guess which of these you get

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.949 
but can you guess which of these you get
the<00:02:15.489> most<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.939> well<00:02:16.269> yeah<00:02:16.450> that's<00:02:16.599> going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> be

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
the most of well yeah that's going to be

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.319 
the most of well yeah that's going to be
the<00:02:17.170> el<00:02:17.620> cheapo<00:02:17.980> one<00:02:18.159> which<00:02:18.549> is<00:02:18.700> basically<00:02:19.120> the

the el cheapo one which is basically the

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.000 
the el cheapo one which is basically the
same<00:02:19.510> goal<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.049> get<00:02:20.200> on<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.379> inside<00:02:20.769> of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
same goal that you get on the inside of

also going to get two of these
beautifully<00:02:25.299> made-up<00:02:25.689> parts<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.349> can

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
beautifully made-up parts and you can

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.380 
beautifully made-up parts and you can
see<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.769> these<00:02:26.860> are<00:02:27.069> going<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.340> be<00:02:27.459> used<00:02:28.209> in

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
see that these are going to be used in

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.569 
see that these are going to be used in
quite<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.629> few<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.140> very<00:02:29.500> visible<00:02:30.159> places

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
quite a few of the very visible places

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.130 
quite a few of the very visible places
like<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.879> knees<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.299> elbows<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.930> thighs

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
like the knees the elbows and the thighs

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.319 
like the knees the elbows and the thighs
when<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.560> open<00:02:32.799> up<00:02:32.890> everything<00:02:33.159> but<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
when you open up everything but the

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.390 
when you open up everything but the
majority<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.349> nice<00:02:35.590> parts<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.159> think<00:02:36.340> you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
majority of the nice parts I think you

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.610 
majority of the nice parts I think you
get<00:02:36.519> five<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.939> these<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.090> total<00:02:37.629> are<00:02:37.780> sort<00:02:38.530> of

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
get five of these in total are sort of

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.830 
get five of these in total are sort of
this<00:02:38.739> toned<00:02:39.220> down<00:02:39.459> gold<00:02:40.269> it's<00:02:40.569> not<00:02:40.720> as

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
this toned down gold it's not as

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.270 
this toned down gold it's not as
lustrous<00:02:41.200> as<00:02:41.349> this<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.769> it's<00:02:41.859> certainly<00:02:42.159> not

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
lustrous as this and it's certainly not

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
as dull as this but anyway these are

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.470 
as dull as this but anyway these are
going<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.159> used<00:02:45.400> for<00:02:45.670> most<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.180> parts

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
going to be used for most of the parts

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.050 
going to be used for most of the parts
on<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.690> inner<00:02:47.139> fray<00:02:47.530> are<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.310> inner<00:02:48.670> parts

on the inner fray are on the inner parts
of<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.239> dragoons<00:02:49.659> but<00:02:50.409> there<00:02:50.590> are<00:02:50.709> still
