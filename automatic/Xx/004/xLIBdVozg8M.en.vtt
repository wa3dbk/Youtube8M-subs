work in absolutely Barcelona and it's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.540 
work in absolutely Barcelona and it's
important<00:01:20.200> because<00:01:20.320> we<00:01:20.920> try<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.130> move<00:01:21.369> the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
important because we try to move the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.880 
important because we try to move the
ball<00:01:21.759> from<00:01:22.390> one<00:01:22.600> side<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.840> another<00:01:22.960> one<00:01:23.440> so<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
ball from one side to another one so the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.980 
ball from one side to another one so the
players<00:01:24.130> have<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.850> move<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.210> lot<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.570> touch<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
players have to move a lot and touch the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.719 
players have to move a lot and touch the
ball<00:01:26.140> we<00:01:27.750> realize<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.780> players<00:01:29.319> when<00:01:29.830> come

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
ball we realize that players when come

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.169 
ball we realize that players when come
here<00:01:31.270> they<00:01:32.200> told<00:01:32.860> us<00:01:33.099> that<00:01:33.160> they<00:01:33.670> have<00:01:33.789> never

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
here they told us that they have never

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.639 
here they told us that they have never
trained<00:01:34.660> at<00:01:35.649> this<00:01:35.950> way<00:01:36.160> so<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:38.170> find<00:01:38.500> that

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
trained at this way so we find that

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.650 
trained at this way so we find that
during<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.819> both<00:01:40.750> weeks<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:43.450> which

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
during the both weeks that what which

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.219 
during the both weeks that what which
have<00:01:43.869> come<00:01:44.340> they<00:01:45.340> change<00:01:45.940> their<00:01:46.630> way<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.899> play

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
and they show us that this kind of

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.120 
and they show us that this kind of
training<00:01:51.520> sessions<00:01:52.179> are<00:01:52.599> very<00:01:52.869> useful<00:01:53.349> to<00:01:53.560> to
