grip<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.850> does<00:02:06.030> not<00:02:06.180> hurt<00:02:06.420> your

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
grip there so it does not hurt your

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 
grip there so it does not hurt your
phone<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.350> I'm<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.340> show<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.789> how

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
phone so I'm going to just show you how

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.590 
phone so I'm going to just show you how
it

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
it

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.380 
it
hatches<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.680> Charcot<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.880> partner

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
hatches and the Charcot this partner

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.790 
hatches and the Charcot this partner
moves<00:02:12.570> looks<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.230> put<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.320> on<00:02:16.470> top

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
moves looks like you just put it on top

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.020 
moves looks like you just put it on top
and<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.430> make<00:02:17.580> sure<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:17.910> not

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
and you have to make sure it's not

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.310 
and you have to make sure it's not
upside<00:02:18.360> down<00:02:18.540> then<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.410> can<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:21.510> screw<00:02:22.200> it

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
upside down then you can just screw it

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.480 
upside down then you can just screw it
in<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.490> seems<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.850> pretty<00:02:27.300> secure

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
in so it seems it pretty secure

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.330 
in so it seems it pretty secure
and<00:02:29.490> then<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.470> was<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.460> and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
and then it just it was like this and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.520 
and then it just it was like this and
then<00:02:35.340> basically<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.330> just<00:02:36.630> put<00:02:37.500> your

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
then basically you can just put your

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.510 
then basically you can just put your
phone<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.070> there

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
phone in there

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.240 
phone in there
so<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.000> filmed<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.930> review<00:02:40.500> before<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
so I filmed this review before I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.210 
so I filmed this review before I
actually<00:02:41.670> had<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> chance<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.690> try<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.590> out<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:43.920> I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
actually had a chance to try it out so I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.640 
actually had a chance to try it out so I
decided<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.090> do<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.240> voiceover<00:02:45.780> sorry

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
decided to just do a voiceover sorry

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.390 
decided to just do a voiceover sorry
that<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.370> blank<00:02:47.760> screen<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:49.400> like

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that it's just a blank screen but I like

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.330 
that it's just a blank screen but I like
this<00:02:50.550> tripod<00:02:51.420> adapter<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> lot<00:02:52.410> more<00:02:52.770> than<00:02:53.130> when

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
this tripod adapter a lot more than when

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.550 
this tripod adapter a lot more than when
I<00:02:53.370> did<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.670> review<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.630> was<00:02:55.110> using<00:02:55.290> it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
I did the review because I was using it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.610 
I did the review because I was using it
wrong<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:56.010> had<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.550> backwards<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.410> talked

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
wrong I had it on backwards but I talked

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.680 
wrong I had it on backwards but I talked
about<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.980> little<00:02:59.250> during<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.790> tutorial

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
about this a little during a tutorial

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.920 
about this a little during a tutorial
that<00:03:01.260> not<00:03:01.920> sure<00:03:01.950> when<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.280> will<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.930> but

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
that not sure when that will be up but

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.860 
that not sure when that will be up but
it's<00:03:04.500> very<00:03:05.010> secure<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.270> doesn't<00:03:06.540> shake

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
it's very secure and it doesn't shake

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
it's very secure and it doesn't shake
unless<00:03:07.200> you're<00:03:07.380> trying<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.980> make<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.250> shake<00:03:08.490> so

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
unless you're trying to make it shake so

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.870 
unless you're trying to make it shake so
I<00:03:09.030> definitely<00:03:10.020> do<00:03:10.200> recommend<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.520> want

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
I definitely do recommend it if you want

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.500 
I definitely do recommend it if you want
a<00:03:12.080> tripod<00:03:13.080> adapter<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.030> 1000<00:03:15.030> times<00:03:15.270> better

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
a tripod adapter and 1000 times better

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.080 
a tripod adapter and 1000 times better
than<00:03:16.020> my<00:03:16.230> other<00:03:16.470> one<00:03:16.620> which<00:03:17.070> was<00:03:17.460> really<00:03:17.730> tight

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
than my other one which was really tight

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.930 
than my other one which was really tight
I'm<00:03:18.570> going<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.980> move<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> review

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
I'm going to just move on to the review

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.610 
I'm going to just move on to the review
of<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.270> tripod<00:03:21.690> here<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.130> tripod<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:25.140> at

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
of the tripod here is the tripod and at

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.820 
of the tripod here is the tripod and at
the<00:03:25.740> beginning<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.750> said<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.140> was<00:03:28.230> cold<00:03:28.560> so

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
the beginning I said what it was cold so

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.460 
the beginning I said what it was cold so
just<00:03:29.070> google<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.270> on<00:03:30.390> Amazon<00:03:30.840> to

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
just google that and it's on Amazon to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.230 
just google that and it's on Amazon to
open<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.190> up<00:03:32.400> pull<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.480> legs<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.080> then<00:03:34.260> this

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
open it up pull the legs and then this

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.560 
open it up pull the legs and then this
comes<00:03:36.240> down<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.530> if<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.160> just<00:03:38.910> pull<00:03:39.240> it<00:03:39.270> up<00:03:39.450> a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
comes down and if you just pull it up a

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.720 
comes down and if you just pull it up a
little<00:03:39.780> bit<00:03:39.990> and<00:03:40.140> then<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.830> can<00:03:40.860> collapse<00:03:41.460> it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
little bit and then you can collapse it

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.010 
little bit and then you can collapse it
so<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.660> do<00:03:42.780> like<00:03:43.110> how<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.470> very<00:03:43.530> stable<00:03:44.310> and

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
so I do like how it's very stable and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.490 
so I do like how it's very stable and
there<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.380> rubber<00:03:47.190> on<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.910> bottom<00:03:48.360> there's<00:03:49.230> a

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
there is rubber on the bottom there's a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.130 
there is rubber on the bottom there's a
handle<00:03:50.250> that's<00:03:50.550> very<00:03:50.820> nice<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.720> actually

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
handle that's very nice you can actually

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.410 
handle that's very nice you can actually
lock<00:03:52.710> this<00:03:52.920> in<00:03:53.100> place<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.550> just<00:03:53.760> realize<00:03:54.210> that

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
lock this in place I just realize that

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.440 
lock this in place I just realize that
if<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:55.020> want<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.470> make<00:03:55.620> sure<00:03:55.650> that's<00:03:56.070> stable

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
if you want to make sure that's stable

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.990 
if you want to make sure that's stable
and<00:03:57.450> doesn't<00:03:58.170> go<00:03:58.440> like<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.890> then<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.790> can

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
and doesn't go like that then you can

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.790 
and doesn't go like that then you can
just<00:04:00.120> twist<00:04:00.270> that<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.840> locks<00:04:01.050> in<00:04:01.260> place

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
just twist that and it locks in place

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.850 
just twist that and it locks in place
I'll<00:04:02.190> show<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.640> how<00:04:03.240> you<00:04:03.270> can<00:04:03.900> extend<00:04:04.680> the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
I'll show you how you can extend the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.930 
I'll show you how you can extend the
legs<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.460> really<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:06.570> feature<00:04:07.580> mine<00:04:08.580> of

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
legs I really like this feature mine of

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.730 
legs I really like this feature mine of
course<00:04:09.210> can<00:04:09.450> do<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.690> too<00:04:09.900> but<00:04:10.140> for<00:04:10.470> mine<00:04:10.620> you

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
course can do that too but for mine you

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.500 
course can do that too but for mine you
have<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.950> twist<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.700> I'm<00:04:12.030> not<00:04:12.210> very<00:04:12.420> good

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
have to twist it and I'm not very good

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.120 
have to twist it and I'm not very good
at<00:04:12.660> making<00:04:12.960> sure<00:04:13.020> things<00:04:13.380> are<00:04:13.560> twisted<00:04:13.920> tight

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
at making sure things are twisted tight

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.890 
at making sure things are twisted tight
but<00:04:14.880> here<00:04:15.120> all<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.480> have<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.690> do<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.930> just

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
but here all you have to do is just

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.170 
but here all you have to do is just
unlatch<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.680> guess<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.370> would<00:04:20.489> say<00:04:20.729> and

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
unlatch this I guess you would say and

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.390 
unlatch this I guess you would say and
then<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.510> can<00:04:21.780> extend

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
then you can extend

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.310 
then you can extend
it<00:04:22.750> then<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:24.470> holds<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.250> really<00:04:25.280> really<00:04:25.940> secure

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
it then it holds a really really secure

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.159 
it then it holds a really really secure
and<00:04:27.320> just<00:04:30.460> as<00:04:31.460> long<00:04:31.759> as<00:04:31.940> you'd<00:04:32.090> like<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.900> says

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
and just as long as you'd like it says

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.320 
and just as long as you'd like it says
it's<00:04:33.350> sixty<00:04:33.770> inches<00:04:34.130> but<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.610> think<00:04:34.940> it's<00:04:35.090> a

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
it's sixty inches but I think it's a

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.420 
it's sixty inches but I think it's a
little<00:04:35.479> bit<00:04:35.780> taller

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
little bit taller

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.939 
little bit taller
there<00:04:37.430> is<00:04:37.639> a<00:04:37.669> level<00:04:38.240> there's<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.020> red<00:04:39.410> ring<00:04:39.680> and

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
there is a level there's a red ring and

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.650 
there is a level there's a red ring and
then<00:04:40.070> there's<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.340> dot<00:04:40.669> in<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:40.880> middle<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.600> you

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
then there's a dot in the middle so you

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.879 
then there's a dot in the middle so you
can<00:04:41.810> see<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.050> perfect<00:04:42.259> center<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:42.800> then

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
can see the perfect center and then

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.249 
can see the perfect center and then
there's<00:04:43.039> a<00:04:43.100> bubble<00:04:43.340> that<00:04:43.580> just<00:04:43.789> moves<00:04:43.970> around

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
there's a bubble that just moves around

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.800 
there's a bubble that just moves around
so<00:04:45.259> that's<00:04:45.410> really<00:04:45.590> nice<00:04:45.860> unit<00:04:46.340> level<00:04:47.030> over

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
so that's really nice unit level over

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.760 
so that's really nice unit level over
here<00:04:48.669> this<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:49.729> normally<00:04:50.539> folded<00:04:51.020> down<00:04:51.229> you

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
here this is normally folded down you

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.580 
here this is normally folded down you
can<00:04:51.949> fold<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.370> out<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.509> then<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:53.990> just<00:04:54.199> crank

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
can fold it out and then you just crank

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.950 
can fold it out and then you just crank
it<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:55.490> kind<00:04:55.729> of<00:04:55.789> have<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.000> hold<00:04:56.300> onto<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:56.720> leg

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
it you kind of have to hold onto the leg

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.260 
it you kind of have to hold onto the leg
so<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:57.350> had<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.620> set<00:04:57.800> up<00:04:57.830> my<00:04:58.100> old<00:04:58.490> tripod<00:04:58.850> which

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
so I had to set up my old tripod which

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.990 
so I had to set up my old tripod which
is<00:04:59.449> definitely<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.930> lot<00:05:00.139> shorter<00:05:00.639> so<00:05:01.639> you<00:05:01.760> can

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
is definitely a lot shorter so you can

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.350 
is definitely a lot shorter so you can
just<00:05:02.210> see<00:05:04.720> crank<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:09.520> it's<00:05:10.520> hard<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.910> see<00:05:11.150> you

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
just see crank it it's hard to see you

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.810 
just see crank it it's hard to see you
but<00:05:11.780> there<00:05:12.050> is<00:05:12.199> another<00:05:12.590> level<00:05:12.919> just<00:05:13.310> in<00:05:13.729> the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
but there is another level just in the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.450 
but there is another level just in the
handle<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.570> bring<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:14.900> up<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.260> down<00:05:15.470> then<00:05:16.070> you

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
handle to bring it up and down then you

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.570 
handle to bring it up and down then you
can<00:05:16.610> turn<00:05:16.789> it<00:05:16.940> side<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.210> side<00:05:17.419> if<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.800> loosen

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
can turn it side to side if you loosen

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.060 
can turn it side to side if you loosen
this<00:05:19.849> then<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.479> can<00:05:20.630> bring<00:05:20.870> this<00:05:21.169> up<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.889> have

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
this then you can bring this up and have

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.870 
this then you can bring this up and have
it<00:05:22.130> pointing<00:05:22.520> straight<00:05:22.729> down<00:05:23.500> if<00:05:24.500> you<00:05:24.880> pop

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
it pointing straight down if you pop

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.680 
it pointing straight down if you pop
this<00:05:26.090> up<00:05:26.680> then<00:05:27.680> this<00:05:28.010> little<00:05:28.669> piece<00:05:28.820> comes<00:05:29.479> out

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
this up then this little piece comes out

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.439
