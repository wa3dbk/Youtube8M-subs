pistol series obviously it's not the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.769 
pistol series obviously it's not the
world's<00:00:22.800> longest<00:00:23.010> series<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.480> don't

little bits of footage that they
streamed<00:01:32.430> out<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.820> remember<00:01:33.509> noticing<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:34.049> soon

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
streamed out I remember noticing as soon

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.749 
streamed out I remember noticing as soon
as<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> characters<00:01:35.100> knifed<00:01:35.369> into<00:01:35.640> one

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
as one of the characters knifed into one

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
as one of the characters knifed into one
of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> other<00:01:36.030> characters<00:01:36.380> there<00:01:37.380> became<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
of the other characters there became a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.240 
of the other characters there became a
nade<00:01:39.150> indicator<00:01:39.780> almost<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.890> indicate

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
nade indicator almost as if to indicate

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.530 
nade indicator almost as if to indicate
that<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.490> player<00:01:41.700> had<00:01:41.820> dropped<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.360> I'm

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
that the player had dropped it and I'm

that the player had dropped it and I'm
not<00:01:42.659> sure<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.110> about<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.740> I'm

not sure what that is about and I'm

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.980 
not sure what that is about and I'm
mining<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.490> wasn't<00:01:44.729> sure<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.180> my<00:01:45.750> nodame

mining I wasn't sure that my nodame
isn't<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> game<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.950> putting<00:01:47.189> it

isn't in the game but just putting it
out<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> small<00:01:48.600> thing<00:01:48.899> okay

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
out there just as a small thing okay

another<00:01:49.560> thing<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> did<00:01:50.220> notice<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
another thing that I did notice is the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.010 
another thing that I did notice is the
return<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.799> kimbo<00:01:53.430> akimbo<00:01:54.180> still<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.289 
return of the kimbo akimbo still in the
game<00:01:55.170> unfortunately<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:57.090> personal

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
game unfortunately and in my personal

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
game unfortunately and in my personal
opinion<00:01:57.570> akimbo<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> most

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
opinion akimbo was it's one of the most

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
it is to require to own a care package

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.220 
it is to require to own a care package
and<00:03:09.030> they<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.299> get<00:03:09.389> things<00:03:09.599> like<00:03:09.780> swim<00:03:09.989> out<00:03:10.139> of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and they can get things like swim out of

and they can get things like swim out of
it<00:03:10.319> they<00:03:10.439> completely<00:03:10.829> stuff<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.310> over<00:03:11.579> and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
it they completely stuff you over and

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.220 
it they completely stuff you over and
then<00:03:12.329> it's<00:03:12.450> just<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:12.930> adds<00:03:13.169> more

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
then it's just it just adds more

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.470 
then it's just it just adds more
inconsistency<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.250> game<00:03:14.459> another<00:03:15.239> thing

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
inconsistency to the game another thing

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.970 
inconsistency to the game another thing
as<00:03:15.599> I<00:03:15.629> noticed<00:03:16.169> that<00:03:16.319> they<00:03:16.590> were<00:03:16.620> bringing

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
as I noticed that they were bringing

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.860 
as I noticed that they were bringing
back<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.519> portable<00:03:18.030> radar<00:03:18.209> or<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.510> motion

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
back the portable radar or the motion

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.629 
back the portable radar or the motion
sensor<00:03:19.290> which<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.889> think<00:03:20.069> has<00:03:20.159> never<00:03:20.400> been

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
sensor which I think has never been

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.580 
sensor which I think has never been
fully<00:03:20.970> balanced<00:03:21.659> hopefully<00:03:22.349> they<00:03:22.530> can

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
fully balanced hopefully they can

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.170 
fully balanced hopefully they can
balance<00:03:22.859> this<00:03:23.099> out<00:03:23.250> nicely<00:03:23.519> with<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:23.879> South

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
balance this out nicely with the South

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.270 
balance this out nicely with the South
perks<00:03:24.449> and<00:03:24.659> make<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.169> good<00:03:25.680> addition<00:03:25.919> to<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
perks and make it a good addition to the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.339 
perks and make it a good addition to the
game<00:03:26.459> but<00:03:26.699> I<00:03:26.819> just<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.269> don't<00:03:27.780> know<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.079> doesn't

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
game but I just I don't know it doesn't

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.050 
game but I just I don't know it doesn't
seem<00:03:28.500> good<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.949> me<00:03:29.129> to<00:03:29.669> have<00:03:29.819> brought<00:03:30.000> that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
seem good to me to have brought that

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.369 
seem good to me to have brought that
back<00:03:30.389> it<00:03:30.569> doesn't<00:03:30.629> seem<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:30.930> an<00:03:31.139> intelligent

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
back it doesn't seem like an intelligent

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.740 
back it doesn't seem like an intelligent
move<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:32.489> me<00:03:32.639> to<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.180> brought<00:03:33.329> that<00:03:33.389> back

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
move to me to have brought that back

move to me to have brought that back
another<00:03:34.440> thing<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.739> noticed<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.099> throughout

overall which is how they actually put

it so those are just a couple of the
cons<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.199> I've<00:04:07.379> managed<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.769> pick<00:04:07.949> out<00:04:08.129> and

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
cons that I've managed to pick out and

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.849 
cons that I've managed to pick out and
these<00:04:08.760> are<00:04:08.939> obviously<00:04:09.239> all<00:04:09.419> premature

these are obviously all premature

these are obviously all premature
opinions<00:04:10.859> because<00:04:11.069> we<00:04:11.489> obviously<00:04:11.609> don't<00:04:11.909> know

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
opinions because we obviously don't know

very<00:04:12.209> much<00:04:12.540> about<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.840> game<00:04:13.019> will<00:04:13.199> have<00:04:13.259> to

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
very much about the game will have to

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.229 
very much about the game will have to
wait<00:04:13.560> until<00:04:13.769> we<00:04:14.069> get<00:04:14.189> a<00:04:14.250> couple<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.729> OPM's

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
wait until we get a couple of the OPM's

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.460 
wait until we get a couple of the OPM's
to<00:04:15.419> go<00:04:15.509> and<00:04:15.599> actually<00:04:15.689> play<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.019> game<00:04:16.259> so<00:04:16.409> we

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
to go and actually play the game so we

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.529 
to go and actually play the game so we
can<00:04:16.560> get<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.680> little<00:04:16.769> bit<00:04:16.919> more<00:04:17.039> inside<00:04:17.400> info

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
can get a little bit more inside info

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.789 
can get a little bit more inside info
but<00:04:18.539> some<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.900> things<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.169> I<00:04:19.259> did<00:04:19.530> see

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
but some of the things that I did see

but some of the things that I did see
that<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.039> did<00:04:20.220> think<00:04:20.489> well<00:04:20.609> flowing<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.239> were

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
that I did think well flowing and were

were<00:04:50.400> doing<00:04:50.670> something<00:04:51.030> wrong<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.390> it's<00:04:52.260> good

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
were doing something wrong and it's good

to<00:04:52.620> see<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.980> advancement<00:04:53.610> that<00:04:53.670> we've<00:04:53.850> made

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
to see the advancement that we've made

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.970 
to see the advancement that we've made
from<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:54.600> game<00:04:54.810> up<00:04:55.020> until<00:04:55.290> this<00:04:55.470> game<00:04:55.770> and

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
from that game up until this game and

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.310 
from that game up until this game and
now<00:04:56.580> in<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:57.060> game<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.540> looks<00:04:57.570> as<00:04:57.900> though<00:04:57.930> that

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
now in this game it looks as though that

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.110 
now in this game it looks as though that
there<00:04:58.500> are<00:04:58.620> going<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.890> be<00:04:59.010> thousands<00:04:59.910> of

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
viable options for perk setups that will

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.950 
viable options for perk setups that will
help<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:02.940> will<00:05:03.060> work<00:05:03.270> in<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.600> game<00:05:03.750> and
