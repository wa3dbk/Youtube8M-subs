00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.729
 [Music] 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.500
 Bangkok Thailand's metropolis of millions 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:09.990
 eight million inhabitants chaotic 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 traffic megacity who here for example 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 such a lamborghini gallardo sees 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.689
 he can not be sure if he 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.239
 it comes from Italy or from this 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.210
 small dead end in bangkok because exactly 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.619
 here is this workshop and behind 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.790
 her always in locked gate 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.800
 chris point italia is working 45 years old 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.300
 He is considered Thailand's best car 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.730
 forger with a slope to 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.310
 extraordinary this should be here once 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 a first martin dbs will be something 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.700
 outside looks English 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.950
 originally from Germany 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.540
 Japanese powered and now in 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.579
 thailand was the sort 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.650
 even a Opel have calibration and a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.560
 first martin dbs the engine we take 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.730
 from a toyota camry my customer has 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.440
 already a first market are mine 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.630
 Get these cars cost in the original 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.440
 a half million euro of my costs 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:09.330
 about 20,000 euros and the carbon skin 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.400
 it just comes from outside 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.310
 old rÃ¼sselsheimer on it everywhere 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.530
 screwed finished yet Christoph italia 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.670
 has great plans and visions he dreams 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.670
 from its own car 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.580
 My goal is my very own 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.620
 develop your own car 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 I think in rows or maybe 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.229
 two years will be the first project 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.090
 be finished 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.350
 I already have a few for that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.290
 inspiration brought in porsche 918 me 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.130
 have been dreaming for almost 20 years now 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.130
 actually of it 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.150
 a thai supercar with 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.250
 German inspiration Chris is looking in 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.700
 its 5000 square meters 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.960
 workshop the first copy for us 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.430
 but that's not so easy 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.430
 with all the chaos 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.970
 then he finds his sports car 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.630
 vision smart from behind and from 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.560
 ahead 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:22.370
 including distinctive name stranger der 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 foreign 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.170
 fact is the Porsche 918 spyder 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.630
 acts like the one to one model of 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.630
 christoph peters body shape 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.760
 but instead of race track there is the 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.890
 backyard and instead of modern hybrid 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.890
 engine is said to be ten years old 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.770
 twelve-cylinder from bmw the thai 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.530
 sports cars drive the danger of 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.390
 Idea-cleverness is unfounded despite the fact 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.570
 brash copy an amazing 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.570
 development 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.140
 20 years ago , I've been using replicas 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.850
 A customer started with such a one 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.810
 bugs and asked me for a porsche 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.930
 To make 911 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.190
 which has eight months took everything to 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.870
 At that time I developed everything new 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.870
 then I have one again 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.620
 made porsche but make something 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.620
 I do not anymore 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.770
 Chris and his staff have joined 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.530
 no matter which one develops 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.209
 Brand no matter what your wish the Thai 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.430
 can be outside like in any car 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.410
 transform apparent original sounds 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.230
 fittings for a Maserati one 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.209
 play with children and what used to be made of tin 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.580
 and of course that's carbon today 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.050
 point italia goes with the times and in 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.940
 he does not want quality in terms of quality 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.269
 hide 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.190
 [Music] 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.220
 that you make it carbon 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.590
 we had the body 25 years ago 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.810
 we still fiberglass but this is 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.550
 very light and also very stable 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.799
 I also use this for the porsche 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.360
 cayman, for example , come by now 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.430
 also the big manufacturers to thailand 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.540
 to have carbon produced here 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.650
 that is just cheaper in the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.349
 Meanwhile , the manufacturer also sees the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.170
 former opel calibra looks like an aston 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.510
 martin dbs today is the supplier of 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.010
 front headlights there and that indeed brings 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.130
 the ordered headlights slices 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.680
 but also a problem with the slices 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.020
 just do not fit but Chris stays 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.190
 Nobody should be politely polite here 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.870
 lose his face 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.700
 we have the over three weeks ago 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.260
 the slices ordered should 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.590
 same curves have as the original 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.060
 really half round not angular and now 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.919
 we have the problem that one here 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.600
 has made a wrong shape that does not fit 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.169
 when I look at it that way I have 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.639
 here just a gap 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.500
 in the end, the supplier is left with nothing 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.330
 other than the discs again 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.610
 to match the given form 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.550
 and delivering cost apiece measly 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.360
 80 euros hopefully including aston 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.340
 martins part 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.169
 chris practices patience because in 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.210
 thailand tick the clocks differently and 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.220
 also the ways of working differ 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.050
 However, from German conditions 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.440
 although some are almost the same here 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.440
 put 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.280
 he is leaving for chris himself 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.720
 very seldom auto he loves it after 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.210
 to go for a walk for a while 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.360
 because he has cars all day around 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.360
 yourself
