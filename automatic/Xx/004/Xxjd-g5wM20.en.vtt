00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.440
 quick cleaning windows 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello dear friends in touch 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.139
 Vasily Kupchikhin 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.580
 and today's project pc-lessons.ru 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.199
 video we will talk about how 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.029
 increase your speed 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.800
 computer 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.269
 I chose this topic not accidentally in 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.220
 Lately my computer has become 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.169
 strong enough to slow down and there was 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.919
 The decision was made to clean the system from 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.439
 any rubbish 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.480
 thereby speeding up computers for 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.720
 these goals I used the program cut 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 on 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 but before proceeding to study 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 this program let's see 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.710
 why the computer can slow down the reasons 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.400
 there may be a huge amount 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 for example your computer may 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.260
 just overheat or his 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.730
 will steal some viruses as well as this 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.830
 may be due to the fact that your 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.600
 computer littered with unnecessary junk in 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.340
 running the right programs erroneous 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.830
 links in the registry and so on and so forth 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.380
 Like this video we will analyze 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.820
 The last item from this list is 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.300
 there is a clean system from unnecessary 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.550
 garbage 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.189
 as a rule, it gives a rather large 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.869
 increase in computer speed 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.759
 I advise you to do this cleaning though. 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.049
 would be 1 month 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.260
 what about the theoretical part we 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.640
 figured out now turn to practice 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.320
 download the program C open air you can 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 at the address that is right within 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.370
 your cocoons or using 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.720
 link right below this video on 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.380
 the official website of the program to us 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.909
 offer several boot options 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.590
 We are interested in the free version of it 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.850
 differs mainly only in that they 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.850
 have technical support 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.430
 after downloading, launch the wizard 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.580
 install and follow all instructions 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.580
 choose a language 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.660
 and read nod the installation wizard here 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.610
 Incidentally unions tick 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.640
 automatically check seg updates 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.640
 the blame 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:07.020
 wait for the end of the installation and then 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:10.520
 run the program agree with 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 program and wait until it starts 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.710
 so what did our program open let's 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.090
 start studying it 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.040
 the first thing that interests us is the point 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.270
 cleaning 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.730
 here we can delete all the files that 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.380
 no systems are used as well 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.510
 clean our browser from all trash 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.880
 by the way at the same time I advise the browser 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.950
 close but before proceeding to 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.300
 cleaning, go to the application tab and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.300
 remove all unnecessary checkboxes 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.670
 for example i don't want my browser 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.970
 deleted log saved sites as well 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.500
 cookies 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.090
 I also want to leave download history 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.650
 all other opinions need to click on 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.770
 button analysis and waiting for results 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.630
 programs she tells us that 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.440
 if we clean the system then 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.090
 retire approximately 900 19 megabytes and this 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.950
 despite the fact that I cleaned the computer completely 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.830
 recently your case I think this figure 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.970
 will be several times more after analysis 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.970
 click on the cleaning button 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.680
 now our system has become a bit 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.080
 less rubbish 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.990
 but this is only the beginning now turn into 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.280
 second item registry 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.850
 here we can fix registry errors 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.410
 windows 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.750
 which can significantly affect 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.160
 computer performance is basically 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.440
 they arise because of the wrong 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.970
 uninstall programs in order to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.640
 fix registry errors click on 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.590
 button search for problems of the program to us 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.989
 gives a whole list of the most diverse 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.730
 mistakes naturally all of them need 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.360
 fix for this click on 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.360
 same button 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.150
 program I suggest to make a backup 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.709
 copy of all changes if you want 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.080
 err you can save 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.880
 backup copy and in case u 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.069
 you will have some problems in work 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.959
 systems then just run saved 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.090
 file and all registry data return to 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.160
 own places but I honestly never 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.840
 I do similar backups and while problems with 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.919
 This was not why I click on 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.870
 no button program found 467 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.850
 there are not so many problems 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.460
 it is likely that in your case this 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.900
 the figure will be much much more for 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.290
 In order to correct mistakes I click on 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.340
 a button 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.460
 fix marked program reports 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.020
 us that everything is fixed but after 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.500
 we are not in a hurry to escape from this 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.820
 section 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.710
 after you once 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.780
 scanned the system for errors 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.669
 immediately worth doing it again 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.150
 because most likely the program will find 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.520
 still some problems as you can see so she 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.290
 there is a need to re-scan 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.270
 hold until the program is 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:05:00.520
 will find any errors usually 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:02.140
 missing two three times appears 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.060
 the message that there were no problems 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.620
 found and we can rest easy 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.770
 so go to the next item 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.660
 service at this stage we have to remove 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.190
 computers all programs we don't need 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.500
 it greatly affects 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.470
 computer performance we find out 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.880
 This list is an unnecessary program and 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.880
 click on the uninstall button 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.590
 in this case, the program is correct 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.330
 retire from your computer if 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.759
 after the removal of this program remains 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.740
 list then do not rush to swear click on 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.650
 f5 button to update data 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.569
 list also there are situations when 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.319
 the program refuses correctly the day 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.000
 steel gavazzi 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.590
 in this case, you can only 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.630
 remove mark from this program 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.550
 from the registry it can be done by highlighting 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:50.050
 program and clicking on the delete button 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.759
 then just simply delete the folder 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.620
 with the program from your hard drive 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.780
 but it should be done only in the most 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.460
 extreme cases after all 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.630
 unnecessary programs will be deleted from 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.370
 computer go to section 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.169
 autoload this list stores those 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.120
 programs that start with 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.800
 running minus that is after you 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.930
 saw the windows welcome screen 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.650
 everything starts to start automatically 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.900
 these programs 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.970
 this list should also be as possible 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.770
 in short, that is, leave this 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.720
 list only those programs that you 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.849
 really needed right at startup 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.120
 system if you find an unnecessary program 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.039
 then highlight and press a button 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.570
 delete or use item 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.849
 turn off the program in this case 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.880
 will remain on this list but it will 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.380
 locked at startup 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.289
 you can always have her back if you want 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.469
 turn on and the last thing worth taking out 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.520
 this is a system restore point 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:43.240
 restore points are saved here 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.800
 windows 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.240
 thanks to them you can recover 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.699
 computer performance 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.199
 if you have something went wrong so 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.159
 I personally do not advise removing points 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.229
 system recovery 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:54.729
 but if you really need free space 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:56.409
 on the disk if you wish, you can 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:59.920
 highlight any restore point and 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:02.320
 just a remover 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.650
 but I repeat once again do not 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.060
 it is recommended that dear friends 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.620
 used in the complex of these decisions you 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.620
 can increase your speed 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.720
 computer several times doing 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.660
 similar cleaning at least 1 month and your 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.250
 computer will thank you on this i 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.500
 round with you was Vasily Kupchikhin 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.720
 and draft letter with dot ru 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.400
