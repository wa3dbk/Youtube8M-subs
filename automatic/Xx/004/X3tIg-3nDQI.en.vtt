00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.900
 Hello company with you warmly 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.880
 invest we are in the village krivodanovka 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.480
 at another site 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.970
 this is a garage under two tractors in the spring we have it 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.730
 polyurethane foam insulated inside and 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.000
 together now 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.099
 talk to the owner of the garage, he will 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.399
 your feedback on the work done 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.940
 well as here as it was earlier well earlier 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.280
 concrete a dozen how many there is no formal reply 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.519
 to life great all concrete removing quiet 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.399
 that is, but also pour, plus everything 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.589
 where is the cold from here warm well that is 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.350
 it's cold you know something about 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.409
 repaired by a tractor together let's say 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.799
 so it is necessary to thoroughly set fire to this 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:00.019
 day warm up its panels are mounted 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:03.319
 much order warmer that is 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:06.430
 a little about stoked so much now 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:08.810
 now sunk everything lies 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.619
 but how much time will be approximately 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.609
 to grow but now I will sink everything 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:20.000
 keep warm all day yes let's say 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.469
 so half the day here's a plus 10 here in 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.210
 the afternoon starts to fall 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:29.780
 leaving temperature is the same parsley 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.320
 Holt traveled almost immediately went to heat 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.630
 Here is this volume apparently it is saved 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:43.030
 just drowned everything warm again and the stove 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.030
 this 5 is what to say in principle then all 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.520
 insulation done for how much mine 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.259
 doing her husband's work in one day 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.789
 earned you damage ie 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.139
 arrived at the facility laid out 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:00.319
 the equipment zapped all the walls and to 

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:02.550
 in the evening we left 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.950
 satisfied with heat differently at all 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.530
 and plus i say repeat something 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.900
 useful now you tell here still 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.030
 once that means you have a house nearby 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.460
 which mineral chewed exactly to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.130
 garage garage mineral watch look like 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.190
 Originally, I also wanted so much mineral wool 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.650
 not its inside on plastic 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.850
 nails at spire or and it turned out between 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.950
 mineral and concrete. 1 and from there pour 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.490
 water change she absolutely does not warm 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.900
 gives away 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.230
 and holds the water and there is obtained 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.660
 analyzed 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.240
 from there cold concrete froze from here 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.940
 after a minute and passed there. 1 is 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.730
 frozen it is frozen, that is, the effect of 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.680
 no, well, scram yourself already beginning 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.080
 the flow is so natural then due to 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.060
 another press thread is then another and west 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.830
 will not fall on press 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.390
 dismantling will have soon but apparently 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:15.900
 I am pleased that she stuck and 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:19.370
 no difference between no. here you go 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.150
 actually difference from mineral wool on face 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.150
 thanks
