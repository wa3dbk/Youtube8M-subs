your<00:00:47.309> hair<00:00:47.460> follicles<00:00:47.910> making<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.360> thinner

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and thinner until the hair follicle

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
and thinner until the hair follicle
actually<00:00:50.789> dies<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.500> hair

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
actually dies and do you see that hair

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
actually dies and do you see that hair
