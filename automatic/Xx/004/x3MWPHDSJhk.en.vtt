00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
Northern Ireland now this is quite

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
Northern Ireland now this is quite
interesting<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.510> are

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
interesting because I think we are

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.389 
interesting because I think we are
looking<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.930> some<00:00:58.050> significant<00:00:58.590> snow<00:00:58.890> coming

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
looking at some significant snow coming

looking at some significant snow coming
in<00:00:59.550> across<00:00:59.910> central<00:01:00.690> lumines<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.469> head

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
in across central lumines as we head

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.110 
in across central lumines as we head
through<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.949> morning<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.430> around<00:01:02.969> the

through the morning so around the

through the morning so around the
Edinburgh<00:01:03.420> area<00:01:03.690> maybe<00:01:03.930> around<00:01:04.229> say<00:01:04.379> five

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
Edinburgh area maybe around say five

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
Edinburgh area maybe around say five
centimeters<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> snow<00:01:05.489> towards<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> Glasgow

area<00:01:06.689> maybe<00:01:07.080> 10<00:01:07.500> centimeters<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.280> snow<00:01:08.460> so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
area maybe 10 centimeters of snow so

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.219 
area maybe 10 centimeters of snow so
it's<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> good<00:01:09.360> rush<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:09.780> although

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
it's not a good rush out here although

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's not a good rush out here although
the<00:01:10.680> snow<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:11.189> ease<00:01:11.369> later<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.420> central

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the snow will ease later on for central

the snow will ease later on for central
parts<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.020> Scotland<00:01:13.170> air<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.409> move<00:01:13.560> further

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
parts of Scotland air will move further

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
parts of Scotland air will move further
south<00:01:13.890> into<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> southern<00:01:14.729> uplands<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.119> also

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
south into the southern uplands and also

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.330 
south into the southern uplands and also
Northern<00:01:16.320> Ireland<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> problem<00:01:17.310> for

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
Northern Ireland and the problem for

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.160 
Northern Ireland and the problem for
Northern<00:01:17.790> Ireland<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.360> get<00:01:18.479> rain<00:01:18.780> first

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
Northern Ireland is we get rain first

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.440 
Northern Ireland is we get rain first
and<00:01:19.470> then<00:01:20.009> snow<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> rain<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.090> wash<00:01:21.299> away

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and then snow so the rain will wash away

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
and then snow so the rain will wash away
the<00:01:21.659> grit<00:01:21.869> from<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> roads<00:01:22.320> making<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.009> all

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the grit from the roads making it all

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.679 
the grit from the roads making it all
the<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.340> problematic<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.090> afternoon<00:01:24.479> when

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the more problematic this afternoon when

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.260 
the more problematic this afternoon when
the<00:01:24.810> snow<00:01:25.140> gets<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.830> maybe<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.490> 10<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> 15

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the snow gets going maybe up to 10 to 15

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.690 
the snow gets going maybe up to 10 to 15
centimeters<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.259> snow<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.890> afternoon<00:01:29.400> so

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
centimeters of snow this afternoon so

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
centimeters of snow this afternoon so
something<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> watch<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> north

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
something to watch out for in the north

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.350

central belt of Scotland for example so

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
both see some significant snow as we

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.980 
both see some significant snow as we
head<00:07:11.730> through<00:07:12.240> the<00:07:12.390> morning<00:07:12.540> we're<00:07:12.870> looking

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
head through the morning we're looking

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.850 
head through the morning we're looking
at<00:07:13.200> maybe<00:07:13.320> 5<00:07:13.710> to<00:07:14.280> 10<00:07:14.490> centimeters<00:07:15.330> of<00:07:15.600> snow<00:07:16.230> so

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
at maybe 5 to 10 centimeters of snow so

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.410 
at maybe 5 to 10 centimeters of snow so
the<00:07:16.920> snow<00:07:17.160> here<00:07:17.370> certainly<00:07:17.670> not<00:07:17.790> looking<00:07:18.240> nice

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.420 
the snow here certainly not looking nice

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.730 
the snow here certainly not looking nice
and<00:07:18.660> through<00:07:18.870> the<00:07:18.990> day<00:07:19.110> it's<00:07:19.350> going<00:07:19.530> to<00:07:19.620> move

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 
and through the day it's going to move

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.310 
and through the day it's going to move
across<00:07:20.070> to<00:07:20.490> Northern<00:07:21.030> Ireland<00:07:21.150> so<00:07:21.840> the<00:07:22.050> snow

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320 
across to Northern Ireland so the snow

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.140 
across to Northern Ireland so the snow
initially<00:07:23.040> will<00:07:23.130> be<00:07:23.220> falling<00:07:23.400> if<00:07:23.580> rain<00:07:23.850> for

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
initially will be falling if rain for

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.490 
initially will be falling if rain for
Northern<00:07:24.420> Ireland<00:07:24.480> it's<00:07:24.780> the<00:07:24.930> mixture<00:07:25.410> of

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
Northern Ireland it's the mixture of

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.290 
Northern Ireland it's the mixture of
rain<00:07:25.650> and<00:07:25.830> sleet<00:07:25.920> and<00:07:26.250> eventually<00:07:27.030> that<00:07:27.150> it's

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
rain and sleet and eventually that it's

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.490 
rain and sleet and eventually that it's
going<00:07:27.450> to<00:07:27.510> turn<00:07:27.690> a<00:07:27.720> little<00:07:27.930> bit<00:07:28.080> more<00:07:28.170> it's

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 
going to turn a little bit more it's

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.440 
going to turn a little bit more it's
significant<00:07:29.250> so<00:07:29.640> we<00:07:29.670> are<00:07:29.820> expecting<00:07:30.300> to<00:07:30.360> see

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
significant so we are expecting to see

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.820 
significant so we are expecting to see
something<00:07:30.780> a<00:07:30.840> little<00:07:30.870> bit<00:07:31.080> heavier<00:07:31.200> maybe<00:07:31.530> 10

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830 
something a little bit heavier maybe 10

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.130 
something a little bit heavier maybe 10
to<00:07:31.980> 15<00:07:32.250> centimetres<00:07:32.910> so<00:07:33.060> not<00:07:33.630> looking<00:07:33.990> great

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.140 
to 15 centimetres so not looking great

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.540 
to 15 centimetres so not looking great
as<00:07:34.260> we<00:07:34.350> head<00:07:34.500> into<00:07:34.530> the<00:07:34.770> afternoon<00:07:34.830> here

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:35.550 
as we head into the afternoon here

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.980 
as we head into the afternoon here
further<00:07:35.970> south<00:07:36.210> or<00:07:36.330> we've<00:07:36.480> seen<00:07:36.660> with<00:07:36.780> pretty

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990 
further south or we've seen with pretty

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.810 
further south or we've seen with pretty
much<00:07:37.170> the<00:07:37.290> same<00:07:37.440> story<00:07:37.680> hopefully<00:07:38.010> some

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820 
much the same story hopefully some

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.520 
much the same story hopefully some
brighter<00:07:39.240> spells<00:07:39.630> should<00:07:39.960> come<00:07:40.170> through<00:07:40.200> but

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
brighter spells should come through but

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.590 
brighter spells should come through but
mist<00:07:40.770> and<00:07:40.980> fog<00:07:41.100> me<00:07:41.370> well<00:07:41.520> linger<00:07:41.940> in<00:07:42.090> for<00:07:42.450> much

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
mist and fog me well linger in for much

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.760 
mist and fog me well linger in for much
of<00:07:42.810> the<00:07:42.870> day<00:07:42.990> so<00:07:43.050> there's<00:07:43.290> a<00:07:43.380> snow

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770 
of the day so there's a snow

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.800 
of the day so there's a snow
working<00:07:44.430> its<00:07:44.550> way<00:07:44.700> in<00:07:44.850> across<00:07:45.120> Scotland<00:07:45.630> and

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810 
working its way in across Scotland and

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.440 
working its way in across Scotland and
Northern<00:07:46.170> Ireland<00:07:46.710> it<00:07:47.250> will<00:07:47.430> slowly<00:07:47.970> be

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:48.450 
Northern Ireland it will slowly be

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.090 
Northern Ireland it will slowly be
moving<00:07:48.750> its<00:07:48.930> way<00:07:49.080> further<00:07:49.410> side<00:07:49.800> so<00:07:49.920> if<00:07:49.980> you've

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.100 
moving its way further side so if you've
