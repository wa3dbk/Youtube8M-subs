00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.340
 We explain folding and charge of char phone about Umino 21 model 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:39.070
 Because sometimes to say carry Kedomo is simple if 30 Juie you can chain Kochijan 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.070
 Four 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.100
 I think it is better to carry the chain so as not to touch the body 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 The 20-inch model is 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:04.070
 It is devised so as not to open with partial doctor's district here tightly stuck 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:09.890
 Real is this part in order to you is it a neat feature that have 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:13.310
 If this search remains straight, it will hit the stem and one more 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:18.979
 Because this magnet may not stick to the base 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.850
 When it One of the things is that stop in a state that sometimes Is the draw was a little tilted to the left side of the square 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.850
 Am thinking 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:33.100
 In this way you raise the brake lever when the folding 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.100
 Say whether the increase for what 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.270
 In this state 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.900
 The plate of this magnet 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:56.160
 As properly seated on the opposite side 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.160
 Greetings radar'll do in order to say that creating a space that does not get in the way 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.640
 We always get in such form 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.740
 but 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.850
 How far to raise the angle of the gree bar or the height of the handle stem 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.120
 Unfortunately when it comes to that 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.710
 There is only gain experience is related to this 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.210
 With the aim of it why so you know it is that it is this side while you are doing Toka What 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:24.460
 I think it would be nice if you could do something 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.910
 To something in the will swollen or worse often wire when to deploy in this kind of wind after 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:32.170
 I think it should be careful not to get stuck 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:37.380
 I used to hang a wire in here before and the cable was damaged . 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.380
 I think that good to get done slowly calm because 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:50.250
 I think the above points as a point of caution I have to put the stone of ha here 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.719
 There is no such thing, so it is received by all in a very easy- to- understand folding 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.590
 I think it is a model 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:03:03.840
 However , when carrying it, it is a transmission here that it is only one point and it is 10th place 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:09.090
 As this comes to the outermost from good or bad , when carrying it 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.840
 If the shift is broken , this is a common thing even with a small road racer person 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.230
 Even though I 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:18.580
 If it is an article, I think it would be better to give it a bit 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:24.030
 The transmission is in the packaging and Shi many or situation or place in the car 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.030
 I think that it can be said that it is necessary to pay attention not to do
