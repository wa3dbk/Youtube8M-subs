can<00:02:30.769> put<00:02:30.920> two<00:02:31.220> cakes<00:02:31.459> because<00:02:31.640> they<00:02:31.849> only<00:02:31.970> have

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
can put two cakes because they only have

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.970 
can put two cakes because they only have
about<00:02:32.450> four<00:02:32.810> gauge<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.200> can<00:02:33.290> turn<00:02:33.409> them<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
about four gauge so you can turn them a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.619 
about four gauge so you can turn them a
lot<00:02:34.340> about<00:02:34.489> annoying<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:35.000> really<00:02:35.239> want<00:02:35.390> higher

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
lot about annoying I really want higher

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.740 
lot about annoying I really want higher
I<00:02:36.129> think<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.400> most<00:02:37.579> I<00:02:37.760> want<00:02:37.939> enough<00:02:38.269> computer

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
I think the most I want enough computer

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.720 
I think the most I want enough computer
from<00:02:38.870> over<00:02:39.019> there<00:02:39.290> seen<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.889> and<00:02:40.129> 13<00:02:40.519> bags

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
from over there seen that and 13 bags

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.460 
from over there seen that and 13 bags
around<00:02:40.939> maybe<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:42.069> looks<00:02:43.069> crazy<00:02:43.340> sweet<00:02:44.470> so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
around maybe it's looks crazy sweet so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.629 
around maybe it's looks crazy sweet so
that's<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.920> Nevada<00:02:46.400> Nevada<00:02:47.439> g-force<00:02:48.439> sucks<00:02:49.220> CDs

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
that's a Nevada Nevada g-force sucks CDs

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:57.460 
that's a Nevada Nevada g-force sucks CDs
this<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.389> I<00:02:52.000> think<00:02:53.739> model<00:02:55.959> toys<00:02:56.959> might<00:02:57.260> get

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
this is I think model toys might get

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.710 
this is I think model toys might get
even<00:02:57.680> though<00:02:57.769> something<00:02:57.980> says<00:02:58.329> said<00:02:59.329> nyan<00:02:59.569> and

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
even though something says said nyan and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.050 
even though something says said nyan and
it<00:03:00.970> looks<00:03:01.970> like<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.950> same<00:03:04.400> guy<00:03:04.459> said<00:03:04.849> they<00:03:04.939> all

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
it looks like the same guy said they all

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.539 
it looks like the same guy said they all
cleaned<00:03:05.359> that<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.590> think<00:03:06.709> he's<00:03:07.189> done<00:03:07.370> is

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
cleaned that so I think he's done is

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.990 
cleaned that so I think he's done is
he's<00:03:07.700> taken<00:03:07.730> off<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.750> oh<00:03:09.430> my<00:03:10.430> god<00:03:10.579> wasn't<00:03:10.879> even

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
he's taken off the oh my god wasn't even

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.789 
he's taken off the oh my god wasn't even
in<00:03:11.090> short<00:03:11.299> there<00:03:11.419> I<00:03:11.659> am<00:03:11.840> thank<00:03:12.439> you<00:03:12.530> sticking

in short there I am thank you sticking
off<00:03:12.889> the<00:03:12.980> heat<00:03:13.129> sink<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:13.609> I<00:03:13.639> think<00:03:13.819> I'm<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.209> I

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
off the heat sink so I think I'm I I

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.969 
off the heat sink so I think I'm I I
don't<00:03:14.780> know<00:03:15.139> I<00:03:15.349> think<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.979> should<00:03:16.010> replace<00:03:16.699> the

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:17.979 
don't know I think I should replace the

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.409 
don't know I think I should replace the
the<00:03:18.979> same<00:03:19.190> or<00:03:19.370> grease<00:03:19.579> on<00:03:19.729> it<00:03:19.849> but<00:03:20.060> yeah<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.299> was

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
the same or grease on it but yeah it was

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.710 
the same or grease on it but yeah it was
quite<00:03:20.780> good<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:22.340> get<00:03:22.519> some<00:03:22.729> people<00:03:23.419> to<00:03:23.510> watch

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
quite good we get some people to watch

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.960 
quite good we get some people to watch
him<00:03:24.079> 1080p<00:03:24.979> video<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.370> never<00:03:25.549> filtered

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
him 1080p video is never filtered

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.360 
him 1080p video is never filtered
pausing<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.780> starting<00:03:27.290> looks<00:03:28.010> like<00:03:28.159> we<00:03:28.250> can

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
pausing and starting looks like we can

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.039 
pausing and starting looks like we can
do<00:03:28.489> some<00:03:28.669> I'm<00:03:28.909> soaked<00:03:29.269> or<00:03:29.389> some<00:03:29.510> add-ons<00:03:29.659> here

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
do some I'm soaked or some add-ons here

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.479 
do some I'm soaked or some add-ons here
looks<00:03:30.319> like<00:03:30.500> some<00:03:30.709> new<00:03:30.859> connectors<00:03:31.340> or

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
looks like some new connectors or

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.140 
looks like some new connectors or
something<00:03:31.790> huh

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
something huh

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.670 
something huh
this<00:03:32.599> is<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.900> very<00:03:33.049> very<00:03:33.199> good<00:03:33.409> shape<00:03:35.680> these

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
this is in very very good shape these

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.379 
this is in very very good shape these
capacitors<00:03:37.190> they<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.639> I<00:03:37.760> think<00:03:37.819> the<00:03:38.120> same

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
capacitors they just I think the same

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.059 
capacitors they just I think the same
these<00:03:38.780> are<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.959> capacitors<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:39.560> blows

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
these are the capacitors that blows

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.009 
these are the capacitors that blows
Baltimore<00:03:40.579> just<00:03:40.760> go<00:03:40.879> bang<00:03:41.150> instead<00:03:41.659> of<00:03:41.810> their

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
Baltimore just go bang instead of their

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.210 
Baltimore just go bang instead of their
release<00:03:42.409> off<00:03:42.620> once<00:03:43.069> but<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.209> don't<00:03:44.479> see<00:03:44.750> any

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
release off once but I don't see any

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.589 
release off once but I don't see any
burn<00:03:47.019> so<00:03:48.019> I'm<00:03:48.109> just<00:03:48.260> having<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.829> quick<00:03:49.040> look<00:03:49.599> it

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
burn so I'm just having a quick look it

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.379 
burn so I'm just having a quick look it
looks<00:03:50.840> all<00:03:51.049> to<00:03:51.199> be<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:51.349> good<00:03:51.560> shape<00:03:54.699> yeah<00:03:55.699> it's

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
looks all to be in good shape yeah it's

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.020 
looks all to be in good shape yeah it's
good

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
good

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.210 
good
so<00:03:59.030> clean<00:03:59.449> not<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.139> stage<00:04:00.409> Scott<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:00.949> am<00:04:00.979> I

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
so clean not the stage Scott I am I

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.469 
so clean not the stage Scott I am I
think<00:04:01.310> that's<00:04:01.519> a<00:04:01.579> branch<00:04:01.760> connector<00:04:02.239> you<00:04:02.329> can

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
think that's a branch connector you can

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.679 
think that's a branch connector you can
join<00:04:03.319> two<00:04:03.530> graphics<00:04:04.129> cards<00:04:04.159> together<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:05.569> I'm

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
join two graphics cards together and I'm

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.339 
join two graphics cards together and I'm
just<00:04:05.720> hoping<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.409> don't<00:04:06.470> need<00:04:06.799> but<00:04:07.010> Jamar<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.519> am

just hoping I don't need but Jamar I am

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:15.999 
just hoping I don't need but Jamar I am

think I'll be getting on this feed patio

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.090 
think I'll be getting on this feed patio
keyboard<00:04:29.020> see<00:04:29.139> if<00:04:29.199> I<00:04:29.259> can<00:04:29.380> get<00:04:29.500> accent<00:04:29.889> and
