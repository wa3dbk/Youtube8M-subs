breath after my Stevie point all right
so<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.240> common<00:01:15.930> problems<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> deadlift

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so now common problems with the deadlift

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.700 
so now common problems with the deadlift
all<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.220> here's<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:18.710> conv

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
all right here's what I see conv

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.380 
all right here's what I see conv
problems<00:01:20.040> number<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.460> people<00:01:20.759> will<00:01:21.090> try<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
problems number one people will try and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.679 
problems number one people will try and
mimic<00:01:22.140> their<00:01:22.470> squat<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.880> them<00:01:24.060> using<00:01:24.330> too

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
mimic their squat I see them using too

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.700 
mimic their squat I see them using too
wide<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.170> stance

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
wide of a stance

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.429 
wide of a stance
they'll<00:01:26.220> try<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.439> then

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
they'll try and be like this and then

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.740 
they'll try and be like this and then
they'll<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:28.979> grab<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:30.090> your

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
they'll go grab it like this if your

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.660 
they'll go grab it like this if your
arms<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.530> right<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.890> front<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.369> knees

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
arms are right in front of your knees

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.819 
arms are right in front of your knees
then<00:01:33.479> you're<00:01:33.659> having<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.079> lean<00:01:34.290> forward<00:01:34.470> more

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
then you're having to lean forward more

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.039 
then you're having to lean forward more
that's<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.460> good<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.299> arms<00:01:36.659> need<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> go

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that's not good the arms need to go

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.060 
that's not good the arms need to go
either<00:01:37.229> between<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:39.060> knees<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.750> 70<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.650> if

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
either between the knees or out 70 so if

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.700 
either between the knees or out 70 so if
you're<00:01:41.189> doing<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.430> conventional<00:01:42.000> deadlift

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
you're doing a conventional deadlift

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.350 
you're doing a conventional deadlift
the<00:01:43.710> arms<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.579> outside<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> knees

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the arms going right outside the knees

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.760 
the arms going right outside the knees
like<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.020> you're<00:01:46.170> doing<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.409> sumo

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
like this if you're doing a sumo

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.120 
like this if you're doing a sumo
deadlift<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.630> arms<00:01:48.990> would<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.320> inside

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
deadlift then the arms would go inside

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.940 
deadlift then the arms would go inside
the<00:01:50.310> knees<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:52.229> are<00:01:52.530> here<00:01:52.799> or

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the knees so see that these are here or

another<00:04:34.850> problem<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:37.460> we'll<00:04:37.729> do<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.910> good

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
another problem is so we'll do a good

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.129 
another problem is so we'll do a good
demo<00:04:39.370> concentric<00:04:40.370> ly<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.880> then<00:04:41.270> eccentric<00:04:41.990> ly

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
demo concentric ly and then eccentric ly

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.350 
demo concentric ly and then eccentric ly
their<00:04:42.320> form<00:04:42.650> falls<00:04:42.979> apart<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:44.180> that's

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
their form falls apart and that's

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.879 
their form falls apart and that's
because<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.720> lot<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:44.960> times<00:04:45.229> people<00:04:45.440> lift<00:04:45.770> up

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
because a lot of times people lift up

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.350 
because a lot of times people lift up
and<00:04:46.010> then<00:04:46.070> just<00:04:46.250> drop<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.639> way<00:04:46.789> they're<00:04:47.150> used

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
and then just drop the way they're used

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.960 
and then just drop the way they're used
to<00:04:47.449> Olympic<00:04:47.840> lifting<00:04:48.199> or<00:04:48.380> or<00:04:48.889> they<00:04:49.789> don't

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
to Olympic lifting or or they don't

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.700 
to Olympic lifting or or they don't
really<00:04:50.150> think<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.720> eccentric<00:04:51.199> is<00:04:51.320> important

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
really think the eccentric is important

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.620 
really think the eccentric is important
the<00:04:52.100> eccentric<00:04:52.699> face<00:04:53.030> should<00:04:53.270> look<00:04:53.330> exactly

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
the eccentric face should look exactly

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.629 
the eccentric face should look exactly
like<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.110> concentric<00:04:54.620> tree<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:54.979> I<00:04:55.010> watch<00:04:55.220> people

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
like a concentric tree so I watch people

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.689 
like a concentric tree so I watch people
and<00:04:55.789> they'll<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:57.680> know<00:04:57.710> they'll<00:04:58.220> give<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.490> good

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
and they'll you know they'll give a good

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.270 
and they'll you know they'll give a good
debit<00:04:59.470> and<00:05:00.470> then<00:05:00.620> from<00:05:00.860> here<00:05:00.889> we'll<00:05:01.220> go<00:05:03.280> like

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
debit and then from here we'll go like

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.310 
debit and then from here we'll go like
that<00:05:04.490> no<00:05:04.880> these<00:05:05.270> are<00:05:05.419> mirror<00:05:05.720> images<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:06.199> one

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
that no these are mirror images of one

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
that no these are mirror images of one
another

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:20.750 

this<00:05:12.970> exact<00:05:13.810> same<00:05:14.110> okay<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:17.550> trying<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.610> think

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
this exact same okay so trying to think

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.980 
this exact same okay so trying to think
I'm<00:05:21.760> trying<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.060> end<00:05:22.210> guy<00:05:22.300> and<00:05:22.570> hit<00:05:22.750> all<00:05:22.870> the

I'm trying to end guy and hit all the
major<00:05:23.169> points<00:05:23.710> but<00:05:24.100> it<00:05:24.820> just<00:05:25.120> takes<00:05:25.330> practice

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
major points but it just takes practice

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.080 
major points but it just takes practice
and<00:05:25.840> some<00:05:26.110> people<00:05:26.350> don't<00:05:26.560> have<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.830> mobility

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090

the<00:06:12.400> back<00:06:12.729> like<00:06:12.970> that<00:06:13.000> so<00:06:14.010> if<00:06:15.010> you<00:06:15.220> have<00:06:15.250> for

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
the back like that so if you have for

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.550 
the back like that so if you have for
entry<00:06:15.910> flexibility<00:06:16.539> you're<00:06:16.870> gonna<00:06:17.110> round<00:06:17.350> in

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
entry flexibility you're gonna round in

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.219 
entry flexibility you're gonna round in
the<00:06:17.650> depth<00:06:17.979> in<00:06:18.070> that<00:06:18.160> case<00:06:18.780> start<00:06:19.780> people<00:06:19.990> off

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
the depth in that case start people off

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.050 
the depth in that case start people off
out<00:06:20.800> of<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:21.160> rack<00:06:21.720> okay<00:06:23.460> problem<00:06:24.460> with<00:06:24.580> rifles

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
out of the rack okay problem with rifles

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.420 
out of the rack okay problem with rifles
I<00:06:25.210> see<00:06:25.479> is<00:06:25.570> people<00:06:25.840> will<00:06:26.560> lie<00:06:26.740> on<00:06:26.770> a<00:06:26.919> far<00:06:27.160> away

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
I see is people will lie on a far away

flexibility this okay

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:06.579 
flexibility this okay
so<00:07:04.729> you<00:07:05.300> don't<00:07:05.479> have<00:07:05.629> good<00:07:06.349> hamstring

so you don't have good hamstring
flexibility<00:07:07.249> you<00:07:07.339> can<00:07:07.399> still<00:07:07.789> provide<00:07:08.479> a

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:08.539 
flexibility you can still provide a

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:11.709 
flexibility you can still provide a
training<00:07:08.869> effect<00:07:09.349> by<00:07:10.219> doing<00:07:10.489> rifles<00:07:10.909> work<00:07:11.449> on

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:11.719

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:22.689 
start doing the full rate debit hope you
found<00:07:18.739> these<00:07:18.979> videos<00:07:19.399> useful<00:07:19.639> thanks<00:07:20.479> a<00:07:20.539> lot
