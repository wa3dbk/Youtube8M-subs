00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
cram stuff inside I'm far more likely to

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.210 
cram stuff inside I'm far more likely to
leave<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.420> corded<00:01:25.930> tool<00:01:26.080> out<00:01:26.320> on<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.590> bench<00:01:26.830> if

I got to wrap it up and cram it in a
drawer<00:01:29.409> summer<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.640> made<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.909> spot<00:01:31.270> right

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
drawer summer so I made a spot right

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.170 
drawer summer so I made a spot right
under<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.380> top<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:33.310> put<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.670> power<00:01:33.850> tools

that I use most they stay plugged into a
power<00:01:36.759> strip<00:01:37.299> so<00:01:37.689> all<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:37.869> have<00:01:38.080> to<00:01:38.110> do<00:01:38.290> is<00:01:38.380> plug

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
but since I did it I've already found an

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.700 
but since I did it I've already found an
easier<00:02:04.329> way<00:02:04.509> which<00:02:04.990> I'll<00:02:05.170> show<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.409> in<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.560> few
