fireplace this is not a track sometimes

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.450 
fireplace this is not a track sometimes
people<00:01:17.549> confuse<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.560> wanted<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
people confuse that so I wanted to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
people confuse that so I wanted to
clarify<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:21.360> top<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.439> bit<00:01:22.590> more

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
clarify up top here a little bit more

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460 
clarify up top here a little bit more
about<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> tracks<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> two-sided

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
about the tracks this is a two-sided

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
about the tracks this is a two-sided
rail<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.520> or<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.150> two-channel<00:01:27.990> rail

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
rail right here or a two-channel rail

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.819 
rail right here or a two-channel rail
and<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> pin<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.420> pin<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.020> critical

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and in it is a pin the pin is critical

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.690 
and in it is a pin the pin is critical
so<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.270> where<00:01:33.479> your<00:01:33.600> glass<00:01:33.960> will

go<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.600> right<00:01:36.869> into<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.409> hole

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
go and it will go right into the hole

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
go and it will go right into the hole
that<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.630> where

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that you see up top here that's where

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.749 
that you see up top here that's where
the<00:01:39.840> pin<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> glass<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.799> go<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.250> these

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the pin for the glass will go and these

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.450 
the pin for the glass will go and these
two<00:01:42.030> rails<00:01:42.329> allow<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.960> glass<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.710> slide<00:01:44.070> back

come out you'll want to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.490 
come out you'll want to
from<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.520> top<00:02:07.729> of<00:02:07.909> your<00:02:08.000> frame<00:02:08.330> up<00:02:08.720> top<00:02:09.140> here

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
from the top of your frame up top here

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.320 
from the top of your frame up top here
you'll<00:02:09.709> see<00:02:09.890> right<00:02:10.069> above<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.459> track<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
you'll see right above the track the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.780 
you'll see right above the track the
edge<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.780> frame<00:02:12.050> down<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.400> bottom

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
edge of the frame down to the bottom

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.260 
edge of the frame down to the bottom
down<00:02:14.240> here<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.930> if<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.340> track<00:02:16.610> comes<00:02:16.880> out<00:02:17.060> is

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
down here and if the track comes out is

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.449 
down here and if the track comes out is
typically<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.780> couple<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.260> screws<00:02:18.680> right<00:02:19.220> in

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
typically a couple of screws right in

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.729 
typically a couple of screws right in
the<00:02:19.880> track<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.750> take<00:02:20.989> those<00:02:21.200> out<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.500> track

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
the track you take those out the track

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.590 
the track you take those out the track
will<00:02:21.920> come<00:02:22.069> right<00:02:22.310> out<00:02:22.340> allowing<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.360> put

no tracks there's no nothing
we<00:02:36.590> simply<00:02:36.980> built<00:02:37.280> him<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:38.060> frame<00:02:38.840> with<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> great

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
we simply built him a frame with a great

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.030 
we simply built him a frame with a great
set<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.220> doors<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.650> he<00:02:42.650> measured<00:02:42.980> the

opening side to side and top to bottom

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.250 
opening side to side and top to bottom
we<00:02:46.730> put<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:46.970> little<00:02:47.150> breathing<00:02:47.450> room<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:47.989> there

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
we put a little breathing room in there

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.920 
we put a little breathing room in there
and<00:02:48.730> got<00:02:49.730> him<00:02:49.850> his<00:02:49.970> doors<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.569> turned<00:02:50.780> out

you're going to want to look for and

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.680 
you're going to want to look for and
consider<00:03:33.440> down<00:03:34.400> on<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.700> bottom<00:03:34.880> here<00:03:35.480> you'll

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
consider down on the bottom here you'll

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.380 
consider down on the bottom here you'll
see<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.380> bottom<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.190> fireplace<00:03:37.430> opening

see the bottom of the fireplace opening
and<00:03:39.350> this<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.769> where<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.040> frame<00:03:40.340> will<00:03:40.609> sit<00:03:41.030> and

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
and this is where the frame will sit and

and this is where the frame will sit and
this<00:03:42.079> is<00:03:42.230> where<00:03:42.410> you'll<00:03:42.530> measure<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.640> plan

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
this is where you'll measure and plan

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.140 
this is where you'll measure and plan
for<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.359> go<00:03:44.570> this<00:03:45.160> is<00:03:46.160> an<00:03:46.459> example<00:03:46.970> right

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150
