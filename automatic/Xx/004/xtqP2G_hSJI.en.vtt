 simply but possibly no one has seen here in the principality 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.790
 because you win five consecutive years with him you expect everything said 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.969
 power based on pib to victory of nadal before ferrero in 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.880

 face-to-face matches 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.039
 although we had stolen red earlier in the preview that in February took 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.479
 the victory in the last duel of Rome in 2008 when 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579

 reuters was carried out so far with the reverse 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.510
 nothing to do 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.690
 a point to culminate nadal his victory number 30 consecutive in this tournament of 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.710
 Monte Carlo 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.650

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.370
 what right of but the defense rafael king now accuses these problems the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.410
 armed they managed like this when it was redoubled would have won at this point 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.110
 sure with another rival 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.410
 on the front 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.070
 It would be wonderful uncoordinated to have been worse 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 he gets behind the ball and it was too good 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.549
 I'm not going to the end to prepare this shot with how irak does 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.780
 for it was fair to say that on the side 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 never face the ball 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 over the look 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.409
 fifteen equal commented that the ball stays behind the head poli pasea

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.270

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.059
 much more disputed ways than the previous days 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.489
 the tri had a well deserved and I ended up taking out a great tournament on his part 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.849

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:22.309
 CD 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:25.809
 he has seen him with a very different attitude to the Valencian in his return 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:28.990
 after the break because of the rain remember that the score was with 3 

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:29.779
 a 2 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.050
 for ferrero 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.050
 nadal before had also had his for a particular 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.979
 due to the wind it was decentralized and in partial s of 0 3 against when he 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.889
 had started the game already with a break in the police in the serve of 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.039
 Juan Carlos Ferrero 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.550
 and while we see the signature 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.169
