speaking of dash demons uh I like using
close<00:01:21.210> standing<00:01:21.600> strong<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> reason<00:01:23.610> why<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
close standing strong the reason why I

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.830 
close standing strong the reason why I
like<00:01:24.000> doing<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.630> he<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:26.390> positive<00:01:27.390> 2<00:01:27.420> on

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
like doing that is he is positive 2 on

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.929 
like doing that is he is positive 2 on
block<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> closed<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> withdraw<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.820> he's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
block with a closed and withdraw so he's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.550 
block with a closed and withdraw so he's
got<00:01:30.090> frame<00:01:30.420> advantage<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.380> do

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
got frame advantage right if you do

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.020 
got frame advantage right if you do
something<00:01:31.770> without<00:01:32.009> frame<00:01:32.430> advantage<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
something without frame advantage and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
something without frame advantage and
you<00:01:33.119> go<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> dash<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.840> there's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> possibility

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you go to dash up there's a possibility

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
you go to dash up there's a possibility
they<00:01:35.159> could<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> move<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.270> stops<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.869> but

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
they could do a move that stops you but

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.289 
they could do a move that stops you but
essentially<00:01:37.770> any<00:01:37.950> kind<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> somewhat<00:01:39.090> quick

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
essentially any kind of somewhat quick

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.160 
essentially any kind of somewhat quick
recovery<00:01:39.570> move<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> dash<00:01:40.560> team

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170

offer full standing strong gives you a
little<00:01:53.070> more<00:01:53.190> leeway<00:01:53.450> stops<00:01:54.450> maybe<00:01:55.020> him<00:01:55.350> from

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
little more leeway stops maybe him from

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.530 
little more leeway stops maybe him from
hitting<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.370> right<00:01:56.610> let's<00:01:57.360> try

second hit of his standing round patch
is<00:03:56.310> parsing<00:03:56.849> house<00:03:58.190> whips<00:03:59.190> right<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.150> is

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
is parsing house whips right so this is

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.990 
is parsing house whips right so this is
perfect<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.930> buffering<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.890> demon<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.549> right

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
perfect for buffering a demon in right

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.740 
perfect for buffering a demon in right
so<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.840> could<00:04:05.239> write<00:04:06.239> grab<00:04:06.720> them<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:07.019> that

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
so you could write grab them like that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.880 
so you could write grab them like that
and<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.989> course<00:04:10.049> you're<00:04:10.349> going<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.799> it

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
and of course you're going to like do it

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.270 
and of course you're going to like do it
like<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> block<00:04:11.280> stir<00:04:11.750> all<00:04:12.750> right<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.680> could

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.670

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
write because if you're too close you

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.650 
write because if you're too close you
get<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:19.919> far<00:04:20.190> standing<00:04:20.579> around<00:04:20.760> house<00:04:21.000> right
