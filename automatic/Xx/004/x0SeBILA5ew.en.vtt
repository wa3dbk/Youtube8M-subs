have you ever had to stick your head
into<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> tree<00:00:27.330> even<00:00:27.869> though<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.230> scoped<00:00:28.710> out

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
into a tree even though you scoped out

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.640 
into a tree even though you scoped out
before<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.340> put<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.670> sections<00:00:30.150> together

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
before you put the sections together

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.889 
before you put the sections together
somehow<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.040> plug<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:32.969> cord<00:00:33.270> managed<00:00:33.750> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
somehow the plug or the cord managed to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.010 
somehow the plug or the cord managed to
hide<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.640> before<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.840> ears

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
hide and before you know it your ears

have been bottle brushed out and the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.979 
have been bottle brushed out and the
whole<00:00:38.700> bit<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.000> your<00:00:39.270> hair<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> mess

and you're really aggravated

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.290 
and you're really aggravated
well<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.899> eliminates<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:44.000> starting<00:00:45.000> with

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
well this eliminates that starting with

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.049 
well this eliminates that starting with
you'll<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> difference<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.250> base<00:00:47.460> of

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you'll see the difference in the base of

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.000 
you'll see the difference in the base of
course<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> standard<00:00:49.289> heavy<00:00:49.680> gauge

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
course this is the standard heavy gauge

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.810 
course this is the standard heavy gauge
metal<00:00:50.399> base<00:00:51.410> swinging<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.579> you'll

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
metal base swinging out but you'll

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.459 
metal base swinging out but you'll
notice<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> cord

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
notice it has the cord

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.770 
notice it has the cord
well<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> electrical<00:00:56.730> system<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.300> starts

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
well the electrical system all starts

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.459 
well the electrical system all starts
through<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.620> base<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.480> as<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.840> are<00:01:00.930> working

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
through the base and as you are working

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.189 
through the base and as you are working
you<00:01:01.680> will<00:01:01.739> notice<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.149> plug<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.809> done

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you will notice that the plug is done

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.920 
you will notice that the plug is done
within<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.799> trunk<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> nice

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
within the trunk so you have the nice

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.859 
within the trunk so you have the nice
rounded<00:01:07.920> plug<00:01:08.369> system<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.330> everything

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
rounded plug system which everything

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.090 
rounded plug system which everything
goes<00:01:10.229> into<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.600> place<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.350> base<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
goes into so as we place the base on the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
goes into so as we place the base on the
floor<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> foot<00:01:15.450> switch<00:01:15.689> going

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
floor and you have the foot switch going

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.859 
floor and you have the foot switch going
there<00:01:16.790> then<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.180> take<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.450> first

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
there then you just take your first

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.730 
there then you just take your first
section<00:01:20.330> line<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.780> pole<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.530> like

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
section line up your pole just like

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.710 
section line up your pole just like
always<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:24.500> slide<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> down<00:01:25.830> within<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
always and slide it down within and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.760 
always and slide it down within and
instantly<00:01:27.799> your<00:01:28.799> lit<00:01:29.780> do<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.470> each

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
instantly your lit do this with each

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.140 
instantly your lit do this with each
section<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.360> progress<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.700> no<00:01:35.700> having<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
section as you progress and no having to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.440 
section as you progress and no having to
look<00:01:36.360> no<00:01:37.350> specific<00:01:38.340> way<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
look no specific way that you have to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.780 
look no specific way that you have to
have<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> turned<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.280> plug<00:01:41.549> system

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
have it turned because the plug system

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.480 
have it turned because the plug system
is<00:01:42.090> perfectly<00:01:42.479> round<00:01:44.600> immediately<00:01:46.490> just

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
is perfectly round immediately just
