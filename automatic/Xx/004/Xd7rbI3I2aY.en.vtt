00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.300 
it on then you hold the tail cap for
like<00:02:16.870> four<00:02:17.140> seconds<00:02:19.830> all<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.280> lights

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
like four seconds all of the lights

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.810 
like four seconds all of the lights
flash<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:23.170> white<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.980> green<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.940> UV<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
flash the the white the green the UV and

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.490 
flash the the white the green the UV and
the<00:02:27.820> red<00:02:28.090> laser<00:02:28.360> everything<00:02:29.140> starts<00:02:29.590> flashing

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the red laser everything starts flashing

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.630 
the red laser everything starts flashing
it's<00:02:32.500> pretty<00:02:32.770> cool<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:35.170> only<00:02:35.530> drawback<00:02:36.190> to

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it's pretty cool the only drawback to

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.550 
it's pretty cool the only drawback to
this<00:02:37.120> flashlight<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:39.040> my<00:02:39.070> opinion<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.000> it

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.530 

you<00:02:44.560> can't<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.880> turn<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.330> light

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you can't just like turn on the light

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.100 
you can't just like turn on the light
and<00:02:46.780> then<00:02:47.520> turn<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.550> off<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:49.330> have<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.750> cycle

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
and then turn it off you have to cycle

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.050 
and then turn it off you have to cycle
through<00:02:50.350> all<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:52.360> modes<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.860> finally<00:02:54.820> shut

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
through all of the modes to finally shut

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.370 
through all of the modes to finally shut
it<00:02:55.239> down<00:02:55.830> that's<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.100> only<00:02:57.340> drawback<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
it down that's the only drawback the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.020 
it down that's the only drawback the
only<00:02:59.590> thing<00:02:59.800> that<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.160> don't<00:03:00.519> care<00:03:00.760> for

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
only thing that I don't care for

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.710 
only thing that I don't care for
personally<00:03:01.840> but<00:03:02.050> other<00:03:02.260> than<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:03.340> a

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
personally but other than that it's a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.780 
personally but other than that it's a
very<00:03:04.720> nice<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.709> flashlight<00:03:06.280> very<00:03:07.000> cool<00:03:07.330> has

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
very nice the flashlight very cool has

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.039 
very nice the flashlight very cool has
some<00:03:09.790> nice<00:03:10.890> texturing<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.040> guess<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.310> call<00:03:12.519> it

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
some nice texturing I guess you call it

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:26.520 
some nice texturing I guess you call it
knurling<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:15.180> foregrip<00:03:19.920> tailcap<00:03:20.920> operation

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.840 

let's<00:03:27.530> see<00:03:27.710> you<00:03:27.860> don't<00:03:28.070> have<00:03:28.190> anything<00:03:28.370> metal

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
let's see you don't have anything metal

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.150 
let's see you don't have anything metal
here<00:03:29.330> because<00:03:29.570> this<00:03:30.010> tail<00:03:31.010> cap<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.610> magnetic

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
here because this tail cap is magnetic

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.850 
here because this tail cap is magnetic
you<00:03:34.160> can<00:03:34.370> use<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:36.200> if<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:36.530> are<00:03:36.590> working

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
you can use it like if you are working

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.350 
you can use it like if you are working
under<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.280> hood<00:03:37.520> of<00:03:37.610> your<00:03:37.640> car<00:03:37.940> or<00:03:38.000> something

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
under the hood of your car or something

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.840 
under the hood of your car or something
you<00:03:38.570> can<00:03:38.750> pop<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.410> up<00:03:39.500> there<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:40.040> if<00:03:40.670> you

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
you can pop it up there and if you

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.000 
you can pop it up there and if you
needed<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.180> light<00:03:41.390> if<00:03:41.930> you're<00:03:42.170> doing<00:03:42.890> something

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
needed a light if you're doing something
