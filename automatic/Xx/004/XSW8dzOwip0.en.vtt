00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.049
 I'm going to show you how you can do this 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.599
 little ribbon flower with this you can 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.799
 decorate bathing suits backpacks 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:18.470
 notebooks purses whatever you want and 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.210
 good if you like continue to see the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.990
 video 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.740
 well quickly for this one 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:32.090
 the little flower we are going to occupy 75 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:36.850
 centimeters of this ribbon can occupy 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.850
 from another but I want from this one 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.900
 that is about 2 centimeters wide 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:49.460
 and 75 long and we're going to occupy a 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.650
 pebble a ball a pompom what you 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.670
 you want to put in the center we're going to 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.629
 load our needle 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.239
 and let's do the following we're going to 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.539
 burn as you know the edges so that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.339
 do not fray our list then 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.619
 what we are going to do here is going to be what 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.619
 next let's do this 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.100
 It is a triangle 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.100
 and then we are going to double here 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.130
 and let's start 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.460
 sew the little ears here 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.620
 very carefully 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.670
 As I told you, be patient 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.760
 and also 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.790
 well 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.540
 without bothering you the first go back to 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.540
 try 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.920
 A) Yes 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.020
 It's our little picture, I will not be 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.009
 doing for you to see after here 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.290
 let's turn it around and let's do 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.870
 this and we will continue to cook in 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.790
 our parts of here then you 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.810
 we double 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.859
 and again like that and we sew this side like this 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.939
 we are going to go all our for 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:34.380
 our squares so right now 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:37.680
 I finished showed you how it is 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.910
 and well here I finished until the last 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.740
 and right now it does not have to stay 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.740
 to start pulling from here 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.190
 not not so much for it to be 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.380
 it depends on you sim here is very closed 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.380
 or normal 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.340
 so it's good then here we are going to 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.340
 close 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.900
 we closed now let's load 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:45.860
 again our needle and let's do 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.860
 this is going to go around like that 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.450
 if you are doing an account 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.640
 we try to accommodate our petals 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.640
 forward to give us this 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.100
 and so that we stay like this we're going 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.830
 to grab the boom as I taught you with the 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:15.230
 pink we have to start you 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.180
 pass the needle on this side 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.970
 example here is 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.970
 and we are going to do only the shores 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.300
 sorry I got a little bit of the thread 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.300
 but good 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.990
 but we are going to do it a little bit 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.800
 bit 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.360
 so that we do not get hurt then 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.360
 first we start with this 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.450
 then another side of this side 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.450
 and so 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.150
 so let's go for just the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.310
 edges to adjust 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.860
 we always have to start from the 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.200
 medium and spinning and sewing 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.180
 besides that I did it to him so that you 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.610
 you realize how we had to stay 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.750
 good the joke that we have to be 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.270
 in this way and good if you want with 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.000
 You are going to put it here 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.620
 inside and we have to now that 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.620
 finish I'll show you how it was 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.570
 and that's what our 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.570
 little flower 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.470
 and nothing else you are accommodating the 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.470
 petals 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.900
 and this is the back not yet 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:05.340
 I have finished because here only 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.340
 we put in needles 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:14.190
 this part we put our perlite or what 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.190
 that you have available 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.660
 we're going like this so this is in 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.050
 medium but people can also 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.050
 leave like this 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.730
 but I want to put a cross with a 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.730
 perlite 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:37.000
 nothing else accommodates you girl if we pass 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.000
 again here so that it is well 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 reposed 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.879
 and so it does not have to be tied down 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.879
 down 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:01.740
 Well, I hope you liked it if 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:05.719

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.719
