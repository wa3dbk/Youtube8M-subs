00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.889

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.870

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.480
 left and right and in the middle one 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.810
 Small party divided and catch now 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.810
 to weave on the individual strands 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.760
 I always take from the outside 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.620
 left and right a small stones at 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.330
 I plait bad ones too 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.330
 actually a French customs 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.829
 I already knew who I was 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.989
 here's just the hairs that be braiding 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.879
 the mirella for the channel is relative to me 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.879
 no matter shop always with her over 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.450
 I want to keep up with that for so long 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.440
 no small stones left and right 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.440
 can read more 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.650
 10 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.890
 Finally, I simply attach the 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.840
 zoff with a transparent hagen ii 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:07.149
 you can by the way in the rossmann 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:08.950
 Buy very little money now loose 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.690
 I just have something to do with it 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.160
 open your hands and then we would be too 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.290
 already done with this hairstyle 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.049
 I think this braid is easy 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.319
 beautiful because he is incredibly thick and 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:23.010
 looks voluminous and yes I think so 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.010
 just looks great 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.439
 the second hairstyle is very good for that 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.269
 suitable if you take your conny away 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.340
 want and in a nice way and 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.139
 wise 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.069
 for that you share your challenge 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:43.139
 or europa from the lot and shared 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.090
 then in three strands with it you 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.549
 can braid and here you see 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.010
 fleeting first a few times and 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.859
 then let the lowest strand hang 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.840
 So we make a waterfall braid then 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.939
 I take a strand right next to it 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.659
 and then put over the middle again 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.090
 Streller 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.340
 Now I take the upper strands put 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.239
 over the middle and lowermost leaves 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.000
 I hang again 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.579
 next to it I take a new route 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.879
 put new hair over the middle 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.519
 strand and then the upper over the 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.040
 middle exactly and then I leave the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.780
 lower fall again and do that 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.689
 I'm up to the back of my head 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.709
 Arrived attacks exactly and yes you 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.750
 Of course you can go further 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.669
 braid if you want but I have 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.269
 then it stopped because I like it very much 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.269
 immediately 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.960
 In the back of my mind I stopped 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.880
 to take hair to and weaves the 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.950
 I still have hair in my hand 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.080
 just go down to a normal braid 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.100
 and then fasten down with one 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.140
 transparent have this hairstyle is 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.600
 especially suitable for when 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.740
 open hair but also his pony 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.540
 We want to wear the face 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.120
 now to the last hairstyle my 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.360
 my favorite is here 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.610
 the laura from the channel loco xo one 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.830
 normal ponytail tied and 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.320
 then divide a small stone from whole 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.390
 turn left and just start 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.220
 weave a few times when I am at the 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.060
 upper beaches arrived again 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.410
 I'll take a few hairs here 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.850
 I do that only at the top 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.560
 argue with the lower master 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.420
 For example, not now I have those again 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.320
 upper in the hand and then do a few 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.540
 the bottom video on the 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.970
 middle and then the upper over the 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.810
 middle and take some hair again 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.570
 You also see that I am doing the job a bit 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.400
 braid down because of itself 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.120
 tie around the ponytail, so to speak 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.120
 should 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.310
 the hardest part of this hairstyle is 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.930
 really then flowed to the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.580
 ponytail drumrum to get 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.430
 because you have to see that you have the 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.020
 single strands again reasonably 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.000
 recorded court so here I have 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.350
 then the strands try again 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.150
 but I have gotthard 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.150
 purchased and yes now I start 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.650
 just continue to braid and do 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.539
 a few times when I go back to 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.919
 Namely, the upper street arrived 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.919
 there again hair added 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:00.089
 Again , I want to bite all right 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.039
 I arrived on the right and then I put 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:05.179
 the braided again around the 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.179
 ponytail around it 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.390
 if I have the hair then around it 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.070
 have fleeting just as much as 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.380
 Earlier also I always take with the 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.450
 Add a few hairs to the upper strand 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.000
 Unfortunately, you can see that I'm not there 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.970
 more in the picture was silly but gone 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.470
 well and yes, finally I fix that 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.660
 whole again with a transparent one 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.820
 hairy and then we would be with this 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.310
 hairstyle also already finished I think the 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.800

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.250
