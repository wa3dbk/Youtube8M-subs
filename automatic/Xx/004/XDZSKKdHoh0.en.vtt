is the one that would be there this is
our<00:01:29.100> emblem<00:01:29.399> saying<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.149> this<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.539> a<00:01:30.570> star<00:01:30.930> now

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
our emblem saying it this is a star now

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
our emblem saying it this is a star now
as<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.850> walk<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.539> other<00:01:33.690> cars<00:01:33.960> are

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
as we walk up here to the other cars are

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.630 
as we walk up here to the other cars are
that<00:01:34.679> are<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.950> stars

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that are the stars

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.020 
that are the stars
the<00:01:36.240> Durant's<00:01:36.690> are<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.560> more<00:01:38.190> rare<00:01:38.460> more

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the Durant's are they more rare more

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.029 
the Durant's are they more rare more
valuable<00:01:39.390> than<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> model<00:01:40.410> is<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.950> but

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
valuable than the model is what it but

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.910 
valuable than the model is what it but
it's<00:01:41.190> not<00:01:41.429> really<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.140> more<00:01:43.470> Model

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it's not really it's you have more Model

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.820 
it's not really it's you have more Model
A's<00:01:44.039> model<00:01:44.610> T<00:01:44.789> stand<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:46.080> stars<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
A's model T stand then stars and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.010 
A's model T stand then stars and
Durant's<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.940> be<00:01:48.119> more<00:01:48.330> rare<00:01:48.720> it's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
Durant's so it would be more rare it's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.770 
Durant's so it would be more rare it's
harder<00:01:49.410> to<00:01:49.530> find<00:01:49.860> parts<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.030> we're<00:01:51.420> getting

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
harder to find parts and we're getting

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.090 
harder to find parts and we're getting
to<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> point<00:01:52.200> where<00:01:52.320> we're<00:01:52.649> gonna<00:01:52.710> start
