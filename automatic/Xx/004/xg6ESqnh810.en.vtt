individual<00:00:16.699> just<00:00:17.600> as<00:00:17.810> an<00:00:18.560> analyst<00:00:18.980> sure<00:00:20.830> well

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
individual just as an analyst sure well

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.370 
individual just as an analyst sure well
it's<00:00:22.190> it's<00:00:22.520> fairly<00:00:22.730> small<00:00:23.120> we<00:00:23.690> said<00:00:24.170> it<00:00:24.260> looks

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
it's it's fairly small we said it looks

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.650 
it's it's fairly small we said it looks
like<00:00:24.530> karst<00:00:24.830> on<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.070> computer<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.670> so<00:00:25.970> that

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
like karst on the computer and so that

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.450 
like karst on the computer and so that
would<00:00:26.780> give<00:00:27.020> way<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.200> you<00:00:27.560> know<00:00:27.650> concentration

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
would give way to you know concentration

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.080 
would give way to you know concentration
and<00:00:28.580> focus<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:30.070> he<00:00:31.070> also<00:00:31.190> had<00:00:31.430> pretty<00:00:31.850> high

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
and focus and he also had pretty high

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.119 
and focus and he also had pretty high
upper<00:00:32.480> zones<00:00:32.689> for<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:32.989> most<00:00:33.230> part<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:33.829> so

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
upper zones for the most part and so

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.279 
upper zones for the most part and so
this<00:00:34.640> way<00:00:34.760> itself<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:35.539> I<00:00:35.600> would<00:00:35.719> say<00:00:35.840> he<00:00:36.020> plans

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
this way itself so I would say he plans

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.790 
this way itself so I would say he plans
ahead<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.760> he's<00:00:38.030> concentrated<00:00:38.630> he<00:00:39.410> also<00:00:39.530> pays

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
ahead and he's concentrated he also pays

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.110 
ahead and he's concentrated he also pays
a<00:00:39.890> lot<00:00:39.980> of<00:00:40.040> attention<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:40.520> details<00:00:40.850> needs

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
a lot of attention to details needs

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.270 
a lot of attention to details needs
observant<00:00:41.600> because<00:00:41.750> he<00:00:42.020> has<00:00:42.200> AI<00:00:42.530> dots<00:00:42.980> very

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
observant because he has AI dots very

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.729 
observant because he has AI dots very
close<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.760> stem<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:44.870> he's<00:00:45.020> an<00:00:45.110> observant

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
close to the stem so he's an observant

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.639 
close to the stem so he's an observant
focused<00:00:46.340> plan<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.149> head<00:00:47.300> person<00:00:47.630> which<00:00:48.440> is

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
focused plan the head person which is

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.799 
focused plan the head person which is
interesting<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.520> then<00:00:50.860> he<00:00:51.910> has<00:00:52.910> ease<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.600> O's

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
interesting and then he has ease and O's

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.750 
interesting and then he has ease and O's
and<00:00:53.840> a<00:00:54.200> they're<00:00:54.500> often<00:00:54.739> quite<00:00:54.920> closed<00:00:55.340> meaning

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.370 
won't listen to yours he's fairly
dominant<00:01:04.100> either<00:01:04.820> in<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.509> leadership<00:01:05.780> role<00:01:05.930> or

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
dominant either in a leadership role or

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.260 
dominant either in a leadership role or
he<00:01:06.530> can<00:01:06.680> be<00:01:06.829> kind<00:01:07.040> of<00:01:07.100> domineering<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:08.000> tends

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
he can be kind of domineering it tends

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.910 
he can be kind of domineering it tends
to<00:01:08.390> not<00:01:08.509> be<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:08.869> sharp<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:09.259> I<00:01:09.499> would<00:01:09.740> imagine

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
to not be so sharp so I would imagine

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.919 
to not be so sharp so I would imagine
that<00:01:10.130> he's<00:01:10.369> firmly<00:01:10.639> mostly<00:01:11.450> just<00:01:11.600> dominant

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
that he's firmly mostly just dominant

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.219 
that he's firmly mostly just dominant
and<00:01:12.249> then<00:01:13.299> he<00:01:14.299> has<00:01:14.389> some<00:01:14.600> temper<00:01:14.959> sometimes

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
and then he has some temper sometimes

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.699 
and then he has some temper sometimes
with<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.950> tea<00:01:16.639> bars<00:01:16.819> only<00:01:17.060> on<00:01:17.359> the<00:01:17.479> right<00:01:17.709> he

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
with the tea bars only on the right he

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:21.370 
with the tea bars only on the right he
his<00:01:19.039> P's<00:01:19.310> are<00:01:19.639> very<00:01:20.060> loopy<00:01:20.659> which<00:01:20.990> means<00:01:21.229> that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
his P's are very loopy which means that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.440 
his P's are very loopy which means that
he<00:01:21.469> has<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.649> need<00:01:21.889> for<00:01:22.130> physical<00:01:22.429> activity<00:01:23.090> and

he has a need for physical activity and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
about average self-esteem for the most

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.319 
about average self-esteem for the most
part<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:29.889> that's<00:01:30.889> what<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.130> mostly<00:01:31.639> came<00:01:32.209> up

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
part and that's what I mostly came up

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.209 
part and that's what I mostly came up
with<00:01:32.509> with<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.929> print<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.499> couple<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:34.009> people

individuals it's all about spirituality
and<00:01:44.869> meditation<00:01:45.189> so<00:01:46.189> we<00:01:46.520> are<00:01:46.609> seeing<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
and meditation so we are seeing the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.330 
and meditation so we are seeing the
imagination<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.439> I<00:01:48.709> do<00:01:48.770> agree<00:01:49.069> with<00:01:49.249> you

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
imagination and and I do agree with you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.190 
imagination and and I do agree with you
that<00:01:49.369> those<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:49.999> going<00:01:50.329> into<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.689> upper<00:01:50.929> zones

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
that those is going into the upper zones

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.260 
that those is going into the upper zones
which<00:01:51.829> could<00:01:52.130> be<00:01:52.219> perceived<00:01:52.549> as<00:01:52.700> positive<00:01:53.179> or

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
which could be perceived as positive or

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.059 
which could be perceived as positive or
negative<00:01:53.659> in<00:01:53.779> this<00:01:53.959> case<00:01:54.200> it's<00:01:54.409> fantasy<00:01:54.919> and

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
negative in this case it's fantasy and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.620 
negative in this case it's fantasy and
we<00:01:55.279> haven't<00:01:55.520> actually<00:01:55.639> talked<00:01:56.119> about<00:01:56.240> what<00:01:56.509> he

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
we haven't actually talked about what he

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.849 
we haven't actually talked about what he
did<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:56.959> I'm<00:01:57.020> gonna<00:01:57.139> hold<00:01:57.289> that<00:01:57.469> just<00:01:57.679> for<00:01:57.799> a

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
did and I'm gonna hold that just for a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.980 
did and I'm gonna hold that just for a
second<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:58.399> we<00:01:58.429> can<00:01:58.669> kind<00:01:59.299> of<00:01:59.329> analyze<00:01:59.779> it

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.229 
second so we can kind of analyze it
before<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.319> give<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:00.590> big<00:02:00.739> reveal

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
before we give the big reveal

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.669 
before we give the big reveal
particularly<00:02:02.239> his<00:02:02.359> crime<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.959> know<00:02:03.380> some<00:02:03.649> of

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
particularly his crime I know some of

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.830 
particularly his crime I know some of
you<00:02:03.859> know<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.219> but<00:02:05.119> one<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.450> things<00:02:05.659> that's

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
you know it but one of the things that's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.109 
you know it but one of the things that's
odd<00:02:06.169> about<00:02:06.499> the<00:02:06.679> writing<00:02:07.069> is<00:02:07.219> we<00:02:07.489> see<00:02:07.789> some

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
odd about the writing is we see some

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.089 
odd about the writing is we see some
very<00:02:08.360> interesting<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.229> odd<00:02:09.410> traits<00:02:09.860> which

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
very interesting and odd traits which

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.309 
very interesting and odd traits which
would<00:02:10.280> catch<00:02:10.459> all<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.789> us<00:02:10.880> off-guard<00:02:11.170> but<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
would catch all of us off-guard but the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.770 
would catch all of us off-guard but the
question<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:12.770> would<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.130> know<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.820> guy<00:02:14.090> had

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
question is would you know this guy had

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.930 
question is would you know this guy had
the<00:02:14.930> capacity<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.470> kill<00:02:15.680> would<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.400> know<00:02:16.700> this

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
the capacity to kill would you know this

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.760 
the capacity to kill would you know this
guy

guy
would<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.100> as<00:02:18.280> perverted<00:02:19.060> as<00:02:19.290> he<00:02:20.290> ended<00:02:20.530> up

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
would be as perverted as he ended up

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.240 
would be as perverted as he ended up
being<00:02:21.600> an<00:02:22.600> ally<00:02:23.080> did<00:02:23.440> would<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.980> yes

bright<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:55.060> I'll<00:02:55.240> say<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.510> because<00:02:56.110> it's

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
bright and I'll say that because it's

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.650 
bright and I'll say that because it's
one<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.680> those<00:02:56.740> things<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.580> it's<00:02:58.030> hard<00:02:58.180> to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
one of those things that it's hard to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.660 
one of those things that it's hard to
put<00:02:58.840> your<00:02:58.960> finger<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.320> intelligence<00:02:59.980> but

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
put your finger on intelligence but

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.960 
put your finger on intelligence but
there's<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.110> slow<00:03:02.110> methodical<00:03:02.530> nature<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.820> his

Sling Blade the movie like the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.580 
Sling Blade the movie like the
characters<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.970> little<00:03:22.540> bit<00:03:22.750> slow

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
characters just a little bit slow

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.949 
characters just a little bit slow
mentally<00:03:24.220> if<00:03:24.459> that's<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.420> handwriting<00:03:25.840> is

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
mentally if that's the handwriting is

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.290 
mentally if that's the handwriting is
slow<00:03:26.140> mentally<00:03:26.590> here<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.550> this<00:03:27.730> slide<00:03:28.090> we

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
slow mentally here in this slide we

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.870 
slow mentally here in this slide we
talked<00:03:28.540> about<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.870> K<00:03:29.080> I've<00:03:29.800> rarely<00:03:30.430> seen<00:03:30.670> a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
talked about the K I've rarely seen a

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.449 
talked about the K I've rarely seen a
more<00:03:31.120> defiant<00:03:31.480> K<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:32.950> have<00:03:33.040> someone<00:03:33.340> who's

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
more defiant K so you have someone who's

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.780 
more defiant K so you have someone who's
not<00:03:33.670> rewrite<00:03:34.180> he<00:03:34.870> can't<00:03:35.260> handle<00:03:35.530> Authority<00:03:36.190> we

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
not rewrite he can't handle Authority we

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.430 
not rewrite he can't handle Authority we
know<00:03:37.000> he's<00:03:37.150> addicted<00:03:37.360> drugs<00:03:37.930> from<00:03:38.260> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
know he's addicted drugs from the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.100 
know he's addicted drugs from the
content<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.190> we<00:03:39.760> see<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.750> sort<00:03:41.020> of

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
content and we see this this sort of

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.990 
content and we see this this sort of
meddled<00:03:41.590> thinking<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:44.070> it's<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.190> formula<00:03:45.520> for

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
meddled thinking and it's a formula for

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.600 
meddled thinking and it's a formula for
