00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
kind of thoughts that I had was what if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.410 
kind of thoughts that I had was what if
it<00:00:50.860> turns<00:00:51.860> out<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.160> I<00:00:52.190> don't<00:00:52.370> like<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:52.850> what<00:00:53.210> if

it turns out and I don't like it what if

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.260 
it turns out and I don't like it what if
it<00:00:53.750> also<00:00:54.440> decreases<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.760> value<00:00:55.880> in<00:00:56.180> the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
it also decreases the value in the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.910 
it also decreases the value in the
future<00:00:56.630> because<00:00:56.840> obviously<00:00:57.380> this<00:00:57.680> is<00:00:57.829> how

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
future because obviously this is how

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.709 
future because obviously this is how
it's<00:00:58.070> supposed<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.460> look<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:58.910> if<00:00:59.090> I<00:00:59.180> painted

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
it's supposed to look and if I painted

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.180 
it's supposed to look and if I painted
is<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.170> going<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.379> decrease<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.710> value<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.100> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
is it going to decrease the value of the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.340 
is it going to decrease the value of the
whole<00:01:01.309> set<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:01.670> things<00:01:01.820> like<00:01:01.910> that<00:01:01.969> but

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
obviously things that obviously go

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.469 
I've just picked up the paint because
it's<00:01:43.580> been<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.729> long<00:01:43.880> time<00:01:44.090> since<00:01:44.119> I've<00:01:44.390> done

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
i'm thinking maybe that's going to be a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.770 
i'm thinking maybe that's going to be a
bit<00:01:48.020> too<00:01:48.470> deep<00:01:48.740> but<00:01:49.520> then<00:01:49.700> sometimes<00:01:50.000> that<00:01:50.509> I

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
bit too deep but then sometimes that I

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.620 
bit too deep but then sometimes that I
mean<00:01:50.930> I<00:01:51.170> used<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.530> do<00:01:51.680> models<00:01:52.009> years<00:01:52.400> back<00:01:52.700> FX

models<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.079> sauna<00:01:54.259> sometimes<00:01:54.740> that's<00:01:55.400> not

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
models and sauna sometimes that's not

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.090 
models and sauna sometimes that's not
quite<00:01:55.790> how<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.060> turns<00:01:56.390> out<00:01:56.570> ever<00:01:57.380> put<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:57.920> in

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
quite how it turns out ever put it on in

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.530 
quite how it turns out ever put it on in
a<00:01:58.130> bit<00:01:58.310> too<00:01:58.430> deep<00:01:58.640> or<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:58.939> doesn't<00:01:59.150> look<00:01:59.390> quite

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
a bit too deep or it doesn't look quite

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.120 
a bit too deep or it doesn't look quite
good<00:01:59.659> I'll<00:02:00.020> just<00:02:00.170> paint<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.500> again<00:02:00.619> I'll<00:02:00.950> just

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
good I'll just paint it again I'll just

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.770 
good I'll just paint it again I'll just
keep<00:02:01.250> on<00:02:01.430> painting<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.150> until<00:02:02.420> I<00:02:02.450> get<00:02:02.689> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
keep on painting it until I get the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.450 
keep on painting it until I get the
right<00:02:02.869> color<00:02:03.020> really<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.500> think<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:04.220> is<00:02:04.369> about

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
right color really I think this is about

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.020 
right color really I think this is about
as<00:02:04.670> close<00:02:05.030> as<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:06.170> could<00:02:06.409> get<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.700> just<00:02:07.880> I'm

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
as close as I could get it it's just I'm

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.880 
as close as I could get it it's just I'm
looking<00:02:08.450> at<00:02:08.570> kind<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.899> like<00:02:09.019> his<00:02:09.229> boots<00:02:09.560> there

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
looking at kind of like his boots there

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.150 
looking at kind of like his boots there
and<00:02:10.160> maybe<00:02:11.200> might<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.380> your<00:02:12.470> own<00:02:12.590> about<00:02:12.829> right

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and maybe might be your own about right

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.850 
and maybe might be your own about right
could<00:02:13.549> be<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.690> anyway<00:02:14.930> what<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:15.590> going<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.739> do

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
could be so anyway what I'm going to do

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.259 
could be so anyway what I'm going to do
is<00:02:15.920> I'm<00:02:16.040> going<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.190> pin<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.609> will

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
is I'm going to pin it and will

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.860 
is I'm going to pin it and will
transition<00:02:17.720> into<00:02:18.109> that<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.329> so<00:02:20.329> this<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
transition into that and so this is the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.670 
transition into that and so this is the
last<00:02:20.989> time<00:02:21.169> we'll<00:02:21.290> see

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
meals of the red and I'd rather have it

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.459 
meals of the red and I'd rather have it
smudged<00:03:13.489> with<00:03:13.730> blue<00:03:14.090> than<00:03:14.419> some<00:03:14.810> old<00:03:15.169> blue

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
on there I'm also in the the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.550 
on there I'm also in the the
the<00:04:32.180> pin<00:04:32.390> on<00:04:32.570> there<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.810> begin<00:04:32.930> with<00:04:33.170> but<00:04:33.440> it

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
the pin on there to begin with but it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.380 
the pin on there to begin with but it
just<00:04:33.710> wasn't<00:04:33.860> tick<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.580> i<00:04:34.700> found<00:04:34.940> i<00:04:35.090> actually

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
just wasn't tick and i found i actually

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.040 
just wasn't tick and i found i actually
had<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.750> use<00:04:36.280> like<00:04:37.280> some<00:04:37.490> of<00:04:37.610> this<00:04:37.820> which<00:04:38.690> is<00:04:38.990> a

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
had to use like some of this which is a

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.470 
had to use like some of this which is a
lot<00:04:39.320> more<00:04:41.350> thick<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.620> lot<00:04:43.220> thicker<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:43.820> i<00:04:43.850> used<00:04:44.120> a

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
lot more thick a lot thicker so i used a

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.660 
lot more thick a lot thicker so i used a
quart<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.350> that<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.830> kind<00:04:46.010> of<00:04:46.100> go<00:04:46.310> off<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.550> on

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
quart of that to kind of go off it on

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.770 
quart of that to kind of go off it on
the<00:04:46.760> blue<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.270> then<00:04:47.810> i<00:04:48.250> used<00:04:49.250> i<00:04:49.610> use<00:04:50.210> this<00:04:50.450> and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
the blue and then i used i use this and

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.010 
the blue and then i used i use this and
come<00:04:51.650> hello<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.730> then<00:04:53.030> kind<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.390> went<00:04:53.570> over<00:04:53.900> it

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
come hello and then kind of went over it

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.470 
come hello and then kind of went over it
and<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.340> took<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.060> lot<00:04:56.210> better

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
and so that it took to it a lot better

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.930 
and so that it took to it a lot better
and<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:57.410> was<00:04:57.830> just<00:04:57.980> a<00:04:58.070> lotta<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.340> lot<00:04:58.640> easier<00:04:58.820> to

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
and it was just a lotta a lot easier to

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.580 
and it was just a lotta a lot easier to
do<00:04:59.090> it<00:04:59.180> that<00:04:59.210> way<00:04:59.420> it<00:04:59.690> meant<00:04:59.930> me<00:05:00.050> having<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.350> pin

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
do it that way it meant me having a pin

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.060 
do it that way it meant me having a pin
at<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.800> couple<00:05:01.070> of<00:05:01.130> times<00:05:01.340> but<00:05:02.210> it's<00:05:02.360> worked<00:05:02.570> out
