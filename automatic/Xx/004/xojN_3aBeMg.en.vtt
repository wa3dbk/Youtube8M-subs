00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
Lakers I did already cut some of the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.730 
Lakers I did already cut some of the
tape<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.060> would<00:01:25.750> be<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.930> little<00:01:26.140> easier<00:01:26.229> to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
tape so that would be a little easier to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.609 
tape so that would be a little easier to
open

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:40.200

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
and this one you can see we got our gas

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.229 
and this one you can see we got our gas
connections<00:03:56.570> gray<00:03:57.079> for<00:03:57.470> gas<00:03:58.000> we<00:03:59.000> got<00:03:59.209> a

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
connections gray for gas we got a

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.890 
connections gray for gas we got a
manifold<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.560> this<00:04:03.739> ko's<00:04:04.040> this<00:04:04.519> part<00:04:04.910> goes<00:04:05.420> to

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
manifold and this ko's this part goes to

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.970 
manifold and this ko's this part goes to
this<00:04:06.530> this<00:04:07.489> part<00:04:07.880> in<00:04:08.120> here<00:04:08.690> goes<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.620> co2

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
this this part in here goes to the co2

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.539 
this this part in here goes to the co2
tank<00:04:10.489> goes<00:04:11.420> into<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.810> manifold<00:04:12.350> out<00:04:13.070> through

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
tank goes into the manifold out through

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.740 
tank goes into the manifold out through
here<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.120> then<00:04:14.989> out<00:04:15.140> to<00:04:15.170> your<00:04:15.440> up<00:04:16.160> cheer<00:04:16.750> beer

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
here and then out to your up cheer beer

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.200 
here and then out to your up cheer beer
kegs<00:04:19.239> see<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:21.610> there's<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:24.880> that's<00:04:25.880> kind<00:04:26.180> of

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
kegs see and there's a that's kind of

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.909 
kegs see and there's a that's kind of
nice<00:04:26.390> of<00:04:26.630> them<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.780> actually<00:04:26.990> individually

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
nice of them to actually individually

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:37.570 
nice of them to actually individually
packaged<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:32.500> manifold<00:04:34.210> whoops<00:04:36.580> that

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
packaged the the manifold whoops that

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.960 
packaged the the manifold whoops that
quinoa<00:04:38.000> oh<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.860> just<00:04:39.950> move<00:04:40.370> on<00:04:40.520> cuz<00:04:41.360> there's<00:04:41.690> the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
quinoa oh I just move on cuz there's the

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:50.830 
quinoa oh I just move on cuz there's the
manifold<00:04:44.289> or<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:46.419> regulator<00:04:49.630> looks<00:04:50.630> pretty

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
manifold or the regulator looks pretty

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.719 
manifold or the regulator looks pretty
good

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
good

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:04.570 
good
nice<00:04:55.539> so<00:04:58.089> we'll<00:04:59.089> set<00:04:59.449> that<00:05:02.979> set<00:05:03.979> that<00:05:04.279> right

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
nice so we'll set that set that right

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.399 
nice so we'll set that set that right
there<00:05:06.249> and<00:05:07.249> I<00:05:07.939> guess<00:05:08.150> what's<00:05:08.419> left<00:05:08.689> is<00:05:08.990> a

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:23.079 

couple<00:05:12.409> of<00:05:14.139> abused<00:05:15.139> kids<00:05:20.650> now<00:05:21.939> obviously<00:05:22.939> when

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:23.089 
couple of abused kids now obviously when

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.230 
couple of abused kids now obviously when
you<00:05:23.210> get<00:05:24.279> used<00:05:25.279> kegs<00:05:25.669> they're<00:05:25.909> not<00:05:26.029> going<00:05:26.149> to

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
you get used kegs they're not going to

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.579 
you get used kegs they're not going to
be<00:05:26.360> beautiful<00:05:26.599> but<00:05:28.719> they<00:05:29.719> say<00:05:30.050> that<00:05:30.080> they<00:05:30.529> do

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:30.589 
be beautiful but they say that they do

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.549 
be beautiful but they say that they do
test<00:05:31.430> them<00:05:31.639> out<00:05:31.759> for<00:05:32.089> you<00:05:32.120> pressure<00:05:33.020> pick<00:05:33.349> them

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:33.559 
test them out for you pressure pick them

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:41.549 
test them out for you pressure pick them
clean<00:05:34.249> them<00:05:34.399> pressure<00:05:34.909> check<00:05:35.240> them<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:35.599> I

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:41.559 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:44.769 

figured<00:05:42.559> that<00:05:42.740> was<00:05:42.919> gonna<00:05:43.129> happen<00:05:43.639> we're<00:05:44.509> here

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
figured that was gonna happen we're here

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.610 
figured that was gonna happen we're here
at<00:05:44.960> in<00:05:45.529> denver<00:05:46.039> colorado<00:05:46.249> so<00:05:47.029> mile<00:05:47.270> high

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
at in denver colorado so mile high

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.269 
at in denver colorado so mile high
everything<00:05:48.620> we<00:05:48.740> get<00:05:48.889> here<00:05:49.159> as<00:05:50.050> gas<00:05:51.159> even<00:05:52.159> our

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 
everything we get here as gas even our

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.700 
everything we get here as gas even our
shampoo<00:05:52.879> bottles<00:05:53.300> when<00:05:53.659> you<00:05:53.779> open<00:05:54.020> them<00:05:54.110> so<00:05:54.379> i

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
shampoo bottles when you open them so i

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.920 
shampoo bottles when you open them so i
think<00:05:57.069> these<00:05:58.069> are<00:05:58.310> coming<00:05:58.639> from<00:05:58.669> Texas<00:05:59.599> so

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
think these are coming from Texas so

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.760 
think these are coming from Texas so
that's<00:06:00.709> a<00:06:00.800> lot<00:06:00.979> of<00:06:01.009> elevation

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.320 

unless<00:06:05.770> they<00:06:05.950> fill<00:06:06.190> these<00:06:06.340> with<00:06:06.400> co2<00:06:06.820> and<00:06:07.240> I'm

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
unless they fill these with co2 and I'm

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.220 
unless they fill these with co2 and I'm
just<00:06:07.570> expelling<00:06:08.020> it<00:06:08.340> don't<00:06:09.340> know<00:06:09.400> anyway<00:06:10.240> so

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
just expelling it don't know anyway so

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.210 
just expelling it don't know anyway so
that's<00:06:12.070> what<00:06:12.280> you<00:06:12.370> get<00:06:12.580> in<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.690> kit<00:06:13.930> and<00:06:14.220> I

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
that's what you get in the kit and I

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.120 
that's what you get in the kit and I
hope<00:06:15.760> you<00:06:15.910> guys<00:06:16.060> enjoyed<00:06:16.510> this<00:06:16.840> unboxing<00:06:17.130> the

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
hope you guys enjoyed this unboxing the

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.690 
hope you guys enjoyed this unboxing the
so<00:06:18.970> you<00:06:19.090> can<00:06:19.240> see<00:06:19.450> what<00:06:19.600> you<00:06:19.780> get<00:06:19.930> and<00:06:20.520> we<00:06:21.520> will

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
so you can see what you get and we will

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:33.690 
so you can see what you get and we will
calculator<00:06:22.770> thanks<00:06:23.770> guys

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700
