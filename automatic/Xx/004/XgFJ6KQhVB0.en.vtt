then<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.399> crystals<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.329> placed

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
then there's crystals that are placed

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.920 
then there's crystals that are placed
around<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.320> edge<00:00:58.680> which<00:00:59.460> are<00:01:00.030> also<00:01:00.270> red<00:01:00.750> I'm

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
around this edge which are also red I'm

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689 
around this edge which are also red I'm
not<00:01:01.140> sure<00:01:01.350> that's<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.949> pick<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.399> there

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
not sure that's going to pick up there

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.000 
not sure that's going to pick up there
but<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> red<00:01:04.140> crystals<00:01:04.710> right

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
but this kind of red crystals right

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.920 
but this kind of red crystals right
there<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.439> lighter<00:01:08.100> red<00:01:08.930> it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
there they are and a lighter red it's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.899 
there they are and a lighter red it's
coming<00:01:10.350> closely<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.729> that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
coming closely you can really see that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
coming closely you can really see that
there<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.420> go<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> lighter

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
there there you go that's the lighter

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.219 
there there you go that's the lighter
red<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:15.000> you've<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> deeper

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
red there and then you've got the deeper

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.690 
red there and then you've got the deeper
red<00:01:16.409> that's<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:17.040> bead<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> go

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
red that's on those bead there so to go

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
red that's on those bead there so to go
with<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.090> frilled<00:01:21.360> edge<00:01:21.720> you've<00:01:22.049> got<00:01:22.320> some

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
with the frilled edge you've got some

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.580 
with the frilled edge you've got some
flowers<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:24.630> some<00:01:24.960> beautiful

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
flowers here and then some beautiful

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.690 
flowers here and then some beautiful
crystals<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> middle<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:29.280> line<00:01:29.520> of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
crystals just in the middle the line of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
crystals just in the middle the line of
the<00:01:29.790> heart<00:01:30.060> follows<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.960> edge<00:01:31.079> detail<00:01:31.650> here

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the heart follows the edge detail here

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.429 
the heart follows the edge detail here
so<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.490> got<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> crystals<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.200> some

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
so it's got the crystals it's got some

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.490 
so it's got the crystals it's got some
red<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.310> then<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> follows<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.180> this

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
red to it and then it follows with this

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.289 
red to it and then it follows with this
flower<00:01:37.500> design<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.280> also<00:01:38.640> got<00:01:38.820> crystals

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
flower design that's also got crystals

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.620 
flower design that's also got crystals
within<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.930> line<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.979> leads<00:01:41.280> on

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
within that line then leads on

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
within that line then leads on
beautifully<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> actual<00:01:43.530> central<00:01:43.950> piece

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
beautifully to the actual central piece

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.399 
beautifully to the actual central piece
of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> heart<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.600> heart<00:01:45.869> itself<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of the heart the heart itself is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.969 
of the heart the heart itself is
adjustable<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.990> it's<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> doggy<00:01:49.500> which<00:01:49.799> you
