00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy with the

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.579 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy with the
upcoming<00:00:03.179> update<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.899> new<00:00:04.049> ash<00:00:04.259> in<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
upcoming update to the new ash in the

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.260 
upcoming update to the new ash in the
next<00:00:04.920> patch<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.400> figured<00:00:05.910> it'd<00:00:05.970> be<00:00:06.000> worth

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
next patch I figured it'd be worth

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.849 
next patch I figured it'd be worth
taking<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.750> look<00:00:06.779> over<00:00:07.230> since<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.560> think<00:00:07.710> it's<00:00:07.799> a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
taking a look over since I think it's a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.259 
taking a look over since I think it's a
pretty<00:00:07.980> cool<00:00:08.220> kit<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.580> will<00:00:08.790> prove<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.090> be

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
pretty cool kit and will prove to be

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.740 
pretty cool kit and will prove to be
quite<00:00:09.540> strong<00:00:10.019> let's<00:00:10.710> get<00:00:10.860> started<00:00:11.690> now<00:00:12.690> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
quite strong let's get started now the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.390 
quite strong let's get started now the
main<00:00:12.990> changes<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.469> ash<00:00:13.590> come<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.040> form<00:00:14.250> of

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
main changes to ash come in the form of

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.060 
main changes to ash come in the form of
her<00:00:14.519> passive<00:00:15.059> her<00:00:15.480> Q<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.990> her<00:00:16.109> Hawk<00:00:16.320> shot<00:00:16.590> her

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
her passive her Q and her Hawk shot her

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.279 
her passive her Q and her Hawk shot her
volley<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.699> her<00:00:17.789> ultimate<00:00:18.150> remained<00:00:18.539> mostly

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
volley and her ultimate remained mostly

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.279 
volley and her ultimate remained mostly
unchanged<00:00:20.039> her<00:00:20.699> old<00:00:21.000> Q<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:21.810> moved<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.199> her

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
unchanged her old Q is now moved to her

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.290 
unchanged her old Q is now moved to her
passive<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.010> every<00:00:23.310> single<00:00:23.609> auto<00:00:23.760> attack<00:00:24.060> with

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
passive so every single auto attack with

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.839 
passive so every single auto attack with
her<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:25.019> slows<00:00:25.470> at<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> cost<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.279> zero<00:00:26.340> mana

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
her now slows at the cost of zero mana

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.000 
her now slows at the cost of zero mana
the<00:00:27.480> trade-off<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.869> now<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> slow<00:00:28.830> at

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the trade-off is now that the slow at

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
the trade-off is now that the slow at
early<00:00:29.369> levels<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.779> weak<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
early levels is really really weak and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.830 
early levels is really really weak and
kind<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> non-existent<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.480> really

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
kind of non-existent but it's really

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.049 
kind of non-existent but it's really
nice<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.559> use<00:00:34.890> man<00:00:35.130> at<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> perma<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.760> people

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
nice to not use man at a perma so people

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.700 
nice to not use man at a perma so people
now<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> scales<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:37.410> in

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
now and it scales up really well in

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.799 
now and it scales up really well in
addition<00:00:38.579> she<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.030> no<00:00:39.120> longer<00:00:39.300> critically

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
addition she can no longer critically

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.780 
addition she can no longer critically
strike<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.559> her<00:00:40.620> passive<00:00:41.070> scales<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.640> gives

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
strike but her passive scales and gives

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.490 
strike but her passive scales and gives
her<00:00:41.910> bonus<00:00:42.180> damage<00:00:42.420> depending<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.230> how<00:00:43.350> much

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
her bonus damage depending on how much

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.010 
her bonus damage depending on how much
crit<00:00:43.770> chance<00:00:43.800> she<00:00:44.309> has<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> also

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
crit chance she has this is also

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
crit chance she has this is also
actually<00:00:46.200> pretty<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.250> bonus

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
actually pretty good because the bonus

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
actually pretty good because the bonus
damage<00:00:47.700> scales<00:00:48.180> well<00:00:48.420> enough<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.960> crit

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
damage scales well enough with crit

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.410 
damage scales well enough with crit
chance<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.829> make<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.210> do

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
chance to make it so that you really do

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
chance to make it so that you really do
just<00:00:51.809> about<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> same<00:00:52.590> amount<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:53.039> damage<00:00:53.430> but

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
just about the same amount of damage but

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.490 
just about the same amount of damage but
without<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> RNG<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> crit<00:00:55.469> chance

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
without the RNG that crit chance

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.830 
without the RNG that crit chance
normally<00:00:56.190> brings<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.149> really<00:00:57.480> sweet

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
normally brings which is really sweet

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.869 
normally brings which is really sweet
now<00:00:58.469> she<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:59.039> doesn't<00:00:59.340> run<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> mana

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
now she really doesn't run out of mana

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.520 
now she really doesn't run out of mana
that<00:01:00.210> much<00:01:00.420> unless<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.899> spamming<00:01:01.140> volley

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that much unless you're spamming volley

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
that much unless you're spamming volley
off<00:01:01.829> cooldown<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> gives<00:01:02.879> her<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.090> lot<00:01:03.329> more

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
off cooldown so it gives her a lot more

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
off cooldown so it gives her a lot more
resources<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.170> work<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.650> which<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> really

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
resources to work with which is really

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
resources to work with which is really
awesome<00:01:05.519> especially<00:01:06.000> since<00:01:06.720> mana<00:01:07.049> issues

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
awesome especially since mana issues

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.109 
awesome especially since mana issues
were<00:01:07.680> such<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> big<00:01:08.250> problem<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.850> her<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
were such a big problem for her in the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.070 
were such a big problem for her in the
past<00:01:10.490> her<00:01:11.490> Q<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.000> builds<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.689> stack<00:01:13.049> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
past her Q now builds up a stack of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
past her Q now builds up a stack of
focus<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.860> lasts<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.310> about<00:01:14.400> five<00:01:14.700> seconds

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
focus that lasts for about five seconds

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
focus that lasts for about five seconds
whenever<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> hit<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> target<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
whenever you hit a target and when you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.800 
whenever you hit a target and when you
activate<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> ability<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.360> increased

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
activate the ability you get increased

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
activate the ability you get increased
attack<00:01:19.110> speed<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.770> passive<00:01:20.189> slow

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
attack speed and your passive slow

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.219 
attack speed and your passive slow
amount<00:01:20.700> increases<00:01:21.150> based<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.020> how<00:01:22.170> many

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
amount increases based on how many

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.350 
amount increases based on how many
focused<00:01:22.710> stacks<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.520> addition<00:01:24.270> if

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
focused stacks you have in addition if

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
focused stacks you have in addition if
you<00:01:24.479> had<00:01:24.570> five<00:01:24.810> stacks<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.380> focus<00:01:25.740> when<00:01:25.890> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
you had five stacks of focus when you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.469 
you had five stacks of focus when you
use<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.340> ability<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> gives<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
use this ability and now it gives you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.179 
use this ability and now it gives you
some<00:01:27.659> rapid-fire<00:01:28.020> attacks<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> nice

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
some rapid-fire attacks that do a nice

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.460 
some rapid-fire attacks that do a nice
chunk<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> damage<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.540> decently<00:01:30.990> strong<00:01:31.079> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
chunk of damage it's decently strong it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.870 
chunk of damage it's decently strong it
makes<00:01:31.619> her<00:01:31.740> early<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.189> mid<00:01:32.310> game<00:01:32.460> damage

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
makes her early and mid game damage

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.580 
makes her early and mid game damage
reasonably<00:01:33.390> higher<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> nice<00:01:34.200> change

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
reasonably higher so it's a nice change

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.700 
reasonably higher so it's a nice change
and<00:01:35.329> lastly<00:01:36.329> her<00:01:36.570> hog<00:01:36.810> shot<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.170> pretty<00:01:37.530> much

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
and lastly her hog shot is pretty much

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.399 
and lastly her hog shot is pretty much
the<00:01:37.829> same<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.579> global<00:01:39.390> which<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.290> be

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the same but it's now global which to be

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.149 
the same but it's now global which to be
honest<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.030> totally<00:01:42.030> insane<00:01:42.619> especially<00:01:43.619> at

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
honest is totally insane especially at

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
honest is totally insane especially at
the<00:01:44.250> competitive<00:01:44.579> level<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.570> alone<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the competitive level this alone is

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.590 
the competitive level this alone is
enough<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.799> make<00:01:46.950> ash<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.820> strong<00:01:48.149> add

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
enough to make ash really strong add

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.810 
enough to make ash really strong add
into<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:49.950> uses<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.369> charge

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
into that that it now uses a charge

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.060 
into that that it now uses a charge
system<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.479> stores<00:01:51.630> two<00:01:52.140> charges<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
system that stores two charges and so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.219 
system that stores two charges and so
it's<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.610> good<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.240> honestly<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.170> my

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
it's really good and honestly in my

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.590 
it's really good and honestly in my
opinion<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.310> biggest<00:01:56.790> buff<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.299> this

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
opinion is the biggest buff of this

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.569 
opinion is the biggest buff of this
update<00:01:58.170> since<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.890> you're<00:01:59.009> skilled<00:01:59.280> enough

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
update since if you're skilled enough

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.100 
update since if you're skilled enough
this<00:01:59.759> skill<00:02:00.000> pretty<00:02:00.270> much<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.600> becomes<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
this skill pretty much just becomes a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440 
this skill pretty much just becomes a
clairvoyance<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.070> better<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.299> use

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
clairvoyance but better and you can use

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.209 
clairvoyance but better and you can use
it<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.689> track<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> enemy<00:02:04.439> jungler<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:04.979> set<00:02:05.130> up

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
it to track the enemy jungler and set up

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.219 
it to track the enemy jungler and set up
a<00:02:05.310> boatload<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.759> place<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.360> really<00:02:06.570> deny<00:02:06.899> so

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
a boatload of place and really deny so

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.380 
a boatload of place and really deny so
many<00:02:07.409> options<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:08.009> your<00:02:08.099> opponents

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
many options for your opponents

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.240 
many options for your opponents
so<00:02:10.960> I<00:02:10.990> played<00:02:11.200> ash<00:02:11.380> for<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> few<00:02:11.830> games<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
so I played ash for a few games on the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.770 
so I played ash for a few games on the
PBE<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.819> have<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.060> say<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.210> now<00:02:13.510> she's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
PBE and I have to say that now she's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.600

using it effectively her mid game team

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.920 
using it effectively her mid game team
fights<00:02:23.380> are<00:02:23.760> reasonably<00:02:24.760> better<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.510> in

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
fights are reasonably better now and in

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.720 
fights are reasonably better now and in
combo<00:02:26.380> with<00:02:26.500> her<00:02:26.590> arrow<00:02:26.830> her<00:02:27.130> team<00:02:27.370> fights<00:02:27.580> in

her raw damage as a whole has gone up by

her raw damage as a whole has gone up by
a<00:02:31.930> decent<00:02:32.410> amount<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.430> lot

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
more room to work with and it's really

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.390 
more room to work with and it's really

it<00:03:00.070> got<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> bit<00:03:00.580> better<00:03:00.760> with<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.090> change<00:03:01.330> to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
it got a bit better with the change to

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.030 
it got a bit better with the change to

her Q and so relating has gone from
below<00:03:03.400> average<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:04.120> about<00:03:04.780> average<00:03:05.320> early<00:03:05.650> on

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
below average to about average early on

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.130 
below average to about average early on
and<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.730> does<00:03:06.910> get<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.180> lot<00:03:07.510> better<00:03:07.750> once<00:03:08.019> he

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
and it does get a lot better once he
