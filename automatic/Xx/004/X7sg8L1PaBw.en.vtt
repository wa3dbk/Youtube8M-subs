 angel montiel we are going to do the review in 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.240
 Spanish of a cube that I have been 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.150
 watching in the comments of the videos 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.710
 of youtube as you all know everything 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.990
 what you ask me all the cubes 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.930
 that you wish will be reviewed 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.059
 here in the leganese channel m10 to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.150
 all our subscribers chile 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.730
 Argentina Spain and Mexico that support 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.650
 fervently the channel and that's why the day 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.440
 today we are going to return to our weevil 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.920
 friend called pink amics 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.920
 well this is my life mix of the brand j 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.449
 I recently bought it for a small fee 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.940
 quantity that is the first advantage of the 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:05.440
 piraco mixco j that is a cheap step and 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.320
 easy to acquire and actually 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.899
 compared to the prices of a pyramid 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.380
 makers because this is practically a 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.690
 gift completely a gift comes in 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.500
 its characteristics as a past of 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.069
 speed in I must say that it does not have a 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.110
 absolutely specific complaint 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.840
 the parties 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.619
 they spin in an optimal way has this 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.619
 kicker system 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 it is not annoying simple and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.040
 simply click like the devil 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.760
 every time you want each of the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.110
 layers this is because it has some balines 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.229
 in the pieces that make up the pyre here 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.490
 I have this pyre very tight because 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.770
 then I have to tell you their 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.040
 disadvantages in fact it is difficult 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.950
 quite take out a piece because the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.840
 disadvantage that has this pir amics of 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.679
 the brand qj 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.220
 is that poppea very constantly sometimes 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.470
 gets to copy in an absurd way 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.570
 that the layers are forced without 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.480
 you get to clog half to half 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.090
 solve a piece falls down simple and 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.970
 it simply falls down and then it is very 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.760
 very annoying this 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.800
 for sun is adjustable here you can see the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.520
 screw perfectly in the high 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.780
 fucking definition that this day walks 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.780
 chipilin or want to focus 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.490
 here's just really good and 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.730
 screw that tells us it's adjustable 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.250
 I really do not need adjustment as 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.840
 I think that as it comes from the factory 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.820
 it looks pretty good 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.110
 You must also be very careful 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.480
 because the materials with which it is 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.750
 they are very delicate and these small 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.920
 edges that he has come on I want the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.540
 see 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.260
 let's go 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.459
 those little edges that it has 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.519
 and they are very very delicate and they bend very 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.310
 easily and it is not not pleasant to be 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.069
 double because after the cube no longer 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.939
 He does not want to assemble me 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.489
 I explain 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.030
 this piece that is the one that goes in that part 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.030
 from the pyre 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.390
 when they fold these little 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.310
 protuberances that have here their 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.890
 small edges starts to be annoying 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.600
 assemble it and they have to have a lot 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.080
 Care every time you are going to do the 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.210
 review of your pira mix 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.180
 those are the basic disadvantages that 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:48.359
 present this let's move on 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.959
 otherwise it does not have anything of 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.810
 bad actually its features 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.470
 for speed olvin they are very good 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.000
 and you can occupy it very well for 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.110
 practice and even for the competition 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.060
 official is very good the truth is that 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.150
 there are few options available in 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.910
 pull mix and from the mark j does not ask 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.800
 nothing to the rest I will not say that it has 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.459
 the same performance as a first month in 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.209
 actually the pyramid first is second to none 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.850
 in quality materials in everything is 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.520
 unsurpassed but if you do not have much 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.889
 money or you do not like both the pyramid 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.860
 I do not have a case that you spend 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.040
 so much in a month first and better you 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.310
 you buy a lame you are practices you learn 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.560
 here 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.720
 you try to compete in the competition 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.280
 official and if you like it and it calls you a lot 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.920
 the attention you buy a meffert that is 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.840
