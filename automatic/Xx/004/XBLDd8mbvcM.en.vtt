00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
in 11 D and I noticed this big a monitor

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.700 
in 11 D and I noticed this big a monitor
let's<00:00:07.859> let's<00:00:08.280> put<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:08.670> that's<00:00:09.500> that's<00:00:10.500> like

monitors<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.780> end<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.110> doing<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.829> much<00:00:41.040> work

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
monitors we end up doing so much work

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.500 
monitors we end up doing so much work
that<00:00:41.579> goes<00:00:42.000> into<00:00:43.219> print<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.489> mass<00:00:44.879> quantities

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that goes into print on mass quantities

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
that goes into print on mass quantities
yeah<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> make<00:00:46.800> sure<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.250> our

yeah that we want to make sure that our

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.900 
yeah that we want to make sure that our
reproduction<00:00:51.170> as<00:00:52.170> possible<00:00:52.710> yeah<00:00:53.219> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
reproduction as possible yeah this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.660 
reproduction as possible yeah this
really<00:00:54.870> does<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> fantastic<00:00:55.440> job<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.579> getting

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
really does a fantastic job of getting

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.420 
really does a fantastic job of getting
those<00:00:57.390> colors<00:00:57.809> true<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> print<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> its<00:00:59.100> final

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
those colors true to print and its final

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.720 
those colors true to print and its final
form<00:00:59.640> I've<00:00:59.969> loved<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:00.960> far<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> 30

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
form I've loved it so far this is the 30

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.170 
form I've loved it so far this is the 30
inch<00:01:02.910> model<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> monster<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.970> way

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
inch model so it's a monster this way

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.440 
inch model so it's a monster this way
and<00:01:06.540> also<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:08.460> looks<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> refreeze<00:01:09.270> no<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and also it looks like a refreeze no I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
and also it looks like a refreeze no I
have<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> 30<00:01:10.049> inch<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.280> lot<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.850> it's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
have a 30 inch but it's a lot like it's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
have a 30 inch but it's a lot like it's
three<00:01:12.270> times<00:01:12.450> skinnier<00:01:12.960> Lee<00:01:13.110> yeah<00:01:13.260> it's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
three times skinnier Lee yeah it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940 
three times skinnier Lee yeah it's
thinner<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.640> think<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.320> crazy

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
thinner and I think for the crazy

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.350 
thinner and I think for the crazy
technology<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.180> would<00:01:18.240> be

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
technology that's in it it would be

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
technology that's in it it would be
thinner<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.979> phenomenal<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
thinner but it really is phenomenal it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.570 
thinner but it really is phenomenal it
looks<00:01:21.240> exactly<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.920> print<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> end

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
looks exactly like the print in the end

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.330 
looks exactly like the print in the end
so<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.689> much<00:01:25.080> better<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> think

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
so it's that much better do you think

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.950 
so it's that much better do you think
it's<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:26.820> you've<00:01:27.030> worked<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.540> pictures

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it's because you've worked with pictures

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.649 
it's because you've worked with pictures
for<00:01:28.200> years<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> years<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.369> makes<00:01:30.180> that's

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
for years and years that it makes that's

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.679 
for years and years that it makes that's
why<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.110> better<00:01:34.040> images<00:01:35.040> sorry<00:01:35.340> I've<00:01:35.759> I've

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
why it's better images sorry I've I've

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
why it's better images sorry I've I've
had<00:01:36.960> issues<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> lot<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> Martyrs<00:01:38.369> with

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
had issues with a lot of Martyrs with

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.020 
had issues with a lot of Martyrs with
the<00:01:39.210> color<00:01:39.540> correction<00:01:39.930> yeah<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.220> far<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the color correction yeah so far this is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.020 
the color correction yeah so far this is
close<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.350> they're<00:01:47.250> expensive<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.850> that's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
close to so they're expensive and that's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
close to so they're expensive and that's
why<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.420> everyone<00:01:48.720> has<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.320> they're<00:01:49.680> pretty

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
why not everyone has one they're pretty

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
why not everyone has one they're pretty
expensive<00:01:50.070> how<00:01:50.670> much<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:52.850> 4,000<00:01:53.850> it's

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
expensive how much are they 4,000 it's

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.179 
expensive how much are they 4,000 it's
not<00:01:54.869> isn't<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.409> an<00:01:55.530> either<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.829> something

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
not isn't like an either or something

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:56.569 
not isn't like an either or something
like<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
like that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.260 
like that
it's

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
it's

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.349 
it's
2,500<00:01:59.020> oh<00:01:59.429> yeah<00:02:00.460> solutely

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
2,500 oh yeah solutely

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the typical 30 inches like stuff l-like

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.240 
the typical 30 inches like stuff l-like
1213<00:02:05.320> oh<00:02:05.409> yeah

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
you're just you're you're paying for the

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.830 
you're just you're you're paying for the
color<00:02:08.050> correction<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:09.069> doesn't<00:02:09.459> have<00:02:09.640> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
color correction it doesn't have that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.720 
color correction it doesn't have that
you<00:02:10.840> still<00:02:11.050> have<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.290> calibrate<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.099> oh<00:02:12.370> yeah

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
you still have to calibrate it oh yeah

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.199 
you still have to calibrate it oh yeah
okay<00:02:13.330> that's<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:14.080> mean<00:02:14.290> that's<00:02:14.470> what<00:02:14.650> gets<00:02:14.890> it

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
okay that's I mean that's what gets it

okay that's I mean that's what gets it
totally<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:17.110> know<00:02:17.140> spot<00:02:17.590> on<00:02:17.769> T<00:02:17.950> yeah<00:02:18.280> and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
totally you know spot on T yeah and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.309 
totally you know spot on T yeah and
they're<00:02:19.180> really<00:02:19.299> quickly<00:02:19.750> that's<00:02:20.110> an
