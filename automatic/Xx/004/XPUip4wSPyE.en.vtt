00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.109
 We were encouraged to say 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.019
 temporary problems and after 3 4 months 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.119

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.599
 the team will still be 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.779

 who became what 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.419
 the main factor accounted for

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.260
 Soviet Union 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.519
 because it was them they criticized 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.039
 I think there is no 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.760
 now therefore with pleasure 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.879
 during adjustment this ball is invited 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.919
 unexpectedly before helping with everyone 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.659
 showing me that based on the team right now experience 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.459
 on one issue or another therefore 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.299
 adaptation 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.660
 pretty quickly passes 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.549
 as a team 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.059
