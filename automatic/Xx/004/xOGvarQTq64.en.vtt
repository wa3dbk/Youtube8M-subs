00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
position on the on the TD bank and you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.450 
position on the on the TD bank and you
need<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.539> able<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.990> develop<00:00:22.439> good<00:00:23.220> power

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
need to be able to develop good power

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.450 
need to be able to develop good power
output<00:00:23.760> output<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.869> terminal<00:00:24.960> by<00:00:25.560> finding

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
output output on the terminal by finding

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.019 
output output on the terminal by finding
a<00:00:26.670> good<00:00:27.390> balance<00:00:27.840> between<00:00:28.849> aerodynamics<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
a good balance between aerodynamics and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.410 
a good balance between aerodynamics and
the<00:00:30.420> ability<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> develop<00:00:31.320> our<00:00:31.969> you<00:00:32.969> also<00:00:33.270> use

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the ability to develop our you also use

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
the ability to develop our you also use
the<00:00:33.600> itune<00:00:33.960> why<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> such<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> good<00:00:35.640> system

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the itune why is that such a good system

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.389 
the itune why is that such a good system
yeah<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.870> TT<00:00:37.260> by<00:00:37.440> special<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.250> good

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
yeah on the TT by special is really good

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.130 
yeah on the TT by special is really good
system<00:00:38.730> because<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.870> switch

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
system because you can you can switch

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.630 
system because you can you can switch
here<00:00:40.940> in<00:00:41.940> both<00:00:42.210> both<00:00:42.690> position<00:00:43.170> when<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> are

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
here in both both position when you are

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
here in both both position when you are
in<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.960> individual<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> bars<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.739> then

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
in a individual in the bars and then

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520 
in a individual in the bars and then
when<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.420> after<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> cornet<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.350> can

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
when you are a after a cornet you can

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
when you are a after a cornet you can
switch<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.520> whenever<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.149> because

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
switch here whenever you want because

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.340 
switch here whenever you want because
you<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.840> two<00:00:52.649> options<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
you have two options and so it's a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.119 
you have two options and so it's a
something<00:00:55.350> when<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> old<00:00:56.579> system<00:00:56.820> you

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
something when I with the old system you

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
something when I with the old system you
sometimes<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.309> technical<00:00:59.760> course<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.420> find

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
sometimes in technical course you find

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.709 
sometimes in technical course you find
difficult<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.199> change<00:01:01.469> because<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
difficult to change because you have the

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.119 
difficult to change because you have the
change<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> end<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> ours<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:05.070> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
change on on the end of ours but now you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
change on on the end of ours but now you
you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.909> UK<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> play<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.350> on

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you can UK you have on the play on on

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.109 
you can UK you have on the play on on
the<00:01:07.799> brakes<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> other

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the brakes and you have it on the other

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.750 
the brakes and you have it on the other
bus<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.130> comfortable<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
bus so it's a it's more comfortable it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.109 
bus so it's a it's more comfortable it
and<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.479> changed<00:01:12.810> faster<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.310> it's

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and that it changed faster it's a it's

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.410 
and that it changed faster it's a it's
easy<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.540> change<00:01:16.460> from<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> big<00:01:17.759> year<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.299> low

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
easy to change from the big year the low

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.440 
easy to change from the big year the low
gear<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> front<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.729> because<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:21.060> when

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
gear in the front and because when when

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.630 
gear in the front and because when when
you<00:01:21.570> ending<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> PT<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.830> use<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> power

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you ending the PT you use all the power

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.070 
you ending the PT you use all the power
sometimes<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.270> even<00:01:24.390> hard<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> change<00:01:24.960> but

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
sometimes it's even hard to change but

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
sometimes it's even hard to change but
we<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.549> press<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> button

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
we do you know you just press the button

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.679 
we do you know you just press the button
that<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:28.020> comfortable<00:01:28.500> ok<00:01:29.070> great

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
that it's really comfortable ok great

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
that it's really comfortable ok great
now<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> giro<00:01:31.200> d'italia<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.770> already<00:01:32.040> coming

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
now the giro d'italia is already coming

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.850 
now the giro d'italia is already coming
last<00:01:32.880> year<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.329> night<00:01:33.540> yeah<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> expectation

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
last year one night yeah the expectation

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.310 
last year one night yeah the expectation
edition<00:01:35.310> yeah<00:01:36.060> easier<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> boot<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.079> even

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
edition yeah easier the boot is even

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.100 
edition yeah easier the boot is even
harder<00:01:37.590> than<00:01:37.619> last<00:01:37.860> year<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.700> my<00:01:39.540> goal<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
harder than last year so my goal is to a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.870 
harder than last year so my goal is to a
right<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.979> same<00:01:41.189> kind<00:01:41.729> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
right there and then the same kind of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.749 
right there and then the same kind of
for<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.210> head<00:01:42.329> last<00:01:42.540> year<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.460> this<00:01:44.460> year<00:01:44.520> we

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
for my head last year and this year we

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.670 
for my head last year and this year we
will<00:01:44.790> start<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.360> another<00:01:45.689> strong<00:01:46.200> ladder<00:01:46.439> in

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
will start with another strong ladder in

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.470 
will start with another strong ladder in
decline

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
decline

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.280 
decline
started<00:01:47.930> in<00:01:48.050> co2<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:49.000> we<00:01:50.000> see<00:01:50.300> how<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.630> would

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
started in co2 and we see how it would
