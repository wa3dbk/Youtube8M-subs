 hi friends from youtube I would talk to you if 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.080
 in this video we are going to learn hi the 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.660
 game plan has requested from the subscriber the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.070
 song is very easy 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:21.090
 let's say a corporal and place it in the 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:21.090
 third space all places 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.140
 well what we agree to use are 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.140
 the following 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200
 they are older 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.930
 if greater with seventh that would be this as 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.820
 the one we all know is here but what 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.050
 we would do here and we took out his middle finger 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.360
 but you can also do this me for 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.010
 a comfort thing one I'm new 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.890
 I'll do field turns here 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 you want it to be 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.650
 a greater concept and if already the same as 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.890
 this but we do not go back all space 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.890
 obviously we are not going 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.100
 We also use C major 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.900
 of major and minor 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.060
 and we are going to be also it is agreed but 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.850
 body that would be like the island with 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.799
 penny here had this but we will 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.100
 click here in the sixth space in the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.100
 second 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:42.700
 and the regio would be 2 below 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:44.970
 2 up and 2 down very easy 2 down 2 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.970
 above 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.920
 to 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.430
 and I had planned to make the royal 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.430
 original that is like that 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.220
 but I do not have the flechita program 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.349
 down and up so up 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.129
 do not have something better to edit 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.290
 which would be a less headache 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.640
 avoid the ray so memorizing so 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.629
 let's put the song into practice and 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.629
 let's touch any doubt 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.240
 and 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 ah 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.470
 ah 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.040
 Y 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.690
 Y 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.420
 Y 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.880
 well we had been the subject that not 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.530
 has greater complexity afterwards 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.420
 chords and the radio is repeating so 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.890
 just change the lyrics so I hope 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.180
