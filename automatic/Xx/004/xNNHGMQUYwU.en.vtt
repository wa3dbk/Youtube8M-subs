00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello everyone I find this 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.089
 new video to make you a tutorial 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.460
 on the colored pencil so that one 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.620
 it's my first bit ugly but I 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.960
 not find the other one I did 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 so that's it so he really feels 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.990
 cream colors with that they go 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 all so really little material is needed 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.849
 rather of the strong state he deserved it 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.680
 will need the paw of the color of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 your choice for the pencil makes me 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.770
 I said red so I use red 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.079
 Indian number 24 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.840
 there it will cost me like a scalpel 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.600
 usually teacher 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.600
 it will take so pretty want to hang 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.780
 pliers if you want to reduce the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 size of the vaulters and that's it 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.010
 will need some material 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.379
 we will start by taking red or 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.899
 the color of your choice 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:06.060
 we're going to make a ball and in fact we're going 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.549
 make a rectangle of shots every 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.540
 sides in his war like that like I 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.610
 show you how to do fake 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.799
 flatten next to each other in fact 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.799
 you have to turn flatten turn flatten 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.740
 you do not have to do this 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.900
 form there at worst you can keep it 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.920
 justin sulky if you want if you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.400
 can not do that but it's very 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.400
 easy to do 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.250
 do you roll you to bake 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.829
 high school high school we will cut the balls 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:48.450
 that's why but sides like that 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.280
 hop we're finally here so here we omit that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 all sides for the end 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.170
 now to not be fit to 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.049
 a kind of glue so I think they 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.350
 do not stop fucking like that 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.439
 dream of one side finer than the other and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.200
 you will take red dough 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:18.030
 he puts on the end so fit 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:19.950
 cone also we have and put it like that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.269
 so it's ugly for now 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.900
 is a little ugly for now 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.860
 when we are going to cut end 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.910
 when one is a flat surface for 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.910
 can the task and the cricket like that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.420
 you see what gives back so after we 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.260
 will do something after we'll do so 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.269
 like that so we will take the offer 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.750
 we're going to make a little ball and we're going 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.750
 flatten 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.040
 hop 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.240
 or not 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:14.569
 and you will put a little bit of 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:17.660
 red a hint of red really 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.819
 not much like that so that's what 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.370
 it gives you for now could the 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.940
 leave like this but look at what I 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.290
 going to do I'm actually going to carve the 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.140
 pencil with the blade 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.880
 so I'm coming this is a little bit 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.709
 hard in business so if you do not have 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.230
 trust to do you do it 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.610
 not to the two expensive ones right was 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:45.380
 broken to the triangle from all sides on 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.470
 going to come carve would put the role of 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.470
 the child 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.740
 hop we'll give a little red 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.970
 he's going to look like you a little bit 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.810
 we want to put a little more 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.609
 red because there 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.190
 it's a bit missed when I detail is 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.980
 so if you want to carve it do it 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:29.440
 principle it works when I size but 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:32.820
 there it will work you reform a small 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.980
 few sides if they were destroyed hop 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.190
 here and that gives you something like that 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.040
 so it's really too cute after I 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.850
 do not know what you're up to 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.980
 but sailing to omagh n their fridge so 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.060
 I hope you have enjoyed this hole 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.660
 and I'll see you soon 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.660
 bye
