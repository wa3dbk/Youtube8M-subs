00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.460 

this<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.180> one<00:01:25.390> reason<00:01:25.420> why<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:25.930> always<00:01:26.230> have

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
this is one reason why I always have

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.770 
this is one reason why I always have
that<00:01:26.620> paring<00:01:27.010> knife<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.340> lot<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:28.570> you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
that paring knife a lot because you

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.350 
that paring knife a lot because you
never<00:01:28.930> know<00:01:29.140> when<00:01:29.410> you're<00:01:29.560> going<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.770> need<00:01:29.980> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
never know when you're going to need it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.660 
never know when you're going to need it
it's<00:01:31.360> just<00:01:31.600> really<00:01:31.840> handy<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.410> have<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:36.400> once

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
it's just really handy to have now once

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.040 
it's just really handy to have now once
again<00:01:36.790> this<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.150> where<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.570> paring<00:01:37.870> knife

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
again this is where the paring knife

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.690 
again this is where the paring knife
comes<00:01:38.320> in<00:01:38.500> handy<00:01:38.710> just<00:01:39.010> go<00:01:39.220> ahead<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.370> scrape

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
comes in handy just go ahead and scrape

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.469 
comes in handy just go ahead and scrape
it<00:01:39.910> off<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.830> now<00:01:42.550> we<00:01:42.610> need<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.970> do<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.300> with

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
it off and now we need to do that with

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:51.820 
it off and now we need to do that with
all<00:01:43.720> four<00:01:44.020> cloves

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.110 

and<00:01:52.830> now<00:01:52.980> remember<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.550> reason<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.970> we're

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
and now remember the reason that we're

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.750 
and now remember the reason that we're
doing<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.230> just<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.770> flavor<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
doing this is this is just to flavor the

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.840 
doing this is this is just to flavor the
actual<00:01:57.360> sauce<00:01:57.780> none<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.890> none<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.700> these

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
actual sauce none of this none of these

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.490 
actual sauce none of this none of these
ingredients<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.540> actually<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.260> be<00:02:01.380> in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
ingredients are actually going to be in

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.870 
ingredients are actually going to be in
the<00:02:01.620> sauce<00:02:01.830> because<00:02:02.250> we're<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.760> be

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the sauce because we're going to be

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
the sauce because we're going to be
straining<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:03.720> now<00:02:04.410> we<00:02:04.470> have<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:04.860> our

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
straining it and now we have all our

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.810 
straining it and now we have all our
garlic<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:08.160> ahead<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:08.580> stir

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
garlic in there and go ahead and stir

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.350 
garlic in there and go ahead and stir
that<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:10.220> now<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.400> particular<00:02:11.610> step

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
that all up now this particular step

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.910 
that all up now this particular step
right<00:02:12.600> here<00:02:12.660> we're<00:02:13.260> only<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.830> be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
right here we're only going to be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.130 
right here we're only going to be
letting<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.730> fri<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.540> maybe<00:02:15.780> about<00:02:15.960> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
letting this fri for maybe about a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.530 
letting this fri for maybe about a
minute<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:17.370> not<00:02:17.580> really<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.120> take<00:02:18.300> too

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
minute it's not really going to take too

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.300 
minute it's not really going to take too
long<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.340> next<00:02:20.520> step<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:21.060> oregano<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
long so the next step is oregano and

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.710 
long so the next step is oregano and
we're<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.520> put<00:02:23.670> about<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.940> tablespoon<00:02:24.210> of

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
we're going to put about a tablespoon of

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.040 
we're going to put about a tablespoon of
oregano<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.410> there<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:30.450> sprinkle<00:02:30.780> it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
oregano in there and just sprinkle it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.940 
oregano in there and just sprinkle it
over<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.350> top<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:33.540> last<00:02:33.750> step<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.350> we

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
over the top and the last step is we

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.220 
over the top and the last step is we
need<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.310> put<00:02:35.580> about<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.120> quarter<00:02:36.720> cup<00:02:36.750> of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
need to put about a quarter cup of

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.610 
need to put about a quarter cup of
tomato<00:02:37.680> paste<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:38.280> there<00:02:38.870> which<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.140> basically

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
tomato paste in there which is basically

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.860 
tomato paste in there which is basically
about<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.280> half<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.730> can<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:45.180> go<00:02:45.390> ahead<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.690> put

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
about a half a can so go ahead and put

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.460 
about a half a can so go ahead and put
that<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.200> there

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.370 

and<00:02:52.470> now<00:02:53.280> go<00:02:53.550> ahead<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.880> once<00:02:54.510> again<00:02:54.660> mix<00:02:55.170> that

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
and now go ahead and once again mix that

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.660 
and now go ahead and once again mix that
all<00:02:55.440> together<00:02:58.010> because<00:02:59.010> what<00:02:59.220> we're<00:02:59.370> doing

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
all together because what we're doing

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.560 
all together because what we're doing
right<00:02:59.850> now<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.360> we're<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.050> making<00:03:01.290> our<00:03:01.650> base

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
right now is we're just making our base

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.630 
right now is we're just making our base
so<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.600> we're<00:03:03.930> ready<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.470> put<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.460> red

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
so that we're ready to put in the red

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.320 
so that we're ready to put in the red
wine<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:07.550> now<00:03:08.550> we're<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.090> let

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
wine and now we're just going to let

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.540 
wine and now we're just going to let
that<00:03:09.360> go<00:03:09.780> ahead<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.440> cook<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.710> about<00:03:11.130> one

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
that go ahead and cook for about one

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.760 
that go ahead and cook for about one
minute<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.150> let<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.050> all<00:03:16.320> bind

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
minute and just let that all bind

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.930 
minute and just let that all bind
together<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.670> come<00:03:20.850> out

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
together and this is going to come out

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.850 
together and this is going to come out
almost<00:03:21.270> like<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.540> paste<00:03:21.930> it's<00:03:22.290> actually<00:03:22.709> going

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
almost like a paste it's actually going

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.850 
almost like a paste it's actually going
to<00:03:22.920> be<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.220> base<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.490> our<00:03:23.820> sauce<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:25.680> is

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
to be the base of our sauce and this is

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.650 
to be the base of our sauce and this is
how<00:03:26.010> we<00:03:26.070> mix<00:03:26.430> all<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.880> ingredients<00:03:26.910> together

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
how we mix all the ingredients together

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.360 
how we mix all the ingredients together
to<00:03:28.200> make<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.560> base<00:03:28.800> for<00:03:29.280> our<00:03:29.310> red<00:03:29.760> wine<00:03:30.030> sauce
