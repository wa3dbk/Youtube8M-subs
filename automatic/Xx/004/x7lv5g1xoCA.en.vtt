is<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:10.020> through<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.409> though<00:01:10.590> i'm<00:01:11.130> not

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
is going through here though i'm not

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.800 
is going through here though i'm not
using<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.760> lot<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> force<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> lot<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
using a lot of force or a lot of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.469 
using a lot of force or a lot of
pressure<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:14.040> would<00:01:14.189> think<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
pressure and I would think you do that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
pressure and I would think you do that
because<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.960> tomato<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.619> commander

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
because of tomato like that commander

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
because of tomato like that commander
night<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.180> sharp<00:01:18.450> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
night but because it's so sharp you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300 
night but because it's so sharp you
don't<00:01:18.990> eat<00:01:19.110> thats<00:01:19.259> aeration<00:01:19.740> people<00:01:20.070> think

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
don't eat thats aeration people think

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.560 
don't eat thats aeration people think
that<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> serrated<00:01:21.540> knife

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that you have to have a serrated knife

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
that you have to have a serrated knife
to<00:01:22.020> cut<00:01:22.170> tomatoes<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> knife<00:01:23.220> is

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
to cut tomatoes and if the knife is

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
to cut tomatoes and if the knife is
sharp<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.180> don't<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.810> does<00:01:24.990> help<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
sharp you really don't it does help a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.499 
sharp you really don't it does help a
little<00:01:25.439> bit<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.040> necessary<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:27.330> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
little bit but it's not necessary as I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.910
