helmet let me tell you is the best of
the<00:00:13.500> best<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.920> constructed<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:15.299> carbon

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
the best is constructed of a carbon

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.590 
the best is constructed of a carbon
fiber<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.650> outer<00:00:16.830> shell<00:00:17.310> making<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.300> very

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
fiber on the outer shell making it very

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.439 
fiber on the outer shell making it very
durable<00:00:18.930> yet<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.240> completely<00:00:21.240> lightweight

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
durable yet it's completely lightweight

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.330 
durable yet it's completely lightweight
I<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.840> literally<00:00:22.260> throw<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.189> it's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
I can literally throw this up and it's

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.550 
I can literally throw this up and it's
so<00:00:24.240> lightweight<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.810> bet<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.260> very

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
so lightweight I bet it's very

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.950 
so lightweight I bet it's very

some<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> features<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:28.920> benefits<00:00:29.869> we<00:00:30.869> did

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
some of the features and benefits we did

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.510 
some of the features and benefits we did
mention<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.439> carbon<00:00:31.769> fiber<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.369> also

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
mention the carbon fiber but it also

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.569 
mention the carbon fiber but it also
comes<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.239> four<00:00:33.690> shell<00:00:34.079> sizes<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:35.130> EPS

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
comes in four shell sizes and for EPS

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
comes in four shell sizes and for EPS
sizes<00:00:36.149> meaning<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> more<00:00:37.140> precise

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
sizes meaning you have a more precise

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.280 
sizes meaning you have a more precise
fit<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.280> top<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> dual

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
fit on top of that you have a dual

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.940 
fit on top of that you have a dual
density<00:00:40.590> EPS<00:00:41.489> foam<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> inside<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
density EPS foam on the inside so one of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.430 
density EPS foam on the inside so one of
the<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.730> layers<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> softer<00:00:45.840> foam<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the the layers is a softer foam and the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
the the layers is a softer foam and the
other<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.190> harder<00:00:47.640> foam<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
other is a harder foam well the the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.110 
other is a harder foam well the the
inner<00:00:48.600> lining<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.739> EPS<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> lot<00:00:50.879> harder

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
inner lining of the EPS is a lot harder

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.630 
inner lining of the EPS is a lot harder
so<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.690> helps<00:00:52.379> spread<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> impact

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so that helps spread out the impact

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.360 
so that helps spread out the impact
absorption<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.480> case<00:00:54.719> you're<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> crash

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
absorption in case you're in a crash

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
absorption in case you're in a crash

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
exhaust ports on the back that is crazy

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.520 
exhaust ports on the back that is crazy
if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.490> thought<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> v1<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> v2<00:01:12.510> had<00:01:13.200> plenty

if you thought the v1 the v2 had plenty

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.429 
if you thought the v1 the v2 had plenty
of<00:01:13.650> breathability<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.880> v4<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.869> really

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
of breathability the v4 is is really

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.760 
of breathability the v4 is is really
where<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.799> at<00:01:17.180> now<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> inside<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.530> have

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
where it's at now on the inside you have

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.210 
where it's at now on the inside you have
this<00:01:20.070> mesh<00:01:20.460> lining<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.450> under<00:01:22.380> liner<00:01:22.619> so

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
this mesh lining on the under liner so

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550 
this mesh lining on the under liner so
that<00:01:23.250> helps<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.600> breathe<00:01:24.960> better<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.409> also

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that helps it breathe better and it also

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.770 
that helps it breathe better and it also
creates<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.220> cooler<00:01:26.640> effect<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> inside

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
really quick here was the intake ports

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
really quick here was the intake ports
right<00:01:33.150> by<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> brow<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:34.049> when<00:01:34.229> you're

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
right by the brow here when you're
