 are actuated hydraulically the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.289
 load arms lift heavy logs 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.200
 easily and place them on the bench 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.110
 cutting the tough clamp 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.909
 trunks and the two lateral supports

 the thickness of the table and move the 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.120
 head to the proper position for the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.430
 next cut 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.890
 five different types of cut you 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.750
 offer maximum flexibility for 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.959
 cut quickly in any
