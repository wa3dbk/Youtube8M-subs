00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.800
 a greeting to all the friends of the corner 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.170
 IT welcomes you in 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.250
 this new video as an agent since 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.710
 title in this video 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.720
 we will activate the no clock function 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.149
 on android 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.010
 in a nutshell I have previously 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.670
 I had already made a video on how 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.160
 activate the noc function that was 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.200
 made famous thanks in the days so 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.960
 to activate the screen with double 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.120
 tap in this case we're going to perform 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.760
 the inverse function then lock it 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.719
 screen by double-tapping our 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.100
 screen 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.600
 we will do everything thanks to 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.239
 an application the application in 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.789
 question is called cnog loc 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.600
 just look for it on the play store is free 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.610
 and therefore weighs less than a mega then 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.050
 very light once you have it 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.120
 found it installed do that on open 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.790
 now we have this russia screen 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.790
 which tells us that the application is not 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.250
 enabled then we do on open 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.370
 android air service ethics 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.410
 let's activate now the screen is 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.590
 then turned green then ours 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.229
 application is activated let's go here in 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.510
 settings up 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.110
 they are few and not many and many 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.530
 simple 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.830
 as you see here we will have a hood that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.080
 we can move for example that I have 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.690
 put here then if we click on 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.729
 settings this red circle 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.000
 are the settings that practically exist 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.740
 lets you choose the portion of the screen where 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.460
 we 're going to plug for the double tap 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.090
 as you can see we can modify the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.570
 scampa where we will go to plug I leave 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.649
 so and facts on the setting itself reopens 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.120
 the settings so I put it where I have it 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.250
 enough space where no applications 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.770
 private I still do settings and le 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 settings have been saved then 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.040
 we leave the application 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.220
 now I find do the double tap here in 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.390
 low and as you can see the screen is 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.220
 stuck 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.880
 so the application is very simple 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:35.140
 the settings are not many to use 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.580
 and it is very useful and is very light for 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.050
 this video is everything if you have gods 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.440
 problems with the configuration 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.150
 application with installation 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.980
 write well in the comments 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.690
 and only a video see you still here 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.530
 on the corner youtube channel 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.530
