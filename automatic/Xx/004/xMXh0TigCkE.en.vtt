welcome to my tutorial series on how to

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.190 
welcome to my tutorial series on how to
make<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.250> zombies<00:00:02.730> map<00:00:02.970> in<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.659> video<00:00:03.990> we'll

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
spawns are quite simple so what we want

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.919 
spawns are quite simple so what we want
to<00:00:07.859> do<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.250> our<00:00:08.400> 2d<00:00:08.730> view<00:00:09.030> we're<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.570> to

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
to do is in our 2d view we're going to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.459 
to do is in our 2d view we're going to
right<00:00:10.170> click<00:00:10.200> go<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> info<00:00:11.969> player<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.139> then

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
right click go to info player and then

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.470 
right click go to info player and then
start<00:00:13.920> now<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.700> want<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.030> make<00:00:15.150> sure<00:00:15.179> that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
start now you want to make sure that

start now you want to make sure that
it's<00:00:15.599> not<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:15.960> ground<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.740> change

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
it's not in the ground so it can change

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.220 
it's not in the ground so it can change
your<00:00:17.310> view<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.090> drag<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.570> up<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.750> where<00:00:19.080> you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I can hit the the 3 on my keyboard and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.480 
I can hit the the 3 on my keyboard and
then<00:00:25.140> raise<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.529> up<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.830> then<00:00:25.920> go<00:00:26.010> back<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> 4

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and as you can see it's now 8 increments

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.470 
and as you can see it's now 8 increments
because<00:00:28.890> we're<00:00:29.130> working<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.519> AIDS<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.029> then

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
because we're working on AIDS and then

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.999 
because we're working on AIDS and then
just<00:00:30.750> Center<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.320> middle<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> map

just Center it in the middle of the map
as<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.520> see<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
as you can see here now this is going to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.260 
as you can see here now this is going to
be<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> single<00:00:34.829> player<00:00:35.040> spawn<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.850> if<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.180> were

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
be a single player spawn so if we were

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.850 
be a single player spawn so if we were
to<00:00:36.360> play<00:00:36.510> single-player<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.469> wouldn't<00:00:37.800> need

to play single-player we wouldn't need

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
to play single-player we wouldn't need
anything<00:00:38.190> else<00:00:38.489> however<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.480> also<00:00:39.629> want<00:00:39.899> to

play multiplayer so to do that we need

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.630 
play multiplayer so to do that we need
for<00:00:42.450> additional<00:00:42.719> spawns<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:44.129> click<00:00:44.399> go

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.110 
for additional spawns so right click go
to<00:00:45.239> script<00:00:45.890> struct<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> now<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
to script struct and now we have a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
to script struct and now we have a
little<00:00:48.390> box<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.930> again<00:00:49.140> line<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.920> where

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
is going to bring up our entity window

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.009 
is going to bring up our entity window
the<00:01:02.070> entity<00:01:02.489> window<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.969> pretty<00:01:03.180> much<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.750> able

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the entity window is pretty much be able

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.640 
the entity window is pretty much be able
to<00:01:04.260> give<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:06.200> attributes<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.380> stuff<00:01:07.560> like

initial underscore spawn underscore
points<00:01:20.750> now<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.810> computer<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
points now the computer is going to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.410 
points now the computer is going to
handle<00:01:22.770> everything<00:01:23.009> else<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.580> us<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.000> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
handle everything else for us so that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
handle everything else for us so that's
all<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.950> hit<00:01:26.070> space

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
all we have to do then we can hit space

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
all we have to do then we can hit space
copy<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.119> put<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.600> where<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:27.900> player<00:01:28.200> 2

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
copy it put it where we want player 2

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.359 
copy it put it where we want player 2
player<00:01:29.490> 3<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.509> player<00:01:30.810> 4<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:32.250> we

player 3 and then player 4 and then we

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.830 
player 3 and then player 4 and then we
can<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:32.670> bring<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> entity<00:01:33.570> window

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
can also bring up the entity window

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.719 
can also bring up the entity window
again<00:01:33.960> by<00:01:34.200> hitting<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> n<00:01:34.740> key<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.700> we

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
again by hitting the n key and then we

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.640 
again by hitting the n key and then we
can<00:01:35.939> select<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> player<00:01:36.600> spawns<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.229> make

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
can select the player spawns and make

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.330 
can select the player spawns and make
them<00:01:37.860> face<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> certain<00:01:38.729> way<00:01:38.880> by<00:01:39.119> clicking<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
them face a certain way by clicking the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.679 
them face a certain way by clicking the
directions<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.939> shift-click<00:01:42.509> them

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
directions here so shift-click them

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.310 
directions here so shift-click them
change<00:01:43.560> where<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:43.979> them<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
change where you want them to go and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.660 
change where you want them to go and
there<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:47.009> we're<00:01:47.369> gonna<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
there you go now we're gonna have a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
there you go now we're gonna have a
single<00:01:47.970> player<00:01:48.180> spawn<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.350> have

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
single player spawn and then we have

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
single player spawn and then we have
multi<00:01:49.770> fighter<00:01:50.009> spawns<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.610> also<00:01:50.880> make<00:01:51.060> sure

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
multi fighter spawns and also make sure

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.210 
multi fighter spawns and also make sure
that<00:01:51.240> they're<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> distance<00:01:52.140> good<00:01:52.950> enough

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that they're at a distance good enough

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.160 
that they're at a distance good enough
your<00:01:53.640> characters<00:01:54.030> usually<00:01:54.360> about<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> block<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
your characters usually about a block a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.200 
your characters usually about a block a
little<00:01:55.500> bit<00:01:55.710> smaller<00:01:56.009> than<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> block<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.030> make

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
little bit smaller than a block so make

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.670 
little bit smaller than a block so make
sure<00:01:57.240> there's<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.049> distance<00:01:58.469> ratio

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
sure there's about that distance ratio

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.260 
sure there's about that distance ratio

get spawned inside of each other if

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
get spawned inside of each other if
you're<00:02:00.390> lucky<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.899> again<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:01.920> game<00:02:02.130> will

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you're lucky or again your game will

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.039 
you're lucky or again your game will
crash<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:03.149> that's<00:02:03.299> pretty<00:02:03.479> much<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.869> for

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
crash but that's pretty much it for

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.539 
crash but that's pretty much it for
spawning<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.009> we'll<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.340> we'll<00:02:05.430> light

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
spawning so what we'll do is we'll light

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.340 
spawning so what we'll do is we'll light
control<00:02:05.939> save<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:07.020> we'll<00:02:07.200> actually

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
control save and now we'll actually

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
control save and now we'll actually
compile<00:02:07.890> our<00:02:07.920> level<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.420> start

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
compile our level so that we can start

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
compile our level so that we can start
playing<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.649> bring<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> launcher<00:02:11.760> go

this will take a few moments and

depending on how much stuff you have it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.449 
depending on how much stuff you have it
could<00:02:30.840> take<00:02:31.019> longer<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.129> just<00:02:32.220> a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
could take longer but if it's just a

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.819 
could take longer but if it's just a
simple<00:02:32.790> thing<00:02:32.849> it<00:02:33.150> won't<00:02:33.239> take<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.510> long

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
simple thing it won't take that long

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.229 
simple thing it won't take that long
then<00:02:34.829> we'll<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.069> over<00:02:35.159> to<00:02:35.310> compile<00:02:35.670> level<00:02:36.090> and

then we'll go over to compile level and

just take compiled level now this will

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.089 
just take compiled level now this will
take<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.940> few<00:03:03.060> moments<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:04.470> depends<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:04.950> how

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
take a few moments it depends on how

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.069 
take a few moments it depends on how
much<00:03:05.220> stuff<00:03:05.370> I'll<00:03:05.790> bring<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.359> window<00:03:06.750> will

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
much stuff I'll bring up a window will

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.199 
much stuff I'll bring up a window will
show<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.349> everything<00:03:07.940> will<00:03:08.940> bring<00:03:09.120> up

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
show you everything will bring up

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.619 
show you everything will bring up
another<00:03:09.329> window<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.260> does<00:03:10.470> different<00:03:10.950> things

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
another window it does different things

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.849 
another window it does different things
lighting<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.810> reflections<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.500> stuff<00:03:13.709> like

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
lighting and reflections and stuff like

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.649 
lighting and reflections and stuff like
that<00:03:14.010> which<00:03:14.190> we'll<00:03:14.400> get<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.549> in<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.879> future<00:03:15.030> so

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
that which we'll get to in the future so

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:16.940 
that which we'll get to in the future so
pretty<00:03:15.900> much<00:03:16.019> just<00:03:16.079> give<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.620> few<00:03:16.799> moments

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
pretty much just give it a few moments

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.500 
pretty much just give it a few moments
and<00:03:17.280> wait<00:03:17.400> for<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.669> to<00:03:17.700> do<00:03:17.880> its<00:03:17.910> thing<00:03:18.090> don't

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
and wait for it to do its thing don't

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.599 
and wait for it to do its thing don't
click<00:03:18.780> anything<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.530> sit<00:03:19.709> here<00:03:19.980> it'll<00:03:20.489> load

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
click anything just sit here it'll load

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.220 
click anything just sit here it'll load
up<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> game<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.599> then<00:03:21.690> soon<00:03:21.989> we'll

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
up the game for you and then soon we'll

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.259 
up the game for you and then soon we'll
be<00:03:22.260> able<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.620> play<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.370> then<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:23.940> get<00:03:24.090> any

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
be able to play and then if you get any

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.059 
be able to play and then if you get any
errors<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.750> could<00:03:25.019> probably<00:03:25.500> google<00:03:25.859> them

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
errors you could probably google them

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.009 
errors you could probably google them
but<00:03:26.669> most<00:03:26.849> likely<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.359> won't<00:03:27.510> as<00:03:27.750> long<00:03:27.780> as

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
but most likely you won't as long as

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.839 
but most likely you won't as long as
nothing's<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> floor<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.099> then<00:03:29.519> here<00:03:29.730> we

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
nothing's in the floor and then here we

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.970 
nothing's in the floor and then here we
go<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.629> actually<00:03:30.780> start<00:03:31.169> playing<00:03:31.349> our<00:03:31.709> map

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
go we can actually start playing our map

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.949 
go we can actually start playing our map
now<00:03:32.609> as<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.060> see<00:03:33.299> it's<00:03:33.540> really<00:03:33.810> ugly

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
now as you can see it's really ugly

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.089 
now as you can see it's really ugly
there's<00:03:34.410> no<00:03:34.590> lighting

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
there's no lighting

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.759 
there's no lighting
there's<00:03:35.489> red<00:03:35.849> everywhere<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.629> also<00:03:37.290> our

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
there's red everywhere and also our

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.430 
there's red everywhere and also our
character<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.549> see<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.000> rainbow<00:03:39.810> we'll<00:03:40.290> be

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
character if you see is rainbow we'll be

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.170 
character if you see is rainbow we'll be
fixing<00:03:40.620> all<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.069> these<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.579> future<00:03:41.940> so

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
fixing all of these in the future so

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.390 
fixing all of these in the future so
don't<00:03:42.209> worry<00:03:42.629> but<00:03:42.959> as<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.470> right<00:03:43.560> now<00:03:43.620> we<00:03:44.129> went

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
don't worry but as of right now we went

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.550 
don't worry but as of right now we went
from<00:03:44.609> what<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.419> few<00:03:45.660> tutorials<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.410> we're

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
from what a few tutorials and we're

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.920 
from what a few tutorials and we're
already<00:03:46.680> inside<00:03:47.099> of<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.370> Samba<00:03:47.970> map<00:03:48.150> which<00:03:48.750> is

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
already inside of a Samba map which is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.319 
already inside of a Samba map which is
really<00:03:49.230> awesome<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:49.980> we<00:03:50.340> can<00:03:50.489> also<00:03:50.639> shoot<00:03:51.030> we

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
really awesome so we can also shoot we

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.909 
really awesome so we can also shoot we
can<00:03:51.480> run<00:03:51.660> around<00:03:51.780> we<00:03:52.049> can<00:03:52.199> do<00:03:52.290> everything<00:03:52.620> in

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
can run around we can do everything in

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.009 
can run around we can do everything in
here<00:03:53.129> except<00:03:53.790> for<00:03:53.819> C<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.629> the<00:03:54.750> next

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
here except for C so in the next

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.780 
here except for C so in the next
tutorial<00:03:55.470> we'll<00:03:55.620> be<00:03:55.650> going<00:03:55.980> over<00:03:56.069> lighting<00:03:56.459> so

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
tutorial we'll be going over lighting so

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.819 
tutorial we'll be going over lighting so
that<00:03:56.940> we<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.299> actually<00:03:57.449> see<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:57.930> our<00:03:58.019> map<00:03:58.230> but

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
that we can actually see in our map but

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.289 
that we can actually see in our map but
then<00:03:58.949> we<00:03:59.040> can<00:03:59.190> also<00:03:59.220> glitch<00:03:59.730> out<00:03:59.970> because

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
then we can also glitch out because

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.000 
then we can also glitch out because
there's<00:04:00.510> no<00:04:00.569> clipping<00:04:01.139> on<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.410> we're

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
there's no clipping on that we're

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.879 
there's no clipping on that we're
outside<00:04:02.190> o<00:04:02.940> also<00:04:03.750> as<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.260> can<00:04:04.379> see<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.709> clock

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
outside o also as you can see the clock

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.369 
outside o also as you can see the clock
texture<00:04:05.400> like<00:04:05.849> I<00:04:05.879> said<00:04:06.180> it's<00:04:06.329> invisible<00:04:06.629> so<00:04:07.260> we

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
texture like I said it's invisible so we

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.930 
texture like I said it's invisible so we
can<00:04:07.530> actually<00:04:07.650> see<00:04:07.980> inside<00:04:08.099> of<00:04:08.430> our<00:04:08.549> map<00:04:08.730> when

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
can actually see inside of our map when

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.879 
can actually see inside of our map when
obviously<00:04:09.599> we<00:04:10.139> won't<00:04:10.290> be<00:04:10.470> able<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.709> get

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
obviously we won't be able to get

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.710 
obviously we won't be able to get
outside<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.669> that's<00:04:11.849> not<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.030> big<00:04:12.180> deal<00:04:12.359> but<00:04:12.599> if

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
outside so that's not a big deal but if

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.589 
outside so that's not a big deal but if
it<00:04:12.840> was<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:14.370> don't<00:04:14.549> want<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:14.879> but<00:04:15.329> anyhow

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
it was you don't want that but anyhow

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.599 
it was you don't want that but anyhow
guys<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.139> hopefully<00:04:16.949> you<00:04:17.160> enjoyed<00:04:17.489> this

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
guys I hopefully you enjoyed this

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.039 
guys I hopefully you enjoyed this
tutorial<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.120> then<00:04:18.329> like<00:04:18.449> I<00:04:18.479> said<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
tutorial and then like I said in the

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.050 
tutorial and then like I said in the
next<00:04:19.199> one<00:04:19.440> we'll<00:04:19.859> be<00:04:20.010> going<00:04:20.310> over<00:04:20.400> lighting<00:04:20.910> so

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
next one we'll be going over lighting so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.580 
next one we'll be going over lighting so
that<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.449> actually<00:04:21.599> see<00:04:21.959> inside<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.469> our

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
that we can actually see inside of our

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.310 
that we can actually see inside of our
map<00:04:22.740> until<00:04:23.010> then<00:04:23.580> have<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> good<00:04:24.450> day<00:04:24.630> will<00:04:25.289> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
map until then have a good day will the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.540 
map until then have a good day will the
dog<00:04:25.680> rounds

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
dog rounds

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.080 
dog rounds
sadly<00:04:27.180> nothing<00:04:27.419> will<00:04:27.780> spawn
