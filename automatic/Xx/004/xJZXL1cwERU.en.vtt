00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:18.110
 wanga you work a little less yes 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:21.410
 How do you rate the game first with new ones? 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.789
 forces as defenders helped all 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.859
 excellent such a team is certainly nice 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.420
 play 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.599
 the guys are very cool helping them have 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.310
 they helped me only not the most 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.280
 difficult throws catch a couple 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.589
 moments the atmosphere is icy he says 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.890
 play of course so in the atmosphere just 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:42.460
 smart to play and even if there where not 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.360
 very much felt like something else 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.769
 viewers are constantly cheered on 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.530
 forget about everything and play for them and 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.600
 for the team what do you say to him pre-match 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.430
 ritual something like last 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.949
 the team will take about what on the ice when already 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.869
 frame it and that's what everybody does 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.080
 the rest of the hockey team there somehow 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.030
 in a special way tapping whether it is in 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.159
 all teams immediately cheer each 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.710
 friend goalie and tune into the game 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:18.070
 all together again before the game 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.070
 rally and go likewise 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.970
 but I thought you probably all guys 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.780
 I take a new one just me she does not 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.600
 took just 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.620
 autograph and so the maxim number is the saltcellar 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.120
 no either stabbed at all but many guys 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.900
 I know this number all my life 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.470
 I play it, I have the words of God here 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.290
 happy and excitement before the match on to 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.200
 the club 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.880
 I was worried and very much when I 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.880
 Last time worried about flying 20 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.510
 the middle of the second period was not 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.290
 feeling that something may not 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.470
 it is good to make a debut match like you 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.610
 not everything worked out for the Nekrasov team 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.790
 the team almost everything worked out 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.050
 I have become better since the second period 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.050
 I just haven't played for a long time 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.910
 plus i had a trauma i got sick 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.290
 as it should be with this at all 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.770
 coping by itself was coping and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.890
 this game 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:35.870
 the whole team turned out to be a good partner 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.120
 responded well to town march in particular 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.980
 Yucca Yalonen now inflame now 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.320
 defenders relax and we are in the following 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.700
 matches already 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.250
 put you at the mercy with attack 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.030
 into several zones and i'm not sure about that i 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.900
 I think that the most important guys so that they 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.520
 felt confident in me somehow 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.620
 could feel more relaxed in 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.489
 defense ie do your own thing and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.510
 do not think that he needs to save Russia 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.989
 locker room you feel completely 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.860
 your own or maybe something not 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.019
 absolutely nothing shy of course 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.390
 everything is new to me team but in many 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.880
 guys know a very long time and at work 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.420
 polkomandy therefore especially problems with this 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.880
 will not occur 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.530
 how is your communication going on with finnish 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.450
 Coach about what we managed to enter days 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.459
 talk to goalkeepers yes how he set 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.440
 after drank here asks what requirements 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.280
 to do i speak english 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.310
 freely communicate with him 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.780
 Of course he also prompted you to demand 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.940
 me certain moments 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.690
 because he has his own vision 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.430
 innovative art and we have a common language with 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.580
 they found good 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.320
 we communicate well and in me very much 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.880
 it helps he said that the tractor is not 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.970
 deserved such a hard defeat as 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.070
 teacher i think yes guys today very 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.580
 played well there for us somewhere more 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.860
 lucky maybe just stands at we 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.380
 helped by the fact that we have certain 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.640
 moments a puck entered the ring in the ring 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.800
 it's no luck 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.959
 he was talking i was working a moment 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.500
 some kind of parting words before 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.430
 departure told me everything they said let us 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.640
 tomorrow we will follow 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.150
 thank you for the season and wish you new failures 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.190
 team such transitions from the February 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.720
 Already for lunch plov appear the same 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.120
 questions not only about you different 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.470

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.530
 long cooperation 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.330
 Knights say that they are not only nemo 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.910
 layers let him go here are some things about 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.240
 the future is early to speak or who is closer to 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.750
 the wall 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.450
