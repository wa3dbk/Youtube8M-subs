00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
get it perfect with one stroke so just

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.319 
get it perfect with one stroke so just
go<00:00:49.559> back<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.160> neaten<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.489> any<00:00:50.700> edges<00:00:53.329> then

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
go back in and neaten up any edges then

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.970 
go back in and neaten up any edges then
starting<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> outside<00:00:55.440> corner<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.860> the
