00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.640

 the others had is like us 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.289

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.310
 over there where we are although here 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.840
 you see us with unhappy jokes of life 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.130
 the truth that we have a cabreo over 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.869
 awful because this is the third time 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.190
 we try we will see if this time 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.410
 the final one we try to record the video 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.120
 in the first one the light has gone in the 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.860
 second to me I forget to hit the button 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.710
 to record and demonstrate that speaking to 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.269
 flies is that good this video is going to be 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 let's try to make it short and all 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.050
 you cojones that like him that speaks 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.899
 I am already my mouth dry we are in 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.829
 game maple to a server that is 1.7 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.839
 points and is not premium 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.659
 and this weekend has played a 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.659
 pig a whiskey pig 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.899
 the piglet and good what he is saying 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.680
 the player is an hour and a half or so in 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:16.140
 factions I've made a house get 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 some diamonds I've done a bit 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.369
 all already I had the perfect place for 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.030
 to start inviting and all that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.030
 when 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.920
 well, this is the one that is served 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.180
 fallen takes about four days fallen but 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.440
 others not the worst of all squid 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.380
 because even if they put it back in 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.330
 running this server does not have 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.550
 neder does not have low hell what 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.990
 disaster then I'll clarify the one to me 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.610
 I love playing as you know in the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.350
 hell making portals to be able 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.220
 move are hitting the poor pig 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.350
 let's go javi pigs for is my pet 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.300
 look, we can hit him or there's a pig 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.980
 as well 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.590
 good yes although the served this streets or 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.990
 if you do not know this good server the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.600
 expansion server that you can enter 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.600
 and play the games of hunger ' 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.110
 What's up 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 good the games is nothing we start in a 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.780
 circle all is worth and there are a lot of 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.510
 chests and in the chests there may be 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.670
 in armor weapons and so on 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.500
 they all stick together against each other and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.390
 the goal of the game is therefore to survive 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.440
 and be the only one not standing not 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.440
 you can win the game 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.299
 well they are called the hunger games very 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.620
 good question the game of the 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.030
 hungry because in truth it is what 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.629
 it's not the swords that interest 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.400
 armor 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.370
 the important thing is to get food because 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:52.909
 there are very little food so if you 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:58.010
 find an armor you will find a 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:59.689
 bag of pipes that I found here what 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.560
 more important is the food because it calls 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.030
 the game of hunger because everyone 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.000
 goes too much to crawl around the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.190
 I'm hungry and skeletons good 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.739
 as I roll up good to say the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.319
 chipirones yes but more than anything as I go 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.239
 to find another server for the 1.7 point 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.349
 2 no premium you told me no 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.689
 awarded because most of you 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.159
 play with the non-premium version worth 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.750
 is that many people have told me that in 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.670
 the non-premium servers there are many 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.250
 hackers many cheaters do many 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.379
 traps was this very controls very 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.689
 fine the matter the premium servers 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.879
 apparently there is not so much cheating and both 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.879
 of rbs but good good 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.439
 friend we can not hide that if we give him 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.439
 to the star 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.180
 now it is not nor does it either 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.379
 I think that for people I am a 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.940
 marginalized in life and only returned 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.670
 Well, there was already a short video 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.709
 he was descojonaba to see if this time not 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.150
 the light goes away nothing unusual happens not that 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.920
 there is a meteorite in the house has not been 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.120
 ordered burning and finally recorded 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.010
 this video what it cost me for god 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.150
 and that which is corridos come I will follow 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.379
 looking for a server because this one already 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.379
 you have seen that there are no infinities she 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.690
 me because I do not like not a saludito for 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.100
 ying what is it that I played with a good 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.630
 a little tiny at least 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.859
 I had given we were both giving 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.260
 around there or we found ourselves a 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.380
 place to live all that and we 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.180
 He also audited that I believe the skin 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.949
 Pulpit is that you can follow me me 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.790

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.920
 hang them 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.580
 I went to click anywhere that 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.580
 You can put things in the address 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.580

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.200
 to give him things from a girl 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.890
