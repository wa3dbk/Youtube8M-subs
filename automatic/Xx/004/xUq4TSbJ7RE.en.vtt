00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:11.180
 most likely 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.700
 so many people wonder what it is 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.110
 the snow cannon 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.310
 it is not the cannon excuse the pearl 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.119
 canzonetta put flowers in yours 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.270
 guns 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.830
 this is a cannon and sui generis 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:32.700
 in the sense that water enters and to ask 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 unfortunately with the stuff added 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.270
 chemistry which will then clearly remain in the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.239
 land and will ruin it but it is given part 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.420
 this is progress as they say though 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.190
 is a debatable progress aside 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.640
 ski resorts 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 without these tools they would be closed 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.740
 in the sense that it is often natural snow 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.329
 is not sufficient 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.670
 and then another very important thing 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.030
 this kind of snow chemical snow 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 let's face it also serves well to make the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.829
 base practically to lay a layer 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.790
 of certainty on the ground and then this 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:18.030
 ground comes when it's okay let's say 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.259
 invaded increased the thickness from the snow 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.530
 natural 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.460
 here is the cannon 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.460
 this cannon 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.810
 in a field like this is sufficient 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.210
 in a rather long track there are 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.030
 about fifty in some given areas 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.150
 Italy even more than 100 for each 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.160
 track 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.840
 look in what context anyway 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.620
 they are working who we are 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.620
 in the playgrounds of the Abetone school 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.240
 this is the famous snow cannon 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.100
 nebulizes as you see 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.369
 which then falls on the track it is already 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.590
 made a good coat already a good one 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.269
 prediction coverage of the fact that the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.010
 Saturday and Sunday there were two 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.379
 or three days the plants will have to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.379
 be available to the peta
