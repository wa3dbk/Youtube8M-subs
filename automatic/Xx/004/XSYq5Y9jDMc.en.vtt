00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.660 

okay<00:01:34.090> whatever<00:01:34.659> it's<00:01:34.929> not<00:01:35.140> super<00:01:35.470> clean<00:01:35.710> I'll

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
okay whatever it's not super clean I'll

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.279 
okay whatever it's not super clean I'll
do<00:01:36.789> another<00:01:36.909> one<00:01:37.240> just<00:01:38.079> so<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:39.220> can<00:01:39.399> see<00:01:40.289> her

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
fail in this one clean so that's how to

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.140 
fail in this one clean so that's how to
ollie<00:02:03.789> over<00:02:04.000> not<00:02:04.450> by<00:02:04.899> Drake<00:02:05.110> Baer
