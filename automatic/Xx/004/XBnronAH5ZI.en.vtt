and<00:00:27.960> screw<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.560> place

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.280 

next<00:00:31.330> we're<00:00:31.480> going<00:00:31.600> to<00:00:31.660> figure<00:00:31.840> out<00:00:32.080> which

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
next we're going to figure out which

next we're going to figure out which
cylinder<00:00:32.830> the<00:00:33.070> exterior<00:00:33.490> cylinder<00:00:34.090> so<00:00:34.420> we<00:00:34.450> can

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
cylinder the exterior cylinder so we can

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.140 
cylinder the exterior cylinder so we can
install<00:00:34.990> that<00:00:35.050> one<00:00:35.500> first<00:00:35.760> both<00:00:36.760> cylinders

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
install that one first both cylinders

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.240 
install that one first both cylinders
have<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.600> same<00:00:37.810> flat<00:00:38.200> tail<00:00:38.500> piece<00:00:38.740> coming<00:00:39.130> off

the rest of the installation the
interior<00:01:26.180> cylinder<00:01:26.600> is<00:01:26.689> going<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:26.930> be

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
interior cylinder is going to be

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.330 
interior cylinder is going to be
installed<00:01:27.409> with<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.619> tail<00:01:27.890> piece<00:01:28.130> going

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
installed with a tail piece going

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.490 
installed with a tail piece going
horizontally<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.810> interlock<00:01:30.229> with<00:01:30.409> the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
horizontally to interlock with the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.490 
horizontally to interlock with the
exterior<00:01:30.860> tail<00:01:31.250> piece<00:01:31.659> however<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:33.229> interior

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
exterior tail piece however the interior

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.830 
exterior tail piece however the interior
tail<00:01:33.920> piece<00:01:34.159> can<00:01:34.369> be<00:01:34.460> flipped<00:01:34.700> 180<00:01:35.240> degrees

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
tail piece can be flipped 180 degrees

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.539 
tail piece can be flipped 180 degrees
and<00:01:36.079> fit<00:01:36.679> into<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.950> deadbolt

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
and fit into the deadbolt

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.330 
and fit into the deadbolt
but<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.420> only<00:01:38.600> functions<00:01:39.170> correctly<00:01:39.350> one<00:01:40.220> of

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
but it only functions correctly one of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.569 
but it only functions correctly one of
these<00:01:40.520> two<00:01:40.789> ways<00:01:41.649> it's<00:01:42.649> difficult<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.369> tell

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
these two ways it's difficult to tell

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.850 
these two ways it's difficult to tell
which<00:01:44.299> way<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.630> tail<00:01:45.079> piece<00:01:45.319> need<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.740> be

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
which way the tail piece need to be

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.969 
which way the tail piece need to be
flipped<00:01:46.130> unless<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.149> talk<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.390> that

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
flipped unless you talk to that

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.340 
flipped unless you talk to that
so<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.820> make<00:01:50.060> sure<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.509> have<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.780> tailpiece<00:01:51.170> in

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
so to make sure we have the tailpiece in

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.600 
so to make sure we have the tailpiece in
the<00:01:51.439> right<00:01:51.649> position<00:01:52.130> we're<00:01:52.310> going<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
the right position we're going to

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.930 
the right position we're going to
install<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.210> one<00:01:53.479> without<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.140> collet<00:01:54.500> around

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
install it one without the collet around

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.430 
install it one without the collet around
install<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.120> cylinder<00:01:57.420> by<00:01:57.840> fitting<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
install the cylinder by fitting the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.770 
install the cylinder by fitting the
tailpiece<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.130> place<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.820> tightening<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
tailpiece in place and tightening the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.540 
tailpiece in place and tightening the
screws<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.680> through<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.159> deadbolt

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
screws so they go through the deadbolt
