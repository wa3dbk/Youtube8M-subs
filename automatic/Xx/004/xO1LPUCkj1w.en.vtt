00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.429
 and then personal beauty rafael here all 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.440
 people for you more in preventing bear 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.000
 end of four goals and in this game freak 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.699
 I want to talk a little bit with 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.260
 You guys on this gun I'm 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 playing now that's aaa cwr face that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.109
 gun is a little monster for you to play 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.210
 face and I squeezed to release her that 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.889
 it was because she kept it a bit boring 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.370
 to release because you have to play 

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:44.100
 of engineer and engineer at gta and max 4 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.329
 which is a new weapon and some game 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.389
 people liked me that way 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.260
 I do not particularly like sheila. 

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:54.179
 very bad weapon to play and I had to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.309
 play a lot with her to get me 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.369
 catch the engineer's stars to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.039
 to release this weapon to the face that is 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.500
 a gun that I was not serious I did not 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.509
 I regret having spent time to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 Release her but why are you going? 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.289
 have to play money you will do 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 an amount x of engineer points 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:16.469
 for you to release the first carbine 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.450
 that the first carbine at ca 5 c 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.899
 You have to release it first. 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.520
 She 's a little bit already, but she's going 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.350
 do to you and makes you less than it is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.659
 this one here but she is also a great 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.490
 gun will have to release that weapon and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.439
 thence you playing in that mine you 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.579
 Release this one, it 's very easy, you? 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.170
 can play fourth time with any 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.149
 classic example you released the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 cabins engineer does not even jump 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.679
 To the doctor after I leave I will release 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.390
 She is a doctor and I think it is much better to play. 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.859
 It's obvious because they map out who 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.049
 playing has chan dominance 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.520
 we did not have as much money as we did 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.119
 congress we will think a lot of play 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.560
 money 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.090
 I threw a little fuel is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.439
 very cool servers sucks 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.679
 Brazilian servers 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.060
 So it's complicated, but when they talk 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.380
 after you see this gun 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.030
 the first thing you will notice is 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.490
 that she looks horrible when 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.600
 you do not have a good reason i will be lonely 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.429
 Her website airs 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.560
 now the site here is horrible that 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.259
 it was then not worth using the site 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.060
 You'll have to release a cool look. 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.700
 for her and this girl I 'm wearing 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.790
 here is a little mine that is the reflection is 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.519
 flex everybody there 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.890
 s red dot normal after you place 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.319
 the red dot on it you always put flex 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.469
 You'll see that face is very very 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.879
 better to play and it is with this weapon more 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.560
 reflexes plus some things that 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.340
 I posted she hired the attackers to 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.200
 to protest 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.859
 I did not get around much 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.810
 this game tactically but no longer 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.209
 I managed to move there and it was very good. 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.239
 that the technician juca got very good very 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.889
 good to play and shoot very fast then 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.599
 Sometimes you have to control a little more 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.849
 guild who served as realize the start 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.560
 a problem in playing but anyway she 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.299
 do not have a legal experience and I can 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.669
 tell you 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.849
 the best weapon prize of this game is 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:03:00.370
 interested here and every twelve house 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.540
 For me they are the two best weapons of the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.159
 goal number 24 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.019
 I do not know if I have not won here yet 14 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.349
 because I have I said it loud 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.930
 I really do not know, but it's better. 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.769
 long gi is far better far than the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.590
 12 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.530
 so I do not know which weapon I say 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.090
 It is better for the very high ones to improve. 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.669
 gaming machine gun 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.739
 Almost an engineer, I played a little 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.019
 that zack machine gun he already has 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.760
 denisia pp 2002 my would be better than her 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.260
 although it has 89 minor 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.760
 I thought it was better, I'm not going to simply 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.799
 I do not like my money for 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.440
 engineer is a class that will be 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.290
 very useful in combat but will have to 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.970
 to use that girl a lot - me 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.409
 I'm going to draw only because 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.019
 I like souls that you have one. 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.060
 good combat to long and medium short 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.069
 distance as the software was such short 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.049
 distance and knows that rng is better 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.519
 but I still do not know I'm not a 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.829
 a person who likes to play like that 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.449
 perhaps the staff likes to play but I I 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.940
 I can not like to measure myself 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.939
 another thing I got to talking about is 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.250
 that showed there on the screen if you shoot 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.989
 in the car and take more than 80% damage 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.519
 one of you can kill him 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.159
 I do not know if it is not if someone else 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.650
 choose someone from your team to kill you 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.079
 wins as an uncle also ie the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.810
 assists county that his friend does not 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:19.239
 we have his interest but it's basically 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.680
 that you take 80 people upset if 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.870
 someone felt me ​​kill him someone you 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.050
 Can you kill, you get as I do? 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.639
 not be that fred steal 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.499
 Can you understand but even you? 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.110
 Yes, it's something that I find very cool. 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:34.999
 new thing in the game and face looks at 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.949
 that is very tense from here 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:39.319
 I could not find anything yet. 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.999
 fix those tracks that gives stay 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.740
 using 100% of my cpu 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:44.479
 if you know of any tutu 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.879
 something that gives you that it will 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.520
 pack it up please tell me 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:53.449
 because it only affects the gameplay a lot 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.529
 other type 50% performance or less than 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.909
 that I could have 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.590
 if you were playing the game with 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.629
 Lacens in his works this madness 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.110
 it would be much easier to play without 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.029
 that 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.379
 but even so also legal 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.159
 play has not much to complain 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.469
 game is good 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:09.259
 Braking confidence is I really liked it 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.300
 goal is one of the things I've seen 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.129
 It's quite a lot of people do not leave the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.569
 Rooftops face this has a side 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.360
 positive and negative 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.400
 The positive side is when the team does not 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.990
 engine does not disturb both the 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.099
 negative qualify killing you all the time 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.479
 but positive things are that the 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.129
 staff stays on top of them asks for total 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.360
 control of the flags also below 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:34.099
 so we can win a game 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.930
 very easy to win games of 250 points to 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.800
 more like us with 204 in 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.810
 few points 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.339
 the enemy zero because the guys stay in 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.529
 roof over the entire game and not 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.520
 have managed to capture a flag to 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.620
 help the team 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.689
 so it's something the staff has to 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.569
 caring to use this guy was once in the past 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.669
 using this part of this roof can be 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.839
 an advantage but has to take care of 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.009
 using this here can not have the 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.689
 play on god you the whole game 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.729
 you lose all flags because the 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:00.080
 Moms stay down there you can not 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.330
 take care of the flag a bit 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.279
 of the way b but even so you lose 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
 air and if you lose your head and not 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.229
 It is also you also will not do 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.180
 no difference 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.680
 the team then it's that thing you have to use 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.969
 in moderation that little roof over there 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.000
 because I know it's a good place to 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.620
 stay but it's that right time thing 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.189
 another will lose the game for bullshit 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.979
 same 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.779
 and looks connected if using our 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.430
 very very good 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.080
 The other thing I have to say to 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.839
 you are the following guarantee a simple 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.430
 to get'll show you not 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.080
 they are very long companies, not because 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.639
 guy I was playing I spoke of 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.199
 servers and conquer chaos that 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.389
 play takes one step forward and two behind 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.099
 of both is that it is not Brazil 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.409
 holding the Brazilian internet is not 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.430
 you know the same beta version are 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.350
 testing the servers 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.420
 will have a lot to improve the motto 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.670
 breaking was 3 has also a mess 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.030
 in the beta just before the 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.740
 start of the game but this is the game after 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.330
 the final version of it that the game will stay 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.340
 much better to play and probably 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.640
 It will not be all over 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.900
 travadinhas to know the game are 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.130
 happening 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.450
 basically what I had to say to 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.340
 You were, if you'd like to know. 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.780
 like that force I put a video and 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.550
 I'll show you a little early today. 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.830
 more of the system running the game as 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.080
 use the new advantages you have 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.810
 there and if you like, know the one who 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.160
 achieve the favorites and there's not one 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.560
