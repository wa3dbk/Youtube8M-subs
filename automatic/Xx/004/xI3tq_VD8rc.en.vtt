second half but I think if we start with
the<00:05:09.539> goal<00:05:09.720> for<00:05:10.169> me<00:05:10.320> George<00:05:10.530> Paris<00:05:11.039> lost<00:05:11.280> it

all-round<00:05:57.030> I<00:05:57.450> think<00:05:57.660> in<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.530> second<00:05:58.770> half

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
all-round I think in the second half

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.950 
all-round I think in the second half
when<00:05:59.010> he<00:05:59.040> slowed<00:05:59.370> down<00:05:59.400> a<00:05:59.640> tempo<00:06:00.150> sod<00:06:00.420> they<00:06:00.810> got

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
when he slowed down a tempo sod they got

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.390 
when he slowed down a tempo sod they got
a<00:06:00.990> passing<00:06:01.440> game<00:06:01.590> going<00:06:02.040> together
