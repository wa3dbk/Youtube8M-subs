00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.970
 step by step instructions 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.670
 The guard light comes in solid and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.949
 convenient for transportation box in the kit 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.559
 enters the control panel guard itself and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.340
 single sensor power supply unit 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.910
 necessary fasteners 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.830
 sensors are wireless and operate from 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 battery alarm 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.570
 sent by secure radio channel 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.620
 all equipment from the kit is configured 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.620
 and ready to use 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.820
 you can always buy extra 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.360
 sensors and set them up to work with 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.360
 your alarm 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.520
 The principle of the alarm is very simple 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.860
 if the sensor is triggered 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.350
 then the alarm turns on the siren for 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.330
 alert alerts and sends you and 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.080
 sms messages with information about 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.080
 accidents 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.450
 consider in more detail how it all 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.480
 works 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.140
 for works 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.430
 alarm need a sim card 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.950
 any mobile operator will do 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.790
 with a stable network signal in that place 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.330
 where the alarm will work for you 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.920
 By installing a sim card, we connect to the network with 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.820
 using the instructions in the kit 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.490
 alarms 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.830
 configure the work of the central unit with 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.820
 using the phone we bring in your memory 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.890
 phone number 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.490
 the signal will come to him 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:03.149
 alarms and all other alerts 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.590
 connect the wired siren from the kit 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.920
 we install sensors on bilateral 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.649
 Scotch 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.390
 or on the screws all the necessary fasteners 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.250
 there is in the kit 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.519
 installation will take a few minutes 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.319
 glue the door opening sensor 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.730
 screw the motion sensor and you put 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.000
 tilt angle 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.239
 that's all it took us less than 10 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.299
 minutes now your property is under secure 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.910
 security we set the alarm to protect 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.000
 if something happens you first about 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.010
 Find out by getting a text message in 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.950
 which sensor will be indicated 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.620
 worked and where it is installed a 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.310
 The siren will not only scare away 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.040
 robber 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.890
 but also notify your neighbors loud 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.700
 sound now consider the difference 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.950
 guardian light from guardian guardians of light 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.079
 deprived of some not the most popular 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.930
 functions that are not usually 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.180
 use most users in 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.239
 in particular it is impossible to connect the light 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.769
 alarm status indicator 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.959
 additional actuators 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.389
 extra battery for 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.530
 connect wired sensors 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.709
 it is necessary to disassemble the alarm unit 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.630
 which is not very convenient if you plan 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.780
 use wired sensors 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.600
 while in contrast to the model of the guard 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.100
 light works great at temperatures 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.709
 below minus 40 degrees 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.260
 the alarm unit itself is small and 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.170
 therefore it can be placed in any 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.540
 place and now about what equipment 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.010
