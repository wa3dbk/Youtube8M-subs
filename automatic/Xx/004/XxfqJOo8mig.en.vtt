 I look at myself and I do not understand 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.709

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.719

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.739
 good even if you're sure you prefer to stay and talk about jones 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.519
 I would understand if I'm late 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.260
 It's almost six fifteen and you know New York on a Saturday night 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.680

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.879
 a friend 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.879
 he called me when I did not expect 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.700
 I have friends like that 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.369
 they always arrive drunk 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.899
 completely just like that 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.029
 today what he said about taxis 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:28.359
 why they do not call the company and my provincial brother is better than walking 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.399
 these neighborhoods 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.399

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.149
 they do not attack me enough for this 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.689
 but for enough judicial with monsters from outer space 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:54.469
 did not give us time to make up, despite its too clear time for 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.669
 local television josé manzur reports military intelligence 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.040

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.979
 obviously adjust your storeroom speak purchase 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.979

 such are 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.830
 a relative concept does not have an intrinsic value 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.610
 hoop warranty 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.599

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.860

 the newspapers called him the friend of Dr. Manhattan died of cancer in 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.680
 1971 I think it was something sudden and quite painful 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:41.909
 I remember walid as a good friend I went to his funeral 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.939
 take away the charge for a while I saw also known as monkey 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.400

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.400

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:13.789
 so how is it I knew that Miss Yen 20 linked 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.169
 romantically you in the sixties also suffer from cancer of the 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.580
 lung doctors gave him six months to live 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.580
 note any connection 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.400
 they did not tell me 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.120
 to be insinuating I'm fine is already no more questions the show is over 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.080
 we also have two other partners from the past who suffer from diseases 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.089
 Similar 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:41.089
 let's go to what we are going people are addressing 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.370

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:02.740

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.610
 the whole Mayan world 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.389
 and leave me alone gentlemen I think it's best not to think in this way 

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:18.360
 Little or nothing 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.360

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:25.539

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.050
 when they lose adrenaline 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.050
 I always end up feeling mistaken 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:36.909
 because no visits to police recover your breath 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:41.219
 I already had enough superhero husbands for a day 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:44.050
 looking for a hotel and I will reflect on my relationship 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.050
 to see if I find a good reason to accept 

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:51.889
 his identity 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:55.159
 the world is very hard 

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:57.800

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.419
 goodbye
