00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.939
 Hi all 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.470
 I bring you an analysis of the reality of football in Paraguay 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.770
 as in any country in Paraguay there is a classic that is disputed between the two 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.770
 supposedly larger clubs in this country 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.220
 On one side is the glorious dean 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.590
 King of cups only winner of international trophies in that country 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.809
 for the other sector, the hurricane of the worker neighborhood Cerro Porteño 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.289
 in the other countries the classics are represented by clubs with great 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.670
 similarity in terms of achievements obtained throughout its history 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.430
 This is not the case in Paraguay since only one of these clubs 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.170
 olimpia has great achievements in the international field while hill 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.790
 Porteño only has the titles obtained locally 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.630
 the countless titles obtained by Olympia both in the field 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.120
 international as a local make the classic in Paraguay not seen as 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.990
 a true classic 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.660
 according to the information collected for the dean's fans and players is what 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.430
 same play a game against Cerro Porteño that against freedom or Guaraní 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.480
 another curious independent 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.280
 since they can not feel the motivation to play against a big 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 because in Paraguay there is only one big and recognized Olympic club and this is 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.860
 You can check in each match that you dispute when you see the grandstands full of 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.670
 fans encouraging non-stop throughout the duration of the game as only happens 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.350
 with the great clubs of the world 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.340
 while the other teams in Paraguay carry a minimal and shameful 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.920
 number of people to their respective parties and only wait for matches 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.350
 who play at home against olympia to fill their pockets with 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.770
 collection obtained from the large number of fans fringed 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.360
 and in the end we ask ourselves a question 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.480
 would have some chance should introduce the olympics in the championship 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.450
 of the afa 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.210
 in view of the decline of the river play club the mouth juniors club would be a 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.040
 worthy rival to the glorious dean 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.380
 Finally, the fans who were fringed could feel the excitement of 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.729
 true classic against a true rival 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.719
 would that be feasible 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.929
 This is the reality in Paraguayan football 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.139
 for the joy of some and sadness of others there is only one big club and 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.029
 glorious olympics in paraguarí 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.999
 thanks for your attention 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.969
 and hold the fringe forever
