00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.309
 now wash my typewriter home 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.820
 let's say this and tell you something 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.820
 interesting 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.590
 yes rav4 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.330
 14 years in general, bought this car mom 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.090
 Half a year ago 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.630
 in return x 3 family truth we have five years 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.220
 honestly and by the way his wife's old car to him 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.110
 need something newer fresh brother 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.240
 persuaded her to persuade her to change something 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.760
 only was we pushed himself love 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.130
 jump honestly but still mom is 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.300
 mom was somehow not only not enough 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.250
 took the train once took all satisfied 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.040
 picking just to max all that is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.590
 give the gift of ordinary let's say so here is 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.750
 all if you take the previous body for 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.270
 taillights with any cars were there 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.700
 such not very nice say here 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.939
 finalized 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.969
 Rearview camera Parktronic means 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:49.070
 here is nice from this button but you 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:53.439
 trunk closers let's say as here 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.810
 60 liters for me goes let's say 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.990
 very quickly that is something for gasoline 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.829
 writes 11 4 there in the city but I don't know 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:13.550
 where pc 1 to 11 4 new seems to me like 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:16.470
 as if i can close here like 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:21.239
 honestly annoying cars 14 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.620
 years are worth giving the usual damn not 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.620
 looks very and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 twenty first century they will be under 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.790
 3 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.790
 repeat mirrors add up by the way 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.670
 find out the threshold here put a cheap 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.710
 pleasure but the look of it all 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.820
 toned when ugildy respectively 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.030
 It was planned out I do not know 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.920
 for me, not at all kind of toned 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.480
 differently if the capillary master immediately 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.480
 tint for big problems 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.450
 This engine is two and a half liters 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.460
 means pradik who collect in China 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.790
 for japan 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.360
 I can't say exactly the same engine 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.360
 shoved Toyota Camry 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.580
 13 14 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.890
 ip in principle he should not go 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.080
 let's say I say this when it starts very 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.260
 fast cutting fast well not allowed 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.630
 take on driving around town and light i love 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.160
 fast ride 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.760
 cool to jump cool everything is super 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.160
 but I donâ€™t have enough relics i 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.930
 I think for a quiet ride through the city 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.630
 180 general maxims that normally catch 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.510
 it will be inconvenient to go but not that 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.100
 uncomfortable you will not feel 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.690
 comfortable you will drive there five hundred 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.209
 seven hundred kilometers this is my opinion not 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.990
 I know this I think you will become 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:04.440
 comments of cars and cars for you in the city 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.440
 went 1 km now running 20,200 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.190
 backwards 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.470
 world of oil 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.610
 pads front rear air filter 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.889
 oil 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.379
 26 thousand rubles 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:27.719
 this is a very doha rear view camera 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:31.229
 cool really cons 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:33.150
 big minus these buttons yes here goes 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:38.490
 this mode let's say fuel economy 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.169
 sport heating aux there these here in general 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.159
 function let's say you are coming from when they 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.870
 don't see busy over this let's say 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.810
 fuck here is a cool say and little thing 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.360
 look at the experience all in Russian 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.979
 average consumption 13 3 in the city he writes 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.169
 power reserve on there the average speed is 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.210
 travel time there is a plus in it 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.949
 By the way there is everything in Russian is not necessary 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.740
 there translate that english 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.169
 Well done they finally get up there 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.950
 phase here are the buttons available 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.139
 start stop 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:17.450
 finally thought of it too pay 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:19.220
 attention to the medicine spirit does not give just 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.419
 bulbs for set send to the rich 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.230
 same two car worth 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:27.919
 chose over a million eight hundred and fifty 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.660
 discounted new pale that this million 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:35.030
 eight hundred write plastic here are trees 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:38.210
 Immediately say it's just a handbrake 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.810
 do not use at all already under blown away 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.240
 turn it on the car starts driving 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.190
 rushny weak sweet 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.160
 do not use already need to tighten it 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.930
 minus 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.470
 there is no soft stuff 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.400
 installment Milan 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.400
 looks cool 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.620
 carbon fiber 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.660
 Carbon goes factory already 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.160
 I think the carbon has played its time 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.840
 could that more interesting 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.050
 tree maybe he will i think it was possible 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.470
 would not hurt more precisely if you 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.910
 get up there would set would have been set 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.670
 how is it properly said back 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.100
 passenger bag 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.090
 control of the heated seats i think 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.700
 it wouldn't hurt here 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.969
 and just nothing behind is empty 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.949
 it pushes 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:33.429
 and by the way, I'll tell you another topic and 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.860
 next isolation is not at all here we are 

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:39.099
 we are going to hear how 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.919
 cars drive through the buzz of wheels though 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.509
 really worth good drawings no 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.839
 if klimashin immediately with our 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.969
 isolation to drive her to manage the role 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:51.069
 no need out of the way to a little bit she's straight already 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.550
 sympathizes that nowhere do you want us 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:54.009
 jump let's say 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.279
 overclocking 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.440
 100 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:03.880
 9.4 seconds in principle for crossovers 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.300
 Means with scales tone 800 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:11.280
 normal enough 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:15.750
 I am not an adviser where I will tell you a car 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.870
 yes my family tune the answer to 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.030
 have formed 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.150
 thank you all 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.150
 until
