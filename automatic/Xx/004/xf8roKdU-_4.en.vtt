00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 and good for all that more actively 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.810
 as always I hope they are super mega 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.019
 tricks welcome once again to the channel 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.240
 and I come to you with a video that is a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.670
 bit different is not a gameplay but 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 will be seeing images of halo 2 by 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.230
 what then because this video wanted to talk 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.660
 very quickly about what is expected 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.340
 of halo 2 or if it's a game that's coming 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.480
 comes to the franchise and so on etcetera 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.550
 etc 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.980
 ok well let's start there are very rumors 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.890
 strong that microsoft wants to take out the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.230
 halo 2 anniversary is to say the same 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.530
 halo 2 but they remake it what 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.420
 renew they put better hd graphics 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 etcetera, and they do not sell it. 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.399
 market there are very strong rumors of that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.950
 because because I do not understand 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.620
 from what I've heard it's not going to come out 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.770
 hey what the five this year the most 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.020
 sure it's coming out in the next year 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.300
 so they want to take out a game that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.149
 can fill the gap here in the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.460
 2014 a game that can sell that can 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.130
 generate revenue for microsoft you can 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.380
 say until the kilo came out 5 ok 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.469
 well said that wants to get out thread 2 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.390
 anniversary but what happens if they take turns 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.909
 anniversary on the one hand I would be father 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.220
 because you say no because then father 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.490
 multiplayer etcetera but not us 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.229
 let's cheat let's be honest the campaign I 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.119
 at least it makes me almost of memory 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.850
 that I'm not going to play the campaign to 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.649
 through the played many times and 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.210
 almost every fan that yes they have 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.869
 played the same as the gil 2 campaign 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.630
 then there is one point less and the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.250
 second is the multiplayer it 's true that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.520
 the multiplayer of halo 2 was one of the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.479
 best of all the turns was very good 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.209
 Turn 2 was very competitive but 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.000
 people right now I do not think I want 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.250
 buy that kind of games practically 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.649
 it's an arcade game because it's a game 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.810
 that in fact I should give it for free with 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.939
 xbox live gold the anniversary halo 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.799
 free not for the goal because because 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.750
 the game is already done the only thing 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.209
 they want to do is change the textures and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.289
 sell you as if it were something new or 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.480
 that people are not so stupid 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.969
 On the one hand, it's good to get it 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.129
 of collection etcetera but on the other 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:19.319
 but we will not deceive people 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.599
 gilo professionals are not going to 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.189
 return to thread 2 ok 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.049
 because it's not a good investment for 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.090
 example to read more and it's not a good 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.489
 investment grabbing already refried games 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.140
 of years ago that already exploded because 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.299
 because it is not a game that can be 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.069
 get a lot of benefit from the e-mail and 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.470
 like to grab a halo 5 grabs 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.469
 competitive put their tournaments but not a 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.599
 game that will last a month playing 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.889
 people and then they will leave it because 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.459
 it is at its peak 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:51.049
 gta 5 comes the titan fail come games 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.950
 new come fresh complete sets 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.930
 in this year many things come then 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.370
 people are not going to go people turn not 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.739
 is going to play if the two 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.620
 anniversary until it comes out of halo 5 o 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.329
 that they will continue to play their games 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.959
 gta etc to all the games there 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.819
 right now and the truth is more something very 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.169
 absurdity of microsoft or who is it 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.629
 happens to say let's take turns 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.130
 okey anniversary will happen the same thing 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.320
 it happened with halo 3 what 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.910
 people are free they play it in a few 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.040
 days but then they are forgotten because 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.690
 because there are other games your friends do not 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.000
 they will go to play anniversary kilos are 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.500
 playing gta 5 you play with them 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.530
 or call of duty cost you can act with 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.450
 them or bar the fill 4 then 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.360
 honestly on the one hand they were at 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.820
 news but on the other the safest thing is 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.130
 that halo 2 would be a failure the truth 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.800
 would be a game that would buy some 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.170
 people would ensure 23 days about two 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.650
 videos was already not something that you 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.160
 can take advantage of clichÃ©d tricks of 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.260
 tutorials nothing or is nothing 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.030
 I would not have anything is more like collector's 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.310
 but well that's my opinion I do not know 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.250
 What do you think I think it would be 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.350
 entertaining I say to hang out 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.840
 but it will not be a game to exploit it 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.160
 to grab it and start playing all the 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.040
 day of truth because it is a game that already 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.190
 we play then that's what I think 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.780
 sincerely and I hope you understand my 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.820
 point of view I would like to hear your 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.920
 point of view of you and do not forget 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.570
 let me like to share it and a 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.860
 comment so I know what they thought 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.860
 See you in the next video
