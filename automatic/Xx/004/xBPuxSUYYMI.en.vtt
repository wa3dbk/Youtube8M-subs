00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
have a little bit of transparency here

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.240 
have a little bit of transparency here
with<00:04:20.910> my<00:04:21.090> dog<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:22.440> corners<00:04:23.010> are<00:04:23.190> rounded

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
with my dog and the corners are rounded

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.790 
with my dog and the corners are rounded
on<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.180> top<00:04:24.420> edge<00:04:24.660> up<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:25.170> that's<00:04:25.350> coming

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
on the top edge up there that's coming

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.490 
on the top edge up there that's coming
from<00:04:25.830> round<00:04:26.310> doc<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.450> think<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.930> adds<00:04:28.200> a

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
from round doc and I think that adds a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.240 
from round doc and I think that adds a
very<00:04:28.890> nice<00:04:29.280> little<00:04:29.870> edge<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.680> doc<00:04:31.919> it

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
very nice little edge to the doc it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.150 
very nice little edge to the doc it
makes<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.640> look<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:33.120> lot<00:04:33.540> better<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.350> there

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
makes it look a lot better and there

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.920 
makes it look a lot better and there
aren't<00:04:35.430> any<00:04:35.730> settings<00:04:36.330> or<00:04:36.510> anything<00:04:36.900> like
