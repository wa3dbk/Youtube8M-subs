this is the cheese flavor now when I

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.390 
this is the cheese flavor now when I
just<00:00:23.720> bought<00:00:24.020> these<00:00:24.230> I<00:00:24.560> did<00:00:24.859> think<00:00:25.279> that

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
just bought these I did think that

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.150 
just bought these I did think that
cheese<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.000> onion<00:00:26.359> I<00:00:26.770> didn't<00:00:27.770> really<00:00:27.949> look<00:00:28.010> at

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160

cheese and onion I didn't really look at
packaging<00:00:28.340> properly<00:00:29.000> because<00:00:29.390> I<00:00:29.420> just

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
packaging properly because I just

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.660 
packaging properly because I just
assumed<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.289> color<00:00:30.590> because<00:00:31.160> they<00:00:31.279> like<00:00:31.460> the

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
assumed the color because they like the

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.090 
assumed the color because they like the
cheese<00:00:31.850> and<00:00:31.970> onion<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:33.140> wouldn't<00:00:33.680> blame<00:00:33.860> me
