00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.900
 you have to ask me something cisco no yes come 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.330
 did you get your suit on 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.849
 giving flash inside that micro ring 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.619
 understanding technology or maybe 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.619
 leave me alone I do n't care 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.570
 just a little I had to calculate the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 temporal deformation romy is right 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.019
 well if we still have something but it is 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 underestimated your contribution or that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.530
 of romney 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.370
 you know how many times I wanted you to mine 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 side while rebuilding the accelerator 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.950
 we would have enjoyed ourselves on this 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 it doesn't change the fact that your ingenious 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.899
 timeline so you call it which one 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.879
 let his name explode 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.590
 no if you do the plates with resins in the evening 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.170
 cobalt will prevent its degradation 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.480
 extreme heat 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.789
 the agreement is fine we try everything here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.010
 nothing but what you want me to 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.359
 the more I know I thought that of all I was 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.430
 what would most have understood mine 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.689
 I do not belong to this situation 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.740
 It was this barbaric age is like 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.439
 live among the dead 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:22.490
 this is repeated to yourself when i am 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.490
 you killed what you said 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.150
 an alternative time sequence that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.320
 barry has reset but I remember the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.530
 scene keeps coming back to mind and I have 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.270
 still in front of you the image of you 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 watch that you compare me to a son and then 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.030
 you tear my heart to pieces with your hand 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 cisco 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.750
 i'm so sorry you know running not of 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.340
 having killed you I had good reasons 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.689
 I'm sorry that you keep 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.930
 trace of another time sequence 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.680
 where of through the vibrations 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.600
 of the universe means I was not sure 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.600
 now I have confirmation of what 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.050
 the evening when the accelerator is excluded 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.790
 you got hit too 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.239
 but you say we are not joking 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.740
 no 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:40.230
 it is not true not to be afraid cisco a 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.200
 great and honorable glorious destiny 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.760
 wait now i just hope that 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.650
 while this beauty of yours lives 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.239
 adventure 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.980
 you will remember who gave you that 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.319
 life 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.319
 and was given to you with love
