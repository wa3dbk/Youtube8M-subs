eight load cells at different locations
the<00:04:49.740> first<00:04:50.699> step<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.630> install<00:04:51.900> each<00:04:52.320> load

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
the first step is to install each load

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.230 
the first step is to install each load
cell<00:04:52.919> stand<00:04:53.280> into<00:04:53.580> its<00:04:53.910> respective<00:04:54.419> position

they insert a link on each side of the

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.090 
they insert a link on each side of the
stand<00:05:02.660> they<00:05:03.660> position<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.229> load<00:05:04.440> cell<00:05:04.740> at<00:05:04.949> the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
stand they position the load cell at the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.150 
stand they position the load cell at the
top<00:05:05.310> of<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.580> links<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:10.320> bulkhead<00:05:10.740> pin<00:05:10.979> at

top of the links and the bulkhead pin at
the<00:05:11.340> bottom<00:05:19.370> then<00:05:20.370> they<00:05:20.520> close<00:05:20.760> up<00:05:20.970> the

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
the bottom then they close up the

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.490 
the bottom then they close up the
location<00:05:21.600> with<00:05:21.870> an<00:05:21.990> access<00:05:22.350> plate<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:28.260> last

location with an access plate the last

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.490 
location with an access plate the last
step<00:05:28.860> is<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.310> calibrate<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.820> scale<00:05:30.320> they<00:05:31.320> lay

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
step is to calibrate the scale they lay

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.040 
step is to calibrate the scale they lay
a<00:05:31.710> 10,000<00:05:32.460> pound<00:05:32.699> weight<00:05:32.789> that's<00:05:33.539> more<00:05:33.900> than

4,500 kilos on different parts of the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.020 
4,500 kilos on different parts of the
scale<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.350> check<00:05:37.800> if<00:05:37.949> the<00:05:38.070> digital<00:05:38.460> readout<00:05:38.639> is

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
scale to check if the digital readout is

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.410 
scale to check if the digital readout is
accurate

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.630 

it<00:05:42.990> takes<00:05:43.230> a<00:05:43.380> lot<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:43.560> time<00:05:43.920> to<00:05:44.160> get<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.340> truck

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
it takes a lot of time to get a truck

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.910 
it takes a lot of time to get a truck
scale<00:05:44.970> just<00:05:45.270> right<00:05:45.660> but<00:05:46.530> it's<00:05:46.680> definitely

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
scale just right but it's definitely

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.480 
scale just right but it's definitely
worth<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.850> wait
