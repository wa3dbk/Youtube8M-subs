00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the car is in motion when you originally

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.070 
the car is in motion when you originally
set<00:00:20.039> up<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> stereo<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.420> connection<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.990> the

set up the stereo the connection to the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.189 
set up the stereo the connection to the
parking<00:00:22.410> brake<00:00:22.590> wouldn't<00:00:22.949> work<00:00:23.189> at<00:00:23.460> all

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
parking brake wouldn't work at all

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.160 
parking brake wouldn't work at all
probably<00:00:25.199> some<00:00:25.410> old<00:00:25.439> wiring<00:00:25.859> difficulties<00:00:27.170> so

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
probably some old wiring difficulties so

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.689 
probably some old wiring difficulties so
we<00:00:28.320> didn't<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:28.949> at<00:00:29.099> all<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> can

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
we didn't have it on at all so I can

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.099 
we didn't have it on at all so I can
watch<00:00:29.849> videos<00:00:30.210> at<00:00:30.330> all<00:00:30.420> even<00:00:30.630> when<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.810> was

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109

parked<00:00:32.180> today<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.570> got<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.989> installed

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
parked today I just got this installed

one<00:00:35.010> my<00:00:35.190> local<00:00:35.610> audio<00:00:37.640> specialists<00:00:39.020> it's<00:00:40.020> just

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
one my local audio specialists it's just

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
one my local audio specialists it's just
a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.350> switch<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.739> fools<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.760> stereo

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
a little switch that fools the stereo

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.850 
a little switch that fools the stereo
it's<00:00:42.660> thinking<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> parking<00:00:43.559> brake<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it's thinking that the parking brake is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
it's thinking that the parking brake is
on<00:00:44.010> even<00:00:44.250> though<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.489> isn't<00:00:45.170> I'll<00:00:46.170> show<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
on even though it isn't I'll show you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:59.349 
on even though it isn't I'll show you
how<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> works

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.369 

might<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.420> well<00:01:00.480> turn<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> car<00:01:00.960> low<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.260> can

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
might as well turn the car low you can

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.619 
might as well turn the car low you can
see<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> actually<00:01:01.829> does<00:01:02.039> work<00:01:02.629> parking

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
see that it actually does work parking

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.450 
see that it actually does work parking
brake<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:05.420> now<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:07.460> just
