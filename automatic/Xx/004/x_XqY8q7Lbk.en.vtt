00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:02.180
 Hello 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.130
 in the first movie we looked at what we needed 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.220
 eat so that the body gets everything 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.960
 necessary components for their 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.579
 vital activity 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.679
 in the second, we covered in more detail 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.519
 as a digestive system 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.679
 adapt heat treated 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.619
 food keeping your microflora 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.210
 today we look at how food affects 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.669
 hormonal background man 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.389
 let's first figure out what 

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:26.589
 is hormonal background 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.519
 hormones 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.999
 this is carriers of the management team from 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.640
 one body to another 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 English scientists Starling Obelix 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860
 opened in 1906 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.950
 and called hormones from the Greek choir could 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.610
 what does excite stimulate 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.030
 hormone producing organs team 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090
 called endocrine 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.150
 let's look at the show 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.650
 endocrine organs are 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.339
 hypothalamus thyroid 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.730
 pancreas pituitary gland 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.730
 adrenal glands 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.220
 lemons produce endocrine 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.090
 organs 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.530
 excreted into the bloodstream and enters all 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.110
 parts of the body 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.810
 but every day only act in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.490
 one place and in a certain 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.600
 organization 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
 referred to as target organ 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 human body 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700
 here the price is truly huge on the list 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.440
 various hormones 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.180
 trains elgave such r testosterone 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.240
 estradiol korea sides prolactin 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 other 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.970
 these biologically active substances 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.860
 involved in all processes 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.240
 vital activity 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.970
 they regulate all processes in the body 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.640
 saliva production from cell 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.850
 hormonal balance is the balance of hormones 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.160
 an organism 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.100
 concentration of certain species 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.300
 hormones depend on our general well-being 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 physical condition of the body 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.780
 crying hysterical 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.220
 excessive impulsiveness 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.590
 obsessive fears for any reason 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.190
 clear signs of imbalance 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.520
 hormones 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.940
 change whether violations 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.370
 hormonal background of the body is expressed 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.880
 in reducing the content of the hormone in the blood 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.409
 and can provoke 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.700
 the occurrence of serious diseases 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.210
 53 sixties twentieth century science 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.770
 it was determined that not only 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.309
 pancreas 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.639
 but there are women too, are indigenous 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:12.689
 way 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.709
 one of the achievements already familiar to us 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.819
 academician ember was what he set 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.739
 that gastrointestinal tract 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.540
 is the biggest and strongest 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.529
 hurricane 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.789
 if it was previously thought that it was gastro 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.279
 the intestinal tract will only produce 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.839
 hormones to control themselves 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:28.489
 by myself 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.819
 for example mister 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.250
 that appearance showed 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.110
 that it works almost all 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.129
 hormone spectrum 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.090
 regulatory activity 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.999
 the body including steroid 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.349
 endocrine cell gastrointestinal 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.089
 tract 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.439
 produce hormones typical of 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.459
 hypothalamus pituitary 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.539
 and pituitary cells gastritis 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:48.959
 so for some 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.389
 hormonal effect 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.150
 hypothalamic pituitary 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.299
 and gastrointestinal systems turned out 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.399
 ropes 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.469
 even such hormone kondrakhin 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.719
 enkephalins 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.249
 whose synthesis is attributed 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.469
 only Moscow 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.409
 are produced in the intestines 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.340
 in particular 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.080
 these morphine and hormones are produced in 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.200
 baby when splitting protein 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.809
 mother's milk 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:12.619
 and in adults with splitting only 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:13.579
 wheat 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.040
 Recall that these hormones cause 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.819
 pain relief feelings causeless 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.609
 the joys of happiness and lanterns 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.849
 also the intestine produces 95 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.639
 percent of all serotonin 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.939
 depressed leads to depression 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.369
 reconciliation 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.099
 neuroscientists psychologists from Britain 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.839
 USA 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.579
 it turned out that serotonin 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.139
 involved in nerve transmission 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.869
 brain pulses 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.929
 can affect emotions in particular 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.169
 behavioral response to 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.369
 injustice 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.619
 their results showed that 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:43.639
 serotonin plays critically important 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.089
 role in decision making 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.469
 holding back from a strong reaction 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.829
 cambridge specialists 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.029
 found that the power change 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.309
 stresses 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:53.369
 a number of our serotonin levels 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.719
 fluctuate what may affect the processes 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.779
 making everyday decisions 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.539
 participatory research 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.879
 psychologists from california 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.129
 university also show 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.029
 why many of us can become 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.509
 aggressive 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.899
 some important acids needed 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:10.419
 for serotonin production 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.510
 enters the body only with food 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.830
 therefore accept the declaration 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.889
 nutritional serotonin level 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.949
 naturally shrinking that 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.469
 reduces what they can hold back 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.509
 anger and aggression 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.289
 now the most important thing 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.330
 regulation of the formation of hormones 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.110
 gastrointestinal tract 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.349
 different from that of other endocrine 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:30.620
 systems of themes 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.830
 that hormone secretions depend not so much 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.620
 from the state of the body 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.150
 how much from direct interaction 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.080
 food components with intestinal walls 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.879
 some hormone enters 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.430
 directly with food 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.960
 I want to draw attention to the importance 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.949
 this output 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.340
 hormonal background 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.010
 which affects our state 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.160
 the body is our mood 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.800
 performance 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.189
 directly depends on the food we are going 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:55.360
 I will give one 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.680
 but a very vivid example of the influence of food 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.680
 on reproductive function 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.740
 hormonal imbalance 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.169
 The most common cause of infertility in women is up to 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.009
 forty percent of all cases 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.990
 I'm angry with the rest of the men asus perm 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.430
 low concentration forest sisters recalled 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.699
 of the first 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:14.719
 sperm concentration 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.639
 experiment participant 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.819
 has grown to four million 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.429
 up to 90 six million one milliliter 

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:24.139
 more than 20 times 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.909
 four months of adequate nutrition 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.319
 after which he became a happy father 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.279
 I repeat that the topic is processed food 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.839
 perceived by the body as a taxi 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.389
 and the whole resource rushing on 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.389
 neutralizing the thrill output from 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:38.300
 of the body 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.919
 as soon as food begins to flow 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.009
 live products capable of self 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.279
 review containing fiber 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.159
 gastrointestinal tract feeds 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.139
 corresponding signal organism 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.039
 then the whole resource of the body which 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.990
 spent on protective functions 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.620
 now spend money on what it is for 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.539
 intended for reproductive 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.500
 function on cleaning the body on its 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.240
 treatment for the replacement of aging tissues on 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.880
 restore original purity to 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.740
 vessels 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.710
 to restore health 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.789
 and in conclusion I want to say that the nervous 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.189
 intestinal system 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:10.489
 which according to the canons traditionally anatomy 

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:12.649
 physiology is just clusters 

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:14.759
 peaceful nodes and nerve endings 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.889
 much more complicated 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.639
 and actually represents 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.800
 autonomous brain 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.560
 Colombian professor 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.779
 Michael Gershun University 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.509
 but such a concept intestinal brain 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.119
 the intestinal brain controls all 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.610
 digestive processes 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.470
 even with the loss of the contract 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.940
 with the brain and spinal cord intestines 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.150
 continues to function 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.889
 This is such a complex autonomous system. 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.180
 which has evolved 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.509
 million years 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:41.659
 if before 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:44.430
 how to put something in your mouth you think 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.590
 did it have at its disposal the ancient 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.979
 man who did not know the book utensils 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:51.979
 kolyada will become your medication 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.889
 summarize tom 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.960
 and what we said 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.229
 if you consider the intestines as black 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:06:59.119
 box 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.089
 a ton of inlet will be 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:02.309
 and at the exit 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.009
 hormonal background of the body I'm still ours 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:06.009
 psyche 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.229
 building material for growth and 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.139
 tissue regeneration 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:13.490
 energy for life support 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.280
 thus our state 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.139
 of the body 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.010
 directly dependent on food 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.860
 which we consume 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.029
 I want to draw your attention to something 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:24.129
 that all i'm telling you is 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:25.419
 very simplistic 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:26.770
 actually the body is arranged 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.369
 much more difficult 

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:30.669
 in the market so far many things just aren't 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:31.589
 is known 

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:33.909
 not known all hormones are not known 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:35.189
 all winter 

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:37.680
 unknown mechanism for their synthesis 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.300
 don't rely on medical 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.819
 drugs remember 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:42.389
 they were created by people 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.360
 without understanding the device that 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.330
 an organism 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.180
 the only doctor who can 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.219
 trust is nature 

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.269
 eat more fresh fruits and vegetables 

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:52.629
 nuts 

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:53.219
 and be healthy
