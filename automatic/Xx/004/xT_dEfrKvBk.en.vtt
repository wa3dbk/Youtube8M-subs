00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 lately it seems that playing 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.400
 videogames is almost synonymous with being 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.080
 macho we have gotten ourselves into a loop 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.059
 endless in which everyone complains 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.370
 and talks about the female characters 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 in video games are all put as 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.240
 secondary or unimportant 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.180
 because they are all the time you will also be in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.279
 troubles and thanks to feminists who give 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.170
 Much grief as anita sarkisiÃ¡n seems 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 that everyone has assumed that this is 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.680
 a reality that's why he decided to do this 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.420
 video that a few minutes I'm going to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.890
 destroy all these topics about 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.660
 women of video games and you will see that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.160
 not only are there strong characters and with 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 personality within the video game but 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.640

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.430
 I'm a little fed up with this rabble 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.020
 he has no idea about video games but he 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.790
 He criticizes them as if he knew something 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.160
 of the subject when the truth is that I see myself 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.630
 what all these people have done is 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.880
 fixed of controversial games as per 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.340
 example the gta iv think how can you 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.440
 vote the whore and they already think that all 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.780
 games are sexist in order to judge 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.120
 all macho games because one 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.100
 what you think is really macho 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.540
 here it is macho to think that 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.130
 women do not have a role 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.780
 important in videogames 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.100
 when he has such an important role 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.019
 as the men do not forget 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.430
 share this video with everyone or 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.640

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.560
 similar nonsense so in 2010 with 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.860
