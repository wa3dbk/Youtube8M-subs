icd<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:36.630> year<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:39.110> with<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.290> system

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
icd on all year and with this system

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.000 
icd on all year and with this system
what<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> allows<00:00:41.280> him<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.440> lock<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
what it allows him to do is lock out and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.000 
what it allows him to do is lock out and
adjust<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.579> suspension<00:00:45.530> remotely<00:00:46.530> front<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
adjust the suspension remotely front and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.970 
adjust the suspension remotely front and
rear<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> same<00:00:47.610> time<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.710> with<00:00:49.710> very

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
rear at the same time and with very

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.229 
rear at the same time and with very
little<00:00:50.219> effort<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:52.160> not<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.610> force<00:00:53.910> at

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
little effort and not a lot of force at

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
little effort and not a lot of force at
on<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.079> lever<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.989> with<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> system<00:00:58.559> he

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
on the lever and so with the system he

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639 
on the lever and so with the system he
has<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> set<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.760> into<00:01:00.059> position<00:01:00.440> where<00:01:01.440> it's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
has it set up into position where it's

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.570 
has it set up into position where it's
just<00:01:01.920> locked<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:03.110> unlocked<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.439> nice<00:01:05.339> thing

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
just locked out unlocked and nice thing

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
just locked out unlocked and nice thing
about<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.909> system<00:01:06.299> too<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.720> you're<00:01:06.930> able<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
about the system too is you're able to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
about the system too is you're able to
adjust<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.770> unlike<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> normal<00:01:08.340> system<00:01:08.729> where

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
adjust it unlike a normal system where

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.270 
adjust it unlike a normal system where
he<00:01:09.630> chooses<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.110> lock<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> out<00:01:10.710> pushing<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
he chooses to lock it out pushing it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.330 
he chooses to lock it out pushing it
forward<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.720> push<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.170> lock<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> out

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
forward you can push it lock it out

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.280 
forward you can push it lock it out
going<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> other<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.750> programmable

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
going the other way it's programmable

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.580 
going the other way it's programmable
you<00:01:17.040> can't<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.840> mechanical

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you can't do that with with mechanical

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
you can't do that with with mechanical
systems<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.220> cables<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.939> kind<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
systems and cables and that kind of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.140 
systems and cables and that kind of
thing<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:23.009> other<00:01:23.159> big<00:01:23.430> benefit<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
thing the other big benefit of the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.179 
thing the other big benefit of the
system<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.659> well<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.619> clip<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:25.950> left

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
system as well is you can clip from left

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
system as well is you can clip from left
to<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.780> has<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:28.049> extremely<00:01:28.409> low

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
to right and it has an extremely low

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.429 
to right and it has an extremely low
lever<00:01:28.979> force<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.840> quite<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> bit

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
lever force you know you got quite a bit

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.770 
lever force you know you got quite a bit
of<00:01:31.530> force<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:32.100> levers<00:01:32.520> mechanical<00:01:33.270> things<00:01:33.540> in

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
of force on levers mechanical things in

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
of force on levers mechanical things in
order<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> make<00:01:34.320> activate<00:01:34.920> them<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
order to make activate them and with the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.190 
order to make activate them and with the
ICD<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.710> little<00:01:37.950> force<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> writer

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
ICD it's very little force so a writer

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.130 
ICD it's very little force so a writer
or<00:01:40.500> racer<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.180> adjust<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.360> quickly<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
or racer can adjust it so quickly that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
or racer can adjust it so quickly that
within<00:01:43.380> 10<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.130> 12<00:01:44.430> feet<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.729> sprinting

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
within 10 to 12 feet of sprinting

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.469 
within 10 to 12 feet of sprinting
sections<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.560> lock<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.060> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
sections they can lock it out and so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.469 
sections they can lock it out and so
they'll<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.220> lever<00:01:50.220> 40<00:01:50.820> times<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.270> lap

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
they'll use this lever 40 times a lap

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.550 
they'll use this lever 40 times a lap
you<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> six<00:01:53.490> lap<00:01:53.729> race<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> gets

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you know on a six lap race so it gets

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.190 
you know on a six lap race so it gets
used<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.040> almost<00:01:56.700> 2<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.329> 3<00:01:57.509> times<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.930> much<00:01:58.140> as

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
used on almost 2 to 3 times as much as

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
used on almost 2 to 3 times as much as
an<00:01:58.530> old<00:01:58.649> mechanical<00:01:59.189> system<00:01:59.610> because<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> how

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
an old mechanical system because of how

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.690 
an old mechanical system because of how
easy<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
easy it is and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.450 
easy it is and
it<00:02:04.090> has<00:02:04.299> three<00:02:04.689> positions<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.100> can<00:02:06.310> do

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
it has three positions what you can do

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.719 
it has three positions what you can do
with<00:02:06.610> this<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:08.080> can<00:02:08.410> lock<00:02:08.800> out<00:02:09.009> front<00:02:09.640> and

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
with this is you can lock out front and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.790 
with this is you can lock out front and
rear<00:02:09.849> at<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.030> same<00:02:10.269> time<00:02:10.569> or<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.620> them

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
rear at the same time or have them

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.430 
rear at the same time or have them
unlocked<00:02:12.250> at<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.519> same<00:02:12.760> time<00:02:13.060> or<00:02:13.810> lock<00:02:14.170> out

doing in that new discipline of racing
so<00:04:57.560> you'll<00:04:58.099> be<00:04:58.219> seeing<00:04:58.490> some<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.789> our<00:04:58.969> top

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
so you'll be seeing some of our top

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.059 
so you'll be seeing some of our top
internal<00:04:59.629> racers<00:05:00.050> on<00:05:00.199> this<00:05:00.379> system<00:05:00.590> going

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
internal racers on this system going

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.320 
internal racers on this system going
into<00:05:01.310> next<00:05:01.580> year<00:05:03.279> so<00:05:04.279> what<00:05:04.729> we<00:05:04.849> have<00:05:05.029> here<00:05:05.060> I'm

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
into next year so what we have here I'm

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.559 
into next year so what we have here I'm
going<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.479> show<00:05:05.659> you<00:05:05.689> is<00:05:05.930> our<00:05:06.050> new<00:05:07.120> 27.5<00:05:08.120> fork

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
going to show you is our new 27.5 fork

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.809 
going to show you is our new 27.5 fork
and<00:05:08.840> we<00:05:09.409> chose<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.710> go<00:05:10.009> with<00:05:10.039> that<00:05:10.370> instead<00:05:10.759> of

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
and we chose to go with that instead of

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:11.709 
and we chose to go with that instead of
650b

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
650b

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.100 
650b
simply<00:05:12.379> because<00:05:12.740> of<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.129> other<00:05:13.250> wheel<00:05:13.520> sizes

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
simply because of the other wheel sizes

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.279 
simply because of the other wheel sizes
26:29<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.979> know<00:05:16.129> it's<00:05:16.719> it's<00:05:17.719> in<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:17.990> middle

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
26:29 you know it's it's in the middle

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.089 
26:29 you know it's it's in the middle
and<00:05:18.710> it's<00:05:19.279> 160<00:05:19.969> millimeter<00:05:20.389> travel4<00:05:21.259> it's

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
and it's 160 millimeter travel4 it's

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:27.730 
and it's 160 millimeter travel4 it's
thirty<00:05:22.370> four<00:05:22.639> millimeter<00:05:23.889> tubes<00:05:25.750> it's<00:05:26.750> length

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
thirty four millimeter tubes it's length

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.119 
thirty four millimeter tubes it's length
is<00:05:27.919> about<00:05:28.219> 13<00:05:28.699> millimeters<00:05:29.330> longer<00:05:30.259> than<00:05:30.440> a<00:05:30.469> 26

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
is about 13 millimeters longer than a 26

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.189 
is about 13 millimeters longer than a 26
inch<00:05:31.370> 34<00:05:32.000> millimeter<00:05:32.389> for<00:05:32.629> it<00:05:32.750> got<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:32.990> same

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
inch 34 millimeter for it got the same

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.930 
inch 34 millimeter for it got the same
travel<00:05:33.740> and<00:05:33.949> that's<00:05:34.370> just<00:05:34.639> to<00:05:34.759> accommodate

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
travel and that's just to accommodate

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.119 
travel and that's just to accommodate
the<00:05:35.330> wheel<00:05:35.509> size<00:05:35.810> so<00:05:36.469> he<00:05:36.560> worked<00:05:36.740> really<00:05:36.860> hard

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
the wheel size so he worked really hard

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.950 
the wheel size so he worked really hard
at<00:05:37.490> keeping<00:05:37.639> that<00:05:37.940> around<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.419> actual<00:05:38.569> height

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
at keeping that around the actual height

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.200 
at keeping that around the actual height
low<00:05:39.969> keeping<00:05:40.969> the<00:05:41.060> stiffness<00:05:41.479> high<00:05:42.460> it's<00:05:43.460> 4.3

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
low keeping the stiffness high it's 4.3

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.540 
low keeping the stiffness high it's 4.3
pounds<00:05:44.629> which<00:05:44.719> keeps<00:05:44.960> it<00:05:45.139> right<00:05:45.319> in<00:05:45.439> that<00:05:45.560> nice

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
pounds which keeps it right in that nice

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.550 
pounds which keeps it right in that nice
weight<00:05:47.210> range<00:05:47.509> so<00:05:47.779> you<00:05:47.870> can<00:05:48.020> keep<00:05:48.169> it<00:05:48.379> you<00:05:48.529> know

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
weight range so you can keep it you know

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.339 
weight range so you can keep it you know
sub<00:05:49.009> 27<00:05:49.729> pounds<00:05:49.909> bike<00:05:50.389> and<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.779> with<00:05:51.169> that

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
sub 27 pounds bike and that with that

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.820 
sub 27 pounds bike and that with that
wheel<00:05:51.589> size<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:53.229> it's<00:05:54.229> going<00:05:54.379> to<00:05:54.469> be<00:05:54.560> used<00:05:54.710> for

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
wheel size and it's going to be used for

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.420 
wheel size and it's going to be used for
enduro<00:05:55.250> all-mountain<00:05:56.589> and<00:05:57.589> it's<00:05:58.069> worked<00:05:58.250> out

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
enduro all-mountain and it's worked out

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.519 
enduro all-mountain and it's worked out
really<00:05:58.639> great<00:05:59.060> because<00:05:59.389> a<00:05:59.810> lot<00:05:59.870> of<00:06:00.379> the

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
really great because a lot of the

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.260 
really great because a lot of the
