00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.889
 the students are still in hand on a right of inventory at the factory of the 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:04.790
 his 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.110
 so that illustrates 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.929
 the game is good or not 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.499
 so this work on three days what we achieve - tv integrated bfi 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.199
 not only production but also control 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.429
 analytic self group 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.230
 to know the growth characteristics 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.659
 six children are unharmed 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.489
 microbiological also meet the criteria 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.489
 so today unfolds so we get fish 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.960
 only a siren 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.450
 turkey to allow to benefit 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.570
 nothing to see 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.140
 parade% 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.320
 charest 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.480
 there is only one strain 6% in the agri-food industries and 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.249
 biological 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:43.490
 conservatory 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.560
 and after that we have the choice either to continue the studies in the end after 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.700
 the spillway to stop 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.790
 it's a syria diploma that has a value 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.810
 in the world of teamwork get to find a position in a 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.560
 business 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.070
 with concerts in agribusiness and fire in winter three areas 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.550
 it's the first one to be in control of quality and to Germans 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.440
 doubt whether it is of microbiological quality 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.490
 crates were rare 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.840
 bc ca 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.870
 because it does not lie consumables and that will have no problem for them 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.880
 consumers 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.050
 after a second match and research and development 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.310
 so it's a fact 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.310
 sr recall for research m 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.570
 on new products 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.410
 they want to get out new targets 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.570
 and the third domain he who brought the area more important is 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.560
 the production has in itself point 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 work within the company every day to produce 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 produce a finished product 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.930
 I do not know what it was 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 it's not always harder 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.030
 what they are working on interview because it 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.650
 go on cucumbers need 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 later 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.030
 a business partner 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.819
 the site 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.049
 Jules Verne 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.049
 he then I was looking for 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:16.679
 he is always present 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.679
 I did not want to do 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.679
 I'm going 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:24.769
 the day 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.989
 who will leave in the village 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.549
 a few inches long 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.549
 it could be either 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:35.639
 by the way 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.259
 that's why the teachers who was at the origin of the tea 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.169
 for the signatories what's called someone loyal and that's what it is 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.469
 it's more interesting do not know what's more 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.579
 she says she integrates several subjects several disciplines on a 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.709
 education 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.709
 how to put myself on issues like smoking 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.589
 all the part of the studies of the product 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.399
 raw materials 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:00.159
 to the finished product at the ecological level 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.959
 and the biochemical level in the quality competition of the raw material 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.959
 quality of finished products in connection with production 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.309
 how to select atp that attack departments 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.119
 so roughly twenty years 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.119
 and then it's been three days that I want 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:20.629
 production level is Tuesday all day menard and suction 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.899
 exception of salmon cutting salmon 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:27.039
 on Tuesday they did the salting suma a smoking drying 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.049
 the second an employee can register 3 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.789
 but a good layer of salt on the litigation 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.799
 and after we have been patients of the sector 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.179
 and for four hours 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.079
 a facet more than the one made in Morocco in its parades 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.069
 the masters in final drying are for him a first phase of drying 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.069
 which lasts an hour and a half 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.139
 we work at a relatively low temperature these 22 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.939
 created it will not allow that a passer 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.889
 but lose his grip 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.249
 with the country produces basic showing his apartment Saturday 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.739
 we work at 22 to not have taken 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.649
 which are proteins 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:05.760
 after one hour and a half we go to the music of film 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.839
 is it going to last two and a quarter hours 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.539
 we buy the chimeric that is produced next to and with sawdust 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:12.679
 light wood 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:15.679
 a small electrical resistance that will allow to have a commission 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.379
 he cleared 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.309
 and in parallel whenever every raw material treatment 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:22.270
 Finished products 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.330
 to control the production 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.580
 in microbiology 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.629
 El bÃ©chir 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:29.830
 so that means to ward off the summer compass the preparations 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.460
 in those two games 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.809
 the week before 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:34.840
 they prepared microbiology walls 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.400
 and the coming weeks, that is until the end of December 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.400
 they will do all the part and microbiological analyzes of the product 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.270
 what to make and guys mans manufacturing conditions 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.779
 and the first week of January they have the same idea at home products 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.110
 on a day 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.080
 7 am 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.740
 six in the evening 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.039
 and Thursday at the do trial 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.809
 at a disadvantage 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:01.049
 this last visual control canvas to have a nice shape at the level of 

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:03.689
 fish are conditioned to be tagged 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.240
 and in expedition 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.349
 and tasted divides into two parts so small side that it sins 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.770
 no 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.360
 this double meaning 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.190
 parise 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.039
 Lille victory 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.210
 the whole of 2010 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.460
 xinhua 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.610
 Paris 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.699
 Wagner Wauquiez Socialist 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.889
 5 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:45.379
 tonight
