together<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.750> i<00:00:18.900> think<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.290> is<00:00:19.770> borne<00:00:20.099> out

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
together which i think is is borne out

together which i think is is borne out
by<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.700> results<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> our<00:00:21.540> collaboration<00:00:22.500> and

by the results of our collaboration and
also<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> fact<00:00:23.520> that<00:00:23.670> i<00:00:24.180> hadn't<00:00:24.810> designed<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
also the fact that i hadn't designed a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.720 
also the fact that i hadn't designed a
camera<00:00:25.590> before<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.550> first

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730

visual world you know I live my life
through<00:01:09.060> images<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.960> things<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.620> day-to-day

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
through images of things on a day-to-day

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.190 
through images of things on a day-to-day
basis<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:11.970> constantly<00:01:12.450> looking<00:01:12.540> at<00:01:12.900> images

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
basis I'm constantly looking at images

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
basis I'm constantly looking at images
of<00:01:13.580> designs<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:15.210> prototypes<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.729> projects<00:01:17.729> in

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
of designs of prototypes of projects in

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.530 
of designs of prototypes of projects in
progress<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.740> looking<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:20.610> images<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.240> really

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
progress so looking at images is really

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.750 
progress so looking at images is really
for<00:01:21.690> me<00:01:21.860> fundamental

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.830 

it's<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.570> very<00:01:26.780> difficult<00:01:26.960> thing<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:27.680> try<00:01:28.250> to

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
it's a very difficult thing to try to

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.240 
it's a very difficult thing to try to
understand<00:01:29.840> what<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.110> like<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.680> design<00:01:30.830> and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
understand what I like to design and

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.220 
understand what I like to design and
what<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.370> don't<00:01:31.610> like<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.970> design<00:01:32.120> for<00:01:32.570> sure<00:01:32.960> i'm

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
what I don't like to design for sure i'm

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.810 
what I don't like to design for sure i'm
not<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.470> fashion<00:01:33.710> designer<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.460> should<00:01:34.670> be

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
not a fashion designer that should be

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.990 
not a fashion designer that should be
clear<00:01:35.150> but<00:01:36.020> in<00:01:36.500> terms<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.980> products<00:01:37.400> i<00:01:37.580> love<00:01:37.850> to

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
like the ability to be able to design

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.240 
like the ability to be able to design
all<00:01:45.020> kinds<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.410> things<00:01:45.650> because<00:01:45.950> that's<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
all kinds of things because that's the
