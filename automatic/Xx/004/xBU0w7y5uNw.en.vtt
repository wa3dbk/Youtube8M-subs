 mercedes cárdenas the frustrated author of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.680
 the music of the Argentine national anthem 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 [Music] 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.240
 How are you doing? 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.140
 I'm fine but I need to continue 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.239
 working stuff so much if it is not 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.350
 you understand, I'm going to be the creator of the 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:32.080
 anthem music 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:36.790
 listening to the righteous 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.790
 to this world 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.420
 dear mother obsession for my work 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.879
 It is already bringing me problems 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.409
 Married I am depressed and exalted 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.300
 what has led me to present a 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.020
 score for the anthem that is something 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.420
 melancholic and nostalgic 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.059
 [Music] 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.510
 is a most dignified throne opened the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.780
 united provinces of the south and the free 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:10.649
 of the world respond to the great people 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.649
 Argentinean health to the great Argentine people 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.400
 argentinian health 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.100
 to the great Argentine people health 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.689
 [Music] 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.689
 It is very emotional 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.770
 we do not like it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.800
 then there is more of course than what 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.750
 they rejected but my creativity can and 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.300
 then present another music with a 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.550
 more effective spirit and I added a 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.770
 gadget that in dance halls 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.430
 sure there will be furor 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.970
 two 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.970
 let's swear with glory die down 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.290
 in this way he loved glory with 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.009
 glory die 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.980
 [Applause] 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:16.620
 we can be something, not glory 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:21.690
 with glory die watch the effect 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.690
 it covers them until they dance without rest 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.730
 you do not like the inner ball 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.330
 that was the good 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.940
 I have more liked neither the music nor the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.530
 ball for strong could sell it to 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.950
 Rocha who told me he was going to put 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.750
 its pinewood while I keep trying to 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.440
 carry on my family life in 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.959
 where my obsession also appears 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.959
 [Music] 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.959

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.440
 Let's see 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:02.370
 may the laurels that we knew be eternal 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.130
 get or swear with glory die or 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.700

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.520
 part of the well are eternal laurels 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.090

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.470

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.470

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.470

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.410
 I have more 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.240
 hoping to calm the child he should 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.780
 understand that the life of his artist father 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.280

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.320

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.530

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:58.100
