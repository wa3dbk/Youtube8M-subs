00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
gaps between them except this little

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.850 
gaps between them except this little
area<00:02:37.530> here<00:02:37.799> but<00:02:38.220> that's<00:02:38.489> minor<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> yeah<00:02:40.500> pose

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
area here but that's minor so yeah pose

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.479 
area here but that's minor so yeah pose
ability<00:02:41.250> oh<00:02:41.430> let's<00:02:42.209> see<00:02:42.830> Scorpios<00:02:43.830> legs<00:02:44.069> has

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
ability oh let's see Scorpios legs has

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.339 
ability oh let's see Scorpios legs has
multiple<00:02:45.209> joints<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.660> them<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:45.930> they<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.110> go

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
multiple joints in them so they can go

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.440 
multiple joints in them so they can go
pretty<00:02:46.650> much<00:02:46.799> anywhere<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.940> one<00:02:48.090> has<00:02:48.239> two

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
points of articulation and yeah so you

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.440 
points of articulation and yeah so you
can<00:02:52.049> give<00:02:52.170> them<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.440> different<00:02:52.620> poses<00:02:53.150> boyzzz<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
can give them a different poses boyzzz I

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.960 
can give them a different poses boyzzz I
say<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.930> poises<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.220> tail<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.400> poseable

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
say that poises and the tail is poseable

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.460 
say that poises and the tail is poseable
so<00:02:57.209> like<00:02:58.040> go<00:02:59.040> all<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> way<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.660> olean<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
so like go all the way out in olean and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.970 
so like go all the way out in olean and
it<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.190> fire<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:03.049> energy<00:03:04.049> sphere<00:03:04.349> I<00:03:04.379> I<00:03:04.709> guess

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
it can fire this energy sphere I I guess

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.440 
it can fire this energy sphere I I guess
that's<00:03:05.160> work<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.459> friend<00:03:05.670> call<00:03:05.879> it<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.299> I

length<00:03:55.859> one<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.579> like<00:03:57.030> these<00:03:57.180> little<00:03:57.359> lakes

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
length one is like these little lakes

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.720 
length one is like these little lakes
here<00:03:57.900> but<00:03:58.620> yeah<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:59.250> just<00:03:59.340> kind<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.579> have<00:03:59.639> to

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
here but yeah you just kind of have to

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.979 
here but yeah you just kind of have to
fiddle<00:03:59.940> with<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.269> little<00:04:00.359> bit<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.750> get<00:04:00.840> them

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
fiddle with it a little bit to get them

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.970 
fiddle with it a little bit to get them
to<00:04:01.139> the<00:04:01.169> right<00:04:01.380> pose<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:03.000> everything<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.980> can't

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
to the right pose and everything I can't

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.259 
to the right pose and everything I can't
hear<00:04:06.980> now<00:04:07.980> although<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.639> shorter<00:04:08.849> legs<00:04:09.060> do

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
hear now although the shorter legs do

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.849 
hear now although the shorter legs do
look<00:04:09.480> out<00:04:09.630> place<00:04:09.900> they<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.260> serve<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> purpose

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
look out place they do serve a purpose

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.069 
look out place they do serve a purpose
however<00:04:11.190> as<00:04:11.489> they<00:04:12.209> act<00:04:12.450> as<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> staple

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
however as they act as a staple

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.409 
however as they act as a staple
restructure<00:04:13.769> for<00:04:14.010> Scorpio<00:04:14.430> as<00:04:14.669> you<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.269> see

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
restructure for Scorpio as you can see

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.449 
restructure for Scorpio as you can see
they<00:04:15.540> touch<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.900> ground<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.500> they<00:04:17.130> sort<00:04:17.370> of

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
they touch the ground so they sort of

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.099 
they touch the ground so they sort of
keep<00:04:17.729> them<00:04:17.849> upright<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.419> everything<00:04:18.750> instead

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
keep them upright and everything instead

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.409 
keep them upright and everything instead
of<00:04:19.200> just<00:04:19.380> flopping<00:04:19.590> about<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.340> they're<00:04:21.209> not

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
of just flopping about so they're not

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.750 
of just flopping about so they're not
entirely<00:04:21.840> useless<00:04:22.139> or<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:23.070> know<00:04:23.219> out<00:04:23.610> of

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
entirely useless or you know out of

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.700 
entirely useless or you know out of
place<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.539> you<00:04:24.599> got<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.900> have<00:04:25.020> stability<00:04:25.289> of

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
place so you got to have stability of

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.930 
place so you got to have stability of
course<00:04:25.919> but

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
course but

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.870 
course but
yeah<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:28.650> that's<00:04:28.890> about<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.670> you<00:04:29.730> got<00:04:29.850> the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
yeah and that's about it and you got the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.240 
yeah and that's about it and you got the
cause<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.120> spikes<00:04:30.450> here<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.840> everything<00:04:31.250> so

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
cause of spikes here and everything so

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.070 
cause of spikes here and everything so
it's<00:04:32.700> all<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:32.820> can<00:04:33.000> say<00:04:33.120> for<00:04:33.150> Scorpio<00:04:33.630> he's<00:04:34.050> a

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
really awesome set and a size comparison

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.550 
really awesome set and a size comparison
will<00:04:36.990> quit<00:04:37.230> playing<00:04:38.240> 30<00:04:39.240> near<00:04:39.600> me<00:04:39.750> here's
