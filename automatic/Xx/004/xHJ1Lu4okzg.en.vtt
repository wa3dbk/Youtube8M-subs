00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
episode just appeared last week but I'm

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.699 
episode just appeared last week but I'm

not sure when this review will get out

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.890 
not sure when this review will get out
there<00:03:55.889> but<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.549> know<00:03:56.699> it's<00:03:57.120> kind<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.690> cool<00:03:57.870> to

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
there but you know it's kind of cool to

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.740 
there but you know it's kind of cool to
think<00:03:58.199> that<00:03:58.590> Hasbro<00:03:59.250> will<00:03:59.910> have<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.389> figure

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
think that Hasbro will have a figure

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.319 
think that Hasbro will have a figure
ready<00:04:01.049> for<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:02.040> episode<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:02.760> appeared

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
ready for the episode that just appeared

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.150 
ready for the episode that just appeared
you<00:04:04.139> know<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.500> would<00:04:04.590> be<00:04:04.650> really<00:04:04.859> cool<00:04:04.980> if

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
you know that would be really cool if

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.920 
you know that would be really cool if
they<00:04:05.340> could<00:04:05.489> do<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.790> for<00:04:06.090> all<00:04:06.629> the<00:04:06.660> episodes

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
they could do that for all the episodes

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.559 
they could do that for all the episodes
but<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:08.040> know<00:04:08.190> they<00:04:08.459> can't<00:04:08.669> do<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:08.849> but<00:04:09.209> you

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569

but I know they can't do that but you
nobody<00:04:09.870> really<00:04:10.199> neat<00:04:10.470> idea<00:04:10.859> if<00:04:10.980> they<00:04:11.129> could

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
nobody really neat idea if they could
