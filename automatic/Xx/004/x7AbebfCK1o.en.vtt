00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
ounce can right before I work out I

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.510 
ounce can right before I work out I

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.870 
results but that it is a lot better than
when<00:06:42.750> I<00:06:42.780> was<00:06:42.960> over<00:06:43.620> 200<00:06:43.830> pounds<00:06:44.460> so<00:06:44.669> I'm

excited<00:06:45.270> about<00:06:45.479> that<00:06:45.630> but<00:06:46.430> if<00:06:47.430> you<00:06:47.729> don't<00:06:47.880> like

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
excited about that but if you don't like

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.240 
excited about that but if you don't like
I<00:06:48.120> said<00:06:48.389> it's<00:06:48.510> really<00:06:48.810> hard<00:06:49.020> to<00:06:49.260> you<00:06:49.979> know<00:06:50.040> like

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
weight training so hopefully that pays
