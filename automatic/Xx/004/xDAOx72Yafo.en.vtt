00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.800
 I am social and essentials 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.050
 professional program and I work as 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.750
 to visit the station 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.880
 my name is built i am public 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.680
 the ns stations remain professional 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.900
 program that means that we are beside us 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.030
 received work training from professionals 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.840
 from people from the organization 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.480
 i started at julia's as 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.580
 unit leader amsterdam central I am looking now 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 as district manager at kiehl's in 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.080
 north holland can actually be concerned with 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.940
 everything and the experience at the station 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.859
 so i investigate what's on my trip 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.600
 wasted and what matters to them 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.370
 For example, we always look to the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.820
 basis for looking at safety 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.609
 look into 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.500
 the cameras clean so what cleaners 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.969
 brightly colored vest and we 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.989
 Also looking at the experience is what now 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.399
 with swear and degree of inviting to what 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.250
 the world we work in is so much fun 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.700
 is the dynamics is the speed of 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.950
 to work 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.729
 the peak moments at the different 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.920
 stations 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.990
 being busy with different 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.310
 colleagues to be that traveler every day 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.430
 to serve better 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.929
 well i dont make me not alone 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.090
 possible is flat on the filming 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.429
 your cleaner life 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 that station was completely built around 78 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.130
 along an extensive 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.440
 the traineeship is a very intensive one 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.090
 trajectory the coaching that get 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.950
 is not limited to class 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.679
 Coaching really sees more attention 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.020
 and there is room for 1 on 1 coaching 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.700
 You always see that there is a difference 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.710
 between work in the field and work on 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.720
 knowledge gained yourself very quickly 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.670
 apply tips on how to apply 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.920
 it could work for us with whatever 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.330
 we think there are actually master classes too 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.069
 deny a certain level 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.450
 get that his colleagues from it 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.369
 company that actually tell us what 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.409
 they did was to convey what the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.780
 makes traineeship unique in my view 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.159
 is that there are directors meets 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.289
 the trainings and not from one 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.090
 director role but also mainly from the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.569
 role as a trainer journey innovation is also 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.859
 often outside 2 nice 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.079
 we are just going to have fun things with one 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.909
 couple and because we also stuff them 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.829
 we just learn a lot from her 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.829
 and and and each other powder 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.580
 state there were tense it is 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.770
 dynamic 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.290
 it is different every day i find my work 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.300
 and I think they really learned a lot in it 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.300
 a year and I am still here
