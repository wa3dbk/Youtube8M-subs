00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.370
 right now I'll take a small role for 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.770
 I just want to show you how I am violets 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.160
 forgive i don't know much of this principle 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.650
 may be interesting in theory there on u 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.800
 tuba many show this method but i don't 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.970
 I know the easiest I take here from me 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.810
 there is a sphagnum moss he is already three 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.359
 years all he like you still not yet 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.939
 rotted though here is wet because in it 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.120
 There are phytoncides that delay 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.280
 rotting as the moss grows in the swamp 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.010
 swamps and it is naturally damp damp 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.840
 other nature has developed in it protective 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.059
 properties that allow him 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.200
 Well, what does not spoil and it is generally 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.780
 unique grass to and 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 germinate and grow orchids but about 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.649
 orchid then tell you now I will show 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.370
 In principle, violets take this 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.590
 container 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.210
 ordinary container can big can 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.070
 small depending on how much u 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.199
 you leaves that leaves were not 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.719
 superimposed one-on-one take a piece 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.010
 conventional film to container 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.350
 could close 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.060
 by denser and there is formed how to see 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.520
 greenhouses such happens khz holds 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.119
 moisture from what's going on like 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.210
 would i come here 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.740
 long time did not look I did not go for an hour 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.110
 bed 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.810
 for the light to fall here this fresh 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.790
 leaves here I put here like a swamp 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.600
 let's see what happened to him 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.810
 ordinary could you moisturize it these but i 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.790
 later always drive smooth water therefore 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.659
 moistened with a spray bottle and thrust 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.189
 there leaves 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.350
 Well, now let's see here you see already once. 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.720
 appeared though passed in principle of the week 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.119
 take a leaf cut you diagonally 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.009
 a sharp knife so that the cut was diagonally 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.430
 and here on the edge here appear 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.920
 the leaves are now these leaves are not the roots 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.770
 now see the others you see 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.140
 it means they have already grown closer to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.479
 dampness was you see what already 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.430
 rootlets 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.520
 that is, in principle, he is ready for that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.070
 to plant it 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.050
 do not deepen the neck shallowly 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.630
 deep because he will crawl 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.450
 it will be hard on our edge 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.550
 cup or small pot there and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.340
 it will be ground and from here they will go with you 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.830
 sprout now we will return it back 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:31.620
 let's see big here let it lie and 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.780
 not even seen it happens so that's how 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.030
 here happened see sheet start 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.420
 rot and deteriorates then this 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.360
 you cut the rot with a knife to further it 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.720
 did not distribute the cut update and again 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.480
 like this put on germination well here 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.780
 but I donâ€™t know how old the leaves are 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.480
 it will not work I already know 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.270
 launched because there was no time here 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.959
 that 's what's happening here 1 sheet 2 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.530
 of 3 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.950
 here already whole vacations have grown naturally 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.040
 in these bushes here and so could disassemble 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.120
 even up to the end do not have to clean it straight with 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.670
 With this ear, put it in the pot 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.360
 powder with earth and you will have 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.180
 high-grade is empty so here such 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.510
 the way i like how much i germinated 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.989
 Well, if you put a valid 10 sheets 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.610
 almost all 10 sheets take root 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.380
 it is true that he comes across 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.370
 such a rot it starts 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.019
 spoil the sheet but it still depends and 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.269
 the immunity of the plant itself that is what 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.340
 it was not very strong when you take 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.570
 try to take the leaves and destiny 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.830
 which are on top of the leaves which is closer to 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:52.730
 the ground they are better germinate here 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.730
 and the rays take root 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.720
 principle, the land is already sold for them 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.060
 ready so you use this land 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.709
 which is written for violets because 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.470
 they are a little earth structures should 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.040
 differ from other plants because 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.070
 violet mostly grows on rocky 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.310
 areas and she does not like greasy soil 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.200
 if you plant humus in manure and 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.180
 other she does not grow at all 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.650
 this she needs better need sand and so 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.970
 poor as if the soil and when watering 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.670
 say violets do not need to be watered from above 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.190
 they only rot them in the pan 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.590
 watered on top i don't rot but i 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.270
 really pour distilled water 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.240
 here that is, they grow normally that is 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.350
 problems with them especially does not arise 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.610
 the only thing you give the pot 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.210
 always if you plant 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.490
 violet earth you watered it once and 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.180
 water now only after when 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.580
 above the ground will be almost dry as 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.040
 I do not know in short, let's get to 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.120
 the pot dried up that is when the earth 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.010
 completely dry 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.300
 after that she waters herself 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.070
 feels good if you will 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.470
 keep the ground feed constantly 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.210
 wet begin to chafing 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.380
 lower leaves starts to get sick then 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.570
 there is she does not like constant dampness 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.820
 were sick 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.890
 dried watered you sewed that's the principle and 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.070
 all if you like subscribe

 him and watch other videos there more 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.430
 50 and feed and about flowers 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.850
 thank you for watching our video before
