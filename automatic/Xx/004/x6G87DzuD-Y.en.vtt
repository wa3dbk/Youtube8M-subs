to<00:04:17.330> our<00:04:17.570> unit<00:04:17.930> is<00:04:18.140> when<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.560> children<00:04:18.769> are

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
to our unit is when the children are

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.940 
to our unit is when the children are
invited<00:04:20.360> to<00:04:20.540> invent<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:21.260> Rube<00:04:21.680> Goldberg

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
invited to invent a Rube Goldberg

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.730 
invited to invent a Rube Goldberg
invention<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.000> we<00:04:23.840> first<00:04:24.080> spend<00:04:24.320> some<00:04:24.500> time

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
invention and we first spend some time

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.770 
invention and we first spend some time
showing<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.220> children<00:04:25.670> how<00:04:25.970> those<00:04:26.210> invention

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
showing the children how those invention

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.440 
showing the children how those invention
processes<00:04:27.380> go<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.640> teacher<00:04:28.850> sits<00:04:29.270> down

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
processes go and the teacher sits down

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.270 
processes go and the teacher sits down
and<00:04:29.750> actually<00:04:29.960> tries<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.680> invent<00:04:30.980> something

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
and actually tries to invent something

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.950 
and actually tries to invent something
and<00:04:31.610> shows<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.970> children<00:04:32.360> that<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:32.630> doesn't

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
and shows the children that it doesn't

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:43.000 
and shows the children that it doesn't
always<00:04:33.080> happen<00:04:33.410> right<00:04:33.740> away<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:42.620> children

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
always happen right away the children

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.340 
always happen right away the children
then<00:04:43.160> take<00:04:43.430> this<00:04:43.580> idea<00:04:43.790> home<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.540> work<00:04:45.080> on<00:04:45.230> an

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
then take this idea home and work on an
