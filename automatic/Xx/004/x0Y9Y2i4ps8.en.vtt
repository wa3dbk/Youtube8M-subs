ways<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.050> doing<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:25.890> how<00:00:26.099> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
ways of doing it but this is just how I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.349 
ways of doing it but this is just how I

do it so I brought my Bowl in from the
high<00:00:30.510> store<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> TTL<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.210> first<00:00:33.210> thing<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
high store up a TTL on it first thing to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.260 
high store up a TTL on it first thing to
do<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.989> shut<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.100> windows<00:00:35.219> indoors<00:00:36.000> okay

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
do is shut all the windows indoors okay

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.450 
do is shut all the windows indoors okay
because<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.320> happens<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.800> when<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> bees

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
because what happens is when the bees

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.180 
because what happens is when the bees
are<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:39.030> cunning<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.320> will<00:00:40.649> smell

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.010 
are very cunning and they will smell
honey<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:42.000> try<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.300> get<00:00:42.390> into<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
honey and they will try and get into the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.590 
honey and they will try and get into the
house<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.379> try<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> honey<00:00:45.030> back<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600

no<00:01:53.759> bees<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.689> comb<00:01:54.930> honey<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:56.280> I've

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
no bees on the comb honey so here I've

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.050 
no bees on the comb honey so here I've
got<00:01:56.460> two<00:01:57.030> lovely<00:01:57.360> big<00:01:57.540> homes<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.880> capped<00:01:59.880> honey

which<00:02:00.540> I'm<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> process<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> do

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
which I'm going to process so what I do

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.090 
which I'm going to process so what I do
is<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:03.360> trusty<00:02:03.570> knife<00:02:04.100> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
is I just get my trusty knife and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.180 
is I just get my trusty knife and
basically

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
basically

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.030 
basically
put<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.850> like<00:02:07.750> this<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.320> mash<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:08.800> up<00:02:08.979> with

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
put it up like this and mash it up with

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.000 
put it up like this and mash it up with
the<00:02:09.310> nine<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.790> what<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.540> is<00:02:10.930> doing<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.590> it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
the nine and what that is doing is it's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.730 
the nine and what that is doing is it's
just<00:02:12.130> release<00:02:12.880> then<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.360> little<00:02:13.600> wax<00:02:13.840> cap<00:02:14.350> on

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
just release then the little wax cap on

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.740 
just release then the little wax cap on
top<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.220> each<00:02:15.400> cell<00:02:15.790> which<00:02:16.060> contains<00:02:16.240> your

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
top of each cell which contains your

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.840 
top of each cell which contains your
honey<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.500> releases<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.670> runny

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
honey so that it releases that runny

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.040 
honey so that it releases that runny
honey<00:02:18.970> into<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.840> bulb<00:02:21.210> if<00:02:22.210> you<00:02:22.420> haven't
