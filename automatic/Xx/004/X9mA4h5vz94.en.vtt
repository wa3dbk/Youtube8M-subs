make<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.310> nice<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.489> flush<00:02:28.880> up<00:02:29.120> against<00:02:29.360> the

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
make it nice and flush up against the

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.470 
make it nice and flush up against the
holder<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.470> spacer<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.299> all

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
holder and spacer and to do that all

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.610 
holder and spacer and to do that all
I've<00:02:32.599> done<00:02:32.720> was<00:02:32.780> visually<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:34.340> held<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.620> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
I've done was visually I held be the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.770 
I've done was visually I held be the
back<00:02:37.840> up<00:02:38.840> against<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:40.330> bottom<00:02:41.330> looking<00:02:41.599> like

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
back up against the bottom looking like

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.229 
back up against the bottom looking like
this<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.260> made<00:02:42.440> sure<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.650> was<00:02:42.890> quite<00:02:43.239> parallel

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
this and made sure it was quite parallel

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.930 
this and made sure it was quite parallel
and<00:02:45.040> basically<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.400> lined<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.730> these

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and basically I just lined up these

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.530 
and basically I just lined up these
hinge<00:02:47.900> points<00:02:48.470> visually<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:50.180> doesn't<00:02:50.360> have<00:02:50.450> to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
hinge points visually it doesn't have to

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.229 
hinge points visually it doesn't have to
be<00:02:50.599> like<00:02:50.750> really<00:02:50.900> perfect<00:02:51.500> or<00:02:51.620> anything<00:02:51.680> and

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
be like really perfect or anything and

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.330 
be like really perfect or anything and
then<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.329> just<00:02:53.510> marked<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.989> mark<00:02:54.349> where<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.890> film

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
then I just marked a mark where the film

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.120 
then I just marked a mark where the film
holder<00:02:55.640> or<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.299> furthest<00:02:56.660> point<00:02:56.930> out<00:02:57.140> is

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
holder or the the furthest point out is

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.000 
holder or the the furthest point out is
on<00:02:58.640> here<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.090> made<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.420> little<00:02:59.630> mark<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.230> did<00:03:00.769> the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
on here I made a little mark I did the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.729 
on here I made a little mark I did the
same<00:03:01.160> for<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.430> top<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.260> ended<00:03:03.560> up<00:03:03.680> with

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
same for the top and so I ended up with

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.809 
same for the top and so I ended up with
two<00:03:04.780> tick<00:03:05.780> marks<00:03:06.230> don't<00:03:06.920> know<00:03:07.100> if<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.400> see

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
two tick marks don't know if you can see

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.140 
two tick marks don't know if you can see
-<00:03:08.630> small<00:03:08.810> red<00:03:09.079> tick<00:03:09.680> marks<00:03:09.950> here<00:03:10.160> but<00:03:11.000> once

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
- small red tick marks here but once

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.930 
- small red tick marks here but once
you've<00:03:11.239> done<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:14.109> you<00:03:15.280> grab<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.310> little

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
you've done that you grab a little

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.080 
you've done that you grab a little
square<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:19.840> basically<00:03:20.840> you'll<00:03:21.380> just<00:03:22.090> mark

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
square and basically you'll just mark

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.330 
square and basically you'll just mark
across<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.530> want<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.799> straight<00:03:25.130> line

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
across and you want a straight line

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.059 
across and you want a straight line
straight<00:03:26.060> up<00:03:26.150> across<00:03:26.989> here<00:03:27.230> I've<00:03:27.680> done<00:03:27.889> two

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
straight up across here I've done two

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.900 
straight up across here I've done two
marks<00:03:28.459> because<00:03:28.910> just<00:03:29.750> as<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:31.340> check

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
marks because just as like a a check

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.390 
marks because just as like a a check
test<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.109> that<00:03:33.139> fine<00:03:33.650> actually<00:03:34.010> make<00:03:34.220> sure

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
test so that fine actually make sure

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.610 
test so that fine actually make sure
that<00:03:34.549> south<00:03:34.790> marks<00:03:35.150> are<00:03:35.380> reasonable

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
that south marks are reasonable

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:47.910 
that south marks are reasonable
so<00:03:37.549> mark<00:03:38.269> those<00:03:38.540> -<00:03:39.670> I've<00:03:40.670> got<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:40.910> rip<00:03:41.120> mark<00:03:41.389> here

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:04:02.940 

so<00:03:50.910> put<00:03:51.910> up<00:03:52.000> against<00:03:52.690> this<00:03:53.200> end<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:02.800> can

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
so put up against this end and you can

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:13.790 
so put up against this end and you can
see<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.520> my<00:04:04.360> mic<00:04:04.630> is<00:04:05.530> actually<00:04:07.830> perfect<00:04:12.780> so

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
see that my mic is actually perfect so

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.210 
see that my mic is actually perfect so
I've<00:04:14.800> got<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.040> mic<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.450> want<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.660> mock<00:04:17.220> down

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
I've got a mic and you want to mock down

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:44.280 
I've got a mic and you want to mock down
here<00:04:18.579> -<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:32.680> is<00:04:32.860> just<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.100> guiding<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:43.290> and

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
here - this is just the guiding you and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.920 
here - this is just the guiding you and
then<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.880> then<00:04:46.000> basically<00:04:46.270> you<00:04:46.630> just<00:04:46.690> get<00:04:46.900> a

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
then and then basically you just get a

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.920 
then and then basically you just get a
hacksaw<00:04:47.380> or<00:04:47.650> some<00:04:48.160> sort<00:04:48.460> of<00:04:48.490> turning<00:04:49.390> tool<00:04:49.600> I'm

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
hacksaw or some sort of turning tool I'm

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.650 
hacksaw or some sort of turning tool I'm
gonna<00:04:50.200> use<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.470> dremel<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.340> think<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.790> you'll

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
gonna use a dremel I think and you'll

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.390 
gonna use a dremel I think and you'll
cut<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.169> down<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:54.010> notice<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.280> haven't

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
cut that down you notice I haven't

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.770 
cut that down you notice I haven't
actually<00:04:54.550> cut<00:04:54.820> this<00:04:54.910> off<00:04:55.030> yet<00:04:55.210> I'll<00:04:55.390> do<00:04:55.690> that

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.900 
you can see I've also cut out the kind
of<00:05:37.300> knob<00:05:37.720> long<00:05:38.560> here<00:05:39.010> this<00:05:39.880> was<00:05:40.030> on<00:05:40.180> here<00:05:41.910> yeah

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
of knob long here this was on here yeah

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.570 
of knob long here this was on here yeah
just<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.330> dremel<00:05:43.720> round<00:05:44.530> it<00:05:44.680> out<00:05:44.800> it's<00:05:45.490> actually

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
just a dremel round it out it's actually

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.670 
just a dremel round it out it's actually
took<00:05:45.820> quite<00:05:45.880> a<00:05:46.060> bit<00:05:46.180> of<00:05:46.270> time<00:05:46.479> because<00:05:46.690> if<00:05:47.470> you

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
took quite a bit of time because if you

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.100 
took quite a bit of time because if you
can<00:05:47.830> see<00:05:48.070> here<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:50.130> kind<00:05:51.130> of<00:05:51.510> edges<00:05:52.510> along<00:05:52.930> the

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
can see here the kind of edges along the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.630 
can see here the kind of edges along the
long<00:05:53.229> end<00:05:53.470> is<00:05:53.680> here<00:05:53.890> are<00:05:54.100> quite<00:05:54.400> thin<00:05:54.610> but

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
long end is here are quite thin but

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.719 
long end is here are quite thin but
these<00:05:55.030> two<00:05:55.810> chunks<00:05:56.110> here<00:05:56.470> were<00:05:57.160> really<00:05:57.460> thick

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
these two chunks here were really thick

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.370 
these two chunks here were really thick
and<00:05:57.970> that<00:05:58.720> took<00:05:58.840> ages<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.289> grind<00:05:59.650> out

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
and that took ages to grind out

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.920 
and that took ages to grind out
but<00:06:00.890> finally<00:06:01.250> came<00:06:01.430> off<00:06:01.550> smooth<00:06:02.450> this<00:06:02.750> over

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
but finally came off smooth this over

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.800 
but finally came off smooth this over
with<00:06:03.410> just<00:06:03.590> a<00:06:03.710> file<00:06:04.090> later<00:06:05.090> I'll<00:06:05.300> fill<00:06:05.570> this<00:06:05.690> up

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
with just a file later I'll fill this up

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.240 
with just a file later I'll fill this up
with<00:06:05.870> epoxy<00:06:06.290> and<00:06:07.780> find<00:06:08.780> it<00:06:08.900> flush

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
with epoxy and find it flush

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.380 
with epoxy and find it flush
maybe<00:06:10.670> embed<00:06:11.090> a<00:06:11.300> small<00:06:12.670> metal<00:06:13.670> plate<00:06:14.030> into

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
maybe embed a small metal plate into

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.950 
maybe embed a small metal plate into
this<00:06:14.660> square<00:06:15.500> hole<00:06:15.710> here<00:06:15.980> and<00:06:16.570> epoxy<00:06:17.570> it<00:06:17.840> in

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
this square hole here and epoxy it in

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.760 
this square hole here and epoxy it in
and<00:06:18.440> secure<00:06:18.860> it<00:06:18.950> and<00:06:19.130> then<00:06:20.170> over<00:06:21.170> that<00:06:21.350> will<00:06:21.620> be

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
and secure it and then over that will be

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.500 
and secure it and then over that will be
the<00:06:21.890> lever<00:06:22.070> now<00:06:23.920> two<00:06:24.920> things<00:06:25.130> I<00:06:25.460> did<00:06:25.730> well<00:06:26.300> as

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
the lever now two things I did well as

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.340 
the lever now two things I did well as
use<00:06:26.720> one<00:06:26.870> thing<00:06:26.990> but<00:06:27.230> two<00:06:27.380> places<00:06:28.900> these<00:06:29.900> two

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
use one thing but two places these two

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.860 
use one thing but two places these two
edges<00:06:30.650> here<00:06:31.450> for<00:06:32.450> the<00:06:32.750> back<00:06:33.470> and<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:34.190> bottom

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
edges here for the back and the bottom

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.690 
edges here for the back and the bottom
there's<00:06:35.870> the<00:06:36.710> leather<00:06:36.890> actually<00:06:37.190> comes<00:06:37.370> here

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
there's the leather actually comes here

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.020 
there's the leather actually comes here
and<00:06:37.820> in<00:06:38.810> the<00:06:38.990> end<00:06:39.110> I'll<00:06:39.260> fold<00:06:39.530> it<00:06:39.680> over<00:06:40.030> for

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
and in the end I'll fold it over for

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.300 
and in the end I'll fold it over for
both<00:06:41.180> these<00:06:41.450> but<00:06:42.170> if<00:06:42.290> fold<00:06:42.590> it<00:06:42.710> over<00:06:42.800> and<00:06:43.070> this

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
both these but if fold it over and this

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.520 
both these but if fold it over and this
is<00:06:43.430> all<00:06:43.520> flush<00:06:43.850> then<00:06:44.690> the<00:06:44.900> leather<00:06:45.110> because<00:06:45.380> of

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
is all flush then the leather because of

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.750 
is all flush then the leather because of
the<00:06:45.680> thickness<00:06:45.830> of<00:06:46.010> the<00:06:46.130> leather<00:06:46.220> it<00:06:46.610> will

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
the thickness of the leather it will

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.390 
the thickness of the leather it will
kind<00:06:47.000> of<00:06:47.090> stick<00:06:47.360> out<00:06:47.480> above<00:06:47.870> this<00:06:48.080> edge<00:06:48.350> and<00:06:49.190> it

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
kind of stick out above this edge and it

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.920 
kind of stick out above this edge and it
will<00:06:49.490> look<00:06:49.610> kind<00:06:49.820> of<00:06:49.880> ugly<00:06:50.000> so<00:06:50.480> what<00:06:50.630> I've<00:06:50.750> done

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
will look kind of ugly so what I've done

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:58.960 
will look kind of ugly so what I've done
was<00:06:51.680> I've<00:06:52.480> kind<00:06:53.480> of<00:06:53.740> cut<00:06:54.740> or<00:06:55.370> filed<00:06:55.760> a<00:06:57.940> sort<00:06:58.940> of

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
was I've kind of cut or filed a sort of

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.690 
was I've kind of cut or filed a sort of
recess<00:06:59.390> along<00:07:00.200> this<00:07:00.380> edge<00:07:00.680> and<00:07:00.890> this<00:07:01.610> edge<00:07:02.350> and

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
recess along this edge and this edge and

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.900 
recess along this edge and this edge and
I'll<00:07:04.700> give<00:07:04.910> you<00:07:05.030> a<00:07:05.060> close-up<00:07:05.660> so<00:07:06.580> you<00:07:07.580> can<00:07:07.700> see

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
I'll give you a close-up so you can see

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.690 
I'll give you a close-up so you can see
there<00:07:08.360> I've<00:07:08.720> instead<00:07:09.530> of<00:07:09.590> having<00:07:10.040> this<00:07:10.400> edge

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
there I've instead of having this edge

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.650 
there I've instead of having this edge
flush<00:07:11.260> I've<00:07:12.260> filed<00:07:13.010> a<00:07:13.400> little<00:07:13.820> reset<00:07:14.150> here<00:07:14.360> the

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:14.660 
flush I've filed a little reset here the

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.150 
flush I've filed a little reset here the
thickness<00:07:15.140> of<00:07:15.410> the<00:07:15.470> leather<00:07:15.590> so<00:07:15.770> it<00:07:16.010> could

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 
thickness of the leather so it could

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.660 
thickness of the leather so it could
wrap<00:07:16.340> around<00:07:16.670> and<00:07:17.050> be<00:07:18.050> flush<00:07:18.350> with<00:07:18.920> this<00:07:19.220> door

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.670 
wrap around and be flush with this door

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.230 
wrap around and be flush with this door
and<00:07:20.000> I've<00:07:20.660> done<00:07:20.840> it<00:07:20.960> to<00:07:21.110> this<00:07:21.260> edge<00:07:21.470> and<00:07:22.240> you

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
and I've done it to this edge and you

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.140 
and I've done it to this edge and you
can<00:07:23.330> see<00:07:23.540> here<00:07:23.780> as<00:07:23.840> well<00:07:24.020> a<00:07:24.050> flush<00:07:24.820> fold<00:07:25.820> little

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
can see here as well a flush fold little

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.040 
can see here as well a flush fold little
much<00:07:26.890> yeah<00:07:27.890> it's<00:07:28.850> just<00:07:29.000> for<00:07:29.210> the<00:07:29.300> leather<00:07:29.750> to

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
much yeah it's just for the leather to

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.010 
much yeah it's just for the leather to
sit<00:07:30.260> in<00:07:30.470> nicely
