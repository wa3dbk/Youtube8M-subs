00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:24.010
 yes 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:27.310
 and we are going to prepare a black pudding 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.610
 of burgos with an onion base 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 caramelized touches of orange 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.230
 orange hull 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.710
 We finish with a sauce 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.470
 Piquillo pepper every 10 minutes 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.080
 It's wrong because 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.600
 we do not have where a guild brand because 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.050
 It is all well and is very well 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.300
 ingredients for the onion to the meditated 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.430
 brown sugar a little salt maldon or 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.640
 salt flake because salt unless the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.340
 standard onion salt 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.940
 and orange peel to create a cap 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.239
 fresh and pleasant citrus 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.580
 all this is reduced 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.950
 logically with a wine but if not every 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.530
 three months or so on we usually 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.180
 change the letter and add new things 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.650
 that we are some that already the people that 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.229
 it's a little bit of content increase the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.930
 sociability and then have use by 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.659
 example the cat the fried egg with thor 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.999
 sausage 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.730
 with sautÃ©ed ham that has a rich and 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:30.960
 a variety of things to do 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.560
 for piquillo sauce 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.000
 we will use 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.000
 a little garlic rolled 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.290
 Piquillo pepper with its natural juice 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.280
 olive oil 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.420
 and a little cream 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.400
 the mythical modern kitchen and kitchen 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.990
 traditional because he likes it a lot 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.900
 innovate he likes his plans very much 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.570
 come out colorful that people like 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.170
 how the issue of making the onion came up 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.540
 is to cut it into rings that have more or 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.959
 minus one millimeter deep once 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.239
 we have the onion we put a pan and 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.430
 we add oil and leave it for 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.680
 five or ten minutes with the oil to 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.680
 medium temperature we always add 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.410
 a few teaspoons of brown sugar 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.930
 I put a little bit of very finite orange 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.450
 this is to give it one more point 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.040
 cool 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.910
 then to nothing at two minutes in 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.120
 how much are they 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.900
 the fine cascarita costs 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.900
 I know the key 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.390
 he came and now it's already turned 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.760
 until it reduces by about 10 minutes 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.739
 we would stay like this very well cooks very 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.170
 well very good for piquillo sauce 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.209
 laminar the garlic prepared a pan 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.909
 for center and cough is put pepper with 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.030
 all your juice we let that for 5 or 10 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.620
 minutes the juices of peppers leave 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.200
 evaporating and when they are evaporated 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.460
 we take out and what we would do is put it 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.840
 here 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.840
 pour the liquid cream 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.800
 and olive oil is very easy I have a 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.450
 money room has a very very contrast 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.450
 very good and then the community helps 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.430
 let's continue preparing the dish 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.380
 blood sausage and we are going to take a blood sausage 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.170
 authentic burgos of burgos we removed 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.020
 the parts the first gut and we do it 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.880
 about 5 centimeters to about 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.800
 this while we make bread what 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.470
 let's just put on the plate 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.460
 without oil or anything and to mount the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.980
 put dish 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.040
 a little bit of pepper here a tad 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.650
 a few drops of olive oil we take out 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.530
 our bread and it is already crispy 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.110
 we ride here we put a little bit of 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.680
 caramelized onion on top 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.530
 finally we put laborcilla and we return 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.470
 that the piquillo sauce we put a 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.040
 always he gave little above a touch 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.040
 of decoration 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.020
 Here is your blood sausage lid 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.520

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.520
 piquillo pepper sauce 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.730
 very good they have 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.280
 the dressing room jewel that is characterized with 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.050
 a flavor as well as mandarins and 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.050
 very good palate background 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.230
