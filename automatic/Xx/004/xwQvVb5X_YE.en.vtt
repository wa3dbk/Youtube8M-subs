waiting to do a review this
for<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> while<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.490> seems<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
for a while because it seems that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.210 
for a while because it seems that
absolutely<00:01:36.510> nobody<00:01:36.780> remembers<00:01:37.410> it's<00:01:38.100> not

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
absolutely nobody remembers it's not

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.620 
absolutely nobody remembers it's not
because<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.610> bad<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:39.030> anything<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.450> actually

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
because it's bad or anything is actually

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.750 
because it's bad or anything is actually
pretty<00:01:40.020> good<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.580> so

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
pretty good it's just that it was so

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.790 
pretty good it's just that it was so
short-lived<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.540> only<00:01:42.720> two<00:01:42.990> seasons<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
short-lived with only two seasons I

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.560 
short-lived with only two seasons I
personally<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.640> that's<00:01:44.850> unfair

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
personally think that's unfair

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.660 
personally think that's unfair
it<00:01:45.660> could<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.930> lasted<00:01:46.260> longer<00:01:46.620> but<00:01:47.220> compared

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it could have lasted longer but compared
