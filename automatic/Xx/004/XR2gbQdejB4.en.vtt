00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470
 every day all this is 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.910
 the only launcher that works kn 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.109
 launcher 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.939
 meanwhile the other for example 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.520
 simply a little because it is very serene 9 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.140
 with the old seat 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.570

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.940
 and I have two users two people I don't know 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 because apocalypse its own 37 10 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.429
 put this on and if you want you can 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.490

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.759
 once chosen one of the users click on 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.159
 play and there will be this thing 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.020

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.500
 harshly the smaller car 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.069

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:55.869
 they saw that I await 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:59.290
 ok then and make this beautiful book file 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.450
 copy and one of these profiles will be 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.150
 we believe these at the beginning and therefore 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.200
 now this will be fine take on edit 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.539
