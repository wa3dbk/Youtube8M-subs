00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
ah well there's a nice little clue so if

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.570 
ah well there's a nice little clue so if
the<00:00:38.660> answers<00:00:39.110> aren't<00:00:39.260> on<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.530> outside<00:00:40.129> they

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
the answers aren't on the outside they

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.950 
the answers aren't on the outside they
must<00:00:40.820> be<00:00:41.000> under<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:41.570> skin<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:43.550> aluminium
