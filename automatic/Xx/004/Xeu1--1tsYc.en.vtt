00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
quest so I really love this so I think

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.329 
quest so I really love this so I think
that<00:06:12.409> was<00:06:12.949> the<00:06:13.399> most<00:06:13.789> part<00:06:14.149> i'm<00:06:14.449> using<00:06:15.020> i<00:06:15.339> think

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:16.339 
that was the most part i'm using i think

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:23.079 
that was the most part i'm using i think
i<00:06:16.490> will<00:06:16.699> do<00:06:16.939> another<00:06:17.419> video<00:06:18.430> I<00:06:19.430> sing<00:06:21.759> next<00:06:22.759> week

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.089 
i will do another video I sing next week

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.490 
i will do another video I sing next week
or<00:06:23.389> in<00:06:23.839> two<00:06:24.439> weeks<00:06:24.710> or<00:06:24.919> so<00:06:25.250> about<00:06:25.639> my<00:06:26.000> pvp<00:06:26.959> add

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
or in two weeks or so about my pvp add

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.249 
or in two weeks or so about my pvp add
on<00:06:27.680> some<00:06:27.919> using<00:06:28.459> or<00:06:28.639> modifications<00:06:29.539> i'm<00:06:29.719> using

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
on some using or modifications i'm using

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:30.999 
on some using or modifications i'm using
and<00:06:30.409> all

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
and all

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.149 
and all
eventually<00:06:31.669> some<00:06:31.939> macros<00:06:32.479> macros<00:06:32.719> stuff<00:06:33.499> so

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
eventually some macros macros stuff so

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.409 
eventually some macros macros stuff so
this<00:06:34.879> would<00:06:35.150> would<00:06:35.689> be<00:06:35.869> a<00:06:35.949> separate<00:06:36.949> video<00:06:37.419> so

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
this would would be a separate video so

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.629 
this would would be a separate video so
I<00:06:38.749> guess<00:06:39.529> this<00:06:40.520> was<00:06:40.759> just<00:06:41.089> a<00:06:41.300> quick<00:06:41.869> overview

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
I guess this was just a quick overview

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.689 
I guess this was just a quick overview
which<00:06:43.639> stuff<00:06:44.119> i'm<00:06:44.419> using<00:06:44.779> and<00:06:45.529> because<00:06:46.249> a<00:06:46.279> lot
