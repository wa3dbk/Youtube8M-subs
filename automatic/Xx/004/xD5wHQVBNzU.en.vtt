00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.570
 I have this form here on the screen 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.979
 of background components I bought it for 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.069
 that there are not many problems with price 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.280
 and what else is going to look a little bad 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:49.530
 environment with the theme of the screen 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.229

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.320
 They changed it 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:07.710

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.380
 and little more than ran has 8 GB are the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.160
 The frog's brand is skiing 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.050

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.510
 Sacyr is going pretty well and test game

 as meter reduces to 1080 and also alan 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.430
 white and he shoots me perfectly without 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.910
 searched and without anything good then the keyboard 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.080
 here you have it is a keyboard that 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.730
 I bought together with the mouse just 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.280
 you can activate the lighting 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.300
 Disable the mouse or mouse the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.850
 normal lighting 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.850
 for the ozone mouse pad 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.290
 I 'm not serious forgive 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.659
 steel series 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.090
 the large square size of large 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.879
 then it has 4 millimeters that has 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.680
 pretty fluffy shelf so 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.000
 say it does not bother anything and good latorre 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.790
 as I said before they left a couple of 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.890
 Photos 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.620
 so you can see the inside and what 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.290
 accessory and also that depp this 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.599
 component came very well bundled with their 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.250
 original booths and everything to put a 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.140
 example the processor card the 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.520
 I have here 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.520
 it comes in case there is a problem 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.530
 well this process also say that 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.150
 pull back with 8 and in turbo 4 with 10 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.240
 fairly good 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.650
 with the good result the skulls of 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.200
 the death that I have also and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.770
 and good also means to calculate 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.970
 in microphones and headphones with which he recorded 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.080
 they are one more 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:03.530
 some also from the triton brand today 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.580
 are very good I love them more than 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.260
 nothing also because it looks for the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:13.290
 playstation3 that are four and inhabit it 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.400
 and well you can and you do not want engraving 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.690
 has the 3.5 this to listen to music and 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.040
 to record if you have to plugged in 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.670
 this 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.670
 stain 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.290
 plug in to pc 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.910
 true 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.700
 announced with the interior 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.110
 meaning why 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.110
 it looks better 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.370
 practically perfect 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.660
 and well the screen say that at a 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.150
 samsung full hd 29 inches but good 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.280
 I also use it as a television 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.100
 and nothing more to the router I have 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.729
 plugged in via the cord 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.949
 also but good 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.330
 but it would fit without making the most of a 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.129
 Internet 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.530
