question which comes in from two people

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
question which comes in from two people
asking<00:01:25.049> similar<00:01:25.290> things<00:01:25.619> which<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.070> how<00:01:26.430> many

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
asking similar things which is how many

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.370 
asking similar things which is how many
new<00:01:26.700> biomes<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.210> coming<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.229> any

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
new biomes are coming and are there any

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.560 
new biomes are coming and are there any
new<00:01:28.470> biomes<00:01:28.799> coming<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.820> which<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.270> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
new biomes coming and if so which one so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.830 
new biomes coming and if so which one so
basically<00:01:31.170> only<00:01:31.409> 360<00:01:32.159> ps3<00:01:32.460> ps4<00:01:33.030> etc<00:01:33.630> basically

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
basically only 360 ps3 ps4 etc basically

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.499 
basically only 360 ps3 ps4 etc basically
right<00:01:34.170> now<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> 23<00:01:35.610> separate<00:01:36.090> distinct

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
right now there is 23 separate distinct

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.060 
right now there is 23 separate distinct
biomes<00:01:36.810> according<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> game<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.710> think

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
biomes according to the game I think

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.920 
biomes according to the game I think
it's<00:01:38.159> 24<00:01:38.579> 25<00:01:38.939> renew<00:01:39.210> hat<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> count<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it's 24 25 renew hat if you count the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.569 
it's 24 25 renew hat if you count the
never<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> end<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.740> there's<00:01:40.890> 23<00:01:41.189> biomes

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
never in the end but there's 23 biomes

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
never in the end but there's 23 biomes
basically<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.180> they're<00:01:42.479> gonna<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.720> upping

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
basically and they're gonna be upping

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.160 
basically and they're gonna be upping
that<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.670> 61<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.450> update<00:01:45.659> that's<00:01:45.930> right

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that to 61 with this update that's right

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.429 
that to 61 with this update that's right
61<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> 1.7<00:01:48.119> update<00:01:48.540> which<00:01:48.780> means<00:01:49.079> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
61 with the 1.7 update which means that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.929 
61 with the 1.7 update which means that
they've<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> force<00:01:50.490> counts<00:01:50.790> out

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
they've you know if the force counts out

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.539 
they've you know if the force counts out
there<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.420> 38<00:01:52.140> new<00:01:52.530> distinct<00:01:53.159> separate

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
there that's 38 new distinct separate

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.760 
there that's 38 new distinct separate
biomes<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.240> absolutely<00:01:54.960> crazy

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
biomes which is absolutely crazy

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
biomes which is absolutely crazy
that's<00:01:56.130> almost<00:01:56.310> tripling<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.030> number<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
that's almost tripling the number that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.459 
that's almost tripling the number that
there<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> game<00:01:58.110> right<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
there is in the game right now and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.109 
there is in the game right now and
that's<00:01:58.860> wacky<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.490> give<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.820> vague

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that's wacky so to give you a vague

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.609 
that's wacky so to give you a vague
rundown<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.020> course<00:02:01.259> what's<00:02:01.469> these

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
rundown because of course what's these

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.139 
rundown because of course what's these
are<00:02:01.740> Teddy<00:02:01.920> Cooper<00:02:02.159> ohms<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:02.969> make

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
are Teddy Cooper ohms so like they make

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.670 
are Teddy Cooper ohms so like they make
a<00:02:03.299> birch<00:02:03.540> forest<00:02:04.020> which<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> ready

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
a birch forest which is just a ready

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.139 
a birch forest which is just a ready
forest<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.219> there's<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> birch<00:02:05.850> forest

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
forest then there's the birch forest

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.760 
forest then there's the birch forest
hills<00:02:06.450> net<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.049> know<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.290> well<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.469> just

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
hills net but you know as well as just

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.990 
hills net but you know as well as just
you<00:02:07.829> know<00:02:07.920> technical<00:02:08.399> biomes<00:02:08.700> there's<00:02:08.849> also

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you know technical biomes there's also

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.729 
you know technical biomes there's also
loads<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.569> cool<00:02:09.780> new<00:02:09.989> ones<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.410> there's<00:02:10.590> ice

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
loads of cool new ones so there's ice

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.650 
loads of cool new ones so there's ice
plane<00:02:11.039> spikes<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.090> ice<00:02:12.270> biomes

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
plane spikes which is just ice biomes

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.880 
plane spikes which is just ice biomes
but<00:02:12.900> covered<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.349> spike

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
but covered in spike

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.680 
but covered in spike
made<00:02:14.100> out<00:02:14.220> packed<00:02:14.550> ice<00:02:14.760> which<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.180> absolutely

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
made out packed ice which is absolutely

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.480 
made out packed ice which is absolutely
crazy<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.560> at<00:02:16.740> there's<00:02:17.100> also<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
crazy to look at there's also the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.100 
crazy to look at there's also the
savanna<00:02:17.850> biome<00:02:18.120> which<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.780> cross

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
savanna biome which is like a cross

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530 
savanna biome which is like a cross
between<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.830> desert<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.450> know

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
between the desert and the you know

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.120 
between the desert and the you know
plains<00:02:21.810> by<00:02:21.959> I'm<00:02:22.050> essentially<00:02:22.470> where<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.010> get

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
plains by I'm essentially where you get

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
plains by I'm essentially where you get
one<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> brand-new<00:02:23.730> trees<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.300> kaya<00:02:24.630> tree

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
one of the brand-new trees the kaya tree

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900 
one of the brand-new trees the kaya tree
I<00:02:24.959> believe<00:02:25.290> there's<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.100> roof<00:02:26.340> forest<00:02:26.700> where

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
I believe there's the roof forest where

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.880 
I believe there's the roof forest where
you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.240> get<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.569> dark<00:02:27.900> oak<00:02:28.140> tree<00:02:28.440> again<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
you can get the dark oak tree again a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.680 
you can get the dark oak tree again a
really<00:02:29.250> crazy<00:02:29.459> want<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.300> it's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
really crazy want to go in because it's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.810 
really crazy want to go in because it's
so<00:02:30.959> dark<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> roof<00:02:31.860> forest<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.430> most<00:02:32.640> will

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
so dark in the roof forest and most will

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.090 
so dark in the roof forest and most will
spawn<00:02:33.090> even<00:02:33.330> during<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> daytime<00:02:34.140> there's

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
spawn even during the daytime there's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.010 
spawn even during the daytime there's
also<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.430> mega<00:02:35.640> taiga<00:02:35.940> biome<00:02:36.180> which<00:02:36.630> has<00:02:36.840> like

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
also the mega taiga biome which has like

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.690 
also the mega taiga biome which has like
a<00:02:37.080> cross<00:02:37.380> between<00:02:37.410> spruce<00:02:38.070> trees<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.430> jungle

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
a cross between spruce trees and jungle

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.910 
a cross between spruce trees and jungle
trees<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.120> super<00:02:39.660> fix<00:02:39.900> Bruce<00:02:40.140> trees<00:02:40.410> as<00:02:40.620> well

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
course some of those biomes will have to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.610 
course some of those biomes will have to
be<00:02:56.820> slightly<00:02:57.330> tweaked<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> consoles<00:02:58.260> but

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620

update which is kind of just for you if
you<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.360> about<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.140> moving<00:03:13.590> on<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
you think about it so moving on to the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.949 
you think about it so moving on to the
next<00:03:14.040> question<00:03:14.280> which<00:03:14.580> comes<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.209> from<00:03:15.450> Joseph

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
next question which comes in from Joseph

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.199 
next question which comes in from Joseph
Hahn<00:03:16.200> who<00:03:16.650> asks<00:03:17.100> why<00:03:17.340> Kat<00:03:17.550> do<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.850> think<00:03:18.090> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
Hahn who asks why Kat do you think the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.870 
Hahn who asks why Kat do you think the
next<00:03:18.450> feature<00:03:18.630> update<00:03:18.959> will<00:03:19.079> be<00:03:19.200> 1.7<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:19.920> 1.8

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
next feature update will be 1.7 and 1.8

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.180 
next feature update will be 1.7 and 1.8
so<00:03:21.239> right<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:22.380> think<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.709> next<00:03:22.950> feature

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
so right now we think the next feature

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.220 
so right now we think the next feature
update<00:03:23.489> will<00:03:23.640> definitely<00:03:24.239> include<00:03:24.480> 1.7

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
update will definitely include 1.7

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.720 
update will definitely include 1.7
because<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.680> next<00:03:25.799> logical<00:03:26.070> place<00:03:26.400> from

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
because it's the next logical place from

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.030 
because it's the next logical place from
1.6<00:03:27.090> however<00:03:27.840> right<00:03:28.230> now<00:03:28.260> log<00:03:28.739> people<00:03:28.980> are

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
1.6 however right now log people are

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.740 
1.6 however right now log people are
torn<00:03:29.280> on<00:03:29.370> whether<00:03:29.400> it's<00:03:29.640> gonna<00:03:29.730> be<00:03:29.910> 1.7<00:03:30.600> and

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
torn on whether it's gonna be 1.7 and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.860 
torn on whether it's gonna be 1.7 and
1.8<00:03:31.320> or<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:31.769> 1.7<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.670> right<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.660> going

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
1.8 or just 1.7 so right now I'm going

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.990 
1.8 or just 1.7 so right now I'm going
under<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.170> pretense<00:03:34.530> that's<00:03:34.799> just<00:03:35.280> 1.7

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
under the pretense that's just 1.7

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.250 
under the pretense that's just 1.7
because<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.420> know<00:03:36.510> we<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.049> guarantee

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
because you know we can guarantee

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.350 
because you know we can guarantee
everything<00:03:37.799> from<00:03:37.980> 1.7<00:03:38.459> will<00:03:38.549> be<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.760> there<00:03:38.970> but

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
everything from 1.7 will be in there but

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.569 
everything from 1.7 will be in there but
the<00:03:39.600> thing<00:03:39.810> about<00:03:39.840> 1.8<00:03:40.769> also<00:03:41.160> known<00:03:41.340> as<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
the thing about 1.8 also known as the

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.370 
the thing about 1.8 also known as the
bountiful<00:03:41.970> update<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.019> was<00:03:43.140> one<00:03:43.290> of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
bountiful update is that it was one of

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.110 
bountiful update is that it was one of
the<00:03:43.470> biggest<00:03:43.709> updates<00:03:44.190> for<00:03:44.310> minecraft<00:03:44.730> PC

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
the biggest updates for minecraft PC

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.910 
the biggest updates for minecraft PC
ever<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.660> although<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.470> no<00:03:46.620> doubt<00:03:46.799> they

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
ever and although I have no doubt they

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.410 
ever and although I have no doubt they
could<00:03:46.980> slowly<00:03:47.489> get<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.790> all<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:48.030> there<00:03:48.150> there's

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
could slowly get it all in there there's

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.900 
could slowly get it all in there there's
a<00:03:48.510> lot<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.840> big<00:03:49.200> changes<00:03:49.739> in<00:03:49.920> that<00:03:50.130> update<00:03:50.489> that

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
a lot of big changes in that update that

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.520 
a lot of big changes in that update that
I<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.360> they<00:03:51.570> might<00:03:51.720> want<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:51.959> phase<00:03:52.170> out<00:03:52.350> so

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
I think they might want to phase out so

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410 
I think they might want to phase out so
I<00:03:52.590> think<00:03:52.650> with<00:03:53.010> 1.7<00:03:53.640> we'll<00:03:53.880> probably<00:03:54.150> get<00:03:54.360> some

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
I think with 1.7 we'll probably get some

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.199 
I think with 1.7 we'll probably get some
off<00:03:55.290> one<00:03:55.500> point<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.829> but<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.340> think<00:03:56.610> because<00:03:56.910> it's

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
off one point a but I think because it's

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.430 
off one point a but I think because it's
such<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.390> big<00:03:57.570> update<00:03:57.720> we're<00:03:58.079> gonna<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.350> to

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
such a big update we're gonna have to

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.170 
such a big update we're gonna have to
wait<00:03:58.680> quite<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.010> bit<00:03:59.280> which<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.579> don't<00:03:59.640> think<00:03:59.910> is

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
wait quite a bit which I don't think is

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.220 
wait quite a bit which I don't think is
ideal<00:04:00.540> for<00:04:00.570> foresters

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
ideal for foresters

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.410 
ideal for foresters
or<00:04:01.500> will<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.070> get<00:04:02.160> 1.7<00:04:02.670> first<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.180> then

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
or will just get 1.7 first and then

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.490 
or will just get 1.7 first and then
they'll<00:04:03.600> start<00:04:03.840> working<00:04:03.930> one<00:04:04.230> point<00:04:04.410> hey

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
they'll start working one point hey

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.440 
they'll start working one point hey
that's<00:04:04.769> how<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.040> see<00:04:05.430> things<00:04:05.459> going<00:04:05.910> right<00:04:06.239> now

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
that's how I see things going right now

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.420 
that's how I see things going right now
but<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.200> know<00:04:07.320> we<00:04:07.530> don't<00:04:07.650> have<00:04:07.829> anything<00:04:08.010> set

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
but you know we don't have anything set

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.520 
but you know we don't have anything set
in<00:04:08.459> stone<00:04:08.760> that's<00:04:09.060> my<00:04:09.360> opinion<00:04:09.600> with<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
in stone that's my opinion with the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.900 
in stone that's my opinion with the
information<00:04:10.920> we<00:04:10.980> have<00:04:11.100> right<00:04:11.130> now<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:11.730> course

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
information we have right now of course

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.280 
information we have right now of course
full<00:04:12.150> justice<00:04:12.420> would<00:04:12.630> come<00:04:12.750> out<00:04:12.840> tomorrow<00:04:13.170> and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
full justice would come out tomorrow and

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.190 
full justice would come out tomorrow and
say<00:04:13.440> 1.7<00:04:14.100> 1.8<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.700> 1.9<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.810> unreleased

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
say 1.7 1.8 and 1.9 the unreleased

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.170 
say 1.7 1.8 and 1.9 the unreleased
update<00:04:16.560> that's<00:04:17.430> what<00:04:17.609> I'd<00:04:17.700> like<00:04:17.729> to<00:04:17.910> see<00:04:18.090> of

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
update that's what I'd like to see of

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.000 
update that's what I'd like to see of
course<00:04:18.329> but<00:04:18.840> personally<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.500> think<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.799> next

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
course but personally I think the next

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.500 
course but personally I think the next
update<00:04:20.160> will<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.789> 1.7

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
update will be just 1.7

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.570 
update will be just 1.7
with<00:04:21.780> some<00:04:22.109> 1.8<00:04:22.680> features<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.280> like<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
with some 1.8 features so like the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.040 
with some 1.8 features so like the
rabbits<00:04:23.940> maybe<00:04:24.180> an<00:04:24.330> end<00:04:24.479> of<00:04:24.599> mites<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.870> stuff

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
rabbits maybe an end of mites and stuff

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.779 
rabbits maybe an end of mites and stuff
like<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.410> that's<00:04:25.830> what<00:04:25.979> I<00:04:26.070> think<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.490> let's

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
like that that's what I think and let's

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.680 
like that that's what I think and let's
move<00:04:26.940> on<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.360> neck

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
move on to the neck

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.650 
move on to the neck
question<00:04:28.320> which<00:04:28.560> comes<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.280> from<00:04:29.880> Alex<00:04:30.330> Scott

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
question which comes in from Alex Scott

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.270 
question which comes in from Alex Scott
who<00:04:30.810> asks<00:04:31.170> do<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.320> think<00:04:31.470> we'll<00:04:31.710> get<00:04:31.920> stained

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
who asks do you think we'll get stained

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.920 
who asks do you think we'll get stained
glass<00:04:32.640> or<00:04:32.880> commandblocks

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
glass or commandblocks

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.900 
glass or commandblocks
so<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.290> think<00:04:34.530> we'll<00:04:34.980> get<00:04:35.220> stained<00:04:35.640> glass

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
so I think we'll get stained glass

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.090 
so I think we'll get stained glass
that's<00:04:36.210> almost<00:04:36.870> 100%<00:04:37.290> guaranteed<00:04:37.770> because<00:04:37.920> it

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
that's almost 100% guaranteed because it

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.190 
that's almost 100% guaranteed because it
said<00:04:38.250> 1.7<00:04:38.790> feature<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.240> it's<00:04:39.810> sitting<00:04:40.170> right

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
said 1.7 feature and it's sitting right

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.060 
said 1.7 feature and it's sitting right
in<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.500> game<00:04:40.710> right<00:04:40.860> now

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
in the game right now

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.460 
in the game right now
but<00:04:42.060> come<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.360> blocks<00:04:42.630> they've<00:04:43.050> been<00:04:43.230> sitting

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
but come on blocks they've been sitting

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.200 
but come on blocks they've been sitting
there<00:04:43.560> for<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.860> while<00:04:43.920> but<00:04:44.340> they're<00:04:44.550> still<00:04:45.030> not

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
there for a while but they're still not

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.570 
there for a while but they're still not
entirely<00:04:45.540> working<00:04:46.020> so<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.260> think<00:04:46.320> maybe<00:04:47.220> what

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
entirely working so I think maybe what

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.980 
entirely working so I think maybe what
they're<00:04:47.760> gonna<00:04:47.850> do<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.300> save<00:04:48.600> them<00:04:48.840> until

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
they're gonna do is save them until

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.900 
they're gonna do is save them until
realms<00:04:49.470> comes<00:04:49.710> out<00:04:49.890> because<00:04:50.070> without<00:04:50.730> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
realms comes out because without the

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.490 
realms comes out because without the
ability<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.210> share<00:04:51.480> worlds<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:51.990> don't<00:04:52.230> really

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
ability to share worlds you don't really

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.100 
ability to share worlds you don't really
need<00:04:52.920> command<00:04:53.700> blocks<00:04:53.970> like<00:04:54.330> they're<00:04:54.870> nice

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
need command blocks like they're nice

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.990 
need command blocks like they're nice
but<00:04:55.530> if<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:55.740> have<00:04:55.860> friends<00:04:56.130> coming<00:04:56.280> over<00:04:56.430> but

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
but if you have friends coming over but

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.490 
but if you have friends coming over but
really<00:04:57.360> there's<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.600> lot<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.840> stuff<00:04:58.020> of<00:04:58.170> command

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
really there's a lot of stuff of command

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.350 
really there's a lot of stuff of command
blocks<00:04:58.680> isn't<00:04:59.190> necessary<00:04:59.790> if<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.210> other

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
blocks isn't necessary if the other

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.330 
blocks isn't necessary if the other
people<00:05:00.630> can't<00:05:00.780> use<00:05:00.840> your<00:05:01.020> world<00:05:01.230> so<00:05:01.500> that's<00:05:01.920> my

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
people can't use your world so that's my

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.560 
people can't use your world so that's my
kind<00:05:02.730> of<00:05:02.820> vague<00:05:02.970> opinion<00:05:03.360> on<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:03.540> whole

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
kind of vague opinion on the whole

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.900 
kind of vague opinion on the whole
ordeal<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.290> think<00:05:05.220> command<00:05:05.490> blocks<00:05:05.670> will<00:05:05.820> be

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
ordeal I think command blocks will be

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.030 
ordeal I think command blocks will be
just<00:05:06.120> coming<00:05:06.390> with<00:05:06.870> realms<00:05:07.350> or<00:05:07.530> just<00:05:07.860> some

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
just coming with realms or just some

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.590 
just coming with realms or just some
point<00:05:08.250> after<00:05:08.370> realms<00:05:08.850> it's<00:05:09.030> kind<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.390> shame

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
point after realms it's kind of a shame

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.240 
point after realms it's kind of a shame
that<00:05:09.810> it's<00:05:09.960> working<00:05:10.170> that<00:05:10.440> way<00:05:10.590> but<00:05:10.860> their

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
that it's working that way but their

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.530 
that it's working that way but their
justice<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.730> that<00:05:11.880> seems<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.180> be<00:05:12.240> how<00:05:12.390> it's

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
justice it that seems to be how it's

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.330 
justice it that seems to be how it's
looking<00:05:12.780> right<00:05:12.990> now<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:13.470> yeah<00:05:13.950> stained<00:05:14.310> glass

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
looking right now so yeah stained glass

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.430 
looking right now so yeah stained glass
definitely<00:05:14.970> command<00:05:15.330> blocks<00:05:15.570> not<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.080> Garrity

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
definitely command blocks not so Garrity

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.710 
definitely command blocks not so Garrity
next<00:05:17.100> question<00:05:17.370> comes<00:05:17.550> in<00:05:17.670> from<00:05:17.820> cyber<00:05:18.180> gaming
