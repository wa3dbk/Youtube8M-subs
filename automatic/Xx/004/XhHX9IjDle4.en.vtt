00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.859
 fat ps bolides a really nice one 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.080
 graphic crashing engine sound and a 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.389
 motivating single player forza 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.700
 Motorsport 5 is supposed to be the game for 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.340
 Microsoft's new console the Xbox One 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.780
 be over 200 cars of 50 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.590
 various manufacturers are available 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.780
 selection ready 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.150
 that sounds like a lot but that 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.870
 predecessor was still with 500 cars 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.790
 delivered 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.920
 also in the route selection you have to 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.310
 you are satisfied with less at part 5 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.860
 give 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.010
 There are only 14 different scenarios 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.870
 four less than the predecessor of the thin one 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.030
 Scope is mainly with the fact too 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.550
 justify a government title before five 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.530
 the new xbox one had to be there 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 less time in development 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.430
 but you do not notice that in the scope but not 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.770
 if you are on the race course around the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 poleposition drives forsa 5 runs 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.270
 buttery soft in a really pretty 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 full hd graphics the cars are watching in 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.050
 the cockpit view class and the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 brute motor sounds pulls you 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.040
 a right in the race happen 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.049
 Forsa has always had a great time 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.190
 feeling and it also changes in 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.110
 Part 5 nothing 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.300
 the cars manage well the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.400
 overtaking maneuvers are exciting and the ki 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.200
 plays really well with that is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.630
 all synonymous because that the computer opponents 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.040
 Analyze your behavior and yourself 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.110
 to suit your driving style 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.060
 about the complete career in her 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.710
 Slowly fight your way up in leagues 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.690
 So you have to have yours again and again 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.010
 Re-adapt attacks to race 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.229
 really win 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.549
 next to the entertaining single player 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.740
 Of course there is one again 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.570
 online multiplayer offers the though 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.530
 Known racing modes and power too 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.990
 basically fun 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.840
 a real wow effect we had 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.760
 but not Explorer 5 is basically 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 a pretty racing game with a great 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.360
 but feel a comparatively 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.760
 rather thin circumference 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.409
 surely microsoft will be there for some more 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.510
 hand over new cars and stretch 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.110
 but not without money too 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.180
 desire 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.369
 who wants to buy an xbox one and 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.250
 racing games like that should but still 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.409
 But access especially for researchers 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.319
 Buy the console five 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.420
 no no not really for that 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.700
 and remains relative to five except one 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.009
 normal racing game is the driving experience 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.500
 great but quite honest that had 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.420
 in forza 4 already so what with that 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.459
 the graphic is really convincing 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.940
 But there is less in the way 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.940
 scope
