use<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.710> important<00:01:56.189> okay<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> have

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
use which is important okay now you have

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.940 
use which is important okay now you have
this<00:01:57.630> case<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.439> need<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> put<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:58.890> in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this case here you need to put it in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.120 
this case here you need to put it in
this<00:01:59.039> case<00:01:59.280> first<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.320> decided<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.859> kind

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this case first I decided not to do kind

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
this case first I decided not to do kind
of<00:02:02.159> an<00:02:02.280> unboxing<00:02:02.609> video<00:02:02.999> even<00:02:03.509> though<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> have

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
of an unboxing video even though I have

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
of an unboxing video even though I have
everything<00:02:04.109> just<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.130> I'd<00:02:05.219> seen<00:02:05.429> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
everything just because I'd seen a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.700 
everything just because I'd seen a
couple<00:02:05.789> other<00:02:05.880> unboxing<00:02:06.359> videos<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.469> knew

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
couple other unboxing videos and I knew

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.660 
couple other unboxing videos and I knew
I<00:02:07.740> wasn't<00:02:07.979> gonna<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.190> able<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> figure<00:02:08.580> this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
I wasn't gonna be able to figure this

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.240 
I wasn't gonna be able to figure this
out<00:02:08.819> first<00:02:09.119> time<00:02:09.300> go<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> decided<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> go

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
out first time go so I decided not to go

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.369 
out first time go so I decided not to go
that<00:02:11.400> route<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> simply<00:02:12.360> place<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.959> into

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
that route so you simply place this into

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.580 
that route so you simply place this into
this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.470 
this
fourth<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> case<00:02:14.190> right<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.819> what<00:02:15.390> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
fourth of the case right now and what it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.300 
fourth of the case right now and what it
does<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.470> essentially<00:02:16.800> leaves<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> back

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
does is it essentially leaves the back

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.080 
does is it essentially leaves the back
part<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> battery<00:02:19.160> exposed<00:02:20.160> but<00:02:20.819> it's<00:02:20.970> not

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
part of the battery exposed but it's not

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.920 
part of the battery exposed but it's not
really<00:02:21.360> exposed<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.930> I'll<00:02:21.989> show<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.200> why<00:02:22.410> so

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
really exposed and I'll show you why so

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.420 
really exposed and I'll show you why so
you're<00:02:24.930> gonna<00:02:25.019> put<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.410> front<00:02:25.650> piece<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.099> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
you're gonna put this front piece on and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.160 
you're gonna put this front piece on and
it's<00:02:26.640> gonna<00:02:26.760> snap<00:02:27.349> along<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.500> top<00:02:30.019> all<00:02:31.019> right

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
it's gonna snap along the top all right

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's gonna snap along the top all right
this<00:02:31.349> is<00:02:31.410> gonna<00:02:31.620> snap<00:02:31.680> along<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> top<00:02:32.450> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
this is gonna snap along the top and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.190 
this is gonna snap along the top and
along<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> bottom<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:36.510> right<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.840> we're<00:02:36.959> snap

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
along the bottom all right so we're snap

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.050 
along the bottom all right so we're snap
it<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:37.470> place<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.950> then<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.459> snaps<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:38.970> on

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
it in place and then it snaps here on

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.180 
it in place and then it snaps here on
the<00:02:39.150> sides<00:02:39.360> as<00:02:39.599> well<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:40.260> both<00:02:40.620> sides<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the sides as well on both sides and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.309 
the sides as well on both sides and
that's<00:02:41.790> gonna<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.060> crucial<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.540> when<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.170> try

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
that's gonna be crucial for when you try

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.199 
that's gonna be crucial for when you try
to<00:02:43.349> take<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.680> off<00:02:43.799> later<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.340> said<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.000> look<00:02:45.120> at

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
to take it off later I said you look at

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.819 
to take it off later I said you look at
the<00:02:45.269> top<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.780> mean<00:02:46.019> there's<00:02:46.170> plenty<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.530> space

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
the top I mean there's plenty of space

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.360 
the top I mean there's plenty of space
there<00:02:47.450> for<00:02:48.450> your<00:02:48.569> microphone<00:02:48.959> jack<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.769> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
there for your microphone jack on the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.550 
there for your microphone jack on the
side<00:02:50.720> there's<00:02:51.720> plenty<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.140> space<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:52.470> your

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
side there's plenty of space for your

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.449 
side there's plenty of space for your
buttons<00:02:52.890> which<00:02:53.010> you're<00:02:53.099> going<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.250> which<00:02:53.430> is

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
buttons which you're going to which is

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.339 
buttons which you're going to which is
going<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.700> make<00:02:53.790> sense<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.180> moment<00:02:54.569> plenty

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
going to make sense in a moment plenty

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.199 
going to make sense in a moment plenty
of<00:02:55.380> space<00:02:55.470> at<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.799> bottom<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.700> pull<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.000> flap

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
of space at the bottom to pull the flap

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.780 
of space at the bottom to pull the flap
off<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.660> charge<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:59.069> then<00:02:59.549> your<00:02:59.670> power

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
off the charge and then your power

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.580 
off the charge and then your power

button but I also want to point out too

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.160 
button but I also want to point out too
that<00:03:01.799> using<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.489> battery<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.629> lose<00:03:03.900> that

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that using this battery you lose that

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
that using this battery you lose that
ip67<00:03:04.920> certification<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.849> lose<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.269> ability

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
ip67 certification you lose that ability

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.960 
ip67 certification you lose that ability
to<00:03:08.660> essentially<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:10.470> water<00:03:10.760> resistant<00:03:11.760> and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
to essentially be water resistant and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.430 
to essentially be water resistant and
then<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.180> say<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.450> water<00:03:12.629> proof<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.140> then<00:03:13.379> you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
then I say the water proof and then you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.920 
then I say the water proof and then you
just<00:03:13.590> slide<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.920> here<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.129> this<00:03:14.220> bigger<00:03:14.430> case

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
just slide it here in this bigger case

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.979 
just slide it here in this bigger case
very<00:03:15.930> simple<00:03:16.440> very<00:03:17.069> easy<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.700> do<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.900> gonna

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
very simple very easy to do is it gonna

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.640 
very simple very easy to do is it gonna
make<00:03:19.139> your<00:03:19.319> phone<00:03:19.500> bigger<00:03:19.769> um<00:03:20.420> yeah<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:22.590> a

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
8500 milliamp hour battery so once you

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.780 
8500 milliamp hour battery so once you
get<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> done<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.250> look<00:03:26.400> all<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.700> way

get it done and you look all the way

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.599 
get it done and you look all the way
around<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> sides<00:03:27.329> then<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:27.840> sell<00:03:28.609> the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
around the sides then you can sell the

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.400 
around the sides then you can sell the
buttons<00:03:29.970> are<00:03:30.090> actually<00:03:30.239> still<00:03:30.660> very<00:03:30.690> tactile

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
buttons are actually still very tactile

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.349 
buttons are actually still very tactile
so<00:03:32.099> we're<00:03:32.340> gonna<00:03:32.430> press<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.880> hold<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.180> get<00:03:33.269> it
