00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
I wasn't first pignon if I draft so I

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.920 
I wasn't first pignon if I draft so I
ended<00:01:30.950> up<00:01:31.040> being<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.340> second<00:01:31.670> pic<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:32.540> norlin

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.980 
it was a big run and I think a lot of
people<00:01:42.259> saw<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:42.920> as<00:01:43.220> our<00:01:43.700> bright<00:01:44.240> future<00:01:44.270> as

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
people saw that as our bright future as

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.990 
people saw that as our bright future as
and<00:01:45.320> his<00:01:45.500> kids<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.009> he<00:01:46.280> didn't<00:01:46.460> do<00:01:46.520> every<00:01:46.789> game

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
and his kids and he didn't do every game

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.240 
and his kids and he didn't do every game
and<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.330> think<00:01:48.259> I<00:01:48.320> played<00:01:48.500> into<00:01:48.800> a<00:01:48.830> little<00:01:49.130> bit

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
and I think I played into a little bit

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.990 
and I think I played into a little bit
to<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.700> that's<00:01:50.149> easy<00:01:51.369> six<00:01:52.369> games<00:01:52.580> into<00:01:52.970> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
to that that's easy six games into the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.139 
to that that's easy six games into the
season<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.690> still<00:01:54.470> had<00:01:54.649> no<00:01:54.800> touchdowns<00:01:55.280> that

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
season I still had no touchdowns that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.430 
season I still had no touchdowns that
was<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.330> first<00:01:56.360> time<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:56.810> really<00:01:57.140> doubted

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
was the first time I really doubted

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.320 
was the first time I really doubted
myself<00:01:57.530> I<00:01:57.979> started<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.460> question<00:01:58.640> whether<00:01:58.940> I

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
myself I started to question whether I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.290 
myself I started to question whether I
was<00:01:59.810> cut<00:01:59.960> out<00:02:00.050> for<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.380> NFL<00:02:00.880> maybe<00:02:01.880> i<00:02:01.970> might<00:02:02.149> as

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
was cut out for the NFL maybe i might as

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.270 
was cut out for the NFL maybe i might as
good<00:02:02.479> as<00:02:02.600> i<00:02:02.660> thought<00:02:02.690> i<00:02:02.869> was<00:02:03.170> i<00:02:03.500> was<00:02:03.890> trying<00:02:04.190> to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
good as i thought i was i was trying to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.580 
good as i thought i was i was trying to
score<00:02:05.000> touchdowns<00:02:05.420> every<00:02:05.899> time<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.259> touch<00:02:06.410> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
score touchdowns every time I touch the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.830 
score touchdowns every time I touch the
ball<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:07.100> can<00:02:07.250> actually<00:02:07.460> hurt<00:02:08.149> yourself<00:02:08.600> more

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
help my team win games even though we

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.350 
help my team win games even though we
didn't<00:02:30.590> win<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.100> NFC<00:02:31.400> Championship<00:02:31.940> game<00:02:32.120> and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.310 
even though we didn't get to Super Bowl
I<00:02:33.799> think<00:02:34.519> that<00:02:34.790> still<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.600> were<00:02:35.690> able<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.019> have

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
I think that still we were able to have

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.440 
I think that still we were able to have

lift a lot of spirits in life down in
the<00:02:38.630> world<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.140> for<00:02:39.709> us<00:02:39.860> that's<00:02:40.220> bigger<00:02:40.549> than

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
the world and for us that's bigger than

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.080

it came from just being patient through

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.540 
it came from just being patient through
just<00:02:47.060> one<00:02:47.180> word<00:02:47.330> patience<00:02:48.099> New<00:02:49.099> Orleans<00:02:49.430> is

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
going to take a while before it comes

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.970 
going to take a while before it comes
back<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.640> would<00:02:52.760> be<00:02:52.849> impossible<00:02:52.970> for<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.769> city
