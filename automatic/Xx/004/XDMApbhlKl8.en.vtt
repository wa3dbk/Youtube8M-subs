00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.990
 Sasha's question in general match turned out such 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.990
 bright and second time big wins up 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.990
 very 45th so that will say take shape 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.710
 played for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.300
 before it happened well played 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.619
 beat somewhere lucky beauty break 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.700
 dig for hide and seek. your partner four 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.840
 goals scored 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.160
 viktor played but I think it is his 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.220
 the game is actually a game on the penny 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.820
 0 4 I think that everyone showed 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.539
 always sincerely then today they are in it 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.039
 there were some saved all this life 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.309
 God forbid that everything is the same 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.890
 happened to continue to work watched 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.070
 nobody turned out very coast I drive on 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.679
 I saw you on sight 5 points 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.629
 quite kind of married was the whole site record 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.730
 sure you personal record excavators 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.700
 part from is internal but in fact 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.630
 do n't even plan it just plan 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.780
 the fact that the game itself today will not specify 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.820
 It turned misunderstanding with partners 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.479
 it turned out that she came in principle 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.190
 I do not know everyone with victories just past 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.560
 car played can miss you today 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.640
 I have already passed 2 match passes 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.290
 archers yes yes not really 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.740
 good to watch matches stands honest you 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:45.020
 I will say when you are healthy and normal you 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:50.360
 Islam is not falling because you are not there 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:54.050
 set but because it leaves sediment 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.539
 unpleasant but no less was to move 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.390
 continue to try to behave more 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.070
 reserved another risk with little or no 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.289
 filed until the morning and are going to sessions for 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.520
 that is, they will not be cut off to you 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.410
 it turned out yes there are a few matches 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.009
 in a row due to what succeeds aluminum 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.780
 support 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.080
 I think by working first 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.610
 due to the desire to start working 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.170
 use dedication reject all 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.710
 everybody is trying to make up for what 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.430
 we are told to play in the locker room 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:32.110
 strictly on instructions in this I think here 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.760
 as a father nonetheless than many complex 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.020
 matches misa is not some kind of case there 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.640
 relax we just relax and 4 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.290
 sing to pretty heavy severstal not 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.620
 arranges today's game not them not 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.260
 shipped table went to first 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.910
 the loop location is actually such a 3 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.400
 power moment because and how I already 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.770
 before that said that personally for me and I 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.850
 I think for each development the main thing is not 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.490
 then he highly McCarthy natural table 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.570
 the main 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.550
 choose the floor and now it 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:15.290
 long process we are preparing 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.500
