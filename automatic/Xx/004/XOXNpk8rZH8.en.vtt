00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.609
 which I embroider this time so 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.420
 the first set is very nice which I 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:32.820
 Alice bought this manufacturer 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 The set is called a winter bunny 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.770
 cute Alice and work cute animals 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.399
 this set is worth 195 rubles embroidered 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.480
 recruitment toris and easy i think in the nursery 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:58.379
 or for a gift the most optimal 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.199
 option second set which i hope 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.790
 ever higher who bought by 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:11.510
 greed at a discount fill 10 dollars 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:16.759
 this is a birdman 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:21.350
 cardinals on some branches there 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.350
 Embroidered stitch kit 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.000
 I did not open the canvas but with the set 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:37.829
 printed 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.470
 precisely drawn borders of leaves 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.570
 florets and you need it all you sew up 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.460
 Birds set has not started embroidering yet 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.810
 I hope, too, sometime higher because 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.810
 that picture I really like 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.009
 the second set that gave me this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.329
 stranger from the manufacturer 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:11.460
 golden fleece on the picture Kramskoy given 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:14.560
 scheme set to be honest I wanted this 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.580
 the same set of notes rhyolis and it seemed to me 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.210
 that rhyolis has a better scheme 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.160
 at least on the site and there are no such 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:31.690
 sharp transitions in colors but what 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:41.410
 donated and I think I'll send this one too 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:47.710
 set following this 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:53.350
 rhyolis pictures on a set of the picture 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:57.450
 Claude Monet did not like the house in the garden 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.450
 This picture I bought this set myself 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:09.220
 packaging is usually the way I do not like 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:14.530
 how is the rhyolis thread organized? 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.350
 there is a little tails and set 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.200
 the light and in the mountain all the threads they like 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.770
 twisted in the uterus when you have the most 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.890
 somehow somehow understand a little bit 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.380
 I didn't like this moment 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.870
 so rhyolis is the second set 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:41.350
 this is venice san marco square pretty 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:45.100
 expensive set, wrapping his type 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.560
 and under and another set such a lock 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.390
 packaging 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.300
 it's the same as saying about the threads fell 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:57.400
 yarn 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.310
 nakida but I really liked 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.520
 so is the circuit 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.200
 scaffolding scheme at least in this 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:12.739
 dear set it is colored 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:16.769
 and divided into plots that is 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:21.419
 the separation is not a solid sheet all such 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:25.830
 scheme by the way the golden fleece 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.850
 I did not like it, such a scheme 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.330
 black and white 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.400
 and there is no separation just 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.850
 a huge sheet of characters accounts for the most 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:41.070
 cut something like divide 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:46.440
 plot so as not to get confused and last 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:52.250
 set my walking corners is 5 rhyolis 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:57.330
 and Charles Bridge in Prague which is located 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:03.810
 also more expensive set respectively 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:07.370
 wrap with lock is all my sets 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:14.130
 which I bought gave me 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:15.800
 which I hope is still higher and 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.919

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.840

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.840
 it's a golden fleece 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.500
 top strawberries with cream on my 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:35.080
 blog you can see all the details and 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.500
