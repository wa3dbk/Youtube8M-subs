moving onto Kawasaki Slater's offering

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.220 
moving onto Kawasaki Slater's offering
with<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> 650<00:00:17.370> R<00:00:17.520> that's<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.600> bikes<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.960> lot<00:00:19.110> of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
with a 650 R that's this bikes a lot of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.120 
with a 650 R that's this bikes a lot of
fun<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.490> goes<00:00:20.730> head-to-head<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> SV

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
fun and it goes head-to-head with the SV

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.220 
fun and it goes head-to-head with the SV
this<00:00:23.130> has<00:00:23.370> no<00:00:23.730> adjustment<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.690> at<00:00:24.870> all<00:00:24.990> in

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this has no adjustment in it at all in

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.110 
this has no adjustment in it at all in
the<00:00:25.320> fork<00:00:25.530> so<00:00:25.770> again<00:00:26.070> we're<00:00:26.280> back<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> changing

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
the fork so again we're back to changing

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.360 
the fork so again we're back to changing
oil<00:00:27.330> viscosity<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.110> springs<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.280> the

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
oil viscosity and springs and on the

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.830 
oil viscosity and springs and on the
shock<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:29.940> actually<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.450> it<00:00:30.539> which<00:00:30.690> is

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
shock we can actually see it which is

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.370 
shock we can actually see it which is
nice

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
nice

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.229 
nice
there's<00:00:31.770> no<00:00:31.890> read<00:00:32.099> rebound<00:00:32.699> adjustment<00:00:33.179> on

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
there's no read rebound adjustment on

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.569 
there's no read rebound adjustment on
the<00:00:33.329> bottom<00:00:33.629> but<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.960> preload<00:00:34.350> only<00:00:34.679> so

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the bottom but just preload only so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.610 
the bottom but just preload only so
again<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:35.999> limited<00:00:36.749> but<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.379> is<00:00:37.589> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
again very limited but this is a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.459 
again very limited but this is a
bargain-basement<00:00:38.010> bike<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:39.960> job

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
bargain-basement bike that to do the job

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
bargain-basement bike that to do the job
mostly<00:00:40.920> commuting<00:00:41.519> and<00:00:41.609> running<00:00:41.879> around<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
mostly commuting and running around the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
mostly commuting and running around the
street<00:00:42.510> rather<00:00:42.780> than<00:00:42.989> track<00:00:43.230> base<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:44.159> this

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
street rather than track base but this

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.219 
street rather than track base but this
can<00:00:44.550> actually<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.300> ton<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.659> fun<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
can actually be a ton of fun on the

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.139 
can actually be a ton of fun on the
track<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.039> let's<00:00:47.190> measure<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> assess

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
track so let's measure this and assess

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.169 
track so let's measure this and assess

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
the spring rate Plaza cycle walk in and

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.930 
the spring rate Plaza cycle walk in and
ride<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> Kawasaki<00:00:53.010> Honda<00:00:53.370> or

Yamaha of your dreams remember Plaza
cycle<00:00:56.819> walk<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:58.109> out<00:01:00.499> so<00:01:01.499> 21<00:01:01.949> were

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
cycle walk in right out so 21 were

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
cycle walk in right out so 21 were
actually<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.659> range<00:01:03.899> at<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.229> inch

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
actually right in the range at an inch

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.310 
actually right in the range at an inch
and<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.620> half<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.980> adjustment<00:01:05.520> and<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.990> hundred

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and a half of adjustment and a hundred

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.900 
and a half of adjustment and a hundred
and<00:01:07.380> ninety<00:01:07.710> pounds<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.190> shocks<00:01:08.430> set<00:01:08.700> pretty

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
and ninety pounds the shocks set pretty

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.220 
and ninety pounds the shocks set pretty
well<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.300> it's<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.660> middle<00:01:09.870> of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> ramp

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
well and it's in the middle of the ramp

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.350 
well and it's in the middle of the ramp
adjustment<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.190> that's<00:01:11.370> fine<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.910> can<00:01:12.090> use

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
adjustment so that's fine we can use

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.990 
adjustment so that's fine we can use
this<00:01:12.620> but<00:01:13.620> it's<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> same<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.340> SV<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.940> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
this but it's the same as the SV it's a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630 
this but it's the same as the SV it's a
gas<00:01:15.180> emulsion<00:01:15.690> shock<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> year<00:01:16.440> maximum<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
gas emulsion shock so a year maximum you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
gas emulsion shock so a year maximum you
know<00:01:17.670> five<00:01:18.030> thousand<00:01:18.510> miles<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.200> needs

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
know five thousand miles and this needs

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
know five thousand miles and this needs
to<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.740> replaced<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.460> performance

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
to be replaced because the performance

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.250 
to be replaced because the performance
of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> shock<00:01:21.390> yourself<00:01:21.540> will<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.050> away

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
of the shock yourself will go away

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.410 
of the shock yourself will go away
quickly<00:01:22.620> so<00:01:23.280> moving<00:01:23.550> on<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:23.850> front<00:01:24.180> let's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
quickly so moving on to the front let's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.680 
quickly so moving on to the front let's
see<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.660> it<00:01:24.780> compares<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.320> SV

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.210 

now<00:01:32.690> we<00:01:32.750> knew<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.050> SV<00:01:33.350> was<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.560> little<00:01:33.890> stiff

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
now we knew the SV was a little stiff

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.140 
now we knew the SV was a little stiff
and<00:01:35.800> indeed<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.900> 650r<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.890> actually<00:01:40.730> just<00:01:41.000> a

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
and indeed the 650r is actually just a

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.050 
and indeed the 650r is actually just a
tad<00:01:41.390> stiffer<00:01:41.870> in<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.200> front<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.280> it's<00:01:43.610> too

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
tad stiffer in the front so it's too

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.750 
tad stiffer in the front so it's too
stiff<00:01:44.330> for<00:01:44.360> Dave<00:01:44.690> at<00:01:45.290> his<00:01:45.590> way<00:01:45.800> that<00:01:46.040> almost

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
stiff for Dave at his way that almost

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.030 
stiff for Dave at his way that almost
200<00:01:47.240> with<00:01:47.360> gear<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.440> that's<00:01:48.620> not<00:01:48.770> gonna<00:01:48.950> work

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
200 with gear so that's not gonna work

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.170 
200 with gear so that's not gonna work
well<00:01:49.430> for<00:01:49.640> Haley<00:01:51.310> all<00:01:52.310> right<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:52.760> with<00:01:52.940> Haley

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
well for Haley all right so with Haley

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.990 
well for Haley all right so with Haley
on<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.360> bike<00:01:54.490> 40<00:01:55.490> pounds<00:01:55.820> lighter<00:01:56.950> Wow<00:01:58.010> almost

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
on the bike 40 pounds lighter Wow almost

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.600 
on the bike 40 pounds lighter Wow almost
no<00:01:59.180> compression<00:01:59.600> at<00:01:59.900> all<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.290> back<00:02:00.610> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
no compression at all in the back the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.000 
no compression at all in the back the
sags<00:02:01.880> very<00:02:02.210> small<00:02:02.570> less<00:02:02.900> than<00:02:03.080> an<00:02:03.170> inch<00:02:03.380> so

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
sags very small less than an inch so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.609 
sags very small less than an inch so
this<00:02:04.190> is<00:02:04.369> I<00:02:04.640> think<00:02:05.060> obviously<00:02:05.720> way<00:02:06.080> too<00:02:06.140> stiff

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
this is I think obviously way too stiff

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.609 
this is I think obviously way too stiff
the<00:02:07.340> shock<00:02:07.550> springs<00:02:07.880> got<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.209> get<00:02:08.330> changed<00:02:08.929> but

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
the shock springs got to get changed but

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.199 
the shock springs got to get changed but
it's<00:02:09.770> interesting<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:10.340> note<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:11.090> in

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
it's interesting to note that just in

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.510 
it's interesting to note that just in
that<00:02:11.330> small<00:02:11.690> weight<00:02:11.900> range<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.890> variance<00:02:13.310> was

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
that small weight range the variance was

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.820 
that small weight range the variance was
pretty<00:02:13.820> obvious<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:15.110> there's<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.380> hint<00:02:15.620> here

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
pretty obvious so there's a hint here

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.500 
pretty obvious so there's a hint here
that<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.130> may<00:02:16.400> be<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.580> progressive<00:02:17.030> spring

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
that this may be a progressive spring

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.270 
that this may be a progressive spring
but<00:02:17.690> we'd<00:02:17.840> have<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> take<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.440> off<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.709> test<00:02:19.010> it

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
but we'd have to take it off and test it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.760 
but we'd have to take it off and test it
to<00:02:19.820> see<00:02:19.850> if<00:02:20.030> that's<00:02:20.209> actually<00:02:20.480> true<00:02:20.810> now<00:02:21.709> we

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
to see if that's actually true now we

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.500 
to see if that's actually true now we
know<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.100> front<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.880> actually<00:02:23.120> not<00:02:23.420> gonna

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
know the front is actually not gonna

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.720 
know the front is actually not gonna
work<00:02:23.750> at<00:02:23.930> all<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.709> when<00:02:30.860> we<00:02:30.950> extended<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.580> bike

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
work at all so when we extended the bike

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.340 
work at all so when we extended the bike
we<00:02:31.910> know<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> maximum<00:02:32.660> was<00:02:32.810> five<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.290> a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
we know the maximum was five and a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.650 
we know the maximum was five and a
quarter<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.209> four<00:02:35.480> and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
quarter and this is four and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.479 
quarter and this is four and
three-quarters<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:36.800> she's<00:02:36.980> getting<00:02:37.250> only

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
three-quarters so she's getting only

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.780 
three-quarters so she's getting only
half<00:02:38.000> an<00:02:38.209> inch<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.930> sag<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> bike<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.610> again

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
half an inch of sag on the bike so again

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.790 
half an inch of sag on the bike so again
this<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.120> good<00:02:41.330> at<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.110> point<00:02:42.350> completely

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
this is good at this point completely

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.040 
this is good at this point completely
unrideable<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:43.640> then<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.180> springs<00:02:44.570> if<00:02:44.870> you're

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
unrideable so then the springs if you're

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.699 
unrideable so then the springs if you're
in<00:02:45.170> her<00:02:45.350> weight<00:02:46.280> range

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
in her weight range

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.170 
in her weight range
13150<00:02:48.709> would<00:02:49.220> have<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.519> come<00:02:49.700> out<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:49.940> be

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
13150 would have to come out and be

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.850 
13150 would have to come out and be
softer<00:02:50.600> Springs<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.200> order<00:02:51.440> for<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.680> get

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
softer Springs in order for you to get

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.350 
softer Springs in order for you to get
some<00:02:52.070> comfort<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.519> plushness<00:02:52.880> out<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.300> the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
some comfort and plushness out of the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.000 
some comfort and plushness out of the
front<00:02:53.570> end<00:02:54.610> all<00:02:55.610> right<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.000> with<00:02:56.709> Chris<00:02:57.709> on<00:02:57.890> the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
front end all right so with Chris on the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.509 
front end all right so with Chris on the
back<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.780> think<00:02:59.780> with<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.769> measurement<00:03:01.220> we<00:03:01.310> got

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
back I think with the measurement we got

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.860 
back I think with the measurement we got
I<00:03:01.700> think<00:03:01.970> we<00:03:02.060> can<00:03:02.209> see<00:03:02.390> here<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:02.720> this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
I think we can see here that this

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.229 
I think we can see here that this
actually<00:03:03.290> may<00:03:03.500> be<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.680> progressive<00:03:04.130> spring<00:03:04.610> so

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
actually may be a progressive spring so

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.060 
actually may be a progressive spring so
be<00:03:05.420> worth<00:03:05.630> at<00:03:05.959> some<00:03:06.170> point<00:03:06.410> taking<00:03:06.769> this<00:03:06.890> off

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
be worth at some point taking this off

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.130 
be worth at some point taking this off
and<00:03:07.280> testing<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.540> will<00:03:08.660> be<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:08.900> line

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
and testing it and that will be in line

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.560 
and testing it and that will be in line
with<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.470> r6<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.190> 675<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.269> bunch<00:03:11.480> of

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
with the r6 and a 675 and a bunch of

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.539 
with the r6 and a 675 and a bunch of
other<00:03:11.750> bikes<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.530> are<00:03:12.650> moving<00:03:12.890> towards<00:03:13.430> this

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
other bikes that are moving towards this

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.630 
other bikes that are moving towards this
to<00:03:13.790> cater<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.269> bigger<00:03:15.170> weight<00:03:16.040> range<00:03:16.430> of

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
to cater to a bigger weight range of

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.050 
to cater to a bigger weight range of
rider<00:03:16.989> now<00:03:17.989> we<00:03:18.049> should<00:03:18.320> find<00:03:18.620> we<00:03:19.549> get<00:03:19.700> some

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
rider now we should find we get some

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.120 
rider now we should find we get some
movement<00:03:20.269> out<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.900> front<00:03:21.140> with<00:03:21.769> Chris

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
movement out of the front with Chris

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.190 
movement out of the front with Chris
given<00:03:22.489> its<00:03:22.640> weight<00:03:22.820> but<00:03:23.180> as<00:03:23.330> it's<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.690> standard

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
given its weight but as it's a standard

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.440 
given its weight but as it's a standard
motorcycle<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:25.370> not<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.670> sport<00:03:26.060> bike<00:03:26.180> where

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
motorcycle it's not a sport bike where

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.539 
motorcycle it's not a sport bike where
your<00:03:26.600> weight<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.170> actually<00:03:27.769> moved<00:03:28.340> further

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
your weight is actually moved further

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.370 
your weight is actually moved further
forward<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:29.540> may<00:03:29.720> not<00:03:29.870> be<00:03:30.019> that<00:03:30.049> big<00:03:30.320> a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
forward it may not be that big a

forward it may not be that big a
difference<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:32.540> indeed<00:03:32.870> it's<00:03:33.049> not<00:03:33.260> it's

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
still just on four inches so he's only

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.400 
still just on four inches so he's only
