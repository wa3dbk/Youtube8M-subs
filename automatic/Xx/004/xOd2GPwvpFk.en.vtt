an<00:00:12.210> origami<00:00:12.660> paper<00:00:12.929> also<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.679> piece<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.070> paper

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
an origami paper also a piece of paper

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.180 
an origami paper also a piece of paper
now<00:00:15.089> let's<00:00:15.509> start<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:16.500> step<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.859> fold<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
now let's start first step I fold the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.750 
now let's start first step I fold the
paper<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.609> half<00:00:17.640> vertically<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:21.890> then<00:00:22.890> unfold

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
paper in half vertically and then unfold

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.560 
paper in half vertically and then unfold
the<00:00:23.850> paper<00:00:24.560> now<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.830> start<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> top<00:00:27.210> edge

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the paper now I start from the top edge

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.120 
the paper now I start from the top edge
to<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.230> center<00:00:28.560> crease<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:30.830> repeat<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> same

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
to the center crease and repeat the same

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.490 
to the center crease and repeat the same
fold<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.730> opposite<00:00:33.090> side<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
fold for the opposite side this is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.889 
fold for the opposite side this is
pretty<00:00:37.829> difficult<00:00:38.160> no<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> symbol<00:00:39.719> rate

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
pretty difficult no it's the symbol rate

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.619 
pretty difficult no it's the symbol rate
and<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.460> start<00:00:41.670> from<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:42.000> tough<00:00:42.270> for

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and now I will start from be tough for

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.200 
and now I will start from be tough for
it<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> other<00:00:43.250> well<00:00:44.250> boy<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.030> see<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it to the other well boy you can see the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240 
it to the other well boy you can see the
point<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> other<00:00:45.899> side<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.770> make

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
point on the other side and then make

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.610 
point on the other side and then make
the<00:00:47.460> crease<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.899> repeat<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> same<00:00:49.379> fold

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the crease on and I repeat the same fold

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
the crease on and I repeat the same fold
for<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.520> opposite<00:00:50.850> side<00:00:51.059> start<00:00:51.539> from

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
for the opposite side start from

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.770 
for the opposite side start from
deportee<00:00:52.289> forth<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:53.699> corner<00:00:54.149> on

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
deportee forth to the other corner on

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.810 
deportee forth to the other corner on
this<00:00:55.050> edge

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.740 

and<00:00:58.330> now<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.590> will<00:01:00.130> start<00:01:00.370> from<00:01:00.520> both<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:01.060> push<00:01:01.570> it

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
and now I will start from both I push it

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.950 
and now I will start from both I push it
into<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.050> center<00:01:02.410> crease<00:01:02.680> I<00:01:03.750> will<00:01:04.750> try<00:01:04.930> to

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
into the center crease I will try to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.950 
into the center crease I will try to
match<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.710> edges<00:01:06.190> together<00:01:09.570> let's<00:01:10.570> see<00:01:10.750> a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
match the edges together let's see a

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.820 
match the edges together let's see a
little<00:01:11.320> bit<00:01:11.440> hard<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:13.810> push<00:01:14.230> the<00:01:14.530> bottom

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
little bit hard now I push the bottom

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.730 
little bit hard now I push the bottom
part<00:01:15.190> down<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:16.030> my<00:01:16.210> decrees<00:01:16.570> harder<00:01:17.140> fix<00:01:17.620> this

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
part down to my decrees harder fix this

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.540 
part down to my decrees harder fix this
a<00:01:17.800> little<00:01:18.040> bit<00:01:18.660> and<00:01:19.660> for<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.800> triangle<00:01:21.340> shape

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
a little bit and for the triangle shape

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.780 
a little bit and for the triangle shape
to<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:22.330> other<00:01:22.450> side<00:01:22.920> rest<00:01:23.920> out<00:01:24.160> to<00:01:24.400> metal

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
to the other side rest out to metal

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.270 
to the other side rest out to metal
crease<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.680> same<00:01:26.890> thing<00:01:27.040> for<00:01:27.160> the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
crease do the same thing for the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.219 
crease do the same thing for the
opposite<00:01:27.640> sign<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.120> then<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:28.510> push<00:01:28.840> the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
opposite sign and then I push the

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.080 
opposite sign and then I push the
triangle<00:01:29.680> shape<00:01:29.710> down<00:01:29.950> as<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.490> can<00:01:30.610> see<00:01:30.820> here

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
triangle shape down as you can see here

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.630 
triangle shape down as you can see here
and<00:01:31.300> our<00:01:32.080> stuff<00:01:32.440> from<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.710> edge<00:01:33.009> for<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.520> to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
and our stuff from the edge for it to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.480 
and our stuff from the edge for it to
the<00:01:33.759> center<00:01:34.030> crease<00:01:34.210> just<00:01:37.920> push<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.070> in

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
the center crease just push it in

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.790 
the center crease just push it in
I<00:01:39.520> think<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> black<00:01:40.780> paper<00:01:41.050> is<00:01:41.290> a<00:01:41.320> little<00:01:41.440> bit

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
I think the black paper is a little bit

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.520 
I think the black paper is a little bit
hard<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.130> see<00:01:42.220> but<00:01:42.610> if<00:01:43.509> you<00:01:43.570> get<00:01:43.900> difficult<00:01:44.170> you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
hard to see but if you get difficult you

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.140 
hard to see but if you get difficult you
can<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:44.860> mean<00:01:45.160> pause<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.670> video<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:46.060> see<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:48.150> and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
can I mean pause the video to see it and

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.910 
can I mean pause the video to see it and
repeat<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.660> same<00:01:49.840> fold<00:01:50.229> for<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.560> opposite

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
repeat the same fold for the opposite

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.900 
repeat the same fold for the opposite
side<00:01:54.540> now<00:01:55.540> push<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.110> down<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.520> very

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
side now push it down this is very

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.560 
side now push it down this is very
similar<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.390> how<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:58.869> fold<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.710> flappy<00:02:00.100> bird

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.940 

let's<00:02:04.570> fix<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.020> little<00:02:05.080> bit<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.560> push<00:02:05.800> it

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
let's fix it a little bit and push it

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.150 
let's fix it a little bit and push it
down

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.280 

and<00:02:10.500> next<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.650> will<00:02:11.740> unfold<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.720> top<00:02:13.720> layer<00:02:13.960> and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
and next I will unfold the top layer and

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.480 
and next I will unfold the top layer and
then<00:02:14.590> fold<00:02:15.010> its<00:02:15.160> back<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:17.530> match<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
then fold its back in to match it to the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.960 
then fold its back in to match it to the
crease<00:02:19.240> or<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.750> edge<00:02:19.930> from<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.920> inner<00:02:21.280> push

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
crease or the edge from the inner push

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.110 
crease or the edge from the inner push
it<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.510> push<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.140> down<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:24.370> make<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> crease

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
it in and push it down and make a crease

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.810 
it in and push it down and make a crease
harm<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.800> repeat<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.890> same<00:02:27.100> fold<00:02:27.490> for<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
harm and repeat the same fold for the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.430 
harm and repeat the same fold for the
opposite<00:02:28.180> side

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
you need to curve the paper and push it

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:42.660 
you need to curve the paper and push it
in<00:02:34.510> slowly<00:02:38.280> after<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:40.030> fold<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.500> inner<00:02:42.190> now<00:02:42.490> I

in slowly after you fold the inner now I
will<00:02:43.060> fix<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.660> D<00:02:44.320> tip<00:02:44.710> on<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.340> head<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.850> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
will fix the D tip on the head of the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.130 
will fix the D tip on the head of the
paper<00:02:46.270> airplane<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.110> would<00:02:47.680> do<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.920> slowly<00:02:48.190> and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
paper airplane I would do it slowly and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.260 
paper airplane I would do it slowly and
I<00:02:50.140> will<00:02:50.320> make<00:02:50.770> sure<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.700> has<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.180> look

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
I will make sure that the has to look

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.610 
I will make sure that the has to look
nice<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:54.360> then<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.810> can<00:02:55.990> see<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.230> triangle

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
nice and then you can see the triangle

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.970 
nice and then you can see the triangle
shape<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:56.980> just<00:02:57.010> for<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.490> back<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:58.230> now<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.560> fold

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
shape I just for it back in now I fold

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.920 
shape I just for it back in now I fold
the<00:03:00.070> paper<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.490> half
