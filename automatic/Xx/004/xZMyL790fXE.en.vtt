00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 then I'm going world landed 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.049
 today we have a vision very very 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.670
 special because I just saw 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.639
 new information that came out on 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.559
 twitter today even a site 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.890
 information about girls 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.289
 to go surf who would be saved so 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.630
 there is a tweak been done by the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.439
 leader of the sledgehammer company 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 games that makes the game case of forgetting to a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.449
 surfer and who odjick the time using 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.279
 fashion here again once at the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.960
 next patch then like to see 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 only the screen especially and where tim 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.489
 horton had written a tweet that said 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.500
 that much too soon on a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.170
 savior in the rotations of 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.570
 refueling there was on board a 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.280
 new character with new costumes 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.940
 complete characters that can be seen at 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.489
 the screen just in sum is an answer to 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.469
 that a person writes while talking about 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 what does he do now 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.030
 approach in relation to girls who is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.949
 far too fast now and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 michael condrey who and when the facts 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.350
 like aubry if the leader and the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.850
 developer is the co-founder of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.100
 sledgehammer games 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.439
 so he made a quarter of the mass 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.040
 offered and a blue would have laid 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.009
 in zac me it's true that at 20 the field 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.110
 was way too long and fans of 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.200
 carl of ten were not happy then 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.090
 they reduced it and they put it equal 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.280
 to the school of 10 but they realized 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.750
 that it was really too short then 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.460
 they will add 1 2 more seconds 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.189
 in the next game objects 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.189
 so what can we ask for better 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.799
 especially the world 2 more seconds for 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.640
 the feed is a difference that will be 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.820
 crucial and that will make that positive 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 I think because time is made 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 of six full seconds what are going 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.329
 to be very practical it will be very good 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.579
 compared to homos style of play 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.770
 of fronts is free to save 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.759
 something very positive and I 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.530
 think they could not have done better 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.969
 choose who added two seconds to 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.920
 have a total of six seconds 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.240
 personally I think perfect stop 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.070
 so that means that the clips 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.810
 franÃ§ois end it means that it is 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.160
 certain that you will see 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.510
 to be on this jules at 100% so a v be 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.890
 make returns everyone understands 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.820
 than sign to make montages of 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.060
 clips etc 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.760
 so that's going to be part of the next bone 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.170
 of one of the game i do not know tian who 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.420
 want there they have not yet specified 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.100
 but he will be present at the next 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.710
 debts so that's all you 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.420
 say today for this video by 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.160
 compared to new models that vary 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.600
 on to bristles do it soon 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.450
 I hope they know how to be very soon 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.310
 so share the video as much as possible 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.650
