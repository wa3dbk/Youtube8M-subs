mortals and Yahweh and this gap is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.559 
mortals and Yahweh and this gap is
filled<00:03:01.170> by<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.620> cross<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.459> forth<00:03:02.730> where

the Old Testament and it's very clear

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.809 
the Old Testament and it's very clear
that<00:03:08.549> Yahweh<00:03:09.090> not<00:03:09.810> only<00:03:10.109> wants<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.250> personal

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
that Yahweh not only wants a personal

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.330

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
well at what point in the Old Testament

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.770 
well at what point in the Old Testament
does<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.190> say<00:05:01.310> ok<00:05:01.610> these<00:05:01.760> are<00:05:01.820> temporary<00:05:02.450> and

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
does it say ok these are temporary and

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.380 
does it say ok these are temporary and
as<00:05:03.320> soon<00:05:03.560> as<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.370> intercessor<00:05:04.940> comes<00:05:05.180> along

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
as soon as the intercessor comes along

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.210 
as soon as the intercessor comes along
and<00:05:05.600> makes<00:05:05.780> that<00:05:05.930> ultimate<00:05:06.290> sacrifice<00:05:06.320> upon

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
and makes that ultimate sacrifice upon

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.920 
and makes that ultimate sacrifice upon
the<00:05:07.280> cross<00:05:07.640> then<00:05:08.330> you're<00:05:08.510> not<00:05:08.660> going<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:08.840> have

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
the cross then you're not going to have

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.570 
the cross then you're not going to have
to<00:05:09.050> worry<00:05:09.200> about<00:05:09.320> doing<00:05:09.680> any<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.919> this<00:05:10.130> anymore

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
to worry about doing any of this anymore

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.700 
to worry about doing any of this anymore
then<00:05:10.850> at<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.090> point<00:05:11.390> salvation<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.500> going<00:05:12.650> to

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
then at that point salvation is going to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.090 
then at that point salvation is going to
be<00:05:12.770> based<00:05:12.980> upon<00:05:13.340> faith<00:05:14.380> where<00:05:15.380> is<00:05:15.560> that<00:05:15.740> found

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
be based upon faith where is that found

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.010 
be based upon faith where is that found
in<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.340> Old<00:05:16.550> Testament<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.180> if<00:05:17.510> it's<00:05:17.870> not

found in the Old Testament where did the
early<00:05:20.120> Christians<00:05:20.300> get<00:05:21.140> their<00:05:21.320> idea<00:05:21.680> if<00:05:22.010> it

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
early Christians get their idea if it

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.690 
early Christians get their idea if it
was<00:05:22.400> not<00:05:22.580> from<00:05:22.880> outside<00:05:23.150> sources<00:05:24.430> finally<00:05:25.430> and

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
was not from outside sources finally and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.580 
was not from outside sources finally and
you<00:05:26.180> may<00:05:26.330> also<00:05:26.540> agree<00:05:26.990> with<00:05:27.140> this<00:05:27.260> that<00:05:27.470> this

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
you may also agree with this that this

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.590 
you may also agree with this that this
really<00:05:27.830> is<00:05:28.070> a<00:05:28.100> pagan<00:05:28.430> influence<00:05:29.030> but<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:29.390> just

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
really is a pagan influence but I just

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.969 
really is a pagan influence but I just
thought<00:05:29.750> I'd<00:05:29.900> bring<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.229> up<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.560> for<00:05:30.770> fun

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979
