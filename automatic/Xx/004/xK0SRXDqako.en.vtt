00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
like me and you can't tie a bow then

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.360 
like me and you can't tie a bow then
using<00:05:18.950> a<00:05:19.040> fork<00:05:19.370> is<00:05:19.700> perfect

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
using a fork is perfect

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.730

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
so I hot-glued that on both sides and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.200 
so I hot-glued that on both sides and
that's<00:05:27.949> about<00:05:28.160> it<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:31.490> took<00:05:31.699> a<00:05:31.820> few<00:05:32.000> days

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210
