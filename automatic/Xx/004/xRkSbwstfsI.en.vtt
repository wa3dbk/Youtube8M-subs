00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
like to serve and volley so when you

take all of this into account you begin
to<00:03:07.770> understand<00:03:08.340> why<00:03:08.520> attacking<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.240> net<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
to understand why attacking the net and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.310 
to understand why attacking the net and
the<00:03:09.720> pro<00:03:10.050> game<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:11.040> high-risk<00:03:11.580> strategy

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
the pro game is a high-risk strategy

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.290 
the pro game is a high-risk strategy
explaining<00:03:13.320> why<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:13.950> many<00:03:14.130> pros<00:03:14.520> just<00:03:14.940> prefer

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
explaining why so many pros just prefer

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.870 
explaining why so many pros just prefer
to<00:03:15.510> stay<00:03:15.720> at<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.170> baseline<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.890> hit<00:03:17.400> huge

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
to stay at the baseline and hit huge

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.930 
to stay at the baseline and hit huge
ground<00:03:18.209> strokes<00:03:18.600> from<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.140> baseline<00:03:19.940> but

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
ground strokes from the baseline but

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.580 
ground strokes from the baseline but
what<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.180> want<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.780> understand<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.530> that

what I want you to understand is that
this<00:03:23.010> doesn't<00:03:23.490> mean<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.180> copy<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
this doesn't mean you have to copy the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.290 
this doesn't mean you have to copy the
pros<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.470> stay<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> baseline<00:03:26.850> hitting

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
pro tennis serve and volley may not be a

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.880 
pro tennis serve and volley may not be a
good<00:03:32.730> strategy<00:03:33.209> for<00:03:33.510> them<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.620> the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
good strategy for them because of the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.040 
good strategy for them because of the
reasons<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.459> explained<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.209> before<00:03:36.330> at

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
club tennis serve and volley can be very

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.880 
club tennis serve and volley can be very
efficient<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.910> know<00:03:42.030> why<00:03:42.209> because<00:03:43.170> club

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
efficient and you know why because club

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.190 
efficient and you know why because club
tennis<00:03:44.220> players<00:03:44.640> aren't<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.330> good<00:03:45.630> making

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
tennis players aren't that good making

passing shots in lobs and even if they

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.410 
passing shots in lobs and even if they
are<00:03:49.050> they<00:03:49.860> are<00:03:50.040> not<00:03:50.250> going<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.700> hit<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.120> shot

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
are they are not going to hit that shot

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.900 
are they are not going to hit that shot
over<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.110> over<00:03:52.350> again<00:03:52.590> they<00:03:53.280> are<00:03:53.310> not<00:03:53.640> going

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
over and over again they are not going

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.540 
over and over again they are not going
to<00:03:54.150> be<00:03:54.330> very<00:03:54.570> consistent<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.220> very

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
to be very consistent this is very

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.640 
to be very consistent this is very
difficult<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.390> club<00:03:57.720> player<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.200> hit<00:03:58.350> good

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
difficult to a club player to hit good

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.000 
difficult to a club player to hit good
passing<00:03:59.130> shots<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.820> good<00:04:00.360> lobs<00:04:00.600> all<00:04:00.870> day<00:04:01.110> so

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
passing shots and good lobs all day so

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.340 
passing shots and good lobs all day so
for<00:04:02.250> pros<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.880> may<00:04:03.180> not<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.810> good<00:04:04.140> strategy

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
for pros it may not be a good strategy

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.830 
for pros it may not be a good strategy
but<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.130> club<00:04:05.370> tennis<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.360> very<00:04:06.720> good

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
but in club tennis it is a very good

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.530 
but in club tennis it is a very good
strategy<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.470> use<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:08.040> your<00:04:08.160> game<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:09.240> is<00:04:09.360> one

different strategies than the one that
the<00:04:45.690> pros<00:04:45.960> use<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:47.010> not<00:04:47.190> bad<00:04:47.460> for<00:04:47.490> Club

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
find it easier to go to the net to

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.590 
find it easier to go to the net to
finish<00:05:42.630> off<00:05:42.870> points<00:05:43.640> so<00:05:44.640> that<00:05:45.030> is<00:05:45.450> everything
