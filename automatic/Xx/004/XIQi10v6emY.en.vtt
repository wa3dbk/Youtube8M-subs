00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 dear friends, I take you with me today 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.890
 to a making of a shooting 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.890
 what I just did 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.160
 Today was a contract shooting at 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.660
 extended if children maybe already 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.140
 rather I have then with goal video 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.260
 made 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.540
 there is a new video tripod and that 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.700
 I almost photographed for the 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.500
 next campaign in the now 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.080
 spring comes on the website in 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.770
 brochures and so on and goal was it 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.510
 Today to produce urban pictures with 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.550
 this tripod not put 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.920
 should look a bit dynamic 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.470
 should be in there a bit of sexyness from 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.420
 Berlin and that's what I have for me 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.760
 city my colleague is the quasi 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.760
 the urban sexyness in person 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.890
 there is 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.659
 there instead of a quasi had it 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.040
 and the whole thing should be one too 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.170
 tell story and story 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.240
 was in the end he goes out of the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.610
 House with his bike to subway drives 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.730
 with the subway to the spot and then to there 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.100
 film and many famous places in 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.720
 berlin are typical berlin 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.210
 motives are to be seen so what buses again 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.710
 taxis the subway that moves and 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.870
 Of course, investigate here at the potsdamer 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.610
 Place is perfect the boat around in the 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.870
 to push darkness and that was in 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.270
 Finally, the concept I wanted 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.390
 So different times of day have to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.830
 one daylight normal to the other 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.200
 but also just the darkness with the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.240
 beautiful lights beautiful background 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.250
 nice is ok say degas setting 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.880
 second day about about always like this 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.650
 between the aperture 22 28 to 35 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.510
 sometimes even four with the 50th 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.700
 millimeter lens at the 100th 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.470
 millimeter lens so 28 to 32 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.690
 Approximately with the shutter closing time 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.920
 I always tried so at least 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.810
 There are 150 160 to create 150 to 200 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.330
 do not care up to two hundredths 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.910
 to create every case and with the iso 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.129
 i was always like this between iso 100 then 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.269
 with proper daylight even later 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.410
 but then if somehow 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.180
 it was a bit cloudier today 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.209
 all day a rather cloudy with 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.640
 iso 200 to 400 partly 800 march at 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.430
 evening i am at iso 2200 i think so 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.739
 over 2,400 that has pretty fresh out 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.260
 still at the dark here with 116 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.349
 closing time and that has pretty good 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.349
 is working 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.440
 I have to stay open all the time 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.060
 with that photographed should be about 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.700
 also the look are mostly with the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.370
 perspective relatively far down like that 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.780
 diagonal to top just what 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.670
 to create something different than you would otherwise 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.170
 just looks when you get out of the whole 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.750
 normal head perspective quasi 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.590
 I have used photographed lenses 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.020
 the 50 millimeter 18 normal 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.450
 Objective for this plastic dying super 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.130
 Objectively straight to full size and there 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.630
 we are already on the subject of 15 2 with the 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.760
 I photographed today from the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.410
 simple reason because on the one hand 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.880
 wanted to have a bigger picture 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.330
 the open aperture and on the other hand 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.070
 even in the dark light conditions 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.600
 here much more leeway so have sap 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.340
 this is photographed with iso 2200 2400 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.020
 not a big one with the fifth row 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.790
 problem little noise is to be seen 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.410
 you can get away with that easily and 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.150
 sometimes noise image is indeed synonymous 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.190
 little sympathetic daylight 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.860
 anyway no problem also on the day with iso 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.050
 800 and so 15 2 no problem with 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.880
 the 600 one has since partially already 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.770
 That's why I have the few problems 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.780
 today , the 100 millimeter is used 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.790
 you can already tokina macro lens 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.440
 from the macro videos has been here too 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.780
 super made in full frame on the 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.190
 real enjoyable picture detail and also 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.810
 15 millimeters objectively 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.730
 Vollformat looks a bit more 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.220
 different so you have much more on 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.930
 the picture on it and also one 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.050
 softer background already with 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.730
 closed aperture on six hours 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.110
 we are in about six to seven 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.010
 hours we are now in here through 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.480
 berlin passed to the 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.030
 different places to just this 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.010
 story to tell from day to now 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.290
 to the dark the good it is november 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.299
 means it gets dark relatively quickly 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.540
 16 30 the sun actually and completely 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.770
 away 17 o'clock completely dark 17 30 degrees 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.960
 It already looks like the night 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.030
 words must be around as long as 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.980
 Having different times after having 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.740
 Not so much daylight over the day 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.970
 but everything worked wonderfully 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.340
 and so are really cool pictures 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.680
 arose 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.210
 nice story with the bike through the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 city ​​and the pictures are yes 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.970
 probably soon on the side of 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.250
 Unfortunately I know wenger 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.360
 and not as you show now 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.360
 not yet 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.450
 patrick of mine I have one 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.210
 memory card from marcel got a 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.760
 adapter easy gloves a good one 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.940
 already gloves just beautiful me 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.480
 May you over with critical day 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.940
 results quite normal because the fifth 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.070
 yes compactflash and the 600 has the atmo 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.990
 SD cards mean I have to be home 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.610
 not so many flash cards come though 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.610
 that an adapter should you know it too 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.320
 from mini sd to normal sd card from 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.530
 Mobile phone, for example, is also available for 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.020
 compactflash and that has pretty good 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.970
 works the day and not too 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.970
 forgot of course looks at the team 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.310
 because the model and mike cameraman 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:42.120
 and assistant side and head 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:43.080
 is torn like including a tee 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.220
 drink 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.780
 that was my shooting day today 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.920
 extended if you liked it 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.090
 video the trained gives like the 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.680
 I do not want to learn thumbs up 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.300

 if you have learned something like living 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.900
 Thumb up and here on the side
