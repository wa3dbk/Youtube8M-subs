everything's<00:03:34.459> all<00:03:34.640> chrome<00:03:34.970> John<00:03:35.750> ously<00:03:35.989> I

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
everything's all chrome John ously I

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.900 
everything's all chrome John ously I
don't<00:03:36.230> think<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.530> correct<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.280> might<00:03:37.459> be<00:03:37.640> for

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
don't think is correct it might be for

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.640 
don't think is correct it might be for
this<00:03:38.000> but<00:03:38.329> I<00:03:38.359> would<00:03:38.750> probably<00:03:38.930> strip<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.560> and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
this but I would probably strip it and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.819 
this but I would probably strip it and
paint<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.010> all<00:03:40.130> aluminum<00:03:40.640> or<00:03:41.410> similar<00:03:42.410> colored

I<00:03:52.660> should<00:03:53.660> say<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.900> wheels<00:03:54.109> here<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.709> these

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
I should say the wheels here and these

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.470 
I should say the wheels here and these
actually<00:03:55.400> look<00:03:55.549> like<00:03:55.579> they're<00:03:55.880> similar

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
actually look like they're similar

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.809 
actually look like they're similar
I<00:03:57.230> believe<00:03:57.560> there's<00:03:57.739> their<00:03:57.890> centreline<00:03:58.430> style

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
I believe there's their centreline style

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.550 
I believe there's their centreline style
wheels<00:03:59.030> like<00:03:59.269> that<00:03:59.329> come<00:03:59.690> on<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.900> 69<00:04:00.380> Nova

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
wheels like that come on the 69 Nova

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.340 
wheels like that come on the 69 Nova
however<00:04:01.130> they're<00:04:01.540> deeper<00:04:02.540> set<00:04:02.780> wheels<00:04:02.989> bigger

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
however they're deeper set wheels bigger

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.670 
however they're deeper set wheels bigger

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
batteries and everything like that so

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.160 
batteries and everything like that so
it's<00:04:28.430> really<00:04:28.460> cool<00:04:28.820> they<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.150> huge<00:04:29.450> tubs<00:04:29.810> and

being<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.160> everything<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:31.640> broken<00:04:31.820> down<00:04:32.060> in

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
being that everything is broken down in

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.610 
being that everything is broken down in
a<00:04:32.240> different<00:04:32.390> part<00:04:32.720> so<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.080> could<00:04:33.290> cut<00:04:33.470> this

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
a different part so you could cut this

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.100 
a different part so you could cut this
down<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.220> fit<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.000> into<00:04:35.210> another<00:04:35.300> car<00:04:35.720> or<00:04:35.930> add

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
down and fit it into another car or add

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.810 
down and fit it into another car or add
pieces<00:04:36.530> on<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.770> outside<00:04:37.160> if<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:37.400> wanted<00:04:37.640> to

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
pieces on the outside if you wanted to

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.330 
pieces on the outside if you wanted to
so<00:04:38.000> there's<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.240> lot<00:04:38.450> of<00:04:38.600> possibilities<00:04:39.340> just

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
so there's a lot of possibilities just
