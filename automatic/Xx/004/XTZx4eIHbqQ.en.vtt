00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
we're going to take them down to the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.609 
we're going to take them down to the
combustion<00:00:29.490> lab<00:00:30.170> and<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.289> we're<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.529> to

combustion lab and then we're going to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.830 
combustion lab and then we're going to
cook<00:00:31.890> some<00:00:32.160> banana<00:00:33.030> fritter<00:00:33.329> sandwiches<00:00:38.840> in

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
cook some banana fritter sandwiches in

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.670 
cook some banana fritter sandwiches in
in<00:00:40.110> Rwanda<00:00:40.680> they<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.600> large<00:00:42.649> quantities<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
in Rwanda they have large quantities of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.340 
in Rwanda they have large quantities of
of<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.430> banana<00:00:44.760> waste<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> 60<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:45.930> 70

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of a banana waste like a 60 or 70

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
of a banana waste like a 60 or 70
percent<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> income<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.820> from<00:00:48.090> bananas

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
percent of the income it is from bananas

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.160 
percent of the income it is from bananas
actually<00:00:49.110> only<00:00:49.879> 10%<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.750> banana<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
actually only 10% of the banana you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
actually only 10% of the banana you
actually<00:00:52.500> eat<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.370> there's<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.730> masses<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
actually eat so there's just masses and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.380 
actually eat so there's just masses and
masses<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.809> waste<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.710> another<00:00:56.370> problem<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
masses of waste and another problem in a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.420 
masses of waste and another problem in a
lot<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.690> large<00:00:58.410> parts<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> developing<00:00:59.190> world

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
lot of large parts of developing world

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.119

is<00:00:59.960> firewood<00:01:00.960> there's<00:01:01.289> there's<00:01:01.559> huge<00:01:01.800> areas

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
is firewood there's there's huge areas

is firewood there's there's huge areas
of<00:01:02.160> land<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:03.059> being<00:01:03.270> deforested<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of land are being deforested and and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.480 
of land are being deforested and and
lands<00:01:05.909> being<00:01:06.180> eroded<00:01:06.619> people<00:01:07.619> need<00:01:07.830> wood<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
lands being eroded people need wood to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
lands being eroded people need wood to
burn<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:09.299> can't<00:01:09.540> afford<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:10.260> more

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
burn they can't afford to be more

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.359 
burn they can't afford to be more
expensive<00:01:10.830> Falls<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.460> LPG<00:01:12.090> or<00:01:12.330> gas<00:01:13.369> also

expensive Falls like LPG or gas also
another<00:01:14.850> problem<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> women<00:01:15.990> might<00:01:16.140> spend

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
another problem is women might spend

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
another problem is women might spend
four<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.710> five<00:01:16.950> hours<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.340> day<00:01:17.509> collecting

four or five hours a day collecting
firewood<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.950> could<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.130> spent<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
firewood time that could be spent in the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.210 
firewood time that could be spent in the
home<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.330> doing<00:01:22.229> other<00:01:22.470> things<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.040> maybe

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
home and doing other things and maybe

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.420 
home and doing other things and maybe
even<00:01:23.700> generating<00:01:24.330> income<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> really

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
even generating income this is a really

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
even generating income this is a really
black<00:01:29.670> banana<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.780> exactly<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.470> want

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
black banana it's exactly what we want

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.640 
black banana it's exactly what we want
we<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.400> them<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.180> nicely<00:01:33.650> mushy

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
we want them so they're all nicely mushy

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.770 
we want them so they're all nicely mushy
in<00:01:35.070> Rwanda<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.000> large<00:01:36.240> quantities<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
in Rwanda they have large quantities of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.240 
in Rwanda they have large quantities of
banana<00:01:37.290> waste<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> skins<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:40.140> stems<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
leaves of the banana plant and those

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
leaves of the banana plant and those
aren't<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.340> used<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.729> anything<00:01:44.909> else<00:01:45.180> at

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
aren't really used for anything else at

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.200 
aren't really used for anything else at
the<00:01:45.420> moment<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.200> they<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.290> rot<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the moment at all and they just rot and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.590 
the moment at all and they just rot and
left<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.689> waste<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> that's<00:01:51.240> what<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.450> want

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
left to waste and so that's what we want

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.510 
left to waste and so that's what we want
to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> use<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.590> waste<00:01:52.860> for

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to do want to use that waste for

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.190 
to do want to use that waste for
something<00:01:53.909> useful

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.290 
people which really has a direct benefit
to<00:02:11.360> people<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.379> really<00:02:12.620> love<00:02:12.769> this<00:02:12.890> project

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
to people and I really love this project

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.350 
to people and I really love this project
because<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:15.519> doing<00:02:16.519> some<00:02:16.670> research

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
because it's doing some research

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.300 
because it's doing some research
so<00:02:18.110> people<00:02:18.290> who<00:02:18.530> wouldn't<00:02:18.739> actually<00:02:18.950> be<00:02:19.160> able

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
so people who wouldn't actually be able

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.820 
so people who wouldn't actually be able
to<00:02:19.489> afford<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.940> research<00:02:20.360> normally<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.989> think

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
to afford this research normally I think

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.110 
to afford this research normally I think
people<00:02:22.190> have<00:02:22.280> caught<00:02:22.430> on<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.700> people<00:02:22.819> just

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
people have caught on to it people just

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.000 
people have caught on to it people just
keep<00:02:23.239> bringing<00:02:23.450> back<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.019> bananas<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:24.709> I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
keep bringing back the bananas like I

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.240 
keep bringing back the bananas like I
went<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:27.250> cat<00:02:28.250> cafe<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.959> globe<00:02:30.620> cafe<00:02:31.010> thing

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
went to a cat cafe a globe cafe thing

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.100 
went to a cat cafe a globe cafe thing
that<00:02:31.430> runs<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.760> Nottingham<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.180> London<00:02:32.540> but

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
that runs in Nottingham in London but

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.960 
that runs in Nottingham in London but
people<00:02:33.440> has<00:02:33.560> turned<00:02:33.799> out<00:02:33.950> with<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.099> change<00:02:34.790> with

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
people has turned out with a change with

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.449 
people has turned out with a change with
bag<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.269> bananas<00:02:35.750> for<00:02:35.930> me<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.280> there's

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
bag of bananas for me and then there's

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.710 
bag of bananas for me and then there's
what<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.700> word<00:02:37.849> spreading<00:02:38.329> that<00:02:38.450> we're<00:02:38.599> after

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
what the word spreading that we're after

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.280 
what the word spreading that we're after
banana<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.380> say<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:40.519> this<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
banana and say that this is the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.229 
banana and say that this is the
definitely<00:02:42.290> not<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.500> shortage<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:44.030> we've<00:02:44.150> got

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
definitely not in shortage so we've got

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.520 
definitely not in shortage so we've got
a<00:02:44.269> nice<00:02:44.420> amount<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.780> pulp<00:02:45.019> here<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.440> we're

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
a nice amount of pulp here and we're

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.220 
a nice amount of pulp here and we're
going<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:46.390> now<00:02:47.390> mix<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.780> with<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.019> bit<00:02:48.140> of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
going to now mix this with a bit of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.100 
going to now mix this with a bit of
sawdust<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.700> mixer<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.780> take<00:02:50.989> this

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
sawdust in the mixer so take this

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.750 
sawdust in the mixer so take this
through<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.650> other<00:02:51.769> room<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:57.640> what<00:02:58.640> you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
through to the other room so what you

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.599 
through to the other room so what you
would<00:02:58.880> normally<00:02:59.000> do<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.569> in<00:03:00.349> Ronda<00:03:00.829> is<00:03:00.860> say<00:03:01.400> for

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
would normally do is in Ronda is say for

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.490 
would normally do is in Ronda is say for
example<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.060> Africa<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.079> put<00:03:03.290> in<00:03:03.410> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
example in Africa if you put in the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.740 
example in Africa if you put in the
stems<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.130> plant<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.549> dry<00:03:04.790> them<00:03:04.940> out<00:03:05.060> and

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
stems of the plant and dry them out and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.059 
stems of the plant and dry them out and
you<00:03:05.900> could<00:03:06.019> put<00:03:06.200> those<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.560> but<00:03:06.829> we<00:03:06.920> haven't

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
you could put those in but we haven't

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.280 
you could put those in but we haven't
got<00:03:07.250> any<00:03:07.480> here<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:08.720> we're<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:08.870> gonna<00:03:09.049> use

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
got any here so we're just gonna use

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500 
got any here so we're just gonna use
sawdust<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:10.970> going<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.150> put<00:03:11.269> a<00:03:11.299> small

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
sawdust so it's going to put a small

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:22.539 
sawdust so it's going to put a small
amount<00:03:11.569> in<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.310> we're<00:03:13.310> not<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:22.190> will<00:03:22.310> form<00:03:22.489> a

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
amount in the we're not that will form a

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.220 
amount in the we're not that will form a
nice<00:03:22.670> break<00:03:22.940> out<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.239> can<00:03:23.389> see<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:24.200> can

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
nice break out you can see it you can

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.680 
nice break out you can see it you can
mold<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.859> shape<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.239> can<00:03:26.359> compress

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
mold it and shape it so we can compress

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.449 
mold it and shape it so we can compress
that<00:03:26.900> really<00:03:27.260> nicely<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.799> force<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.190> really

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
that really nicely and force a really

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:38.970 
that really nicely and force a really
nice<00:03:28.780> like<00:03:29.780> ass

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.090 

the<00:03:39.980> reason<00:03:40.850> we're<00:03:41.030> using<00:03:41.060> an<00:03:41.959> instrument<00:03:42.170> to

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
the reason we're using an instrument to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.930 
the reason we're using an instrument to
compress<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.900> pulp<00:03:45.380> if<00:03:45.980> so<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.550> can<00:03:46.670> do<00:03:46.819> it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
compress and the pulp if so we can do it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.660 
compress and the pulp if so we can do it
in<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.810> very<00:03:47.930> controlled<00:03:48.380> way<00:03:48.440> we<00:03:49.250> can<00:03:49.430> do<00:03:49.580> it

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
in a very controlled way we can do it

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.420 
in a very controlled way we can do it
too<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:51.290> can<00:03:51.410> put<00:03:51.590> very<00:03:51.830> very<00:03:52.070> controlled

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
too we can put very very controlled

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.730 
too we can put very very controlled
amount<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.760> force<00:03:52.940> on<00:03:53.180> there<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:54.320> we<00:03:54.500> can<00:03:54.620> do

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
amount of force on there and we can do

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.620 
amount of force on there and we can do
it<00:03:54.860> as<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.250> very<00:03:55.700> very<00:03:55.820> controlled<00:03:56.090> rate<00:03:56.480> as

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
it as a very very controlled rate as

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.820 
it as a very very controlled rate as
well<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.620> we<00:03:57.740> can<00:03:57.890> make<00:03:59.440> identical<00:04:00.440> briquettes

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
well so we can make identical briquettes

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.430 
well so we can make identical briquettes
time<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.280> time<00:04:01.459> again<00:04:02.110> which<00:04:03.110> is<00:04:03.230> really

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
time and time again which is really

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.330 
time and time again which is really
important<00:04:03.830> if<00:04:03.920> you're<00:04:04.040> trying<00:04:04.070> to

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
important if you're trying to

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.550 
important if you're trying to
scientifically<00:04:04.910> test<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:06.230> combustion

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
scientifically test and the combustion

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:25.930 
scientifically test and the combustion
earth<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.610> briquettes

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.390 

now<00:04:26.510> we<00:04:26.570> have<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:28.400> banana<00:04:29.240> skin<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.900> sawdust

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
now we have a banana skin and sawdust

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.480 
now we have a banana skin and sawdust
briquettes<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:36.770> we<00:04:36.860> made<00:04:37.010> out<00:04:37.130> briquettes

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
briquettes so so we made out briquettes

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.100 
briquettes so so we made out briquettes
and<00:04:37.760> we're<00:04:38.390> just<00:04:38.480> going<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.690> put<00:04:38.840> them<00:04:38.960> into

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
and we're just going to put them into

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.420 
and we're just going to put them into
the<00:04:39.260> oven<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.500> dry<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.660> oven<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.900> just<00:04:42.200> at

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
the oven to dry so the oven is just at

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.930 
the oven to dry so the oven is just at
105<00:04:43.430> degrees<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:46.280> it's<00:04:46.430> not<00:04:46.550> going<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.760> start

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
105 degrees so it's not going to start

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.370 
105 degrees so it's not going to start
cooking<00:04:47.060> them<00:04:47.360> too<00:04:47.930> much<00:04:48.460> so<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:50.180> is<00:04:50.330> a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
cooking them too much so this is a

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.920 
cooking them too much so this is a
rather<00:04:51.380> deformed<00:04:52.370> banana<00:04:52.760> briquettes<00:04:53.270> that

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
rather deformed banana briquettes that

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.200 
rather deformed banana briquettes that
we<00:04:54.650> made<00:04:54.860> these<00:04:55.310> ones<00:04:55.550> will<00:04:55.700> actually<00:04:55.730> be<00:04:56.180> a

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
we made these ones will actually be a

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.150 
we made these ones will actually be a
lot<00:04:56.450> better<00:04:56.600> because<00:04:57.200> then<00:04:57.410> we<00:04:57.770> mix<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.130> with

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
lot better because then we mix it with

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.950 
lot better because then we mix it with
sawdust<00:04:58.580> this<00:04:58.850> was<00:04:58.970> just<00:04:59.150> pure<00:04:59.300> skins

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
sawdust this was just pure skins

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.950 
sawdust this was just pure skins
and<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.740> just<00:05:00.890> kind<00:05:01.100> of<00:05:01.160> shrinks<00:05:01.580> in<00:05:01.730> good

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.260 

so<00:05:05.560> this<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.860> our<00:05:06.009> banana<00:05:06.250> briquette<00:05:06.910> which<00:05:07.120> we

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
so this is our banana briquette which we

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.350 
so this is our banana briquette which we
made<00:05:07.479> earlier<00:05:08.110> as<00:05:09.070> it's<00:05:09.340> burning<00:05:09.550> here<00:05:10.150> and

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
made earlier as it's burning here and

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.629 
made earlier as it's burning here and
the<00:05:10.990> mass<00:05:11.169> is<00:05:11.320> decreasing<00:05:11.740> gases<00:05:12.400> have<00:05:12.520> been

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
the mass is decreasing gases have been

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.550 
the mass is decreasing gases have been
given<00:05:12.910> off<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.240> we're<00:05:13.389> locking<00:05:13.930> that<00:05:14.229> here

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
given off and we're locking that here

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.680 
given off and we're locking that here
this<00:05:15.100> is<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.310> thermocouple<00:05:15.669> we're<00:05:16.509> measuring

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
this is a thermocouple we're measuring

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.260 
this is a thermocouple we're measuring
the<00:05:16.870> temperature<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.500> flame<00:05:17.710> in<00:05:17.889> here<00:05:18.270> and

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
the temperature of the flame in here and

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.540 
the temperature of the flame in here and
as<00:05:19.479> as<00:05:19.990> it's<00:05:20.259> burning<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.860> gases<00:05:21.160> of<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.310> ging

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
as as it's burning the gases of the ging

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.790 
as as it's burning the gases of the ging
being<00:05:21.940> given<00:05:22.180> off<00:05:22.300> picked<00:05:23.110> up<00:05:23.259> by<00:05:23.410> this<00:05:23.470> hood

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
being given off picked up by this hood

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.520 
being given off picked up by this hood
here<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:25.240> they're<00:05:25.389> being<00:05:25.539> measured<00:05:25.750> by<00:05:26.139> this

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
here and they're being measured by this

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.370 
here and they're being measured by this
meter<00:05:26.830> here<00:05:27.900> it's<00:05:28.900> blending<00:05:29.169> really<00:05:29.259> well

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
meter here it's blending really well

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.760 
meter here it's blending really well
yeah<00:05:29.979> it's<00:05:30.460> burning<00:05:30.759> really<00:05:30.940> well<00:05:31.090> so<00:05:31.990> enough

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
yeah it's burning really well so enough

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.350 
yeah it's burning really well so enough
of<00:05:32.889> the<00:05:33.009> science<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.430> engineering<00:05:33.520> what

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
of the science and engineering what

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.029 
of the science and engineering what
we're<00:05:34.449> going<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.630> do<00:05:34.780> now<00:05:34.960> is<00:05:35.169> show<00:05:35.380> that<00:05:35.620> these

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
we're going to do now is show that these

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.469 
we're going to do now is show that these
briquettes<00:05:36.490> can<00:05:36.759> actually<00:05:37.090> cook<00:05:37.210> something

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
briquettes can actually cook something

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.320 
briquettes can actually cook something
and<00:05:37.840> what<00:05:38.349> better<00:05:38.560> thing<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:38.889> do<00:05:39.160> and<00:05:39.970> cook<00:05:40.180> up

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
and what better thing to do and cook up

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.689 
and what better thing to do and cook up
some<00:05:40.509> of<00:05:40.539> those<00:05:40.690> bananas<00:05:41.259> that<00:05:41.470> we<00:05:41.699> killed

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
some of those bananas that we killed

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:43.890 
some of those bananas that we killed
this<00:05:42.820> morning<00:05:42.970> so<00:05:43.389> this<00:05:43.479> is<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:43.630> banana

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
this morning so this is a banana

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.570 
this morning so this is a banana
briquette<00:05:44.289> that<00:05:44.380> we<00:05:44.440> made<00:05:44.620> earlier<00:05:45.130> in<00:05:45.340> goes

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
briquette that we made earlier in goes

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.930 
briquette that we made earlier in goes
to<00:05:45.759> banana<00:05:46.030> briquettes<00:05:50.370> so<00:05:51.370> we've<00:05:51.490> got<00:05:51.639> banana

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
to banana briquettes so we've got banana

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.140 
to banana briquettes so we've got banana
fritters<00:05:52.389> so<00:05:52.630> fried<00:05:53.560> banana<00:05:54.150> sandwiches

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
fritters so fried banana sandwiches

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.370 
fritters so fried banana sandwiches
we're<00:05:55.630> going<00:05:55.750> to<00:05:55.810> stick<00:05:55.990> them<00:05:56.080> between<00:05:56.199> two

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
we're going to stick them between two

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.540 
we're going to stick them between two
slices<00:05:56.770> of<00:05:57.009> bread<00:05:58.349> the<00:05:59.349> fact<00:05:59.590> is<00:05:59.710> is<00:05:59.889> it's<00:06:00.400> what

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
slices of bread the fact is is it's what

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.610 
slices of bread the fact is is it's what
I<00:06:00.580> do<00:06:00.669> is<00:06:01.120> what<00:06:01.330> they<00:06:01.419> do<00:06:01.479> in<00:06:01.570> Ghana<00:06:01.870> they<00:06:02.259> do<00:06:02.500> a

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
I do is what they do in Ghana they do a

in a few minutes so within a few minutes
we<00:06:19.000> put<00:06:19.210> our<00:06:19.360> briquettes<00:06:19.840> in<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.080> fire<00:06:20.289> and

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
we put our briquettes in the fire and

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.710 
we put our briquettes in the fire and
we're<00:06:21.070> cooking<00:06:21.460> banana<00:06:22.030> fritters<00:06:22.539> how

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
we're cooking banana fritters how

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:30.029 
we're cooking banana fritters how
amazing<00:06:23.349> is<00:06:23.470> that<00:06:28.440> actually<00:06:29.440> to<00:06:29.710> be<00:06:29.830> honest

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
I'm really happy to do this I've never

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.029 
I'm really happy to do this I've never
actually<00:06:31.599> done<00:06:31.810> this<00:06:31.960> before<00:06:34.620> that's<00:06:35.620> best

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
actually done this before that's best

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.390 
actually done this before that's best
bad<00:06:36.280> isn't<00:06:36.490> it<00:06:36.870> never<00:06:37.870> actually<00:06:38.159> burning<00:06:39.159> in

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
bad isn't it never actually burning in

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:54.080 
bad isn't it never actually burning in
real<00:06:39.550> life

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:05.490 

just<00:06:54.750> what<00:06:54.870> we<00:06:54.960> need
