00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.940
 Here I connected the boat first profit lil 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.800
 we cut along the perimeter 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.370
 to pull it all still on where 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.100
 pull back and then stripes 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.600
 such 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.840
 overlap overlap overlapped 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.320
 fiber with resin but this is not the main 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.380
 fortified the main mount will be inside 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.040
 being laid here is roughly speaking 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.180
 so just making money 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.820
 inside to make it smaller 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.890
 protruded outside to have to grind 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.820
 it was all the same 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:51.260
 slightly stands out so long as this 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.260
 what we do 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.949
 Here is such a punishment 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.030
 it's foam 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:23.460
 I then folded two layers of 300 ma to 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:28.220
 the foam did not bend anything so that she 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.350
 kept here we got this 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.810
 elastic 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.910
 I deliberately did not blow the kens there 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.070
 so you can have folded or something else 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.070
 so that the water does not get much inside 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:52.790
 rear similar so small 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:59.369
 recess a little but come such 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:01.050
 glue here overlap there of course 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.820
 we will not be very comfortable doing this 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:10.470
 but try and all the boat is almost ready 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.030
 page I decided to do is ready 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.640
 when a bunch is cut off evenly profit 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.910
 faces plywood then made and ribs 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:29.370
 stiffeness of foam over the canvas here 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.570
 boats and ready the only thing left 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.570
 make with creators 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:46.730
 closing start this when 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.640
 the boy quickly painted 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.970
 spray cans but so for the background then 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.970
 we will do with a stencil 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.210
 such a paddle turned out like this 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.780
 the shop is for the transport position 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.600
 go somewhere you can on the motor she 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.330
 moves back and forth and proper for 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.740
 hunters position it is shifted 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:25.130
 here so I go there shutters 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.130
 closing and all my boat 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.920
 took it all there is a miracle so read 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:38.640
 collect working time 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:41.340
 Well, maybe thirty or forty hours if 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.700
 do us five hours a day well for 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.170
 week can be done easily by principle 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.270
 considering that this is the first instance of such 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:56.660
 my boat turned out 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:04:01.860
 meter eighty long and 110 wide 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:04.280
 Iâ€™ll try to get a camera 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.280
 to establish 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:19.739
 it turns out like this I sit here like this 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:31.590
 I have a mushroom in it 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:31.590
 either with the motor sailed into place go and 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:42.130
 settled here a bed or yourself at home 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:46.590
 folded shut I'm lying watching duck 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.590
 thrive insulted and shoot 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.400
 my pretty 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.080
 Today we will go to experience learned 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.240
 so far waste it and do nothing 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.810
 I will not 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:05.560
 sash also test on water 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:08.639
 Well, let's see what happens thanks 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.639
 for your attention
