00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.770 
that is really low so when I open the
tile<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.700> move<00:02:44.909> out<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.329> way<00:02:45.359> they'll

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
tile to move out of the way they'll

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.380 
tile to move out of the way they'll
fight<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.109> one<00:02:46.609> kind<00:02:47.609> of<00:02:47.700> like<00:02:47.819> stay<00:02:48.150> behind

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
fight this one kind of like stay behind

as you can see I'm more
you<00:05:59.030> know<00:05:59.180> put<00:05:59.600> the<00:05:59.690> right<00:05:59.900> side<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.230> lane

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
you know put the right side of the lane

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.810 
you know put the right side of the lane
in<00:06:00.620> case<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.890> sparse<00:06:01.160> was<00:06:01.310> to<00:06:01.400> switch<00:06:01.610> lanes

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
in case the sparse was to switch lanes

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.430 
in case the sparse was to switch lanes
so<00:06:02.570> there's<00:06:02.750> a<00:06:02.780> lot<00:06:02.870> of<00:06:02.930> things<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.260> I'm

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
here i'm probably gonna go to the left

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.910 
here i'm probably gonna go to the left
most<00:06:11.300> out<00:06:11.480> of<00:06:11.510> this<00:06:11.630> Lane<00:06:11.840> go<00:06:12.140> to<00:06:12.200> the<00:06:12.350> cars<00:06:12.740> on

most out of this Lane go to the cars on
the<00:06:13.010> right<00:06:13.220> they<00:06:13.370> might<00:06:13.550> switch<00:06:13.730> lanes

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
the right they might switch lanes

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.559 
the right they might switch lanes
and<00:06:16.099> that's<00:06:16.280> just<00:06:16.340> the<00:06:16.550> way<00:06:16.729> i<00:06:16.759> ride<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.389> mean
