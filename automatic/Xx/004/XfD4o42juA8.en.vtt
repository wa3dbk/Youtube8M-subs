 developments at the new fifa 13 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.829
 opposite the current version 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.720
 we are with a brand new one 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.329
 philosophy approached the game 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.859

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.040
 leaves a lot of work is so in the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.010
 gameplay has been invested 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.419
 the gameplay is the soul of the game 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.549
 first touch control is the biggest 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.889
 innovation in the new fifa this year 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.930
 this is about how it behaves 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.879
 ball if you accept him how does he move 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.889
 what a twist he had and 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.190
 what does the player actually do? 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.569
 he runs sprints he determines all this 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.010
 whether the player controls the ball 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.870
 get or not 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.150

 filmed inspired by messi's in 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.409
 this year our testimonial is that 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.849
 complete dribbling system allows you 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.099
 the direct fight with the 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.659
 Defender or goalkeeper and worries 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.870
 for making sure you have the ball in front of you 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.099
 better shield against opponents 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.709
 a huge job was the a tec 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.739
 Intelligence the defender fight 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.329
 now with all the means around the ball 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.879
