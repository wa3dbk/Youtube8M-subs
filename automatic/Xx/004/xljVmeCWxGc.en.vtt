so comes in an envelope not a box cash a
little<00:00:24.150> piece<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.359> instructions<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.830> qu<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
little piece of instructions so qu and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.510 
little piece of instructions so qu and
the<00:00:27.810> main<00:00:27.990> islands<00:00:29.240> which<00:00:30.240> are<00:00:31.219> this<00:00:32.219> thing

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the main islands which are this thing

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.110 
the main islands which are this thing
which<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.120> put<00:00:33.570> your<00:00:33.690> oil<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.760> turn<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
which you put your oil in turn to the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.500 
which you put your oil in turn to the
tube<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.840> then<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.890> around<00:00:40.399> to<00:00:41.399> this

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
tube and then you can get around to this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.299 
tube and then you can get around to this
which<00:00:42.510> goes<00:00:42.780> either<00:00:42.989> side<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.710> chain

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
which goes either side of your chain

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.119 
which goes either side of your chain
sprocket<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.890> chain

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
sprocket so if that was your chain

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.000 
sprocket so if that was your chain
sprocket<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.789> would<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.559> like<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:52.010> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
sprocket it would be like that and you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.110 
sprocket it would be like that and you
turn<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:55.140> figure<00:00:55.469> ish<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:56.640> what<00:00:56.910> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
turn it on you figure ish and what you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.080 
turn it on you figure ish and what you
need<00:00:57.239> certain<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.809> by<00:00:58.550> measuring<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
need certain on by measuring and it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.410 
need certain on by measuring and it
delivers<00:01:00.359> oil<00:01:02.629> you<00:01:03.629> also<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:04.970> these<00:01:05.970> blocks

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
put in here very very simple think it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.620 
put in here very very simple think it
costs<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.610> thirty<00:01:35.670> five<00:01:36.180> euro

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
so I'll fit this on the bike at some

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.660 
so I'll fit this on the bike at some
stage<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:44.820> say<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.480> use<00:01:45.720> normal

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
stage and they say you can use normal

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.210 
stage and they say you can use normal
10w<00:01:47.900> 40<00:01:48.900> or<00:01:49.730> 20w50<00:01:50.840> oil<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.010> not

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
10w 40 or 20w50 oil in here it's not

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.050 
10w 40 or 20w50 oil in here it's not
fussy<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:55.010> and<00:01:56.010> it's<00:01:56.190> not<00:01:56.370> it's<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.880> same

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
fussy so and it's not it's not the same

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.150 
fussy so and it's not it's not the same
as<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> score<00:01:57.540> toiler<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.410> not<00:01:58.620> bad<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:59.040> on

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
as a score toiler it's not bad to be on

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.440 
as a score toiler it's not bad to be on
constantly<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.570> idea<00:02:01.050> here<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.440> if<00:02:01.920> you're<00:02:02.460> if

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
constantly the idea here is if you're if

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.790 
constantly the idea here is if you're if
you're<00:02:03.690> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.900> maintain<00:02:04.350> your<00:02:04.530> chain

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
you're going to maintain your chain

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.889 
you're going to maintain your chain
every<00:02:05.600> 400<00:02:06.600> kilometers<00:02:07.340> instead<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.899> stopping

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
every 400 kilometers instead of stopping

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.630 
every 400 kilometers instead of stopping
the<00:02:10.110> bike<00:02:10.290> lifting<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.190> back<00:02:11.370> wheel

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
instead of doing our left which do is

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.880 
instead of doing our left which do is
you<00:02:23.370> put<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:23.910> oil<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.239> here<00:02:24.739> you've<00:02:25.739> already

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.630 
it's empty fair enough if it's not empty
just<00:02:46.290> turn<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> off<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.830> when<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.280> get<00:02:47.430> going

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
just turn it off and when you get going

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.699 
just turn it off and when you get going
again<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.209> can<00:02:48.390> turn<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.570> back<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.870> again<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
again you can turn it back on again and

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.140 
again you can turn it back on again and
eventually<00:02:50.100> when<00:02:50.549> you're<00:02:50.670> finished<00:02:50.940> writing

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
eventually when you're finished writing

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.850 
eventually when you're finished writing
and<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.630> empty<00:02:51.900> that's<00:02:52.200> your<00:02:52.410> chain<00:02:52.620> loop

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
and this is empty that's your chain loop

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.390 
and this is empty that's your chain loop
it's<00:02:53.850> being<00:02:54.510> coded<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> new<00:02:55.230> layer<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:56.040> this

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
it's being coded a new layer of of this

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.220 
it's being coded a new layer of of this
stuff<00:02:56.670> whatever<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.450> have<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.600> put<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.019> here

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
stuff whatever you have to put in here

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.830 
stuff whatever you have to put in here
and<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.799> very<00:03:01.830> lazy<00:03:02.280> approach<00:03:02.580> but<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
and it's a very lazy approach but the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.280 
and it's a very lazy approach but the
nice<00:03:04.410> thing<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:05.040> about<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:06.170> if<00:03:07.170> you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
nice thing I like about it is if you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.229 
nice thing I like about it is if you
think<00:03:07.500> about<00:03:07.560> when<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:07.980> rains<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.730> lot<00:03:09.000> of

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
think about when it rains a lot of

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.930 
think about when it rains a lot of
people<00:03:09.450> avoid<00:03:09.690> going<00:03:09.930> out<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.290> rain<00:03:10.320> and

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
people avoid going out in the rain and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.190 
people avoid going out in the rain and
but<00:03:11.940> if<00:03:12.030> you're<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.269> me<00:03:12.420> go<00:03:12.690> at<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:12.959> whether

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
but if you're like me go at all whether

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.860 
but if you're like me go at all whether
as<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.560> commute<00:03:14.060> your<00:03:15.060> normal<00:03:15.450> chain<00:03:15.630> mate

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
as you commute your normal chain mate

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.750 
as you commute your normal chain mate
and<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.110> isn't<00:03:16.530> too<00:03:16.650> big<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.890> deal<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.400> when<00:03:17.670> it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
and it isn't too big a deal but when it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.490 
and it isn't too big a deal but when it
starts<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.150> rain<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.810> particularly<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.350> it's

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
starts to rain and particularly if it's

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.800 
starts to rain and particularly if it's
constantly<00:03:20.280> raining<00:03:20.489> you're<00:03:21.360> constantly

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
constantly raining you're constantly

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.500 
constantly raining you're constantly
having<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.500> look<00:03:23.070> after<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.519> chain<00:03:23.760> after<00:03:24.420> it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510

I'm forget about it where is we're there
with<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.100> normal<00:03:54.489> chain<00:03:54.850> lubrication<00:03:55.420> system

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
with the normal chain lubrication system

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.589 
with the normal chain lubrication system
you<00:03:56.140> would<00:03:56.700> you'd<00:03:57.700> have<00:03:57.850> to<00:03:58.000> get<00:03:58.150> off<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.420> bike

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
you would you'd have to get off the bike

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.610 
you would you'd have to get off the bike
and<00:03:59.760> try<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:01.030> cleaner<00:04:01.480> it's<00:04:02.170> still<00:04:02.350> need<00:04:02.530> to

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
and try it a cleaner it's still need to

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.140 
and try it a cleaner it's still need to
warm<00:04:02.800> up<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:02.950> channel<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.640> can't<00:04:03.910> do<00:04:04.030> it

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
warm up to channel you can't do it

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.300 
warm up to channel you can't do it
writing<00:04:04.690> because<00:04:05.019> it's<00:04:05.290> wet<00:04:05.440> alright<00:04:05.800> so

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
writing because it's wet alright so

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.100 
writing because it's wet alright so
that's<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.580> bit<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.819> problem<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.690> what<00:04:08.080> are

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
that's a bit of a problem so what are

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.559 
that's a bit of a problem so what are
you<00:04:08.200> going<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.410> do<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.010> hair<00:04:09.280> dryer<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.880> then

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
you going to do a hair dryer and then

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.270 
you going to do a hair dryer and then
you<00:04:10.690> have<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.959> do<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.440> chain<00:04:11.650> again<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.190> then

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
you have to do the chain again and then

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.009 
you have to do the chain again and then
of<00:04:12.400> course<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.730> Jewish<00:04:13.180> as<00:04:13.810> soon<00:04:13.989> as

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
of course you Jewish as soon as

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.420 
of course you Jewish as soon as
Australia<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.620> could<00:04:14.769> rain<00:04:14.950> again<00:04:15.250> and

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
Australia and I could rain again and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.940 
Australia and I could rain again and
you're<00:04:15.519> back<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.700> square<00:04:15.819> one<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:17.440> this<00:04:17.799> is

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
you're back to square one so and this is

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.479 
you're back to square one so and this is
quite<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.220> simple<00:04:18.430> idea<00:04:18.729> and<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:20.650> very<00:04:21.070> cheap

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
quite a simple idea and it's very cheap

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.560 
quite a simple idea and it's very cheap
it<00:04:22.419> doesn't<00:04:23.169> need<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.320> vacuum<00:04:23.889> or<00:04:24.610> electronics

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
it doesn't need a vacuum or electronics

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.270 
it doesn't need a vacuum or electronics
or<00:04:25.780> battery<00:04:26.139> pair<00:04:26.380> or<00:04:26.470> anything<00:04:26.889> to<00:04:27.010> make<00:04:27.100> it

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
or battery pair or anything to make it

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.840 
or battery pair or anything to make it
work<00:04:27.690> gravity<00:04:28.889> pipe<00:04:30.510> sprocket<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:32.640> so<00:04:33.640> I'll

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
work gravity pipe sprocket and so I'll

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.330 
work gravity pipe sprocket and so I'll
fit<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.479> bike<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:35.070> probably<00:04:36.070> should

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
fit this to the bike I probably should
