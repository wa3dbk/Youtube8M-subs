JavaScript<00:00:12.940> is<00:00:13.510> a<00:00:13.570> rather<00:00:13.900> cumbersome

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
JavaScript is a rather cumbersome

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.120 
JavaScript is a rather cumbersome
process<00:00:14.740> it's<00:00:15.730> much<00:00:15.940> simpler<00:00:16.449> in<00:00:16.720> jQuery<00:00:17.380> now

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
process it's much simpler in jQuery now

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.730 
process it's much simpler in jQuery now
I've<00:00:18.429> already<00:00:18.730> started<00:00:19.060> my<00:00:19.330> jQuery<00:00:20.080> script<00:00:20.529> in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
I've already started my jQuery script in

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.849 
I've already started my jQuery script in
this<00:00:21.099> page<00:00:21.699> I've<00:00:22.060> got<00:00:22.599> a<00:00:22.630> reference<00:00:23.199> to<00:00:23.560> the

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
this page I've got a reference to the

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.099 
this page I've got a reference to the
submit<00:00:24.460> button<00:00:24.490> which<00:00:25.089> I've<00:00:25.269> stored<00:00:25.689> in<00:00:25.960> the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
submit button which I've stored in the

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.210 
submit button which I've stored in the
variable<00:00:26.499> button<00:00:27.249> and<00:00:27.579> then<00:00:28.359> I've<00:00:28.509> used<00:00:28.539> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
variable button and then I've used the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.989 
variable button and then I've used the
jQuery<00:00:30.220> a<00:00:30.339> TDR

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:30.999 
jQuery a TDR

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.400 
jQuery a TDR
method<00:00:31.839> to<00:00:32.200> disable<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.370> submit<00:00:34.359> button<00:00:34.410> when

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
method to disable the submit button when

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.709 
method to disable the submit button when
the<00:00:35.559> form<00:00:35.800> is<00:00:36.039> loaded<00:00:36.579> so<00:00:37.210> I<00:00:37.239> need<00:00:37.449> to<00:00:37.570> get<00:00:37.660> a

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
the form is loaded so I need to get a

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.680 
the form is loaded so I need to get a
reference<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:38.590> radio<00:00:38.949> button<00:00:39.309> group<00:00:39.690> very

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
reference to the radio button group very

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.810 
reference to the radio button group very
often<00:00:41.050> when<00:00:41.260> you're<00:00:41.440> getting<00:00:41.949> reference<00:00:42.579> to

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
often when you're getting reference to

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.080 
often when you're getting reference to
elements<00:00:43.030> in<00:00:43.510> jQuery<00:00:44.350> you'll<00:00:45.070> use<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.519> ID<00:00:45.670> but

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
elements in jQuery you'll use the ID but

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.000 
elements in jQuery you'll use the ID but
you<00:00:46.210> can't<00:00:46.480> use<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.050> ID<00:00:47.199> in<00:00:47.559> this<00:00:47.739> case

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
you can't use the ID in this case

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.799 
you can't use the ID in this case
because<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.730> idea<00:00:49.090> of<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.239> first<00:00:49.480> radio

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
because the idea of the first radio

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.080 
because the idea of the first radio
button<00:00:50.109> in<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.469> group<00:00:50.679> is<00:00:50.920> agree<00:00:51.340> terms<00:00:51.550> zero

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
button in the group is agree terms zero

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.840 
button in the group is agree terms zero
and<00:00:52.359> of<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.050> second<00:00:53.410> one<00:00:53.589> is<00:00:53.829> agree<00:00:54.160> terms<00:00:54.429> one

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
and of the second one is agree terms one

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.650 
and of the second one is agree terms one
that's<00:00:55.719> because<00:00:56.199> you<00:00:56.440> can<00:00:56.589> only<00:00:57.129> use<00:00:57.760> an<00:00:58.149> ID

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
that's because you can only use an ID

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.650 
that's because you can only use an ID
once<00:00:59.350> on<00:00:59.559> a<00:00:59.620> page<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.179> way<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.359> get<00:01:01.629> a

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
once on a page so the way to get a

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.900 
once on a page so the way to get a
reference<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.469> a<00:01:02.499> radio<00:01:02.920> button<00:01:03.129> group<00:01:03.399> is<00:01:03.609> to

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
reference to a radio button group is to

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.859 
reference to a radio button group is to
use<00:01:04.030> an<00:01:04.180> attribute<00:01:04.720> selector<00:01:05.350> using<00:01:06.250> its<00:01:06.430> name

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
use an attribute selector using its name

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.230 
use an attribute selector using its name
because<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.320> radio<00:01:08.710> button<00:01:09.130> group<00:01:09.400> uses<00:01:10.030> the

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
because the radio button group uses the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.770 
because the radio button group uses the
same<00:01:10.479> name<00:01:10.930> in<00:01:11.710> each<00:01:12.189> button<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:13.360> let's<00:01:13.540> create

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
same name in each button so let's create

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.219 
same name in each button so let's create
a<00:01:13.930> jQuery<00:01:14.590> object<00:01:14.829> that<00:01:15.960> references<00:01:16.960> the

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
a jQuery object that references the

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.380 
a jQuery object that references the
radio<00:01:17.710> button<00:01:18.070> group

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.820 

the<00:01:21.170> input<00:01:21.800> tag<00:01:22.190> followed<00:01:23.090> by<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.830> name

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the input tag followed by a name

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.410 
the input tag followed by a name
attribute<00:01:25.460> with<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.270> value<00:01:26.980> agree<00:01:27.980> terms

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.010 

and<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:31.500> need<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.920> add<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.430> change<00:01:33.000> event<00:01:33.360> handler

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and I need to add a change event handler

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.360 
and I need to add a change event handler
to<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.710> period<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:35.850> change<00:01:37.370> and

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
to that so period and then change and

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.580 
to that so period and then change and
I'm<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> select<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.780> third<00:01:40.260> option

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
I'm going to select the third option

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.290 
I'm going to select the third option
down<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> Dreamweaver<00:01:42.800> inserts

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
down here so that Dreamweaver inserts

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.120 
down here so that Dreamweaver inserts
automatically<00:01:45.300> an<00:01:45.479> anonymous<00:01:46.410> function<00:01:46.619> for

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
automatically an anonymous function for

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.660 
automatically an anonymous function for
me<00:01:48.170> inside<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.440> anonymous<00:01:49.890> function<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.460> need

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
me inside the anonymous function I need

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.020 
me inside the anonymous function I need
to<00:01:51.150> create<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.840> conditional<00:01:52.470> statement<00:01:53.030> that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
to create a conditional statement that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.870 
to create a conditional statement that
checks<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> value<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:56.130> selected

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
checks what the value of the selected

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.270 
checks what the value of the selected
radio<00:01:57.240> button<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> if<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.950> then<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
radio button is so if and then to get a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.990 
radio button is so if and then to get a
reference<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.660> radio<00:02:04.440> button<00:02:04.860> I'm<00:02:05.340> going

reference to the radio button I'm going

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.650 
reference to the radio button I'm going
to<00:02:06.119> use<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.690> this<00:02:07.170> keyword<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.489> wrap<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to use the this keyword but wrap it in a

jQuery object the reason I'm doing that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.390 
jQuery object the reason I'm doing that
is<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:15.269> want<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.870> able<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.230> use<00:02:16.530> the

is because I want to be able to use the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
button that has been selected if you

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.300 
button that has been selected if you
just<00:02:32.430> use<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.420> keyword<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.350> its<00:02:34.500> own<00:02:34.739> you

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
just use the this keyword on its own you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.990 
just use the this keyword on its own you
can't<00:02:35.640> apply<00:02:36.200> jQuery<00:02:37.200> methods<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
can't apply jQuery methods to it and the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.569 
can't apply jQuery methods to it and the
way<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.540> getting<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.260> value<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.100> so

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
way of getting the value is just so

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.050 
way of getting the value is just so
incredibly<00:02:42.540> simple<00:02:43.049> in<00:02:43.380> jQuery<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.640> it

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
incredibly simple in jQuery that's it

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.640 
incredibly simple in jQuery that's it
that<00:02:45.540> will<00:02:45.690> get<00:02:45.810> me<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.079> value<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that will get me the value of the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.100 
that will get me the value of the
selected<00:02:47.459> radio<00:02:47.700> button<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> need<00:02:48.959> to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
selected radio button so I need to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.560 
selected radio button so I need to
compare<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.700> value<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.209> want

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
compare it with the value that I want

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.280 
compare it with the value that I want
which<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.739> yes<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:54.660> create<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> code

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
which is yes and then create a code

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.520 
which is yes and then create a code
block<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.220> code<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.120> want<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.390> be

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
block for the code that you want to be

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.310 
block for the code that you want to be
executed<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.489> selected<00:03:00.390> radio<00:03:00.600> button<00:03:01.079> is

executed if the selected radio button is
yes<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> want<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.680> remove<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.130> disabled

submit button is stored in the button

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.319
