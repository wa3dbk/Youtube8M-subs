00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
goes by so quickly and I think man if we

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.840 
goes by so quickly and I think man if we
if<00:03:03.140> we<00:03:03.200> could<00:03:03.440> just<00:03:03.590> get<00:03:03.739> that<00:03:03.860> across<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.760> I

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
if we could just get that across if I

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
could get that across I think that would

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.770 
could get that across I think that would
take<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.380> lot<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.590> pressure<00:03:06.860> off<00:03:06.980> moms<00:03:07.660> who<00:03:08.660> have

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
take a lot of pressure off moms who have

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.600 
take a lot of pressure off moms who have
put<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.080> much<00:03:09.200> pressure<00:03:09.260> upon<00:03:09.769> themselves

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
put so much pressure upon themselves

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.820 
put so much pressure upon themselves
I<00:03:10.640> hate<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.269> get<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.660> end<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.080> think<00:03:12.320> wow<00:03:12.799> I

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
I hate to get to the end and think wow I

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.949 
I hate to get to the end and think wow I
taught<00:03:13.160> him<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:13.549> much<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.480> missed<00:03:14.780> out<00:03:14.930> on
