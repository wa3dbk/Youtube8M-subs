00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.730
 a warm welcome to one 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.889
 little tutorial today I want you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.540
 show how to do something like that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.470
 small snack machines and that 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.539
 he works so we press here 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.029
 on it and down here comes 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.550
 Fried chicken is also possible 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.010
 with steak and pork it comes 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.240
 just everything down here in the crate out 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.529
 is a very simple construction 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.610
 you do not need to be tired 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.309
 stone for that looks like the whole of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.379
 back and here we can there's the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.460
 Fill things are just as drinne 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.980
 everything can be done 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.440
 that's exactly how the whole thing looks at the end 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.180
 I'll just show you how 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 that works how to build that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.899
 that you press on it and there is a stack 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.039
 rauskommt delete was that time here 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.340
 we already do the things we need 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.260
 Not much just a few donors 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.299
 but now only since 16 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.920
 two donors before that were the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.960
 troupe with her also knows what I mean 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.270
 knÃ¶pfe richter i have iron now 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.130
 I think you can do that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.900
 Take what you want for that since 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.430
 I found that was on now 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.740
 it is also beautiful 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.380
 rock wool so it does not matter 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.920
 then we need the shilton frame 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.909
 apple with peace and a monastery that was 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.640
 actually need more 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.840
 we do not do that and preorder it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.590
 Let's go here now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:45.270
 our troupe and set three 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.960
 one another and another direction exactly 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.000
 the same 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.950
 the body gets its successive 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.799
 put by your ship so pushes 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.880
 you can get enough 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.590
 So you can do everything on this troupe 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.119
 can also be set up at workbenches and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.810
 so on then first the crate the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.790
 We present here one offset 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.469
 then we take the name of the judge 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.880
 to the crate so that he is with 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.120
 the box connects 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.200
 and then again by ship click on the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.000
 funnel on it we get up here and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.050
 again with shift look the funnel there 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.580
 sit upstairs 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.110
 that then looks like that 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.330
 funnel in the runs and the sat 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.380
 Judge in the box That 's it 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.550
 actually that is already now 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.480
 all the technical stuff then 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:37.350
 we dress up the whole with how to travel 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.760
 I'll take blocks here now if I can 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.120
 here now a ice block down court 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.250
 the crate does not open and one level 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.670
 i can show you the tomb it is 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.020
 then yes no matter what material you 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.300
 So even if I use now a 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.080
 take wood that just looks stupid 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.710
 find 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.770
 that's not my taste 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.180
 That's why I take the monastery below 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.290
 you can still get the chest 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.710
 so then we make the buttons here 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.360
 down 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.810
 It is very important that we are here 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.430
 So get there exactly at the blog are 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.400
 who is in front of these hits and there too 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.250
 still there we now make a sign in 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.570
 the writing was done on it 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.120
 then exactly what we see straight to 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.930
 So here's a little deco has 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.900
 a frame 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.250
 because the sign is still so he is actually 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.459
 Basically, the thing is already 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.690
 now we can do ours here 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.150
 I do not pack apples 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.330
 I also took books with me 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.540
 we took it here with us 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.770
 just divide something so easy 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.680
 and if the match stands for chicken 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.330
 it does not matter 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.630
 We write here in short chicken 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.630
 tuned 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:09.030
 whoops so munich 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.770
 then the whole thing is already done 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.330
 if I can push on it now 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.670
 I take out main april down here 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.200
 But press it can not not be here 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.840
 why take out a chicken at the 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.920
 Of course, that does not happen at all 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.700
 only works because we are empty 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.910
 that was already the whole thing 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:32.360
 magic around these snack machines like hers 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.160
 see you need 6.3 funnels 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.810
 any blog you take 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.440
 wanted and disguise the whole six 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.850
 buttons and the stuff and the chest is 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.580
 The rest is really important 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.500
 not important because you could be here 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.910
 take everything is it does not matter there 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.250
 now just take me or stone 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.490
 wood or so it works with 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.310
 all the materials that the buttons are 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.720
 then through to the group yes 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.650
 that was it already from the snack 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.560
 machines 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.290
 I said a little tutorial myself 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.360
 Hope you liked it and we see 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.470
 then in one of my next videos 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.470
 until george a
