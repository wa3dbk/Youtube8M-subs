while ago with creepers nemesis who is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.710 
while ago with creepers nemesis who is
an<00:00:16.350> awesome<00:00:16.830> cannon<00:00:17.220> designer<00:00:17.580> by<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.850> way<00:00:18.029> he

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
an awesome cannon designer by the way he

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.480 
an awesome cannon designer by the way he
has<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.230> pretty<00:00:19.380> neat<00:00:19.619> stuff<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
has some pretty neat stuff out that and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.170 
has some pretty neat stuff out that and
I<00:00:21.359> never<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.740> got<00:00:22.859> around<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.400> making<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
I never really got around to making it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.630 
I never really got around to making it
but<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:26.070> turned<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.580> pretty

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
but now I have and it turned out pretty

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.529 
but now I have and it turned out pretty
good<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.539> completely

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
good I think it is completely

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.760 
good I think it is completely
controllable<00:00:31.399> we<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.960> back<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
controllable we have at the back here to

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
moment this is this side is on strength

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
moment this is this side is on strength
one<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.300> sides<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.750> strength<00:00:40.079> zero<00:00:40.500> and

one and that sides on strength zero and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.310 
one and that sides on strength zero and
if<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:41.010> fire<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.940> cannon<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:42.660> which<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.170> this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
button you can see that the TNT will

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.430 
button you can see that the TNT will
just<00:00:46.469> sort<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.010> hop<00:00:47.280> off<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.520> edge<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.719> barely

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
just sort of hop off the edge it barely

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.549 
just sort of hop off the edge it barely
even<00:00:49.649> makes<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:52.020> I'll<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.289> drop

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
even makes it and that I'll just drop

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.100 
even makes it and that I'll just drop
down<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.910> increase<00:00:54.270> each<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.960> these

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
down but we can increase each of these

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.500 
down but we can increase each of these
sides<00:00:55.500> power<00:00:55.980> all<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> way<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> seven

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
sides power all the way up to seven

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.439 
sides power all the way up to seven
that's<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.770> three<00:00:59.340> now<00:00:59.670> we'll<00:01:00.000> leave<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.329> at

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that's a three now we'll leave that at

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.650 
that's a three now we'll leave that at
three<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.379> boom<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.699> seven<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
three and boom this one up to seven and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.890 
three and boom this one up to seven and
the<00:01:05.360> controls<00:01:06.360> basically<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:09.720> can

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the controls basically you just you can

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.100 
the controls basically you just you can
flick<00:01:10.200> them<00:01:10.470> short<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:14.420> off<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
flick them short to get just one off and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260 
flick them short to get just one off and
you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.799> leave<00:01:17.009> them<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.729> increase<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you can leave them down to increase it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
you can leave them down to increase it
over<00:01:18.540> time<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.520> now<00:01:20.580> that's

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
over time and if we do this now that's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.969 
over time and if we do this now that's
seven<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.810> side<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.380> three<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
seven on that side and three on this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.800 
seven on that side and three on this
side<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.640> should<00:01:23.820> go<00:01:23.970> flying<00:01:24.270> off<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
side so it should go flying off in that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
side so it should go flying off in that
direction<00:01:24.869> oh<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.810> wasn't<00:01:28.159> proper<00:01:29.159> button

I<00:01:56.570> if<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.979> these

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
I if you see there we have all of these

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.889 
I if you see there we have all of these
on<00:01:59.880> full<00:02:00.630> power<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:02.340> TNT<00:02:02.969> went<00:02:03.299> slightly

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
on full power and the TNT went slightly

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.209 
on full power and the TNT went slightly
off<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.259> direction<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.040> is

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
off in that direction and this is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.010 
off in that direction and this is
reproducible<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.180> will<00:02:06.360> happen<00:02:06.659> every

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
reproducible this will happen every

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.740 
reproducible this will happen every
single<00:02:07.229> time<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:09.300> TNT<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.110> balanced<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
single time if the TNT is balanced the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.460 
single time if the TNT is balanced the
shot<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:13.200> all

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
shot will all

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.210 
shot will all
with<00:02:13.590> fire<00:02:13.980> off<00:02:14.370> slightly<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.270> left<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
with fire off slightly to the left and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.060 
with fire off slightly to the left and
possibly<00:02:17.220> very<00:02:17.730> much<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.480> left<00:02:18.630> down<00:02:19.560> here

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
possibly very much to the left down here

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.920 
possibly very much to the left down here
we<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.520> third<00:02:20.910> control<00:02:21.360> which<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.660> this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
we have a third control which is this

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.460 
we have a third control which is this
final<00:02:22.410> repeater<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.880> set<00:02:24.090> between

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
final repeater this can be set between

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.460 
final repeater this can be set between
four<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.800> one<00:02:26.580> ticks<00:02:27.000> if<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:27.630> set<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.050> one

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
four and one ticks if we set this to one

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.760 
four and one ticks if we set this to one
tick<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.810> attitude<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
tick we can see that the attitude of the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.070 
tick we can see that the attitude of the
shot<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.340> much<00:02:32.910> lower<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.390> because<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
shot is much lower that is because the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.160 
shot is much lower that is because the
TNT<00:02:37.590> has<00:02:37.860> landed<00:02:38.610> back<00:02:38.850> on<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.240> dispenser<00:02:39.600> by

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
TNT has landed back on this dispenser by

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.400 
TNT has landed back on this dispenser by
the<00:02:40.230> time<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.070> charge<00:02:41.430> fires<00:02:42.410> obviously

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
the time that the charge fires obviously

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.430 
the time that the charge fires obviously
this<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.710> only<00:02:43.860> semi-automatic<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.440> don't

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
this is only semi-automatic I don't

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.420 
this is only semi-automatic I don't
think<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.740> could<00:02:46.890> make<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.220> fully

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
think you could make this fully

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.500 
think you could make this fully
automatic<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.090> tried<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.870> before<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.850> well<00:02:50.850> you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
automatic I tried it before and well you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.290 
automatic I tried it before and well you
could<00:02:51.690> make<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:52.020> fire<00:02:52.290> every<00:02:52.830> four<00:02:53.520> seconds

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
could make it fire every four seconds

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.290 
could make it fire every four seconds
but<00:02:54.630> I'm<00:02:55.459> not<00:02:56.459> massively<00:02:56.850> impressive<00:02:59.030> yeah<00:03:00.030> I

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
but I'm not massively impressive yeah I

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.760 
but I'm not massively impressive yeah I
don't<00:03:00.540> think<00:03:00.750> there's<00:03:00.990> much<00:03:01.260> else<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.560> say

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
don't think there's much else to say

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.680 
don't think there's much else to say
except<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.280> simple<00:03:02.700> explanation<00:03:02.940> now<00:03:03.420> I'm<00:03:03.510> not

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
except a simple explanation now I'm not

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.150 
except a simple explanation now I'm not
going<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:04.260> through<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> full<00:03:04.770> thing<00:03:04.980> here

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
going to go through the full thing here

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.740 
going to go through the full thing here
there<00:03:05.310> will<00:03:05.400> be<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.580> link<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.940> tutorial<00:03:06.180> video

there will be a link to a tutorial video

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.270 
there will be a link to a tutorial video
in<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.080> doobly-doo<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.680> at<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.860> end<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.130> the

video which will explain everything

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.300 
video which will explain everything
fully<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.530> show<00:03:10.740> you<00:03:10.800> how<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.010> put<00:03:11.250> it

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
fully and show you how to put it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.570 
fully and show you how to put it
together<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:11.910> basically<00:03:12.630> down<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:13.890> we<00:03:14.250> have

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
together but basically down here we have

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.350 
together but basically down here we have
two<00:03:15.120> memory<00:03:15.330> cells<00:03:15.690> which<00:03:16.470> are<00:03:17.360> hexadecimal

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
two memory cells which are hexadecimal

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.600 
two memory cells which are hexadecimal
well<00:03:19.260> they're<00:03:19.590> not<00:03:19.650> actually<00:03:20.040> hexadecimal

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
well they're not actually hexadecimal

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.270 
well they're not actually hexadecimal
even<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.180> SAP<00:03:21.900> till<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.350> suppose<00:03:22.739> if<00:03:22.980> they<00:03:23.130> go

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
even the SAP till I suppose if they go

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.000 
even the SAP till I suppose if they go
up<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.480> seven<00:03:24.510> oh<00:03:24.660> no<00:03:25.350> they'll<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.650> octal

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
up to seven oh no they'll be octal

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.860 
up to seven oh no they'll be octal
because<00:03:26.280> they<00:03:26.400> go<00:03:26.489> from<00:03:26.670> zero<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.000> seven<00:03:27.330> but

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
because they go from zero to seven but

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.650 
because they go from zero to seven but
anyway<00:03:28.200> that's<00:03:28.350> irrelevant<00:03:28.830> their<00:03:29.660> signal

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
anyway that's irrelevant their signal

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.620 
anyway that's irrelevant their signal
strength<00:03:30.989> cells<00:03:31.590> memory<00:03:32.340> cells<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.970> if<00:03:33.390> we

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
strength cells memory cells and if we

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.690 
strength cells memory cells and if we
were<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.110> retract<00:03:34.830> this<00:03:34.950> piston<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.400> remove

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
were to retract this piston and remove

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.100 
were to retract this piston and remove
this<00:03:35.880> block<00:03:36.120> here<00:03:36.330> we<00:03:36.480> can<00:03:36.630> see<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.959> the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
this block here we can see that the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.350 
this block here we can see that the
strength<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.530> redstone<00:03:38.280> current<00:03:39.090> here

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
strength of the redstone current here

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.449 
strength of the redstone current here
decays<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:41.610> push<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:42.570> piston<00:03:43.170> and

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
decays and if we push this piston and

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.090 
decays and if we push this piston and
move<00:03:44.459> this<00:03:44.700> block<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.540> here<00:03:45.870> we<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:46.709> see<00:03:46.890> that

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
move this block to here we can see that

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.870 
move this block to here we can see that
the<00:03:47.280> strength<00:03:48.200> increases<00:03:49.250> all<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.310> way<00:03:50.580> up<00:03:50.730> to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
the strength increases all the way up to

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.690 
the strength increases all the way up to
seven<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.390> will<00:03:51.570> stop<00:03:51.780> at<00:03:51.930> seven<00:03:52.230> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
seven it will stop at seven and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.370 
seven it will stop at seven and
basically<00:03:53.700> that's<00:03:53.970> how<00:03:54.060> these<00:03:54.510> two<00:03:54.840> controls

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
basically that's how these two controls

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.780 
basically that's how these two controls
work<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.010> then<00:03:56.670> when<00:03:57.090> we<00:03:57.239> fire<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:58.170> just

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
work and then when we fire it just

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.340 
work and then when we fire it just
retracts<00:03:59.790> these<00:04:00.120> two<00:04:00.420> Pistons<00:04:00.900> here<00:04:01.140> which

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
retracts these two Pistons here which

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.580 
retracts these two Pistons here which
allows<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.010> state<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:03.180> be<00:04:03.330> transmitted<00:04:04.110> into
