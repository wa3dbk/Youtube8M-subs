hi guys so we are marine sciences and

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.830 
hi guys so we are marine sciences and
we've<00:00:14.619> learned<00:00:14.860> lots<00:00:15.250> of<00:00:15.459> basic<00:00:15.670> truths<00:00:16.180> with

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
we've learned lots of basic truths with

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.330 
we've learned lots of basic truths with
the<00:00:16.960> key<00:00:17.110> by<00:00:17.349> itself<00:00:17.619> and<00:00:17.919> that<00:00:18.070> we<00:00:18.160> also

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
the key by itself and that we also

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.890 
the key by itself and that we also
learned<00:00:18.669> a<00:00:18.759> lot<00:00:18.880> to<00:00:19.090> lose<00:00:19.270> that<00:00:19.599> kind<00:00:19.869> of

one<00:00:43.910> is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
one is

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.130 
one is
only<00:00:44.770> head

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.380 

so<00:00:47.710> go<00:00:47.890> back<00:00:48.040> to<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.340> video<00:00:48.520> of<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:49.030> basics

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
so go back to the video of the basics

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.210 
so go back to the video of the basics
Turtles<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:49.990> learn<00:00:50.170> this<00:00:50.440> one<00:00:50.710> with<00:00:50.920> all<00:00:51.130> the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
Turtles to learn this one with all the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.340 
Turtles to learn this one with all the
other<00:00:51.400> tourists<00:00:52.000> okay<00:00:52.240> once<00:00:52.900> you<00:00:53.080> get<00:00:53.200> this

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
other tourists okay once you get this

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.980 
other tourists okay once you get this
one<00:00:53.680> then<00:00:54.490> we<00:00:54.760> are<00:00:54.910> going<00:00:55.150> to<00:00:55.270> need<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.840> add

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
one then we are going to need to add

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.050 
one then we are going to need to add
another<00:00:56.320> move<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:56.830> it<00:00:57.160> so<00:00:57.250> it<00:00:57.430> looks<00:00:57.640> like<00:00:57.790> this

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
another move to it so it looks like this

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.430 
another move to it so it looks like this
I'll<00:00:58.300> show<00:00:58.450> you<00:00:58.510> get<00:00:58.720> through<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:58.990> first<00:00:59.080> man

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
I'll show you get through the first man

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.840 
I'll show you get through the first man
will<00:00:59.560> break<00:00:59.710> it<00:00:59.860> down<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.460> it's<00:01:00.580> going<00:01:00.700> to<00:01:00.790> look

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
will break it down so it's going to look

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.429 
will break it down so it's going to look
like<00:01:01.030> this<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.840> then<00:01:02.530> like<00:01:02.710> this

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.230 

so<00:01:05.979> what<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.369> actually<00:01:06.490> looks<00:01:06.729> like<00:01:06.999> it's

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
so what it actually looks like it's

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.309 
so what it actually looks like it's
almost<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.659> people<00:01:07.929> would<00:01:08.020> have<00:01:08.049> either

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:08.319 
almost the people would have either

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.230 
almost the people would have either
eight<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.609> funny<00:01:09.789> thing<00:01:09.969> about<00:01:10.030> this

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
eight and the funny thing about this

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.849 
eight and the funny thing about this
figure<00:01:10.390> each<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.840> with<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.079> boxy<00:01:11.439> grace<00:01:11.619> on<00:01:11.770> a

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
figure each and with a boxy grace on a

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.529 
figure each and with a boxy grace on a
ferrule<00:01:12.219> to<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.429> wall<00:01:12.640> para<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.179> the<00:01:13.270> floor

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
ferrule to the wall para to the floor

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.539 
ferrule to the wall para to the floor
built<00:01:13.869> in<00:01:14.020> your<00:01:14.109> chest<00:01:14.380> whatever<00:01:14.829> but<00:01:15.429> this

built in your chest whatever but this
one<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.789> kind<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:15.969> like<00:01:16.090> yeah<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.240> want<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.509> to

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:16.569 
one is kind of like yeah I want you to

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:17.999 
one is kind of like yeah I want you to
think<00:01:16.719> about<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:16.960> kind<00:01:17.079> of<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.259> parallel<00:01:17.679> to<00:01:17.859> the

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
think about is kind of a parallel to the

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.239 
think about is kind of a parallel to the
ceiling<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.880> ground<00:01:19.469> so<00:01:20.469> there's<00:01:21.189> a

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
ceiling and the ground so there's a

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:24.510 
ceiling and the ground so there's a
circle<00:01:21.880> on<00:01:22.719> the<00:01:22.780> ceiling<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:24.219> then<00:01:24.340> this

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
circle on the ceiling and then this

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.999 
circle on the ceiling and then this
should<00:01:24.729> show<00:01:24.939> up<00:01:25.060> on<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.390> ground<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:26.259> that's

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
should show up on the ground and that's

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.390 
should show up on the ground and that's
your<00:01:27.280> figure<00:01:27.609> eight

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
your figure eight

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700 
your figure eight
on<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.820> ground<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.300> then<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.840> crossing<00:01:31.260> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
on the ground and then you crossing the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.550 
on the ground and then you crossing the
switch<00:01:32.340> photo<00:01:32.670> circles<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:34.290> sounds<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
switch photo circles that sounds a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.660 
switch photo circles that sounds a
little<00:01:34.650> funny<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.430> what

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
little funny but that's really what

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.400 
little funny but that's really what
we're<00:01:35.850> doing<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.300> so<00:01:36.810> we're<00:01:37.050> gonna<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.380> two

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
pushing the head nice and straight then

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.480 
pushing the head nice and straight then
pushing<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.560> back

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
pushing the back

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.399 
pushing the back
so<00:02:01.030> we're<00:02:01.210> gonna<00:02:01.299> be<00:02:01.479> switching<00:02:01.750> every<00:02:02.260> two

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
so we're gonna be switching every two

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.750 
so we're gonna be switching every two
counts<00:02:02.830> we're<00:02:02.920> gonna<00:02:03.010> be<00:02:03.130> switching<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.520> body

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
counts we're gonna be switching the body

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.080 
counts we're gonna be switching the body
position<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.810> 1<00:02:05.140> &amp;<00:02:05.440> 2<00:02:05.770> 3<00:02:06.369> &amp;<00:02:06.520> 4<00:02:06.729> 1<00:02:07.390> &amp;<00:02:07.840> 2<00:02:08.110> 3<00:02:08.590> &amp;<00:02:09.280> 4<00:02:09.520> &amp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
position so 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 &amp;

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.760 
position so 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 &amp;
the<00:02:10.360> way<00:02:10.479> I'm<00:02:10.690> doing<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.260> simply<00:02:11.650> by

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
the way I'm doing that is simply by

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.050 
the way I'm doing that is simply by
taking<00:02:12.130> two<00:02:12.310> steps<00:02:12.550> I'm<00:02:12.790> gonna<00:02:12.940> actually

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
taking two steps I'm gonna actually

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.780 
taking two steps I'm gonna actually
literally<00:02:13.630> walking<00:02:14.020> okay<00:02:14.640> nothing<00:02:15.640> really

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
literally walking okay nothing really

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.320 
literally walking okay nothing really
too<00:02:16.000> complicated<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.810> no<00:02:17.020> happy<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:18.060> sorry<00:02:19.060> I'm

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
too complicated so no happy is sorry I'm

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.760 
too complicated so no happy is sorry I'm
gonna<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.690> like<00:02:19.840> watch<00:02:20.050> my<00:02:20.260> feet<00:02:20.530> here

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
gonna have you like watch my feet here

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.559 
gonna have you like watch my feet here
so<00:02:21.100> I'm<00:02:22.090> gonna<00:02:22.239> start<00:02:22.510> straight<00:02:22.900> 1<00:02:23.680> &amp;<00:02:23.950> 2<00:02:24.400> 3<00:02:25.030> &amp;<00:02:25.209> 4

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
so I'm gonna start straight 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:33.460 
so I'm gonna start straight 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4
1<00:02:26.260> &amp;<00:02:26.860> 2<00:02:27.130> 3<00:02:27.730> &amp;<00:02:28.600> 4<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:29.830> walk<00:02:30.250> forward<00:02:30.930> walk<00:02:31.930> back

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 so walk forward walk back

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.880 
1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 so walk forward walk back
walk<00:02:34.070> forward<00:02:34.600> one<00:02:35.600> that's<00:02:36.020> really<00:02:36.620> simple

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
walk forward one that's really simple

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.260 
walk forward one that's really simple
two<00:02:37.250> steps<00:02:37.700> right<00:02:38.350> left<00:02:39.350> right<00:02:39.740> left<00:02:40.460> or

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
two steps right left right left or

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.700 
two steps right left right left or
that's<00:02:41.480> right<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.870> really<00:02:41.960> does<00:02:42.230> not<00:02:42.440> matter

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
that's right it really does not matter

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.680 
that's right it really does not matter
which<00:02:43.310> one<00:02:43.460> you<00:02:43.580> started<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.030> whatever<00:02:44.420> you

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
which one you started just whatever you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.730 
which one you started just whatever you
feel<00:02:44.870> comfortable<00:02:44.930> with

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
feel comfortable with

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.380 
feel comfortable with
so<00:02:46.010> it's<00:02:46.190> really<00:02:46.460> that<00:02:46.610> simple<00:02:46.640> how<00:02:47.330> you

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
so it's really that simple how you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.810 
so it's really that simple how you
switch<00:02:47.750> position<00:02:48.230> forward<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.160> back

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
switch position forward and back

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.260 
switch position forward and back
think<00:02:50.450> about<00:02:50.630> your<00:02:50.750> footwork<00:02:51.200> steady<00:02:51.740> still

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
think about your footwork steady still

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.520 
think about your footwork steady still
pushing<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.390> back<00:02:53.570> one<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.440> two

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.229 

okay<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.920> get<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.250> footwork<00:02:59.579> first<00:02:59.909> and<00:03:00.150> then

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
okay so get that footwork first and then

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.970 
okay so get that footwork first and then
from<00:03:00.420> there<00:03:00.599> we're<00:03:01.079> gonna<00:03:01.200> add<00:03:01.409> our<00:03:01.590> twirls

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
from there we're gonna add our twirls

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.369 
from there we're gonna add our twirls
with<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.549> King<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.390> over<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> hand<00:03:04.109> hill<00:03:04.290> up

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
with the King so over a hand hill up

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.459 
with the King so over a hand hill up
option<00:03:04.769> for<00:03:04.950> two<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.909> one<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.569> two

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
option for two and one and two

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.099 
option for two and one and two
my<00:03:07.890> body<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.400> straight<00:03:08.790> I'm<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.810> take<00:03:09.959> my

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
my body is straight I'm going to take my

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.190 
my body is straight I'm going to take my
two<00:03:10.170> steps<00:03:10.590> back<00:03:10.939> the<00:03:11.939> roof<00:03:12.359> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
two steps back the roof going to the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.569 
two steps back the roof going to the
left<00:03:13.409> and<00:03:14.750> four<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.950> right<00:03:17.189> and

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
left and four going to the right and

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.039 
left and four going to the right and
then<00:03:18.090> up<00:03:18.359> again<00:03:19.939> so<00:03:20.939> from<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.569> slide<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
then up again so from the slide you

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.600 
then up again so from the slide you
might<00:03:22.170> be<00:03:22.290> better

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.730 

and<00:03:25.700> two<00:03:26.710> three<00:03:27.710> and<00:03:28.340> four<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.600> it's<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.440> big

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
and two three and four so it's a big

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.680 
and two three and four so it's a big
circle<00:03:31.280> I'm<00:03:31.430> trying<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.880> draw<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.450> floor

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
circle I'm trying to draw on the floor

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.510 
circle I'm trying to draw on the floor
right<00:03:32.900> here<00:03:33.080> because<00:03:33.410> we're<00:03:34.100> doing<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.340> big

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
right here because we're doing a big

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.490 
right here because we're doing a big
circle<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.660> that's<00:03:35.810> what<00:03:35.900> I'm<00:03:35.960> saying<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.380> as

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
circle so that's what I'm saying is as

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.900 
circle so that's what I'm saying is as
simple<00:03:36.860> as<00:03:37.010> actually<00:03:37.370> fell<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.880> ground

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
simple as actually fell to the ground

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.820 
simple as actually fell to the ground
and<00:03:38.510> then<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.780> first<00:03:38.990> one<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.380> do<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.800> a

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
and then the first one that I do is a

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.220 
and then the first one that I do is a
circle<00:03:40.280> it's<00:03:40.400> parallel<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:40.850> walk<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:42.140> the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
circle it's parallel to walk to the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.260 
circle it's parallel to walk to the
particular<00:03:42.710> sealants<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.490> drive<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:44.060> the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
particular sealants on drive to the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.570 
particular sealants on drive to the
circles<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.140> ceiling<00:03:45.410> then<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.250> began

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
circles on the ceiling then I began

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.730 
circles on the ceiling then I began
start<00:03:47.150> with<00:03:47.240> a<00:03:47.300> left<00:03:47.450> first<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.290> then<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.470> draw

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
start with a left first and then I draw

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.610 
start with a left first and then I draw
two<00:03:49.100> circles<00:03:49.130> on<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.090> floor<00:03:50.410> now<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.440> might

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
two circles on the floor now I might

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.660 
two circles on the floor now I might
have<00:03:51.709> helped<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:52.040> lot<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.459> know<00:03:52.610> you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
have helped a lot of it you know you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.430 
have helped a lot of it you know you
want<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:52.910> always<00:03:53.450> keep<00:03:53.570> in<00:03:53.870> mind<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.170> shapes

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
want to always keep in mind the shapes

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.830 
want to always keep in mind the shapes
that<00:03:54.530> you're<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.580> two<00:03:55.970> circles<00:03:56.420> on<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
that you're on so two circles on the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.440 
that you're on so two circles on the
ceiling<00:03:57.050> I'm<00:03:57.440> going<00:03:57.740> to<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.160> white<00:03:58.459> that's<00:03:59.270> my

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
ceiling I'm going to the white that's my

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.960 
ceiling I'm going to the white that's my
direction<00:03:59.810> okay<00:04:00.500> two<00:04:01.040> circles<00:04:01.490> on<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.700> floor

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
direction okay two circles on the floor

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.030 
direction okay two circles on the floor
I'm<00:04:02.240> going<00:04:02.270> to<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.840> left<00:04:03.050> left<00:04:03.590> right<00:04:03.860> left

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
I'm going to the left left right left

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.670 
I'm going to the left left right left
right<00:04:04.520> two<00:04:05.270> circles<00:04:05.660> on<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.140> ceiling<00:04:06.350> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
right two circles on the ceiling and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.270 
right two circles on the ceiling and
going<00:04:07.010> right<00:04:07.400> left<00:04:07.670> right<00:04:08.060> left<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.890> hopefully

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
going right left right left so hopefully

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.040 
going right left right left so hopefully
that<00:04:10.459> helps<00:04:10.700> look<00:04:10.880> okay<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.450> I'll<00:04:11.660> start<00:04:11.780> over

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
that helps look okay so I'll start over

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.150 
that helps look okay so I'll start over
again<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:13.040> one<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:13.880> two<00:04:14.239> step<00:04:15.140> back<00:04:15.380> three<00:04:15.830> and

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
again so one and two step back three and

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.470 
again so one and two step back three and
four<00:04:16.820> on<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.269> floor<00:04:18.070> -<00:04:19.070> I'm<00:04:19.640> stepping<00:04:19.880> toward

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
four on the floor - I'm stepping toward

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.330 
four on the floor - I'm stepping toward
to<00:04:20.630> do<00:04:20.750> my<00:04:20.900> forward<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.620> begin<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.220> there's

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
to do my forward to begin and there's

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.379 
to do my forward to begin and there's
something<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:23.390> do<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.720> two

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
something that to do the two

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.179 
something that to do the two
on<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.629> floor<00:04:24.870> instead<00:04:25.050> before<00:04:25.379> to<00:04:25.889> be<00:04:25.979> two

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:26.189 
on the floor instead before to be two

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.219 
on the floor instead before to be two
circles<00:04:26.340> on<00:04:26.699> the<00:04:26.789> ceiling<00:04:27.000> stepping<00:04:27.960> back<00:04:28.199> to

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
circles on the ceiling stepping back to

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.659 
circles on the ceiling stepping back to
these<00:04:28.500> two<00:04:28.620> circles<00:04:28.949> on<00:04:29.099> the<00:04:29.159> floor<00:04:29.370> step

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
these two circles on the floor step

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.339 
these two circles on the floor step
forward<00:04:30.120> two<00:04:30.300> circles<00:04:30.659> on<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.870> ceiling

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
forward two circles on the ceiling

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.580 
forward two circles on the ceiling
step<00:04:31.740> back<00:04:31.949> two<00:04:32.129> circles<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.699> floor<00:04:32.879> so

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
step back two circles on the floor so

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.330 
step back two circles on the floor so
hopefully<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:34.740> helps<00:04:34.919> it's<00:04:35.039> kind<00:04:35.189> of<00:04:35.250> like

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
hopefully that helps it's kind of like

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.950 
hopefully that helps it's kind of like
somebody<00:04:35.639> gave<00:04:35.759> you<00:04:35.879> a<00:04:35.909> really<00:04:36.150> big<00:04:36.389> parents

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
somebody gave you a really big parents

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.290 
somebody gave you a really big parents
that<00:04:37.080> draw<00:04:37.530> two<00:04:37.800> big<00:04:38.129> circles<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:39.060> this

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
that draw two big circles on this

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.869 
that draw two big circles on this
ceiling<00:04:39.569> and<00:04:39.990> then<00:04:40.199> say<00:04:40.979> things<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.400> try<00:04:41.610> to

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
ceiling and then say things that try to

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.480 
ceiling and then say things that try to
be<00:04:42.180> close<00:04:42.810> on<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.289> floor<00:04:43.560> like<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.370> then

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
be close on the floor like this and then

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.890 
be close on the floor like this and then
you<00:04:44.580> tell<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.240> also<00:04:45.449> that<00:04:45.569> you're<00:04:45.750> going<00:04:45.870> to

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
you tell you also that you're going to

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.790 
you tell you also that you're going to
make<00:04:46.020> sure<00:04:46.080> that<00:04:46.229> you<00:04:46.409> switch<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:46.740> the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
make sure that you switch in the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.230 
make sure that you switch in the
direction<00:04:47.039> so<00:04:47.250> you're<00:04:47.340> going<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.520> go<00:04:49.969> yeah

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
direction so you're going to go yeah

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.959 
direction so you're going to go yeah
so<00:04:51.599> try<00:04:52.259> to<00:04:52.319> make<00:04:52.469> it<00:04:52.590> easy<00:04:52.800> but<00:04:53.099> you<00:04:53.699> really

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
so try to make it easy but you really

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.129 
so try to make it easy but you really
want<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.210> draw<00:04:54.360> those<00:04:54.509> shapes<00:04:54.719> in<00:04:54.930> hand

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
want to draw those shapes in hand

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.600 
want to draw those shapes in hand
because<00:04:55.500> they<00:04:55.800> kind<00:04:56.189> of<00:04:56.219> make<00:04:56.400> it<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.550> little

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
because they kind of make it a little

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.760 
because they kind of make it a little
bit<00:04:56.849> easy<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.659> know<00:04:57.779> exactly<00:04:58.169> which<00:04:58.379> direction

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
bit easy to know exactly which direction

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.709 
bit easy to know exactly which direction
you're<00:04:59.039> going<00:04:59.069> okay<00:04:59.699> so<00:05:00.120> there's<00:05:00.629> some

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
then you're gonna stomp and one and two

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.790 
then you're gonna stomp and one and two
back<00:05:12.419> for<00:05:13.110> four<00:05:13.650> or<00:05:13.860> two<00:05:14.279> back<00:05:14.909> for<00:05:15.599> four<00:05:16.229> go<00:05:16.439> to

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
back for four or two back for four go to

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.459 
back for four or two back for four go to
back<00:05:17.490> for<00:05:18.120> it's<00:05:18.509> important<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.169> get<00:05:19.289> the

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
back for it's important you to get the

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:20.779 
back for it's important you to get the
other<00:05:19.620> hand<00:05:19.919> out<00:05:20.159> of<00:05:20.189> the<00:05:20.370> way<00:05:20.490> because<00:05:20.580> we

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
other hand out of the way because we

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.909 
other hand out of the way because we
don't<00:05:20.969> want<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.150> motion<00:05:21.779> too<00:05:22.289> many<00:05:22.469> thinks

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
don't want to motion too many thinks

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.010 
don't want to motion too many thinks
moving<00:05:23.279> but<00:05:23.879> we<00:05:24.000> also<00:05:24.180> we<00:05:24.479> don't<00:05:24.569> want<00:05:24.689> to<00:05:24.840> hit

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
moving but we also we don't want to hit

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.019 
moving but we also we don't want to hit
our<00:05:25.169> arm<00:05:25.439> so<00:05:25.919> we<00:05:26.099> want<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.340> get<00:05:26.400> this<00:05:26.550> arm<00:05:26.849> in

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
our arm so we want to get this arm in

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.309 
our arm so we want to get this arm in
other<00:05:27.210> words<00:05:27.360> so<00:05:27.479> I'm<00:05:27.599> gonna<00:05:27.719> put<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:28.020> right<00:05:28.050> on

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
other words so I'm gonna put it right on

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.079 
other words so I'm gonna put it right on
the<00:05:28.440> hip<00:05:28.620> right<00:05:28.770> here<00:05:29.039> so<00:05:29.550> we<00:05:29.639> can<00:05:29.759> really

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
the hip right here so we can really

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.390 
the hip right here so we can really
focus<00:05:30.330> on<00:05:30.719> nothing<00:05:31.139> but<00:05:31.589> the<00:05:31.770> motion<00:05:32.219> of

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
focus on nothing but the motion of

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.649 
focus on nothing but the motion of
thinking<00:05:32.789> we<00:05:32.940> don't<00:05:33.089> want<00:05:33.210> too<00:05:33.300> many<00:05:33.419> things

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
thinking we don't want too many things

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
and still and it's one and two step back

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.119 
and still and it's one and two step back
right<00:05:41.699> left<00:05:42.210> as<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.629> do<00:05:42.750> two<00:05:42.930> circles<00:05:43.379> back<00:05:43.710> I

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
right left as you do two circles back I

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.070 
right left as you do two circles back I
mean<00:05:44.580> down<00:05:44.759> on<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.029> floor<00:05:45.210> sorry<00:05:45.449> and<00:05:45.750> then

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
mean down on the floor sorry and then

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.779 
mean down on the floor sorry and then
step<00:05:46.289> forward<00:05:46.500> again<00:05:46.650> right<00:05:47.039> down<00:05:47.190> left<00:05:47.520> as

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
step forward again right down left as

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.279 
step forward again right down left as
you<00:05:47.909> do<00:05:48.029> two<00:05:48.180> circles<00:05:48.539> on<00:05:48.629> the<00:05:48.719> ceiling<00:05:48.960> and

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
you do two circles on the ceiling and

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.140 
you do two circles on the ceiling and
then<00:05:49.740> step<00:05:49.919> back<00:05:50.069> you<00:05:50.190> got<00:05:50.339> right<00:05:50.580> now<00:05:50.729> left<00:05:51.000> as

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
then step back you got right now left as

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
you do two circles on the floor so a lot

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.800 
you do two circles on the floor so a lot
of<00:05:53.370> faster<00:05:53.729> do<00:05:53.939> it<00:05:54.029> one<00:05:54.210> last<00:05:54.360> time<00:05:54.599> for<00:05:54.750> you

don't wanna do this move for too long

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.119 
don't wanna do this move for too long
because<00:06:09.080> your<00:06:10.080> hand<00:06:10.319> is<00:06:10.469> gonna<00:06:10.620> start<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:10.949> come

because your hand is gonna start to come
off<00:06:11.159> the<00:06:11.699> King<00:06:11.879> if<00:06:12.029> you<00:06:12.060> do<00:06:12.210> it<00:06:12.330> for<00:06:12.509> like<00:06:12.599> I

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
off the King if you do it for like I

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.089 
off the King if you do it for like I
don't<00:06:12.839> know<00:06:12.960> more<00:06:13.229> than<00:06:13.319> like<00:06:13.500> for<00:06:13.710> rats

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
don't know more than like for rats

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.610 
don't know more than like for rats
so<00:06:14.759> do<00:06:15.029> it<00:06:15.180> for<00:06:15.419> maybe<00:06:15.569> like<00:06:15.719> twice<00:06:16.169> in<00:06:16.500> this

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
so do it for maybe like twice in this

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.379 
so do it for maybe like twice in this
matter<00:06:16.860> and<00:06:17.789> it<00:06:17.879> doesn't<00:06:18.089> really<00:06:18.180> look<00:06:18.330> pretty

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
matter and it doesn't really look pretty

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.480 
matter and it doesn't really look pretty
for<00:06:18.750> you<00:06:18.810> repeated<00:06:19.319> too<00:06:19.409> many<00:06:19.589> times<00:06:19.800> so<00:06:19.889> maybe

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
for you repeated too many times so maybe

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.070 
for you repeated too many times so maybe
forward<00:06:20.909> and<00:06:21.060> back<00:06:21.180> forward<00:06:21.210> and<00:06:21.689> back<00:06:21.779> and

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
forward and back forward and back and

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.320 
forward and back forward and back and
then<00:06:22.229> you<00:06:22.319> die<00:06:22.469> and<00:06:22.740> then<00:06:23.039> otherwise<00:06:23.490> you're

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
then you die and then otherwise you're

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.700 
then you die and then otherwise you're
gonna<00:06:24.389> start<00:06:24.719> to<00:06:24.810> kind<00:06:24.960> of<00:06:24.990> like<00:06:25.139> adjust<00:06:25.259> your

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
gonna start to kind of like adjust your

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.679 
gonna start to kind of like adjust your
hand<00:06:25.919> on<00:06:26.219> the<00:06:26.370> king<00:06:26.580> anything<00:06:27.360> a<00:06:27.389> little<00:06:27.539> more

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:27.689 
hand on the king anything a little more

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.200 
hand on the king anything a little more
pretty<00:06:28.139> so<00:06:28.439> that's<00:06:29.099> they<00:06:29.219> have<00:06:29.370> a<00:06:29.400> concert<00:06:29.909> or

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
a concert or move I guess we can call it

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.279 
a concert or move I guess we can call it
that<00:06:33.930> and<00:06:34.469> I'm<00:06:34.740> just<00:06:34.889> doing<00:06:35.009> so<00:06:35.430> -<00:06:35.659> two<00:06:36.659> circles

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
that and I'm just doing so - two circles

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.230 
that and I'm just doing so - two circles
up<00:06:37.529> parallel<00:06:38.159> to<00:06:38.219> the<00:06:38.370> ceiling<00:06:38.550> two<00:06:38.849> circles

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
up parallel to the ceiling two circles

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.180 
up parallel to the ceiling two circles
down<00:06:39.509> down<00:06:39.870> to<00:06:40.080> the<00:06:40.199> floor

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
down down to the floor

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.409 
down down to the floor
the<00:06:41.490> up<00:06:41.639> is<00:06:41.789> what<00:06:41.940> we<00:06:42.000> call<00:06:42.149> the<00:06:42.270> helicopter

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
the up is what we call the helicopter

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.139 
the up is what we call the helicopter
move<00:06:43.020> but<00:06:43.409> putting<00:06:43.800> it<00:06:43.919> together<00:06:44.130> will<00:06:44.969> be

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:45.149 
move but putting it together will be

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:47.959 
move but putting it together will be
almost<00:06:45.870> like<00:06:46.020> a<00:06:46.050> secret<00:06:46.259> H<00:06:46.589> we<00:06:46.830> like<00:06:46.979> Kayla<00:06:47.250> to

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 
almost like a secret H we like Kayla to

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.749 
almost like a secret H we like Kayla to
floor<00:06:48.270> and<00:06:48.599> ceiling<00:06:49.409> and<00:06:49.709> he<00:06:50.099> does<00:06:50.310> a<00:06:50.339> request

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
floor and ceiling and he does a request

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.459 
floor and ceiling and he does a request
and<00:06:50.909> it<00:06:51.000> just<00:06:51.240> in<00:06:51.389> in<00:06:51.509> Devon<00:06:51.779> I<00:06:51.810> can't<00:06:52.169> just<00:06:52.349> do

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:52.469 
and it just in in Devon I can't just do

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:54.019 
and it just in in Devon I can't just do
a<00:06:52.500> stand<00:06:52.860> and<00:06:53.039> still<00:06:53.250> make<00:06:53.430> sure<00:06:53.580> you<00:06:53.729> remember

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:54.029 
a stand and still make sure you remember

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:55.610 
a stand and still make sure you remember
that<00:06:54.149> they're<00:06:54.629> standing<00:06:54.959> still<00:06:55.259> then<00:06:55.500> you're

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
that they're standing still then you're

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.909 
that they're standing still then you're
moving<00:06:55.949> back<00:06:56.159> and<00:06:57.020> adjusting<00:06:58.020> for<00:06:58.560> two<00:06:58.709> counts

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
moving back and adjusting for two counts

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.649 
moving back and adjusting for two counts
every<00:06:59.310> time<00:06:59.520> by<00:06:59.669> simply<00:07:00.029> taking<00:07:00.149> two<00:07:00.479> steps

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659 
every time by simply taking two steps

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.680 
every time by simply taking two steps
forward<00:07:00.930> and<00:07:01.319> so<00:07:02.310> that<00:07:03.000> is<00:07:03.240> our<00:07:03.449> combination

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
forward and so that is our combination

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.480 
forward and so that is our combination
hopefully<00:07:04.469> you<00:07:04.529> guys<00:07:04.620> like<00:07:04.830> it<00:07:05.039> and<00:07:05.129> I'll<00:07:05.310> see
