 Hey, youtube group. 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.759
 today the tutorial will serve as download the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.190
 original skateboard for tablet or smartphone 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.160
 first you will have to download this 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:23.699
 here is the success of the skateboard 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.199
 after you have downloaded this is only you 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.720
 start playing 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.250
 you will not preserve this uic gauge 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.330
 none of this 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.330
 Look here 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.460
 it's very good 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:02.040
 he embarks since he entrusts 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:13.500
 it pulls the key it's the graph 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:21.479
 the only difference is that it will be he 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:28.619
 could have more ball but this is the time to 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:37.220
 pick up the key there 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:37.220
 the references 54 av between 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:56.200
 too much and I think you want to start 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:58.240
