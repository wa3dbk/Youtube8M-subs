38 millimeters across this Orion

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.510 
38 millimeters across this Orion
measures<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.850> 8.8<00:01:06.540> millimeters<00:01:06.720> thick<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
measures in at 8.8 millimeters thick and

48<00:01:08.520> millimeters<00:01:08.820> log<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.510> lug<00:01:09.689> which<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
48 millimeters log to lug which is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
48 millimeters log to lug which is
actually<00:01:10.350> quite<00:01:10.530> large<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.189> watch<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
actually quite large for a watch of this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
actually quite large for a watch of this
size<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.450> you'll<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> given

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
size but I think you'll see that given

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.370 
size but I think you'll see that given
the<00:01:13.710> curve<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> lugs<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.290> kind<00:01:16.290> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the curve of the lugs and the kind of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.590 
the curve of the lugs and the kind of
expansive<00:01:17.100> dial<00:01:17.430> there's<00:01:17.790> very<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.119> bezel

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
expansive dial there's very little bezel

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.380 
expansive dial there's very little bezel
in<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.200> design<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.150> you'll<00:01:21.240> see

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
in this design and I think you'll see

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
in this design and I think you'll see
when<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> show<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.530> wrist<00:01:22.950> just

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
when when I show it to you on wrist just

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
when when I show it to you on wrist just
how<00:01:23.430> how<00:01:23.970> well<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.330> wears<00:01:24.540> even<00:01:24.960> given<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
how how well it wears even given the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.649 
how how well it wears even given the
rather<00:01:25.500> large<00:01:25.799> lugs<00:01:26.189> I've<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.640> dive<00:01:27.330> watches

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
rather large lugs I've had dive watches

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.859 
rather large lugs I've had dive watches
that<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.020> shorter<00:01:28.530> lugs<00:01:28.799> than<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.869> you're
