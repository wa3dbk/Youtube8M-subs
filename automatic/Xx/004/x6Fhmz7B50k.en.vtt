the instrument and turned them into

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.339 
the instrument and turned them into
musical<00:00:08.280> alphabet<00:00:08.550> letters<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.080> we're<00:00:10.230> gonna

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
musical alphabet letters so we're gonna

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.169 
musical alphabet letters so we're gonna
start<00:00:10.710> with<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> one<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.580> just<00:00:11.610> ended

left hand thumb 1 2 3 let's play that

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
left hand thumb 1 2 3 let's play that
note<00:00:46.430> and<00:00:47.809> again<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.170> might<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.649> higher

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
note and again you might get that higher

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.069 
note and again you might get that higher
one<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> that's<00:00:51.030> okay<00:00:53.210> but<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:54.750> we're

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
one and that's okay but for now we're

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.580 
one and that's okay but for now we're
gonna<00:00:55.140> display<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> lower<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.309> so<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:01.379> flute

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
gonna display the lower one so the flute

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.369 
gonna display the lower one so the flute
works<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> recorder<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:04.019> lift

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
works a lot like the recorder as we lift

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.399 
works a lot like the recorder as we lift
up<00:01:04.619> fingers<00:01:05.580> listen<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.689> happens<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
up fingers listen to what happens to the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.630 
up fingers listen to what happens to the
sound<00:01:12.619> all<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> did<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.159> start<00:01:14.549> with

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
sound all I did was start with

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.969 
sound all I did was start with
everything<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.330> my<00:01:15.420> left<00:01:15.630> hand<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.439> except

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
everything in my left hand down except

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.670 
everything in my left hand down except
the<00:01:17.070> pinky<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.270> lifted<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the pinky and then I lifted and then I

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.109 
the pinky and then I lifted and then I
lifted<00:01:20.070> again<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.430> hear<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> sound

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
lifted again you can hear that the sound

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.039 
lifted again you can hear that the sound
gets<00:01:27.509> higher<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.920> lift<00:01:29.159> fingers<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
gets higher as you lift fingers up so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.010 
gets higher as you lift fingers up so
think<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.400> musical<00:01:32.909> alphabet<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
think about the musical alphabet as the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.340 
think about the musical alphabet as the
sound<00:01:34.350> gets<00:01:34.740> higher<00:01:35.189> where<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.450> forwards

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
sound gets higher where you go forwards

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.700 
sound gets higher where you go forwards
through<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> music<00:01:38.310> alphabet<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:40.229> note

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
through the music alphabet this note

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.030 
through the music alphabet this note
that<00:01:40.979> we're<00:01:41.250> starting<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.909> thumb<00:01:42.570> 1<00:01:43.079> 2<00:01:43.409> 3<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that we're starting with thumb 1 2 3 is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.590 
that we're starting with thumb 1 2 3 is
the<00:01:45.000> musical<00:01:45.450> alphabet<00:01:45.750> letter<00:01:46.380> G<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:48.299> let's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the musical alphabet letter G so let's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.080 
the musical alphabet letter G so let's
play<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.530> your<00:01:49.680> head<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.399> about<00:01:50.700> G

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.990 

so<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.509> lift<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.110> one<00:01:58.500> finger<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.670> sound

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
so if we lift up one finger the sound

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600 
so if we lift up one finger the sound
goes<00:02:00.240> higher<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.829> forwards<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
goes higher we go forwards in the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.819 
goes higher we go forwards in the
musical<00:02:03.060> alphabet<00:02:03.240> think<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:04.619> letter

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
musical alphabet think about what letter

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
musical alphabet think about what letter
comes<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.430> after<00:02:05.579> G<00:02:05.969> remember<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.750> H

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
comes right after G remember it's not H

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.639 
comes right after G remember it's not H
we<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.439> back<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> beginning<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
we go back to the beginning and it's a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.490 
we go back to the beginning and it's a
so<00:02:10.649> let's<00:02:10.950> play<00:02:11.720> thumb<00:02:12.720> one

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so let's play thumb one

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.830 
so let's play thumb one
to<00:02:14.120> only<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.420> that's<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.990> note<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:20.660> let's<00:02:21.660> go

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to only and that's the note a let's go

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.440 
to only and that's the note a let's go
back<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.470> G<00:02:22.830> by<00:02:23.310> putting<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.820> third<00:02:24.180> finger

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
back to G by putting that third finger

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.500 
back to G by putting that third finger
down<00:02:24.810> again<00:02:28.430> now<00:02:29.430> go<00:02:29.640> back<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:29.910> forth<00:02:30.360> between

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
down again now go back and forth between

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:50.000 
down again now go back and forth between
G<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.290> G<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.370> G<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:40.760> try<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.820> again<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> those<00:02:49.830> are

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
G a G a G a try it again so those are

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.229 
G a G a G a try it again so those are
the<00:02:50.100> first<00:02:50.280> couple<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.670> notes<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:51.000> we<00:02:51.090> know

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
the first couple of notes that we know

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.280 
the first couple of notes that we know
we<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:51.989> G<00:02:52.380> lifts<00:02:53.070> up<00:02:53.280> for<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.670> if<00:02:54.150> we<00:02:54.750> lift<00:02:55.020> up

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
we have G lifts up for a if we lift up

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.940 
we have G lifts up for a if we lift up
that<00:02:55.830> second<00:02:56.550> finger<00:02:56.820> we<00:02:57.660> go<00:02:57.900> forwards<00:02:58.560> again

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that second finger we go forwards again

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.430 
that second finger we go forwards again
we<00:02:59.190> go<00:02:59.340> higher<00:02:59.730> again<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.200> guess

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
we go higher again and you can guess

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.840 
we go higher again and you can guess
that<00:03:01.770> we're<00:03:01.920> going<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.160> go<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.640> letter<00:03:02.850> B

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.710 

so<00:03:08.850> let's<00:03:09.060> try<00:03:09.390> starting<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:11.130> going<00:03:11.720> a.b

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so let's try starting on a and going a.b

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:26.710 
so let's try starting on a and going a.b
a.b<00:03:13.790> a.b<00:03:15.950> try<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:24.950> try<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.130> again

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
a.b a.b try it try it again

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.940 
a.b a.b try it try it again
