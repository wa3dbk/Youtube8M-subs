00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 Hi, I'm all physicist and I come to you 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.820
 talk about a small detail that is not 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.660
 very known 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.960
 what we are going to see here is that the c4 in 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.710
 theory can be destroyed with bullets like this 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.380
 as it is now 98 m Wear 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.800
 bulls that instaura have been with 1,098 ve 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.559
 but we meet and that 1099 does not 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.920
 destroys the four a bit weird the 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:39.530
 rifle with greater power does not destroy them 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.719
 now we are seeing the gt3 as you see 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.460
 it does not destroy it either and we decided to try 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.329
 the m-40 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.430
 to 5 as you can see the m-40 to 5 yes that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.660
 destroy the explosives we talk about c-4 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.480
 and enemy mines this time we're going to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.489
 try the m 39 mr as you can see 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.079
 this semiautomatic also works 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.830
 to destroy enemy explosives 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.390
 now let's see the sks also serves 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.380
 Also works 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.790
 we can see that all the records of 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.210
 tractors in addition to the record work 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.580
 minus lm 98 with the rest of the weapons 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.770
 of the record we can destroy the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.650
 next enemies since 4 are mines 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.690
 enemy here we are going to test the weapons 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.110
 of support because they share the caliber 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.330
 are of the same caliber 7.62 but we 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.970
 we found that they do not destroy the c4 with 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.820
 clips we should take it 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.820
 the n-240 of now we are colarme 60 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.740
 to 3 or I do not know what exactly is now the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.320
 fellow Luis for the person 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.390
 to this company in the oil law and 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.880
 neither the stress of 34 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.700
 none of the machines destroy the c4 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.380
 none of the assault weapons destroy 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.479
 the c4 none of the weapons of the wit 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.000
 the study is four are here 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.950
 watching type 88 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.240
 we can only establish four with 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.380
 triple re with less than 98 m now 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.330
 we find ourselves with ammunition 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.520
 explosives of the shotgun how can you 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.680
 see also destroys it somewhat obvious 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.630
 since we are with expressive ammunition and 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.290
 here as we can see we carry ammunition 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.620
 and putting 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.790
 and we can also destroy the 04 and the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.829
 enemy mines 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.069
 let's try what guns are 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.290
 I carry the magnum 44 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.170
 there we were a tank that was 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.469
 make four with the frame also them 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.340
 destroy this almighty command every 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:45.469
 I like it more, it's very useful and now 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.689
 We had to try the other revolver 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.090
 small stir that we can see that 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.609
 it also works both revolvers 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.540
 they work in the rest of the pistols not 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.930
 only revolvers work 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.750
 and if you know some trick more what 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.030
 always do not share if I the one of the 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.010
 facts and if you liked it like favorites 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.010
 and see you in the next trick
