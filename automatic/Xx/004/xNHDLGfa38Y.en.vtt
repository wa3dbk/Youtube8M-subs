00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:03.580
 It is a part of the weapon 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.830
 On this occasion 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.530
 I told that euro about ict newspaper ads 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.479
 A little bit 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.339
 As there were still only words and information missing 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.299
 I will proceed with the customer 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.970
 We were a little battered, but Honda's 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.279
 But that 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.970
 Studio Ghibli's 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.810
 To tomorrow 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.239
 Book which collected newspaper advertisement that this book started 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.679
 Is out 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.550
 It is this 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.550
 Have you ever seen Hiranosuke's newspaper advertisements? 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.900
 Tokuma bookstore 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.909
 As it was feeling that we paid tax for the main body 2300 yen, of less than 2500 yen 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.810
 I think Honda 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.560
 It is fine for a small company, but if you look at the contents to make 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.110
 In this way newspaper advertisements are often done well 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.670
 Newspaper advertisements for Ghibli works have always been sought 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.960
 During the establishment 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.780
 In addition, we have been reading that time that is accelerating more 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.370
 is not it 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.460
 It was very interesting to know about those days 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.370
 This is still out, but if it is good for the hand 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.640
 Please give me 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.480
 From then on 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.390
 Pitching Kunio 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.720
 We told in various ways, but the last round of September 3 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.110
 It was on the evening 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 It is this, but it is this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.980
 Yeah 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.030
 There are words written for the country 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.280
 Ghibli's new one 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.420
 I moved the mind of this summer world 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 Ant finals final 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.010
 The charm of this movie 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.860
 It looks like it was so cold 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.130
 It will be wonderful 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.149
 Really this 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.630
 Spicy copy that residual rhyme remains with one slave unit remained 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.430
 I was thinking of 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.100
 You may think that it is different from the current route 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 It may have been, but this is also true 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.270
 Sekine 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.429
 I say that you're a hite 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.839
 We use chuck of juxtaposition 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.279
 Even if it is chucked 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.939
 I will not change the words 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.819
 Think of it as a copy of a movie promotion 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.699
 Even though it is regular 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.699
 Words given by that person 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.189
 I was in charge of Suzuki, and there was the late Nakata acquaintance of Michiuchi Ann. 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.459
 I have sent a certain dry spelled mane 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.289
 is 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:36.269
 That's him 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.819
 Please allow me to use words. 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.629
 It is that I put it 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.209
 This one 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.789
 Until the day of chuck type 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.379
 Copywriter 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.449
 It is something I want to see but 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.299
 Really that 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.239
 Of a large senior 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.609
 Mr. Sekine is from now on 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.919
 It is a Japanese film 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.909
 Of various films 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.169
 Advertising or newspaper copy place 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.129
 I was thinking 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.939
 It looks like an iron cat 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.120
 Egypt 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.529
 This direction is this previous stone's 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.059
 I'm also asking that radio program to appear on the radio program 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.609
 State and thought of that time 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.929
 I think I'm stuck in the podcast 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.269
 If you are interested in looking at the stratum, what is the other party 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.219
 That's the point about the newspaper Newspaper about here 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.769
 Supplement about what was missing yesterday 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.539
 I was allowed to
