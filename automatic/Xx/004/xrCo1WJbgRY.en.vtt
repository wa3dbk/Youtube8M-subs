00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 well let's talk about the many 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.340
 ways of dying that exist in advance 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.170
 warfare and to be more concrete when 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.150
 we are going in a certain way that many of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.769
 you have passed that when you go in 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.780
 traced things happen a little weird 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 truth a little iluminatis then good 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.550
 let's talk about them we are in the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.350
 sniper mode sniper mode 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.480
 whatever you want to call it and we get into 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.220
 the lobby with a little caution and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.439
 that we have a run of 17 and suddenly 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 we have an asthen god knows where and from 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.790
 we kill another guy who did not throw the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 it was a bit weird but true 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.860
 you know that I am torete the advanced 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.469
 warfare hates me but we're good 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.420
 we kill a guy we're with on the map 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.399
 of the horizon and the map is quite 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 controlled it seems that we are facing a 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.370
 fierce run when a triple comes 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.000
 missile and the truth is that my reaction was 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.000
 so that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.630
 to 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.180
 life 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.440
 and with the ways of dying in pretty fairy 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.760
 we are facing a streak of 25 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.250
 practically when we meet 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.860
 he responds every miraculously and 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.920
 a god appears god knows where and I 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.439
 Bush 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 just when he's just come out it's brutal not 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.310
 I can believe it we are in a 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.350
 start of streak we are not with the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.570
 ruthless streak of 10 good always 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.970
 it puts the ruthless we all come 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.130
 quite up and we say pussy that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.740
 we are making a little rose let's go 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.080
 to see how far we got to go 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.789
 then it 's when you start to feel a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.610
 little more the ground when they are no longer enough 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.610
 to sarkozy but a little more 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.710
 as I say cautiously, they are not enough 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.479
 brandon on the map and it's when good 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.640
 you see that a quick one hides in a 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.190
 garage like a pacific knees 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.769
 and you say good I'll be cautious as 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.140
 I say and we are going to test the ground 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.180
 then it's when we meet 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.540
 an uncle which we left quite 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.280
 touched we expect your reaction when 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.560
 spend a few seconds and I see that it does not come out 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.200
 Well, I'm still on my way, not going 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.519
 of the subject when hitting a couple of 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.620
 jumps I meet another god who 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.420
 after all those shots has not come out 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.790
 but not only that but they finish 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.709
 killing me God knows how and right now 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.290
 let's analyze it as you can see 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.710
 in the minimap image that stopped for 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.800
 that the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.650
 is the day just before dying I take the 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.630
 drone and shot it immediately 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.510
 as if I was going to shoot the gun I think 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.270
 me and that's when I end my life 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.190
 I really was stunned but 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.330
 there are also happy endings not in the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.980
 which you end up with a very large adn not 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.900
 and what is our relationship when we 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.030
 we took one of January I have been 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.490
 trying to find the best way to 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.420
 describe it and I think this is the best 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.420
 I have found
