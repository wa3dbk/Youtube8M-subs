00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.550
 It has very characteristics 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.910
 conquered international markets 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.830
 and for which we worked for 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.200
 get the denomination of origin and 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.059
 those characteristics are the paper that 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.780

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.370
 shapes and colors 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.019
 that you have to not those that come together 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.150
 many peppers in fact practically 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.040
 I could say that he is the only one 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.010
 joint to all those characteristics 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.500
 there are other peppers that have 12 but not 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.239
 all of these and that's what makes it so 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.280
 special the world is discovering 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.900
 barely the habanero chile so the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.940
 potential market is huge

 He indicated that habanero pepper leaves its 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.080
 taste for the world because of its 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.610
 unique features he remembered that as 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.070
 the fruit has to comply with the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.810
 norms of the denomination of origin 40 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.760
 producers and researchers will have 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.280
 information for each derived product 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.330
 of habanero pepper based on the 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.790
 rules 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.490
 new regulations that under which 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.620
 we have to produce now it's not what 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.780
 same produce as we were 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.730
 used to local market and 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.710
 regional or national 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.560
 practically with rules that establishes 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.840
 the tradition to have to produce now 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.790
 under a designation of origin there is no 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.840
 there are a number of regulations that we have 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.150
 to comply and well those are reflected 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.979
