 I cook you with karin coughing teeth 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.460
 if so it really started as a hobby 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.869
 i always loved to cook no am i 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.369
 started a website 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.289
 on which I have my recipes and my 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.400
 drawings have put 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.940
 and then I really thought very quickly to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.620
 the i can do i much more with that i have 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.719
 I quit my job and we want the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 we go full-time on what should just go on 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.480
 hear it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.950
 I work for a publishing company 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 sponsored magazines make the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.040
 magazines in something else from childhood 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.460
 off already 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.989
 the kitchen so you know a child tray 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.539
 I wasn't that much the pies 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.680
 really would be busy with cooking and I liked it 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.579
 agree with my mother in the kitchen 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.260
 but my mother liked buying 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 terrible so that wasn't real 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.270
 a role model and when I was 16 then went 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.800
 a year again to switzerland and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.989
 then I suddenly had to cook every day for 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.430
 three children then I actually have 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.630
 I learned it to start and then 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.380
 I also discovered it very much fun 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 find 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.390
 Noord-Holland whether I or I wanted to come 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.159

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.259
 you for 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.939

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.619

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.680

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.860
 subject and yes I try a bit 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.540
 variation in and before 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.820
 a little of his early screen 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.240
 read in see what yes what can I do about it 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.100
 to tell 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 what what are perhaps nice recipes 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.930
 not easily through the radio 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.520
 could tell some of all very easily 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.930
 millionaire they make yes that is real 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.790
 super fast that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.149
 what do one yourself that is whole 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.890
 difficult 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.969
 actually bowed a little bit 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.040
 sauerkraut I love very much or is very bad 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.560
 of oven dishes 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.979
 totally oysters very much 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.160
 pies are really desserts 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.200
 cold so yes yes but many savory you 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.170
 fourth book is from the 2nd edition already 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.230
 so that is going in the right direction and what will 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.910
 give you a fee 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.069

 it is easier that people often think and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.489
 I want a bit of fun in it 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.440
 bring back cooking 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.150
 Many people may also see it as one 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.400
 kind of daily evil of all that must 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.140
 we well we eat and help 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.220
 I want to show that it's easy 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.760
 that it is fun to do 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.040
 that it gives a lot of satisfaction 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.480
 even if you eat something very bad afterwards 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.920
 tasty and which everyone says 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.239
 me that you have already cooked well 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.519
 those are all things that contribute 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.379
 to the happiness of life 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.050

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.150
 favorite topic of arjan that is 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.489
 namely an apple pie and in the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.540
 very first time i came but that 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.250

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.500

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.360
 all further to wait with cooking 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.840
 my can that i will continue with my 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.790

 cooking with spice dot en I will continue with 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.730
 make books 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.560
 a book comes out that spring 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.190
 He was called kitchen that they bundle 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.780
 of recipes from faithful ones in the odds 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.060
 have written and with interviews with 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.670
 people about septum but are special 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.170
 have memory and and it 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.720
 next cookbook worth going to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.239
 working is buying an oven if you are 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.090
 love oven dishes i think is over 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.680
 such a handy device and you all do 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.450
 things together in the dish and then 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.489
 put you so over everyone about this 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.769
 issue of waiting the oven is also one 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.690
 way in a really simple way 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.190
 way to create a lot of taste so you can 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.510
 Of course things do in a pan with all 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.400
 the not with water 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.510
 when you roast them in the oven often comes 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.420
 makes movies upwards 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.000
 you also prepare a workshop 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.850
 cooking workshops are greetings 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.590
 then we go there some nice things one evening 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.810
 and people are surprised to 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.890
 see that they can all do it themselves 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.770
 watch a cell the veins 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.600
 cooking programs yes often only says something 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.280
 I watch TV macro programs 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.200
 but what do you think the pan you have one 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.880
 favorite program 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.070
 yes most still look to the 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.310
 english can bbc programs 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.290
 the masses really great this one now it 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.590
 is a master chef professional 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.570
 they are not amateur chefs but cooks 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.520
 already work in a restaurant but now one 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.660
 step higher really want Michelin stars 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.120
 want to become a shift 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.320
 it's really phenomenal and television is about 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.800
 to look at if your book is also not 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.620
 more 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.490
 do you have a nice broccoli recipe 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.470
 soup soup is actually very easy to 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.570
 make themselves like your boss and one of 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.240
 vegetables and you have to mix it 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.950
 for example, it takes 500 grams of wok oil 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.350
 some broth 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.460

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.160

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.660

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.520
 until it is soft until the broccoli is good 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.350
 then you put the hand blender in and you have 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.440
