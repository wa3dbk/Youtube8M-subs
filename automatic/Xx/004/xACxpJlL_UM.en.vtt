side<00:02:14.459> or<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:14.760> opponent's<00:02:15.750> side<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.230> could

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
side or your opponent's side so I could

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.309 
side or your opponent's side so I could
play<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.829> 12<00:02:17.190> red<00:02:17.489> here<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> then<00:02:19.109> on<00:02:19.200> my

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
play this 12 red here and then on my

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.140 
play this 12 red here and then on my
next<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:19.799> play<00:02:19.889> another<00:02:20.069> 10<00:02:20.459> red<00:02:20.760> here

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
next one I can play another 10 red here

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.470 
next one I can play another 10 red here
and<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:22.170> way<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:23.069> works<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.060> cards<00:02:24.420> that

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
and the way this works is the cards that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.170 
and the way this works is the cards that
you<00:02:24.569> play<00:02:24.810> they're<00:02:24.989> much<00:02:25.170> match<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.920> cubes<00:02:26.280> so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you play they're much match to cubes so

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.210 
you play they're much match to cubes so
only<00:02:27.840> one<00:02:28.079> card<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.500> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.769> played<00:02:29.069> here

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
only one card is going to be played here

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.319 
only one card is going to be played here
in<00:02:29.280> each<00:02:29.430> side<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.299> a

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
in each side and it's going to be a

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.780 
in each side and it's going to be a
green<00:02:30.600> card<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.590> are<00:02:31.680> two<00:02:31.920> red<00:02:32.220> cards<00:02:32.579> are<00:02:32.700> in

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
played the cards of someone else we then

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.699 
played the cards of someone else we then

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
will total the numbers on the cards I

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.670 
will total the numbers on the cards I
have<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.040> 12<00:02:47.280> into<00:02:47.430> 10<00:02:47.549> here<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:47.910> 22<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.540> 13<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.470> 8

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
have a 12 into 10 here for 22 a 13 and 8

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.259 
have a 12 into 10 here for 22 a 13 and 8
is<00:02:49.889> 21<00:02:50.930> here<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.590> mountain<00:02:53.069> card<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:54.060> big

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
is 21 here it's a mountain card but big

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.660 
is 21 here it's a mountain card but big
numbers<00:02:54.599> here<00:02:54.959> showing<00:02:55.380> 11<00:02:55.620> 12<00:02:55.799> 13<00:02:55.829> so<00:02:56.549> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
numbers here showing 11 12 13 so the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.420 
numbers here showing 11 12 13 so the
higher<00:02:56.940> total<00:02:57.420> wins<00:02:57.599> so<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.079> would<00:02:58.440> win<00:02:58.650> both<00:02:59.220> of

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
higher total wins so I would win both of

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.690 
higher total wins so I would win both of
these<00:02:59.549> red<00:02:59.849> cubes<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:01.950> all<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.400> cards

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
these red cubes and then all the cards

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.039 
these red cubes and then all the cards
are<00:03:02.819> discarded<00:03:03.359> that<00:03:03.480> were<00:03:03.599> played<00:03:03.840> there<00:03:04.019> and

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
are discarded that were played there and

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.050 
are discarded that were played there and
we<00:03:04.319> flip<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.590> over<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.099> now<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.489> lowest

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
we flip it over and now the lowest

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.089 
we flip it over and now the lowest
number<00:03:06.299> is<00:03:06.359> gonna<00:03:06.510> win<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.840> location<00:03:07.200> we

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
number is gonna win in that location we

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.640 
number is gonna win in that location we
go<00:03:08.310> back<00:03:08.549> into<00:03:08.760> our<00:03:08.880> bag<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.450> doom<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.989> pull

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
that the game can lock up if you have

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.570 
that the game can lock up if you have
two<00:04:49.990> great<00:04:50.290> cubes<00:04:50.650> in<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.919> same<00:04:51.100> thing<00:04:51.340> this

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
two great cubes in the same thing this

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.670 
two great cubes in the same thing this
has<00:04:51.729> never<00:04:51.880> happened<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.390> me<00:04:52.540> but<00:04:53.140> it<00:04:53.200> happened

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
has never happened to me but it happened

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.010 
has never happened to me but it happened
to<00:04:53.740> some<00:04:53.919> people<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:55.060> there's<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.330> summer<00:04:55.870> I

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
to some people and so there's a summer I

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.480 
to some people and so there's a summer I
can't<00:04:56.290> remember<00:04:56.440> what<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:56.979> is<00:04:57.070> I've<00:04:57.220> taught<00:04:57.370> my

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
can't remember what it is I've taught my

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.830 
can't remember what it is I've taught my
I<00:04:57.520> think<00:04:58.120> basically<00:04:58.330> you're<00:04:58.600> just<00:04:58.750> not

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
I think basically you're just not

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.030 
I think basically you're just not
supposed<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.110> put<00:04:59.229> two<00:04:59.350> great<00:04:59.590> cubes<00:04:59.860> on

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
supposed to put two great cubes on

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.590 
supposed to put two great cubes on
anything<00:05:00.250> because<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.820> game<00:05:00.940> could<00:05:01.210> lock<00:05:01.390> up

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
anything because the game could lock up

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.130 
anything because the game could lock up
that<00:05:01.810> way

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
that way

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.420 
that way
but<00:05:02.550> I<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:04.900> in<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.650> cosmos<00:05:06.070> two-player

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
but I like it in the cosmos two-player

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.490 
but I like it in the cosmos two-player
line<00:05:06.640> I<00:05:06.850> like<00:05:07.270> lost<00:05:07.510> cities<00:05:07.840> better<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.200> like

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
line I like lost cities better I like

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.830 
line I like lost cities better I like
battle<00:05:09.220> line<00:05:09.370> I<00:05:09.400> like<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.270> deeper<00:05:10.600> games

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
battle line I like the the deeper games

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.500 
battle line I like the the deeper games
better<00:05:11.260> than<00:05:11.410> this<00:05:11.710> one<00:05:11.950> but<00:05:12.789> this<00:05:12.940> one<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.300> the

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
better than this one but this one is the

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.010 
better than this one but this one is the
one<00:05:14.440> of<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.590> most<00:05:14.740> easy<00:05:15.419> games<00:05:16.419> to<00:05:16.690> play

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
one of the most easy games to play

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.110 
one of the most easy games to play
I<00:05:17.289> can<00:05:17.620> teach<00:05:17.800> someone<00:05:18.039> to<00:05:18.130> play<00:05:18.340> this<00:05:18.520> so

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
I can teach someone to play this so

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.020 
I can teach someone to play this so
quickly<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.770> just<00:05:20.979> makes<00:05:21.160> sense<00:05:21.400> that<00:05:21.610> oh

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
quickly and it just makes sense that oh

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.120 
quickly and it just makes sense that oh
I<00:05:22.150> higher<00:05:22.960> number<00:05:23.229> wins<00:05:23.380> lower<00:05:23.620> number<00:05:23.950> wins

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
I higher number wins lower number wins

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.310 
I higher number wins lower number wins
and<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:24.370> go<00:05:24.460> back<00:05:24.669> and<00:05:24.820> forth<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.300> I<00:05:25.930> almost

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
and you go back and forth and I almost

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.930 
and you go back and forth and I almost
hesitate<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.890> say<00:05:27.010> that<00:05:27.130> there's<00:05:27.310> no<00:05:27.640> strategy

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
hesitate to say that there's no strategy

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.270 
hesitate to say that there's no strategy
hit<00:05:28.390> at<00:05:28.510> all<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:29.260> just<00:05:29.289> play<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.770> best<00:05:29.979> card

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
hit at all you just play the best card

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.500 
hit at all you just play the best card

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
I'll agree with that it's definitely

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.480 
I'll agree with that it's definitely
better<00:06:05.470> than<00:06:05.680> some<00:06:05.800> of<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:05.950> games<00:06:06.040> that<00:06:06.190> even

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
better than some of the games that even

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.250 
better than some of the games that even
