00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
know the power bank so the cable is not

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.880 
know the power bank so the cable is not
actually<00:03:36.799> web<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:39.019> worked<00:03:39.549> fine<00:03:41.650> computer<00:03:42.650> and

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
actually web it worked fine computer and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.840 
actually web it worked fine computer and
devices<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:45.650> one<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.100> first<00:03:46.190> thing<00:03:46.670> is

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
devices so one of the first thing is

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.770 
devices so one of the first thing is
that<00:03:47.120> when<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.109> power<00:03:48.440> on<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.829> LED<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:50.750> can

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
that when you power on you LED you can

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.930 
that when you power on you LED you can
see<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.500> indicator<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.250> mean<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.489> battery

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
see the indicator I mean the battery

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.220 
see the indicator I mean the battery
level<00:03:53.060> indicator<00:03:53.299> so<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:55.040> know<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:56.420> can't<00:03:56.690> if

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
level indicator so you know you can't if

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.940 
level indicator so you know you can't if
if<00:03:57.530> you're<00:03:57.769> better<00:03:58.310> level<00:03:58.640> is<00:03:58.790> low<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.890> you

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
if you're better level is low and you

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.870 
if you're better level is low and you
want<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:02.450> know<00:04:02.570> a<00:04:02.780> torch<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.829> can<00:04:03.920> activate

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
want you know a torch you can activate

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.550 
want you know a torch you can activate
your<00:04:04.940> touch<00:04:05.239> but<00:04:05.269> you<00:04:05.900> will<00:04:06.049> know<00:04:06.200> when

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
your touch but you will know when

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.760 
your touch but you will know when
you<00:04:08.560> know<00:04:08.680> your<00:04:09.040> power<00:04:09.970> level<00:04:10.270> will<00:04:10.420> deplete

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
you know your power level will deplete

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.630
