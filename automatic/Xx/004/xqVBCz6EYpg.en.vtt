 eco-drive system clock 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.320

 slide rule or counting 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 ruler is a computing device 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.460
 allows you to perform several 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.119
 mathematical operations multiplication and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 division 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.170
 exponentiation you do not need 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.340
 calculate logs daily 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.910
 most cases logarithmic 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.000
 rulers are built into the hour and a number of hours 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.989
 equipped with computing lines 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 whose functions are close to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.860
 everyday life here for example 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.670
 sieve deputy pro workshop already by 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.090
 designation on the outside and inside 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.090
 saw inside 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.039
 you can understand that this watch is easy 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.160
 determine fuel consumption when 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.270
 car trip or travel 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.270
 on a motorboat 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.530
 let's start the simplest 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.490
 in order to divide the number 150 by 3 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.430
 should be the number 15 that is 150 on the outside 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.200
 scale set opposite the number 30 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.200
 which is on the inside scale 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:41.460
 the result is counted on the inside 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:45.450
 the scale against number 10 is 50 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.620
 try it yourself with prime numbers 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.620
 pause the video and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.190
 You can also calculate how much the pilot has 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.340
 aircraft time to end flight 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:11.030
 let's say the pilot is at a height of 3300 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:14.520
 meters he loses altitude with speed 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.780
 anal meter per second that 60 meters in 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:26.130
 a minute to know the answer 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.950
 should set the number 33 to external 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.190
 scale against the number 60 on the inside 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.190
 scale 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.879
 the result is opposite the number 10 in 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.269
 the internal scale is he in 55 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.269
 minutes 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.970
 let's leave aviation tasks alone and 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.020
 apply this rule to calculations more 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.200

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.760
 liters per 100 kilometers install 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.760
 number 40 opposite number 8 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.840
 we receive result 50 taking into account scale 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:35.930
 1 10 for 500 kilometers can be a bit 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:42.890
 practice simple examples with 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:45.260
 easy calculation of the results first 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.490
