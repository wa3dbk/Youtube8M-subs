00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello friends I am veronica lion of the 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.690
 brand of luque 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.689
 It's a pleasure to be back with 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.060

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.400
 let's make a nice necklace and a 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.680
 pair of earrings with tagua materials 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.489
 the materials that we are going to use for the 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.099
 necklace are three waxed cords of 60 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.559
 centimeters each a piece of tagua 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.430
 in the form of bean two rings 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.340
 separators 18 balines a parrot's beak 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.280
 for the earrings we need a couple of 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.830
 handles closed two eggs of tagua 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.850
 pins covers Balinese pebbles number 3 and 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.390
 couch milestones for earrings 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.510
 We center the pieces on the laces of 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.920
 so that we can on each side make a 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.390
 knot 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.500
 before placing the terminals we have 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.820
 to see that the tips are even 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.820
 we proceed to place the terminal 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.310
 and proceed to place the rings 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.229
 these rings have to be double the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 necklace was already finished until in the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.460
 terminals are the hoops and we are going to 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.460
 proceed to place the parrot's beak 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.640
 let's make the earrings we have the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.160
 pin that we've gone through the covers 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.330
 pepa we insert the rubber of ram 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.930
 then we put the little egg of water 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.330
 we put a little bit of earring 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.510
 we adjust these little pieces of earrings are 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.530
 so that the piece is firm 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.700
 and then we put the other covers pepa then 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.680
 we take the clamp and give it the shape of the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.020
 hook to place in closed shop 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.310
 we grease it on the pin which already 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.440
 is given to the curve we close 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.840
 and ready 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.840
