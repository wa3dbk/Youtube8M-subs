I<00:02:42.680> listen<00:02:43.310> Olivia<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:45.350> know<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.680> list<00:02:45.890> goes

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
I listen Olivia you know the list goes

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.820 
I listen Olivia you know the list goes
on<00:02:46.549> there's<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.360> many<00:02:47.660> designers<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.620> it

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
on there's so many designers and it

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.100 
on there's so many designers and it
starts<00:02:49.340> December<00:02:49.940> first<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.569> I<00:02:50.870> guess

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
starts December first and I guess

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.229 
starts December first and I guess
supplies<00:02:51.650> are<00:02:51.680> limited<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.610> believe

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
supplies are limited so I believe

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.699 
supplies are limited so I believe
they're<00:02:53.360> going<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.660> one<00:02:53.930> replenishment

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
they're going to have one replenishment

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.930 
they're going to have one replenishment
they're<00:02:54.920> going<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.099> drop<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.340> once<00:02:55.670> and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
they're going to drop it once and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.690 
they're going to drop it once and
whatever<00:02:56.780> goes<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.260> gone<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:58.010> believe<00:02:58.430> it

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
whatever goes is gone and I believe it

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.070 
whatever goes is gone and I believe it
in<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:58.940> higher<00:02:59.150> volume<00:02:59.630> targets<00:02:59.989> they're

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
in the higher volume targets they're

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.900 
in the higher volume targets they're
going<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:00.349> one<00:03:00.980> more<00:03:01.160> replenishment

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
going to have one more replenishment

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.430 
going to have one more replenishment
meaning<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.330> have<00:03:02.450> one<00:03:02.690> more<00:03:02.810> chance<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.200> get
