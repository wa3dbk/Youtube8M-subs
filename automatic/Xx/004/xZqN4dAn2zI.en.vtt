00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
shoulder trap level and then you'll see

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.690 
shoulder trap level and then you'll see
that<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.920> kind<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> little

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that they kind of have to do a little

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
that they kind of have to do a little
tippy<00:00:36.120> toe<00:00:36.270> motion<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> bar<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.200> or

off<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.500> rack<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.040> don't<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.880> because<00:00:39.090> I

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
off the rack I don't like that because I

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.760 
off the rack I don't like that because I
feel<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> sit<00:00:40.230> there<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
feel like you have to sit there and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.840 
feel like you have to sit there and

pitch it around with the weight and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
pitch it around with the weight and
readjust<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.510> even<00:00:42.750> after<00:00:42.870> you've<00:00:43.050> taken<00:00:43.170> off

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

readjust it even after you've taken off
the<00:00:43.559> rack<00:00:43.710> before<00:00:43.949> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.190> actually<00:00:44.309> get

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the rack before you can actually get

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.459 
the rack before you can actually get
squatting<00:00:45.059> whereas<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.929> keep<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> rack

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
squatting whereas if you keep the rack

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.200 
squatting whereas if you keep the rack
nice<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.920> low<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.489> lower<00:00:47.699> than<00:00:47.910> actually

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
nice and low like lower than actually

because of that I lost a lot of strength

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.089 
because of that I lost a lot of strength
of<00:02:06.960> my<00:02:07.050> squat<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.500> I'd<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.620> to<00:02:07.830> see<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.009> go

500 if I can squatting is definitely one

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.750 
500 if I can squatting is definitely one
of<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> most<00:02:13.140> awkward<00:02:13.349> exercises<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:14.459> me<00:02:14.610> I

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
of the most awkward exercises for me I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.449 
of the most awkward exercises for me I
have<00:02:15.120> long<00:02:15.390> legs<00:02:15.629> in<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.930> short<00:02:16.140> torso<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.800> cannot

have long legs in a short torso I cannot
low<00:02:17.730> barsuk<00:02:18.150> why<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.420> don't<00:02:18.569> have<00:02:18.659> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
low barsuk why I don't have the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.959 
low barsuk why I don't have the
flexibility<00:02:19.409> in<00:02:19.499> my<00:02:19.530> shoulders<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.760> by

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969 
flexibility in my shoulders just by

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.670 
flexibility in my shoulders just by
design<00:02:21.390> i<00:02:21.420> believe<00:02:21.840> squats

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
design i believe squats

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.589 
design i believe squats
they're<00:02:23.489> just<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.730> only<00:02:23.879> exercise<00:02:24.180> that's

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
they're just the only exercise that's

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.990 
they're just the only exercise that's
never<00:02:24.930> ever<00:02:25.230> felt<00:02:25.530> comfortable<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:26.129> me<00:02:26.159> but

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
never ever felt comfortable for me but

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.490 
never ever felt comfortable for me but
either<00:02:27.359> way<00:02:27.629> we're<00:02:27.810> bringing<00:02:28.079> them<00:02:28.140> back<00:02:28.260> up

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
either way we're bringing them back up

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.250 
either way we're bringing them back up
slowly<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:28.950> surely<00:02:29.629> next<00:02:30.629> move<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.900> did<00:02:31.049> was<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
slowly and surely next move I did was a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
slowly and surely next move I did was a
leg<00:02:31.500> press<00:02:31.829> now<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> don't<00:02:32.489> like<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.760> leg<00:02:32.879> press

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
leg press now I don't like the leg press

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970 
leg press now I don't like the leg press
because<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.599> feel<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.290> hack<00:02:34.439> squats<00:02:34.739> are<00:02:34.859> more

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
because I feel like hack squats are more

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.729 
because I feel like hack squats are more
efficient<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.439> a<00:02:37.500> pain<00:02:37.680> in

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
efficient that and it's just a pain in

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.839 
efficient that and it's just a pain in
the<00:02:37.769> butt<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.250> load<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.519> unload<00:02:38.549> the

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
the butt to have to load and unload the

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.339 
the butt to have to load and unload the
leg<00:02:39.000> press<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.480> kept<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.719> real<00:02:39.870> simple<00:02:40.109> today

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
leg press we kept the real simple today

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.500 
leg press we kept the real simple today
about<00:02:40.560> four<00:02:40.859> or<00:02:40.889> five<00:02:40.980> sets<00:02:41.459> no<00:02:42.299> more<00:02:42.480> than

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
about four or five sets no more than

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.360 
about four or five sets no more than
eight<00:02:42.719> plates<00:02:42.989> what<00:02:43.590> i<00:02:43.650> did<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.040> i<00:02:44.099> kept<00:02:44.310> my

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
eight plates what i did is i kept my

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.399 
eight plates what i did is i kept my
stance<00:02:44.609> nice<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.060> wide<00:02:45.389> which<00:02:46.079> makes<00:02:46.290> it

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
stance nice and wide which makes it

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.740 
stance nice and wide which makes it
harder<00:02:46.829> see<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> regular<00:02:48.060> stance<00:02:48.269> like<00:02:48.450> press

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
harder see a regular stance like press

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.140 
harder see a regular stance like press
