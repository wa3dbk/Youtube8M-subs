00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you to get your piano tuned how do you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.929 
you to get your piano tuned how do you
know<00:00:19.439> when<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:19.980> time<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.310> get<00:00:20.609> your<00:00:20.699> piano

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
know when it's time to get your piano

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150 
know when it's time to get your piano
tuned<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:21.960> not<00:00:22.230> as<00:00:22.380> easy<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.710> things<00:00:23.010> you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
tuned and it's not as easy of things you

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.189 
tuned and it's not as easy of things you
might<00:00:23.310> think<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.449> i'm<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
might think so i'm going to like it it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.200 
might think so i'm going to like it it
to<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> couple<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> different<00:00:26.039> things<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:27.000> any

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to a couple of different things if any

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.700 
to a couple of different things if any
of<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.359> play<00:00:27.630> guitar<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.320> know<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.529> every

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
of you play guitar you know that every

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.460 
of you play guitar you know that every
time<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.039> take<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.760> turn<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
time you take it out you turn it up in a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
time you take it out you turn it up in a
perfect<00:00:31.920> world<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> same

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
perfect world you would do the same

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.600 
perfect world you would do the same
thing<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.660> your<00:00:33.750> piano<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.680> since<00:00:35.309> there's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
thing with your piano but since there's

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.600 
thing with your piano but since there's
almost<00:00:35.760> over<00:00:36.750> 200<00:00:37.200> streams<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.739> tune<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.370> not

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
almost over 200 streams to tune it's not

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.549 
almost over 200 streams to tune it's not
practical<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.290> certain

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
practical so there are certain

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.860 
practical so there are certain
guidelines<00:00:40.829> much<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.149> your<00:00:42.239> car<00:00:42.540> when

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
guidelines much like with your car when

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.660 
guidelines much like with your car when
you<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> oil<00:00:43.410> change<00:00:43.860> well<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.550> an

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you get the oil change well you have an

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
you get the oil change well you have an
odometer<00:00:44.969> reading<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.960> if<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> ever<00:00:46.260> notice

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
odometer reading but if you ever notice

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.700 
odometer reading but if you ever notice
that<00:00:46.770> there's<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.940> date<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:49.110> even<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.620> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
that there's also a date so even if you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.139 
that there's also a date so even if you
don't<00:00:49.890> drive<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.430> car<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.910> still

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
don't drive your car it's still

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330 
don't drive your car it's still
recommended<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> change<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> oil<00:00:52.379> well<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
recommended you change the oil well the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
recommended you change the oil well the
same<00:00:53.670> thing<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.239> true<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.750> piano<00:00:54.960> your

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
same thing is true for your piano your

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
same thing is true for your piano your
candle<00:00:56.340> might<00:00:56.489> sound<00:00:56.910> fine<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.109> maybe

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
candle might sound fine to you but maybe

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.930 
candle might sound fine to you but maybe
it's<00:00:58.530> been<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> year<00:00:58.890> year<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> half<00:00:59.760> since

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it's been a year year and a half since

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.479 
it's been a year year and a half since
it's<00:01:00.120> been<00:01:00.239> tuned<00:01:00.539> well<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.680> important<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it's been tuned well it's important to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.009 
it's been tuned well it's important to
get<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.789> tuned<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.539> whole<00:01:03.719> camera

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
get it tuned because the whole camera

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.320 
get it tuned because the whole camera
could<00:01:04.229> shift<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.100> might<00:01:05.670> sound<00:01:06.030> good

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
could shift up or down might sound good

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
could shift up or down might sound good
within<00:01:06.570> itself<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> instrument<00:01:08.430> will

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
within itself but the instrument will

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
within itself but the instrument will
not<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.150> able<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.450> accept<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.200> tuning<00:01:10.619> without

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
not be able to accept the tuning without

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.609 
not be able to accept the tuning without
several<00:01:12.240> more<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.750> needs<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> pitch

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
several more to needs to get the pitch

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.090 
several more to needs to get the pitch
stable<00:01:14.070> again<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.090> rough<00:01:15.840> guidelines<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
stable again so rough guidelines the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.010 
stable again so rough guidelines the
piano<00:01:17.369> technicians<00:01:17.909> give<00:01:18.020> recommends

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
piano technicians give recommends

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
piano technicians give recommends
ideally<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> piano<00:01:19.890> should<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.159> tuned<00:01:20.340> about

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
ideally a piano should be tuned about

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.260 
ideally a piano should be tuned about
four<00:01:20.759> times<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.270> year<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.920> minimum<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> twice<00:01:23.369> why

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
four times a year a minimum of twice why

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.200 
four times a year a minimum of twice why
is<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.259> very<00:01:25.380> simple<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.580> change<00:01:26.939> of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
is that it's very simple the change of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.600 
is that it's very simple the change of
seasons<00:01:27.740> affects<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> tuning<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.220> your<00:01:29.369> piano

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
seasons affects the tuning of your piano

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.249 
seasons affects the tuning of your piano
so<00:01:30.119> even<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> don't<00:01:30.750> play<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.079> piano

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so even if you don't play your piano

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
so even if you don't play your piano
it's<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.189> tuned<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.640> minimum<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
it's got to be tuned a minimum of a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.940 
it's got to be tuned a minimum of a
couple<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.689> times<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.049> year<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.829> most

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
couple of times a year and in most

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
couple of times a year and in most
climates<00:01:35.520> four<00:01:35.729> times<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.119> year<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.509> really

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
climates four times a year is really

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.830 
climates four times a year is really
closer<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.799> ideal<00:01:38.280> now<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.420> play<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
closer to ideal now if you play the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.990 
closer to ideal now if you play the
piano<00:01:39.869> great<00:01:40.350> deal<00:01:40.560> every<00:01:41.340> time<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.729> play<00:01:41.880> to

piano great deal every time you play to

piano great deal every time you play to
go

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
go

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.749 
go
a<00:01:42.409> little<00:01:42.770> bit<00:01:42.950> especially<00:01:43.520> if<00:01:43.579> you're<00:01:43.700> a

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
a little bit especially if you're a

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.520 
a little bit especially if you're a

you<00:01:46.070> might<00:01:46.280> consider<00:01:46.520> monthly<00:01:47.329> tunings<00:01:47.719> of

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
you might consider monthly tunings of

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.779 
you might consider monthly tunings of
your<00:01:47.990> piano<00:01:48.289> now<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:48.890> know<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.159> might<00:01:49.579> think

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
your piano now I know you might think

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.179 
your piano now I know you might think
this<00:01:50.000> gets<00:01:50.180> very<00:01:50.420> expensive<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.920> long

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
this gets very expensive but in the long

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.039 
this gets very expensive but in the long
run<00:01:52.220> like<00:01:52.939> changing<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.509> oil<00:01:53.659> in<00:01:53.840> your<00:01:53.990> car

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
run like changing the oil in your car

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.649 
run like changing the oil in your car
the<00:01:54.860> more<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:55.220> tune<00:01:55.520> your<00:01:55.549> piano<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.420> better

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
the more you tune your piano the better

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.270 
the more you tune your piano the better
you<00:01:56.780> preserve<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.350> instrument<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.070> more

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
you preserve the instrument and the more

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.819 
you preserve the instrument and the more
stable<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.820> tuning<00:01:59.149> becomes<00:01:59.539> you<00:02:00.170> never<00:02:00.530> save

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
stable the tuning becomes you never save

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.830 
stable the tuning becomes you never save
money<00:02:01.070> by<00:02:01.250> putting<00:02:01.490> off<00:02:01.729> tuning<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:02.600> here's

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
money by putting off tuning so here's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.779 
money by putting off tuning so here's
what<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.020> recommend<00:02:03.289> for<00:02:03.679> you<00:02:03.799> if<00:02:04.369> you're<00:02:04.729> a

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
what I recommend for you if you're a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.149 
what I recommend for you if you're a
casual<00:02:05.390> player<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.110> you've<00:02:06.560> got<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.710> stable

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
casual player and you've got a stable

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.009 
casual player and you've got a stable
environment<00:02:07.189> for<00:02:07.670> your<00:02:07.819> piano<00:02:08.090> put<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.899> on

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
environment for your piano put it on

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.660 
environment for your piano put it on
your<00:02:09.140> calendar<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.769> get<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.069> tuned<00:02:10.310> at<00:02:10.429> least

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
your calendar to get it tuned at least

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.509 
your calendar to get it tuned at least
twice<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.180> year<00:02:11.510> once<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.319> year<00:02:12.349> you're<00:02:13.069> really

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
twice a year once a year you're really

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.089 
twice a year once a year you're really
kind<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.230> one<00:02:15.230> step<00:02:15.440> forward<00:02:15.709> two<00:02:15.980> steps

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
kind of like one step forward two steps

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.610 
kind of like one step forward two steps
backwards<00:02:16.819> because<00:02:17.269> your<00:02:17.720> piano<00:02:18.049> over<00:02:18.349> time

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
backwards because your piano over time

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.070 
backwards because your piano over time
will<00:02:18.830> not<00:02:19.010> really<00:02:19.400> be<00:02:19.519> stable<00:02:20.120> enough<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.989> if

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
will not really be stable enough but if

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.990 
will not really be stable enough but if
you<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.349> twice<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:21.980> might<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:22.549> stay

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
you do it twice here you might just stay

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.150 
you do it twice here you might just stay
on<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.299> cusp<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.900> at<00:02:24.019> least<00:02:24.170> not<00:02:24.500> going

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
on that cusp and at least not going

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.970 
on that cusp and at least not going
backwards<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.060> tooling<00:02:26.360> stability

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
backwards in the tooling stability

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.890 
backwards in the tooling stability
ideally<00:02:27.980> more<00:02:28.549> tunings<00:02:29.060> you'll<00:02:29.450> appreciate

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
ideally more tunings you'll appreciate

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.320 
ideally more tunings you'll appreciate
it<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.680> eventually<00:02:30.950> you'll<00:02:31.790> save<00:02:32.090> money

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
it and eventually you'll save money

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.240 
it and eventually you'll save money
because<00:02:32.599> your<00:02:32.810> piano<00:02:33.080> become<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.709> stable<00:02:34.040> that

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
because your piano become so stable that

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.600 
because your piano become so stable that
the<00:02:34.760> tunings<00:02:35.209> will<00:02:35.630> hold<00:02:35.930> longer<00:02:36.470> for<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:36.950> so

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610
