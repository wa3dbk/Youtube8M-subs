walk<00:02:40.570> away<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.290> just<00:02:41.760> think<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.940> my<00:02:43.720> result<00:02:44.140> at

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
walk away and just think of my result at

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.890 
walk away and just think of my result at
the<00:02:44.830> end<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:45.730> i<00:02:45.760> really<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:46.750> that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
the end of this so i really think that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.560 
the end of this so i really think that
these<00:02:47.350> first<00:02:47.890> three<00:02:48.100> days<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.640> hugely<00:02:49.150> it's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
these first three days it's hugely it's

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.470 
these first three days it's hugely it's
a<00:02:49.630> big<00:02:49.870> mind<00:02:50.260> battle<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.000> have<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.300> deal

a big mind battle that you have to deal
with<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:53.019> get<00:02:53.170> through<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.890> um<00:02:54.790> but<00:02:55.360> i<00:02:55.620> just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
with to get through and um but i just

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.660 
with to get through and um but i just
think<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.100> kind<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.340> just<00:02:57.489> make<00:02:57.640> a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
think you have to kind of just make a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.570 
think you have to kind of just make a
decision<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.680> talk<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.860> yourself<00:03:00.010> i'm
