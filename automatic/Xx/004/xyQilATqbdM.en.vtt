00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.410
 very good to all people I am a machine 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.220
 welcome to a new world of video of 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.540
 warcraft 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.710
 this time to tell you about a 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.660
 new feature that is going to be 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.150
 implemented soon and I'm 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.160
 sure that many will like it 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.960
 better some not but good to most 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.520
 I think you're going to like it is one of the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.950
 more important features than me 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.050
 I said in one of the last videos that 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.640
 I published the world of warcraft about 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.110
 the next changes and many me 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.940
 you said and when this feature 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.379
 was active that will be notified good 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.410
 Well, the characteristic of which I am 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.899
 speaking is to be able to pay time for 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.210
 game with gold of the game is not to say 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.940
 have to pay with real money 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.550
 Well, I'll tell you soon it's going to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.890
 adding a wow tab is called like that 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.620
 which the web tab the wow tab is 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.559
 a card an item that you can redeem 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.909
 for 30 days of play this card the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.069
 they will have bought other players 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.960
 previously in the world of shop 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:01.690
 warcraft in the breeze store that is 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.089
 players who want can win gold 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.520
 fast they will buy real money 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.200
 tab and they will sell it within the game to 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.210
 players who have gold and who want 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.690
 buy game time this system already 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.760
 we have seen a lot 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.960
 last titles like arkaitz for example 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.640
 although what you do free to play but 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.740
 you can buy the apex to have the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.290
 advantages of being premium and then also 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.090
 the wow is cool, these were the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.620
 scripts you could buy kritz that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.110
 other players bought real content 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.790
 and subscribed exchanged for time of 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.160
 good game because web is going to make a 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.900
 similar system with some nuances that 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.060
 will continue commenting but good is going to 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.800
 be that we're going to be able to play wow 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.240
 without paying a hard one is to say 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.700
 simply with the time that you 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.740
 dedicate and what you take out then playing 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.960
 I imagine that you can quite get the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.030
 enough gold to be able to buy time 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.650
 of games 30 days then good I'm going to 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.820
 explain these details because I imagine 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.550
 that there will be people who do not understand it very 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.980
 alright so he had to explain questions 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.690
 frequent as I buy chips from the 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.660
 world with real money it is so 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.060
 simple as it puts here as in inside 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.520
 of the game in your bag of your character 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.290
 you can access the elisa store in 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.760
 this in this store, there will be an item 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.220
 that will wow tab and you 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.170
 buy it with real money then says 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.670
 I need gold as I sell a tab 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.530
 egg to another player that is to say we 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.960
 we put now in the skin of the player who 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.310
 He has game time but wants gold 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.900
 because love has not been able to get it 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.640
 because I needed it to be bought by 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.210
 example a super face saddle what does 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.250
 that player 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.950
 well so far or farm and the sack 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.660
 or illegally buying the gold in 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.640
 external pages well now it's going to 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.140
 to be able to buy the chips with real money 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.850
 of wow and sell ace in the house of 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.370
 auctions so that those people who 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.470
 they have a lot of gold but they do not want to pay 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.970
 subscription or can not pay 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.280
 subscription but they have a lot of time 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.840
 to generate gold because they can buy 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.610
 game chips I said they sell 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.740
 in the auction house but it's not going to be 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 as a typical egg auction is 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.090
 say you are not going to put the price that you 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.980
 you do not even want to be able to put in a bid 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.290
 initial for people to occupy 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.750
 the price of the egg tokens goes to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.970
 be fixed by region ie america 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.530
 europe china 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.560
 I do not know if Korea is separated I think so 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.600
 and I do not know if he left me some taiwan and I do not know 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.130
 if any more the price will be 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.410
 fixed by region will be fixed 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.270
 depending on the supply and demand is 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.070
 say how much are you going to place a token 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.890
 in the auction house so that the trÃ£ 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.000
 buy a player you will be told the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.860
 price for which it is selling 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.810
 now you can decide if to put it 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.150
 directly or wait 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.530
 you decide to put it then the price that you 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.849
 is saying that with the one that is going to 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.700
 sell for which you are going to sell 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.780
 then you accept it you put the file and 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.610
 then you simply have to wait 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.200
 to have someone buy it if for a 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.660
 those chips are sold very fast 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.220
 the price will then rise a player who 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.930
 come later to put the card as to what 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.220
 better sell more expensive then as 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.840
 there is a bit of the game of waiting 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.489
 they have to wait for you what they do not know 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.280
 You can do as you did for example in 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.430
 arkaitz or how it happened in why start is 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.280
 that when those games came out and it came out 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.019
 this system you already came very well 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.610
 buy crisis or buy apex 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.290
 dependent on the game very early 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.880
 because you knew that later I was going to go up 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.590
 price then you could play in the 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.180
 auction with that item 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.850
 with the item that gives you game time 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.440
 in this case the boys start not 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.819
 they want to do so they do not want you 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.620
 can you say make money buying and 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.959
 selling fact chips the chips a 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.790
 once bought they will be linked to you to your 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.799
 soul they are going to link to your account you are not going to 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.770
 you will be able to sell again, so 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.110
 is going to be able to make say in gold without 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.850
 buy the card previously is to say you 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.320
 you will not be able to be in the auction go 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.540
 buying chips selling chips 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.100
 how the price goes up or down simply 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.170
 you can buy it with real money and 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.940
 put it or not put it in the house of 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.830
 auctions for the fixed price of that 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.390
 moment the price of wow chips 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.440
 has not yet been announced they say that 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.270
 will join soon 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.060
 I can only tell you that for example in 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.490
 why start the price of the crit that was the 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.950
 why stars tab was sold in with 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.840
 real money at 16 euros when the month 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.400
 was to 13 is to say that there was a 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.560
 little bit more expensive I say it simply 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.030
 as data I do not know if they will do the same or 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.280
 will sell directly to what a 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.370
 month that are 13 euros on the other hand in 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.110
 As you buy a card ebook either 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.580
 buying the real money in the 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.380
 shop enable or connor or in the house 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.030
 of auctions within the game you will receive 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.430
 the card instantly in the mailbox 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.170
 with your character plus all the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.180
 transactions that you do with 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.340
 real money or in the auction house 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.490
 they will be final you will get the message 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.590
 typical of if you are if you agree 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.480
 with what is going to happen and if you accept then 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.100
 you can not even cancel the bid in the 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.060
 auction house of a game card 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.280
 neither 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.240
 and return the game card that they meet 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.440
 have it enabled for you 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.060
 reimburse the money that has cost you 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.100
 any of those two actions are 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.660
 final and finally the chips 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.270
 well I think you said it but they are 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.160
 of 30 days each that you consume with your 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.020
 character with your characters will be 30 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.639
 days that you add to your account and 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.950
 these chips never educate is to say that 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.630
 you can buy four chips and 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.900
 keep them in your infinite inventory 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.940
 until you decide 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.560
 until you decide to spend them consume them 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.790
 and good people, this is the first 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.100
 information we have about this new 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.930
 system wanted to make a specific video 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.340
 about this first because I 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.990
 you have asked many who will notify you in 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.600
 how much could it possibly be to 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.070
 Many people interested you and also 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.830
 because it is very important news that 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.229
 the great mpg of all times good 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.410
 any the most played game the mpg more 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.820
 played or one of the most played I do 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.490
 this can be quite striking not 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.440
 because always many games come out 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.940
 with quota system and after about 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.680
 years some months right away 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.539
 changing the model and then it's the one that 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.970
 he has kept constant and faithful and super 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.440
 faithful to its payment system more than anything 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.430
 because they have done very well they have done the 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.510
 things well we're not going to fool 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.580
 so then with all of this it is 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.520
 striking this new system that you 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.080
 allow to play some official without having 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.910
 to pay real money that's why I wanted 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.070
 make the video so nothing people hope 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.710
 that you liked the idea to those who do not 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.090
 Well I do not know more luck and see you in 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.090
 the next video see you later
