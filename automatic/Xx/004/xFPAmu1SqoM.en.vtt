place where and got it pierced hoping

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.359 
place where and got it pierced hoping
for<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.910> solution<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.870> he<00:00:16.379> said<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.949> he<00:00:17.190> was

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
for a solution and he said that he was

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.580 
for a solution and he said that he was
going<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> take<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.910> hoop<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.590> suggested

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
going to take the hoop out suggested

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.689 
going to take the hoop out suggested
putting<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.100> gem<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.590> drain<00:00:22.590> out<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.279> fluid

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
putting in a gem and drain out the fluid

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.230 
putting in a gem and drain out the fluid
that<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.380> bubble<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.070> put<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.000> some

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
that was in the bubble and put on some

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.779 
that was in the bubble and put on some
triple<00:00:27.449> antibiotic<00:00:28.320> ointment<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
triple antibiotic ointment on it so it

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.020 
triple antibiotic ointment on it so it
was<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> guess<00:00:30.330> he<00:00:30.539> knows<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:30.900> he's<00:00:31.019> doing<00:00:31.470> so

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
was a guess he knows what he's doing so

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.990 
was a guess he knows what he's doing so
he<00:00:33.030> took<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.710> nose<00:00:35.130> hoop<00:00:35.460> which<00:00:35.670> looked

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
he took out the nose hoop which looked

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
he took out the nose hoop which looked
like<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.760> he<00:00:39.739> put<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.210> oh<00:00:42.350> before<00:00:43.350> he

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
like this and he put in oh before he

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.670 
like this and he put in oh before he
tried<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> squeeze<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.930> bubble<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
tried to squeeze out the bubble but it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.799 
tried to squeeze out the bubble but it
didn't<00:00:47.070> work<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.640> he<00:00:47.969> had<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> cut<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.600> off

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
didn't work so he had to cut it off

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
didn't work so he had to cut it off
which<00:00:49.110> hurt<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.500> lot<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.920> bled<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.059> then

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
which hurt a lot it bled a lot and then

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.590 
which hurt a lot it bled a lot and then
he<00:00:51.360> put<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> gem<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.500> hurt<00:00:52.739> too<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
he put in the gem and that hurt too and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.590 
he put in the gem and that hurt too and
after<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.960> everything<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.710> fine<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.270> put

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
after that everything was fine so I put

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.709 
after that everything was fine so I put
in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> ointment<00:00:58.559> two<00:00:59.129> times<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.789> day<00:01:00.030> inside

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719

in the ointment two times a day inside
and<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> clean<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
