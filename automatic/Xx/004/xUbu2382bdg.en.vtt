watching<00:04:17.450> Sherlock<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.320> night<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:19.579> I

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
watching Sherlock that night that I

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.300

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
think you just really can't put a finger

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.040 
think you just really can't put a finger
on<00:04:22.520> it

shooting<00:04:52.419> in<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.659> streets<00:04:52.930> at<00:04:53.169> night<00:04:53.229> is

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
shooting in the streets at night is

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.640 
shooting in the streets at night is
definitely<00:04:54.069> a<00:04:54.099> lot<00:04:54.280> harder

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
definitely a lot harder

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.649 
definitely a lot harder
fortunately<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:57.490> ken<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:58.150> camera<00:04:58.449> I'm<00:04:58.539> sure

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
fortunately the ken the camera I'm sure

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.390 
fortunately the ken the camera I'm sure
you<00:04:58.750> were<00:04:58.900> right<00:04:59.020> now<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.229> Canon<00:04:59.830> 5d<00:05:00.009> it's

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
you were right now the Canon 5d it's

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.279 
you were right now the Canon 5d it's
really<00:05:00.849> great<00:05:01.060> in<00:05:01.150> high<00:05:01.300> ISO<00:05:01.659> so<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:01.930> could<00:05:02.139> just

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
really great in high ISO so I could just

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.279 
really great in high ISO so I could just
bump<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.069> up<00:05:03.159> to<00:05:03.220> 3200<00:05:03.940> ISO<00:05:04.030> no<00:05:04.509> problem<00:05:04.870> and

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
bump it up to 3200 ISO no problem and

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.570 
bump it up to 3200 ISO no problem and
since<00:05:05.409> I'm<00:05:05.590> shooting<00:05:05.800> with<00:05:05.830> a<00:05:05.949> prime<00:05:06.190> lens<00:05:06.400> I

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
since I'm shooting with a prime lens I

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.279 
since I'm shooting with a prime lens I
have<00:05:06.729> a<00:05:06.759> really<00:05:07.419> large<00:05:07.509> aperture<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:08.080> lets

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
have a really large aperture that lets

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.860 
have a really large aperture that lets
in<00:05:08.409> ally<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.770> light<00:05:08.949> and<00:05:09.750> when<00:05:10.750> you're

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
in ally of light and when you're

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.570 
in ally of light and when you're
shooting<00:05:11.050> during<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.440> night<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.949> think

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
shooting during the night I think

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.120 
shooting during the night I think
there's<00:05:12.849> so<00:05:13.030> much<00:05:13.090> more<00:05:13.360> mystery<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.169> so<00:05:14.979> much

the<00:06:05.530> street<00:06:05.800> is<00:06:05.889> definitely<00:06:06.370> something<00:06:07.060> that

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
the street is definitely something that

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:26.340 
the street is definitely something that
all<00:06:07.660> superstars<00:06:08.110> have<00:06:08.470> to<00:06:08.590> do

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.870 

I<00:06:26.970> think<00:06:27.970> that<00:06:28.180> photography<00:06:28.720> really<00:06:28.960> helps

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.130 

kind<00:06:32.880> of<00:06:32.940> humbled<00:06:33.300> me<00:06:33.420> myself<00:06:33.960> as<00:06:34.050> a<00:06:34.080> person<00:06:34.590> I

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
kind of humbled me myself as a person I

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.920 
kind of humbled me myself as a person I
remember<00:06:37.140> when<00:06:37.440> I<00:06:38.090> started<00:06:39.090> photography<00:06:39.210> I

remember when I started photography I

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.250 
remember when I started photography I
just<00:06:40.650> threw<00:06:40.830> my<00:06:41.580> primary<00:06:42.000> concern<00:06:42.360> was<00:06:42.810> to<00:06:43.020> get

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
just threw my primary concern was to get

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.440 
just threw my primary concern was to get

photographers on my blog and people are

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.500 
photographers on my blog and people are
just<00:07:24.030> so<00:07:25.190> genuinely<00:07:26.190> touched<00:07:26.490> and<00:07:26.940> honored<00:07:27.150> by

just so genuinely touched and honored by

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.080 
just so genuinely touched and honored by
this<00:07:27.570> and<00:07:28.320> it's<00:07:28.470> it's<00:07:28.800> this<00:07:29.220> is<00:07:29.520> weird<00:07:29.850> because

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090 
this and it's it's this is weird because

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.990 
this and it's it's this is weird because
I<00:07:30.570> always<00:07:31.260> tried<00:07:31.650> so<00:07:31.830> hard<00:07:31.860> to<00:07:32.160> get<00:07:32.310> featured

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
I always tried so hard to get featured

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.220 
I always tried so hard to get featured
on<00:07:33.450> websites<00:07:34.040> for<00:07:35.040> my<00:07:35.190> photography<00:07:35.520> but

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.230 
on websites for my photography but

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.700 
on websites for my photography but
focusing<00:07:37.230> and<00:07:37.620> helping<00:07:37.920> others<00:07:38.220> I<00:07:38.460> think<00:07:38.520> that

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.710 
focusing and helping others I think that

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.070 
focusing and helping others I think that
in<00:07:40.710> the<00:07:40.890> big<00:07:41.040> picture<00:07:41.250> I've<00:07:41.580> actually<00:07:42.080> been

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
in the big picture I've actually been

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.300 
in the big picture I've actually been
rewarded<00:07:43.650> more<00:07:43.830> through<00:07:44.070> that<00:07:46.010> not<00:07:47.010> only<00:07:47.130> that

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.310 
rewarded more through that not only that

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.540 
rewarded more through that not only that
but<00:07:47.550> street<00:07:47.940> photography<00:07:48.450> helps<00:07:48.720> me<00:07:49.550> really

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.550 
but street photography helps me really

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.540 
but street photography helps me really
appreciate<00:07:50.640> life<00:07:51.180> a<00:07:51.360> lot<00:07:51.480> more
