00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.780 

all<00:00:01.020> right<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.410> is<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.800> blue<00:00:02.040> whale<00:00:02.370> fuzz

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
all right this is the blue whale fuzz

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.369 
all right this is the blue whale fuzz
made<00:00:03.240> by<00:00:03.449> make<00:00:03.780> sounds<00:00:04.290> loudly<00:00:04.560> petals<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:06.379> we

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
made by make sounds loudly petals and we

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.129 
made by make sounds loudly petals and we
got<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> volume<00:00:07.980> knob<00:00:08.599> compression<00:00:09.599> knob<00:00:09.809> and

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
got a volume knob compression knob and

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.240 
got a volume knob compression knob and
then<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.070> fuzz<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.170> fuzz<00:00:13.170> works<00:00:13.500> best<00:00:13.889> at

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
then the fuzz and the fuzz works best at

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.060 
then the fuzz and the fuzz works best at
twelve<00:00:14.969> o'clock<00:00:15.289> you<00:00:16.289> go<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> right<00:00:16.800> that

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
twelve o'clock you go to the right that

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.890 
twelve o'clock you go to the right that
sounds<00:00:17.430> better<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.880> some<00:00:18.150> pickups<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
sounds better with some pickups go to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.200 
sounds better with some pickups go to
left<00:00:19.109> sounds<00:00:19.470> better<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:19.800> other<00:00:19.949> pickups<00:00:20.310> it

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
left sounds better with other pickups it

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.529 
left sounds better with other pickups it
gets<00:00:21.449> more<00:00:21.810> compressed<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.300> gated<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
gets more compressed and gated and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.960 
gets more compressed and gated and
square<00:00:25.109> when<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.099> turn<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.519> compression

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
square when you turn this compression

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.160 
square when you turn this compression
knob<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:28.820> sounds<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.480> loud<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
knob to the right sounds really loud and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.630 
knob to the right sounds really loud and
wide<00:00:31.380> open<00:00:31.800> all<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.790> way<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.180> left<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
wide open all the way to the left and

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.970 
wide open all the way to the left and
it's<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.940> circuit<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.570> designed<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.739> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it's a circuit I designed and it's in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.410 
it's a circuit I designed and it's in
this<00:00:38.610> case<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.180> painted<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:41.239> rode<00:00:42.239> out

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this case that I painted and rode out

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.020 
this case that I painted and rode out
blue<00:00:42.870> whale<00:00:43.050> fuzz<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> sides<00:00:44.670> there's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
blue whale fuzz and on the sides there's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.319 
blue whale fuzz and on the sides there's
pictures<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.360> whales<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.960> drew<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:47.329> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
pictures of whales that I drew on and so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.680 
pictures of whales that I drew on and so
I'm<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.670> give<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> clean<00:00:51.120> signal

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.170 

and<00:00:58.650> now<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.830> 25%<00:01:01.830> volume<00:01:02.580> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and now here is it with 25% volume and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:02:14.990 
and now here is it with 25% volume and
everything<00:01:03.870> else<00:01:03.989> masked

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.790 

so<00:02:16.000> that's<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.480> little<00:02:16.720> bit<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:17.080> what<00:02:17.380> kind

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
so that's just a little bit of what kind

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.440 
so that's just a little bit of what kind
of<00:02:17.830> sounds<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.400> get<00:02:18.520> out<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.910> kind

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
of sounds you can get out of this kind

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.780 
of sounds you can get out of this kind
of<00:02:19.710> definitely<00:02:20.710> square<00:02:21.040> wave<00:02:21.250> there's<00:02:21.580> some

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
of definitely square wave there's some

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.670 
of definitely square wave there's some
sub<00:02:22.120> octave<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:25.140> that's<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.350> blue<00:02:26.500> whale

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
sub octave and that's the blue whale

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.850 
sub octave and that's the blue whale
fuzz<00:02:26.920> thanks
