00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 today guys I've been bringing them here 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.279
 You guys are a lot different than me. 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.080
 I had never done before arrival type 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.519
 the first time I do here and I 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.489
 I really enjoyed it so they 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.710
 like it is that and let's go then 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.290
 surprise look what I've done here that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.590
 it was for those who are not recognizing this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.110
 here is the mini one way of my wicked 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.940
 favorite was that even that minimum 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 that cute little yellow bug 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.590
 It's very cute in my movie. 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 evil favorite was for those who do not know 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.289
 What is a cartoon car drawing film? 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.079
 né e e r and 1 million of my movie 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.879
 Wicked favorite is and I liked it a lot 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.629
 of having done it because it is a sculpture 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.280
 3d guys that same 3d and I never had 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.960
 made a 3g sculpture before it went to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.409
 first time I make a sculpture 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.700
 type 3 is so is and was was not so 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.920
 difficult because I already had one 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 notion of how I could have done this 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 is turned on so it was fairly easy to 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.060
 It took me about an hour to 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.280
 make the complete kit even I went 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.409
 listening to music and not even having to 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.680
 passing the rapidion to do this 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.630
 here I arrived I did not use the word I had 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.509
 any instrument type the most right 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.390
 additional is because it is not too many details 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.549
 and there is no way to type with where type 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.619
 for example and looting these boots do not have 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.360
 how to use digitized so I had 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.040
 who do everything amon can see that up 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.350
 that at last is hollow because it was 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 everything at hand even in the same hand used 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.840
 even I took some excesses that have here is 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.820
 zero 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 but finally some excesses here that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.710
 You take out it will give light type here 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.649
 so I did not have access but finally to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.479
 I was I go and you can see that 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.060
 these videos that are coming out is 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.740
 tas consultant still small and three 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.500
 minutes four minutes because the galley 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.110
 because the guys do not have the camera 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.129
 studio which is the program I use 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.349
 to do ooo time lethes, then it's 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.360
 I still can not do it yet 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.950
 But I took some print out to 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.989
 you have an idea of ​​how the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.730
 progress and for those people who will 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.430
 Say I got there from somewhere. 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.930
 I do not know, but I'll leave it at that. 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.640
 now the question of the possible sale is 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 so I think two or three pikes 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.920
 Clients I took and anyway people are 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.540
 I got to do it here because it's in 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.180
 statue and you have seen even the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.920
 video right yesterday that it was very good 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.400
 until deposition continues in the air with the series 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.739
 from the bar of good né and I usually do 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.290
 want kaká big structure then 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.079
 I decided to do here is to test at least né 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.910
 a large statue right and this will me 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.889
 help get a sense of what to do 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.840
 Like I'm going to make a statue of 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.400
 freedom a redeeming christ of life 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.319
 kind of going to be pretty hard because 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.510
 has the details and that is that it was only one 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.400
 Little test come in for me to have a 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.859
 sense of how I went about but 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.500
 anyway guys was good because kind of 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.940
 odessa for some details here buttons and 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.639
