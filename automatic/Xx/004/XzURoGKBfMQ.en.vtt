we're wanting to go forward but there's
something<00:02:12.720> different<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.319> shisha<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.370> way

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
something different and shisha is a way

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.970 
something different and shisha is a way
that<00:02:14.700> he<00:02:15.269> touches<00:02:15.840> hearts<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.349> minds<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
that he touches hearts and minds and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.920 
that he touches hearts and minds and
gets<00:02:17.160> things<00:02:17.459> going<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:18.030> think<00:02:18.420> he<00:02:18.599> will<00:02:18.780> make<00:02:18.900> a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
gets things going I think he will make a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:33.990 
gets things going I think he will make a
difference

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.530

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.449 

yeah<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.599> baby<00:02:39.689> crazy<00:02:40.689> I<00:02:41.439> think<00:02:41.950> Jason's<00:02:42.310> not

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
yeah you baby crazy I think Jason's not

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:56.280 
yeah you baby crazy I think Jason's not
afraid<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:43.000> try<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.390> bit<00:02:43.659> of<00:02:43.689> everything

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.920 

it's<00:02:57.159> unusually<00:02:57.760> versatile<00:02:58.269> I<00:02:58.480> think<00:02:58.780> that's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
it's unusually versatile I think that's

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.990 
it's unusually versatile I think that's
really<00:02:59.200> what<00:02:59.319> makes<00:02:59.920> things<00:03:00.219> work<00:03:00.430> form<00:03:00.730> so

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
really what makes things work form so

in my second year in medical school I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.090 
in my second year in medical school I
was<00:04:02.270> looking<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.540> do<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.110> international

doing here to our patients so that we

can advance medicine for not only

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.860 
can advance medicine for not only
patients<00:04:44.730> here<00:04:44.850> in<00:04:44.940> Edmonton<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:45.420> across<00:04:45.600> the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
patients here in Edmonton but across the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.230 
patients here in Edmonton but across the
world<00:04:45.990> was<00:04:46.560> an<00:04:46.680> opportunity<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.820> don't

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
world was an opportunity that I don't

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.020 
world was an opportunity that I don't
think<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:48.450> could<00:04:48.660> get<00:04:48.780> anywhere<00:04:49.170> else<00:04:49.350> but<00:04:50.030> he

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
think you could get anywhere else but he

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.060 
think you could get anywhere else but he
just<00:04:51.270> has<00:04:51.810> everything<00:04:53.210> you<00:04:54.210> know<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.390> I'm

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
just has everything you know and I'm

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.140 
just has everything you know and I'm
sometimes<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:56.190> think<00:04:56.250> why<00:04:56.580> doesn't<00:04:57.060> one

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
sometimes you think why doesn't one

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.330 
sometimes you think why doesn't one
person<00:04:57.210> get<00:04:57.750> everything<00:04:58.200> but<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.860> difference

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
person get everything but the difference

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.860 
person get everything but the difference
between<00:04:59.490> geesh<00:04:59.940> on<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.330> some<00:05:00.510> people<00:05:00.750> who

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
between geesh on and some people who
