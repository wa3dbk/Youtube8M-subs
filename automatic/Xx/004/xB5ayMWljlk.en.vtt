00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
rises to over 500 degrees into think so

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.520 
rises to over 500 degrees into think so
over<00:00:47.079> 600<00:00:47.680> degrees

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.050 

he's<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:52.740> going<00:00:53.070> straight<00:00:53.550> through<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.880> hole

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
he's now going straight through the hole

and spraying a fine mist of water into
the<00:00:56.730> room<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.330> you<00:00:57.810> see<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> temperatures

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
the room and you see the temperatures
