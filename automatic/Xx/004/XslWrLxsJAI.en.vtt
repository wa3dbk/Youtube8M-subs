and a half human baby that was kind of
weird<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.750> thought<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:15.930> gonna<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.009> then

weird I thought it was gonna be and then

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
weird I thought it was gonna be and then
it<00:01:17.340> shows<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> end<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.360> she's<00:01:18.750> dying<00:01:19.020> and

it shows at the end that she's dying and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.249 
it shows at the end that she's dying and
the<00:01:19.439> only<00:01:19.560> way<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> save<00:01:20.070> her<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.900> turn<00:01:22.080> her

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the only way to save her is to turn her

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
the only way to save her is to turn her
into<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.530> vampire<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.909> Edward<00:01:24.390> two

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
into a vampire and was it Edward two

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.370 
into a vampire and was it Edward two
turns<00:01:25.229> into<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.590> mother<00:01:26.250> vampire<00:01:26.729> side

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so in this clip in the teaser I guess

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.840 
so in this clip in the teaser I guess
it's<00:01:32.970> official<00:01:33.450> trailer<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.400> it<00:01:35.400> shows

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it's official trailer then it shows

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
Bella as vampire and the council's not

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.069 
Bella as vampire and the council's not
too<00:01:38.310> happy<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.790> she's<00:01:38.970> become<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.600> vampire

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
too happy that she's become a vampire

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.770 
too happy that she's become a vampire
because<00:01:40.350> that's<00:01:40.740> against<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> rules<00:01:41.780> even

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
