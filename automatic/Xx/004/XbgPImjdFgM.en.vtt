00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
stop sign works really nicely since I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.960 
stop sign works really nicely since I
wasn't<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.020> video<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:17.040> didn't<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
wasn't know the video I didn't get the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.870 
wasn't know the video I didn't get the
tape<00:01:18.180> undone<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.049> package<00:01:19.369> but<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.430> did

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
tape undone for this package but I did

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:51.410 
tape undone for this package but I did
not<00:01:21.979> did<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:25.280> did<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:27.030> open<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> yet<00:01:28.110> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.780 

so<00:01:52.420> there<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.840> is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
so there it is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.330 
so there it is
+60<00:01:55.200> stop<00:01:56.200> sign<00:01:56.440> giving<00:01:56.740> me<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.890> little<00:01:57.130> bit<00:01:57.250> of

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
+60 stop sign giving me a little bit of

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.630 
+60 stop sign giving me a little bit of
tension<00:01:57.970> there<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.590> cold<00:01:59.980> because<00:02:00.400> it's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
tension there it is cold because it's

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.570 
tension there it is cold because it's
really<00:02:01.450> cold<00:02:01.690> outside<00:02:01.900> so<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:03.250> may<00:02:03.460> have

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
really cold outside so that may have

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.720 
really cold outside so that may have
been<00:02:03.730> why<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.120> had<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:04.690> much<00:02:04.840> tension<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.730> hadn't

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
been why it had so much tension I hadn't

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.700 
been why it had so much tension I hadn't
I<00:02:06.820> decided<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.330> get<00:02:07.420> me<00:02:07.540> another<00:02:07.780> one<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.590> this

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
I decided to get me another one and this

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.230 
I decided to get me another one and this
is<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.040> one<00:02:09.220> with<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.520> hood<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:10.090> can

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
is the one with the hood that can

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.470 
is the one with the hood that can
actually<00:02:10.540> come<00:02:10.780> off<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.390> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
actually come off because there's a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.930 
actually come off because there's a
screw<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.960> keeps<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.320> hood<00:02:14.470> on<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.940> that's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
screw that keeps the hood on so that's

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.850 
screw that keeps the hood on so that's
another<00:02:16.270> reason<00:02:16.480> why<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.720> got<00:02:16.960> this<00:02:17.350> version<00:02:17.590> of

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
another reason why I got this version of

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.950 
another reason why I got this version of
it<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.310> way<00:02:18.460> if<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.730> want<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.600> make<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.840> look

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
it so that way if I want to make it look

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.330 
it so that way if I want to make it look
like<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.530> know<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.920> getting<00:02:21.130> work<00:02:21.310> done

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
like you know this is getting work done

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.960 
like you know this is getting work done
on<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.700> could<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:23.200> also<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.340> know<00:02:24.610> my<00:02:24.790> other
