is<00:00:07.350> it's<00:00:07.559> such<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.160> privilege<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.470> picket<00:00:10.470> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
is it's such a privilege to picket to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.190 
is it's such a privilege to picket to
come<00:00:10.769> back<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.640> come<00:00:11.820> back<00:00:12.030> around<00:00:12.180> and<00:00:12.570> and
