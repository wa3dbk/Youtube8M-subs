00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
and that's actually how they were

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.290

but they come from villages farmers

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.380 
but they come from villages farmers
things<00:03:25.020> like<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:26.030> they<00:03:27.030> don't<00:03:27.150> have<00:03:27.360> a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
things like that and they don't have a

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.440 
things like that and they don't have a
lot<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.630> money<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.980> wrestling<00:03:29.940> federation

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450

I believe that they get some kind of a

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.680 
I believe that they get some kind of a
pocket<00:03:34.830> money<00:03:34.980> monthly<00:03:35.490> but<00:03:36.150> for<00:03:36.330> winning
