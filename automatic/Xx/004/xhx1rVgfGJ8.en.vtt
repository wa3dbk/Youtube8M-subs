00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
football and throw it probably because

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
just a really hard game for me to pick

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.340 
just a really hard game for me to pick
it<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.400> depends<00:02:39.760> on<00:02:39.819> if<00:02:39.970> Rivers<00:02:40.300> who<00:02:40.870> doesn't

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350
