00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
huh there's no way this is just a

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.949 
huh there's no way this is just a
location<00:03:56.060> with<00:03:56.180> bandits<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.629> that<00:03:56.750> said

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
location with bandits and that said

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.509 
location with bandits and that said
there's<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.230> chest<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:57.709> behind<00:03:58.069> here<00:03:58.340> though

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
there's a chest in behind here though

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.350

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
let's take a dip down here just to make

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.550 
let's take a dip down here just to make
sure<00:04:04.459> we<00:04:04.730> got<00:04:04.879> everything<00:04:05.360> okay<00:04:06.140> this<00:04:06.379> is

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
sure we got everything okay this is

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.589 
sure we got everything okay this is
another<00:04:06.860> section<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.430> ship<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.420> there's

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
another section of the ship and there's

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.240 
another section of the ship and there's
probably<00:04:08.959> going<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.290> be<00:04:09.379> another<00:04:09.709> chest<00:04:10.069> in

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
probably going to be another chest in

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.740 
probably going to be another chest in
here<00:04:10.280> I<00:04:10.459> would<00:04:10.730> wager<00:04:11.049> let's<00:04:12.049> see<00:04:13.030> we<00:04:14.030> uh<00:04:14.060> yeah

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
here I would wager let's see we uh yeah

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.890 
here I would wager let's see we uh yeah
we<00:04:14.930> can't<00:04:15.170> take<00:04:15.379> a<00:04:15.410> breather<00:04:15.769> all<00:04:16.130> right

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
we can't take a breather all right

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.490 
we can't take a breather all right
anything<00:04:17.900> else<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:19.280> let's<00:04:19.790> go<00:04:20.060> back<00:04:20.090> here

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
anything else so let's go back here

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.810 
anything else so let's go back here
anything<00:04:21.500> there<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.430> bed<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.510> some<00:04:23.690> shoes

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
anything there is a bed and some shoes

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.219 
anything there is a bed and some shoes
what<00:04:25.820> about<00:04:26.030> down<00:04:26.270> here<00:04:26.300> there's<00:04:26.870> probably<00:04:27.139> a

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
what about down here there's probably a

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.500 
what about down here there's probably a
chest<00:04:28.240> yep<00:04:29.240> there<00:04:29.450> is<00:04:29.600> certainly<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.260> chest<00:04:30.710> and

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
chest yep there is certainly a chest and

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.390 
chest yep there is certainly a chest and
it<00:04:32.510> has<00:04:32.540> just<00:04:32.840> a<00:04:33.320> bunch<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.680> rubies<00:04:34.220> and

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
it has just a bunch of rubies and

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.150 
it has just a bunch of rubies and
various<00:04:34.820> things<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:36.080> think<00:04:36.139> that's<00:04:36.830> gonna

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
various things and I think that's gonna

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.740 
various things and I think that's gonna
be<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.430> why<00:04:37.820> don't<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.030> double<00:04:38.360> check<00:04:38.570> really

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
be it why don't I double check really

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.969 
be it why don't I double check really
quick<00:04:39.020> just<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.320> make<00:04:39.470> sure<00:04:39.590> we<00:04:39.740> didn't<00:04:39.919> miss

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
quick just to make sure we didn't miss

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.320 
quick just to make sure we didn't miss
anything<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.610> then<00:04:40.760> we<00:04:40.940> will<00:04:41.060> end<00:04:41.240> the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
anything and then we will end the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.320 
anything and then we will end the
episode<00:04:42.550> yes<00:04:43.550> ladies<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:43.880> gentlemen<00:04:44.210> that

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
episode yes ladies and gentlemen that

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.969 
episode yes ladies and gentlemen that
seems<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.780> be<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.020> so<00:04:45.200> I<00:04:45.229> guess<00:04:45.470> just<00:04:45.740> three

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
seems to be it so I guess just three

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.469 
seems to be it so I guess just three
chests<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.490> bunch<00:04:46.669> of<00:04:46.789> bandits<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.270> want

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
chests and a bunch of bandits that want

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.029 
chests and a bunch of bandits that want
to<00:04:47.570> kill<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.870> as<00:04:47.930> well<00:04:48.139> as<00:04:48.229> a<00:04:48.260> shipwreck<00:04:48.770> ship

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
to kill you as well as a shipwreck ship

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.240 
to kill you as well as a shipwreck ship
um<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.690> also<00:04:50.840> just<00:04:51.260> one<00:04:51.560> thing<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:51.919> note<00:04:52.100> is

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
um and also just one thing to note is

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.070 
um and also just one thing to note is
that<00:04:52.460> apparently<00:04:52.699> if<00:04:53.210> you<00:04:53.360> pickpocket<00:04:54.020> a

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
that apparently if you pickpocket a

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.689 
that apparently if you pickpocket a
courier<00:04:54.470> or<00:04:54.500> something<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.130> has<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.310> small

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
courier or something it has a small

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.460 
courier or something it has a small
chance<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.240> activate<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:56.960> location

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
chance to activate this location

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.260 
chance to activate this location
randomly<00:04:57.950> so<00:04:58.100> I<00:04:58.130> guess<00:04:58.340> that's<00:04:58.550> just<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:58.940> glitch

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
randomly so I guess that's just a glitch

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.659 
randomly so I guess that's just a glitch
