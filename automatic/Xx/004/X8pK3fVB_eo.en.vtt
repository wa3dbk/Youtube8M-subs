00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
Moshlings for outer space which they
look<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.060> they'd<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.659> our<00:01:51.780> space<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
look like they'd be from our space so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.260 
look like they'd be from our space so
that<00:01:52.470> makes<00:01:53.100> sense

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270 

that's<00:01:57.270> my<00:01:57.960> autofocus<00:01:58.649> turned<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.100> or

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that's my autofocus turned on or

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.560 
that's my autofocus turned on or
something<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.790> looks<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> keeps

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
something here looks like it keeps

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
something here looks like it keeps
blurring<00:02:01.170> itself<00:02:01.619> let's<00:02:02.159> see<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.969> fix

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
blurring itself let's see if I can fix

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
blurring itself let's see if I can fix
that<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.689> quickly<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:05.009> write<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.219> do

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that here quickly I just write and do

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.609 
that here quickly I just write and do
that<00:02:05.399> while<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> camera<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.090> rolling<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.899> I'm

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
that while the camera is rolling so I'm

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.050 
that while the camera is rolling so I'm
gonna<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.920> stop<00:02:08.250> camera<00:02:08.580> here<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
gonna do a stop camera here and see if I

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.170 
gonna do a stop camera here and see if I
can<00:02:09.179> adjust<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> camera<00:02:10.819> alright<00:02:11.819> sorry

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
can adjust the camera alright sorry

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
can adjust the camera alright sorry
about<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:12.720> I'll<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.870> able<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.020> turn

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
about that I think I'll be able to turn

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.699 
about that I think I'll be able to turn
now<00:02:13.349> they

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
now they

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.140 
now they
it's<00:02:13.890> kind<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.069> focusing<00:02:14.459> Han<00:02:14.609> out<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
it's kind of focusing Han out to the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.479 
it's kind of focusing Han out to the
autofocus<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.140> manual<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.799> well

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
autofocus and I have a manual so well

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.530 
autofocus and I have a manual so well
that<00:02:17.640> turns<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.969> little<00:02:18.030> bit<00:02:18.150> better

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that turns a little bit better

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.479 
that turns a little bit better
hopefully<00:02:19.019> my<00:02:19.230> other<00:02:19.379> videos<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.859> shot<00:02:20.219> the
