00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
NFC and I just wanted to show for the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.450 
NFC and I just wanted to show for the
first<00:00:11.309> time<00:00:11.460> actually<00:00:11.670> how<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.660> pairs<00:00:12.990> up<00:00:13.460> it's

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
first time actually how it pairs up it's

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.860 
first time actually how it pairs up it's
actually<00:00:14.790> quite<00:00:14.880> surprised<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.570> by<00:00:15.690> default

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
actually quite surprised that by default

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
actually quite surprised that by default
NFC<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.680> turned<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.609> Nokia<00:00:17.880> Lumia<00:00:17.910> 920

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
NFC is turned on on the Nokia Lumia 920

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.980 
NFC is turned on on the Nokia Lumia 920
so<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.439> off<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:20.160> press<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.960> on<00:00:21.960> button

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
so this is off just press the on button

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.640 
so this is off just press the on button
at<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.320> back<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.480> I<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.779> spotters<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
at the back and I see spotters at the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.440 
at the back and I see spotters at the
top<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:27.380> then<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.890> tap<00:00:32.120> that<00:00:33.120> says

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
top and then we can just tap that says

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.490 
top and then we can just tap that says
that<00:00:33.750> don't<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:36.170> is<00:00:37.170> even

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that don't if you can see that is even

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.790 
that don't if you can see that is even
on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> 808<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> pair<00:00:40.530> let's<00:00:41.399> click

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:58.120 

guessing<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:46.950> paired<00:00:47.280> up

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.770 

so<00:00:58.850> that's<00:00:59.290> in<00:01:00.290> blue<00:01:01.130> now<00:01:01.460> shrink<00:01:02.180> it<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.540> now

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
so that's in blue now shrink it is now

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.100

it's just pairing is just simply case of
or<00:02:10.850> not<00:02:11.060> pairing<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:11.660> connecting<00:02:12.110> simply

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
or not pairing so just connecting simply

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:24.760 
or not pairing so just connecting simply
case<00:02:12.710> of<00:02:13.210> tapping<00:02:16.810> it's<00:02:17.810> convenient<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:24.500> see

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
case of tapping it's convenient you see

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.880 
case of tapping it's convenient you see
a<00:02:24.800> little<00:02:25.270> similar<00:02:26.270> top<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.080> it's<00:02:27.260> dozen<00:02:27.740> be

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
a little similar top so it's dozen be

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:42.370 
a little similar top so it's dozen be
focusing<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.760> too<00:02:28.970> well<00:02:41.110> what<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.170> find

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
focusing on that too well what I find

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.470 
focusing on that too well what I find
quite<00:02:42.470> useful<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.010> when<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:43.400> playing<00:02:44.270> on<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
quite useful is when it's playing on the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.030 
quite useful is when it's playing on the
phone<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.900> then<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.110> tap<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.470> NFC<00:02:45.890> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
phone and then you tap on the NFC the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.520 
phone and then you tap on the NFC the
music<00:02:46.400> continues<00:02:46.960> but<00:02:47.960> when<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
music continues but when you do the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.080 
music continues but when you do the
reverse<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:49.100> actually<00:02:49.460> stops<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.940> phone

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
reverse it actually stops on the phone

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.310 
reverse it actually stops on the phone
so<00:02:50.210> it's<00:02:50.330> kind<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.540> like<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:51.050> know<00:02:51.080> when<00:02:51.260> you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320
