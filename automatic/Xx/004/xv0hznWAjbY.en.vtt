00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.280
 today we will learn how to make a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.650
 This crazy one is one of my idols. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.830
 and this recipe can not 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.830
 go wrong 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.130
 good recipe is important that you 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.130
 write down all the ingredients right 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.649
 you see the ingredients are very simple to 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.120
 people can do it both in hand 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.800
 while on the mixer to speed up the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 process went straight on tv 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.480
 The big secret is to put all the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.760
 ingredients errors first and stir them 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.800
 well you can mess with a spoon even the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.469
 wet ingredients and ended beating 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.120
 He's very fast, they only beat a lot not for 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.260
 the baking powder and place in the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.810
 is ready injuries and was last 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.360
 so that it grows pretty cool 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.680
 Back in the oven, never forget to join your 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.110
 shape with a little butter 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.850
 margarine and oil and put a little 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.740
 so your wheat flour will not cake 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.090
 the time you finish and already 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:31.520

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.520
