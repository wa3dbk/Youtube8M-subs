00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 this 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.780
 I 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.420
 the warm and inviting the wooden terrace is the place by 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.600
 excellence after war while staying at home she was put in a 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.679
 natural setting 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.199
 or simply to please the sun 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.060
 the shocking gold of the revolution martine michel berger however, it is necessary to know 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:25.890
 plus it's all 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.810
 aesthetically it could be not bad no 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.080
 we made a wooden terrace because we find that the wood there 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.190
 conveyed emotions 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.120
 the floor time and place 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.540
 you drive united it's important that everyone feels comfortable 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.830
 we as well as the people we have the pleasure of receiving here 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.100
 for us it was an important element for it to really become 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 in the extension of our stay to wish to have a beautiful terrace 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.229
 however most analysts were waiting outside 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.449
 also for something Thursday included inside the 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.700
 universities 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.520
 on track the wood wool advantage is that when it is very hot it stays 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.690
 still the land where you can walk barefoot is also 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.330
 in leclerc which is nice when you walk barefoot 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.810
 % so that's a little bit all these benefits the higher haye of these 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.480
 amenities 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.720
 find it pretty and a few steps a little timeless 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.600
 which makes it what he does but of people who do not hit hard anymore in 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.570
 ten years the wood always appears an event 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.570
 he felt the year time 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.510
 and here is the result to get there it only took a week of work 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.900
 simplicity and extraordinary fluidity thanks to the qliq system 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.940
 the players developed by the collective of architects the weight it allows to 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.369
 use no efficiency and its security and the future of the party 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 then by the merchant and there it is rather a surging sector 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.090
 created and asked because his wood for five years this morning have confirmed to us that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.160
 your idea of ​​making a terrace 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.220
 on that side of that side allow them to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.580
 to enjoy the sun right now 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.820
 no longer at best between kitchens in kit for the moment at a lunch 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.340
 the region did not mark the memories 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.330
 and for our own 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.790
 what is important is anyway to always select 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.630
 species of wood which will have mechanical characteristics of 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.630
 longevity of holding in time required training 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.099
 who is recognized 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.469
 I am today its solidity of background unified technical documents which 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.720
 regulates construction by strict standards 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.099
 whatever happens if the wood species recommended 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.390
 so there are some really very very important points 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.399
 like the ventilation that must absolutely be respected 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.879
 on the terrace to give that the wood breathe properly 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.129
 as also the prohibition of the laying of joists directly on the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.129
 ground so avoid reverts of meditating 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.839
 wells the launch coefficient which is a coefficient that sets the 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:50.749
 width 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.019
 the ratio between the width and the thickness of the blade architecture of the 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.049
 wood also allowed by its development 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.029
 to invent a new profile of the man who is the profile crowded with the blade 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.999
 that allows the permanent evacuation of rainwater the air of the 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.370
 considerable mans tiling effects listen to these women all our 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.950
 contact information 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.629
 and then we will fix an appointment 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.629
 order books fill up at full speed 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.759
 unemployment is not for tomorrow on demand is so strong 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.119
 likewise on the terraces years ago that was a lot of work of 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:24.449
 preparation to do it will make sure of the activity for our small office 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.449
 study 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.479
 what 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.459
 I
