granola<00:00:34.360> today<00:00:34.810> is<00:00:34.960> not<00:00:35.140> healthy<00:00:35.620> for<00:00:35.800> several

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
granola today is not healthy for several

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.720 
granola today is not healthy for several
reasons<00:00:36.850> one<00:00:37.090> granola<00:00:38.050> contains<00:00:38.770> grains<00:00:39.280> and

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
reasons one granola contains grains and

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.330 
reasons one granola contains grains and
typically<00:00:40.090> it's<00:00:40.270> processed<00:00:40.960> grains<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.710> many

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
typically it's processed grains and many

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.710 
typically it's processed grains and many
of<00:00:42.430> these<00:00:42.520> grains<00:00:42.880> they<00:00:43.120> actually<00:00:43.540> are

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
of these grains they actually are

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.350 
of these grains they actually are
inflammatory<00:00:44.620> they<00:00:45.100> cause<00:00:45.310> inflammation<00:00:45.940> in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
inflammatory they cause inflammation in

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.300 
inflammatory they cause inflammation in
your<00:00:46.450> joints<00:00:46.590> cause<00:00:47.590> you<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.800> age<00:00:48.010> faster

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
your joints cause you to age faster

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.980 
your joints cause you to age faster
cause<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:48.940> gain<00:00:49.180> weight<00:00:49.450> higher<00:00:49.810> in

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
cause you to gain weight higher in

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.470 
cause you to gain weight higher in
carbohydrates<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:51.040> so<00:00:51.640> we<00:00:51.910> typically<00:00:52.240> say

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
carbohydrates and so we typically say

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.510 
carbohydrates and so we typically say
stay<00:00:52.780> away<00:00:52.810> from<00:00:53.020> granola<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.920> grains<00:00:54.250> and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
stay away from granola the grains and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.470 
stay away from granola the grains and
granolas<00:00:55.060> also<00:00:55.840> most<00:00:56.170> granola<00:00:56.590> today<00:00:56.950> is

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
granolas also most granola today is

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.360 
granolas also most granola today is
packed<00:00:58.480> with<00:00:58.840> sugar<00:00:59.140> if<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.740> flip<00:01:00.070> over<00:01:00.250> a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
packed with sugar if you flip over a

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.100 
packed with sugar if you flip over a
granola<00:01:00.790> cereal<00:01:01.120> today<00:01:01.450> or<00:01:01.750> a<00:01:01.780> regular

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
granola cereal today or a regular

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.630 
granola cereal today or a regular
granola<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.620> typically<00:01:03.010> buy<00:01:03.130> at<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.370> store

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
granola you typically buy at the store

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.020 
granola you typically buy at the store
they<00:01:04.210> typically<00:01:04.720> add<00:01:04.869> sugar<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:06.040> again

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
they typically add sugar to it and again

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.490 
they typically add sugar to it and again
just<00:01:07.150> very<00:01:07.270> high<00:01:07.659> in<00:01:07.810> sugar<00:01:08.110> high<00:01:08.439> in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
just very high in sugar high in

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.870 
just very high in sugar high in
carbohydrates<00:01:09.310> high<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.610> grains

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
carbohydrates high and grains

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.450 
carbohydrates high and grains
inflammatory<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.290> really<00:01:11.619> it's<00:01:11.740> not<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.009> best

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
inflammatory so really it's not the best

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.280 
inflammatory so really it's not the best
thing<00:01:12.729> for<00:01:12.759> you<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:13.479> what<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:13.780> created<00:01:14.170> was

most of these ingredients so one cup

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.469 
most of these ingredients so one cup
they're<00:01:50.530> sunflower<00:01:51.100> seeds<00:01:51.520> next<00:01:52.270> thing<00:01:52.389> we're

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
they're sunflower seeds next thing we're

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.319 
they're sunflower seeds next thing we're
going<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.659> add<00:01:52.810> in<00:01:53.049> our<00:01:53.490> dried<00:01:54.490> apple<00:01:55.060> slices
