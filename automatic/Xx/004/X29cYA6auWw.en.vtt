another<00:00:14.790> review<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:15.960> gonna<00:00:16.080> be

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
another review and we're gonna be

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.840 
another review and we're gonna be
looking<00:00:16.289> at<00:00:16.529> my<00:00:16.680> second<00:00:17.220> space<00:00:17.490> machine

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
looking at my second space machine

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.570 
looking at my second space machine
figure<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.510> via<00:00:19.109> con<00:00:19.380> Raj<00:00:19.910> now<00:00:22.160> Mirage<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.430> is

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
figure in via con Raj now Mirage here is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.490 
figure in via con Raj now Mirage here is
a<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:24.330> guess<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.199> could<00:00:25.260> say<00:00:25.439> it's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
a I guess you could say it's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.779 
a I guess you could say it's
Cybertronian<00:00:27.109> for<00:00:28.109> Formula<00:00:28.920> One<00:00:29.099> race<00:00:29.340> car<00:00:29.369> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
Cybertronian for Formula One race car I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.540 
Cybertronian for Formula One race car I
guess<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:30.929> what<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.199> could<00:00:31.320> call<00:00:31.349> it

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
guess that's what you could call it

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
guess that's what you could call it
definitely<00:00:32.550> homage<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.600> back<00:00:33.840> into<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.890> know

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
definitely homage in back into you know

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.110 
definitely homage in back into you know
g1<00:00:35.370> Raj<00:00:35.610> that's<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:38.059> see<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
g1 Raj that's pretty much it I see the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.549 
g1 Raj that's pretty much it I see the
colors<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.629> mixture<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> translucent

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
colors get mixture of the translucent

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.319 
colors get mixture of the translucent

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
great night I really do like how the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.939 
great night I really do like how the
vehicle<00:00:54.960> mode<00:00:55.050> looks<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.969> rose<00:00:57.960> decent<00:00:58.559> but

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
vehicle mode looks it rose decent but

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.849 
vehicle mode looks it rose decent but
you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.030> hear<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.780> plastics<00:01:01.530> kind<00:01:01.770> of

dragging and yeah as you can see you
have<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.080> vehicon<00:01:07.220> spark<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:09.439> it's<00:01:10.439> all

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
have the vehicon spark there it's all

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.990 
have the vehicon spark there it's all
orange<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:13.159> overall<00:01:14.159> vehicle

orange about that and overall vehicle

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
orange about that and overall vehicle
mode<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:17.780> like<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.049> personally<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.560> like

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
mode is I like it I personally do like

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.990 
mode is I like it I personally do like

it I really do like it yes the
transistor<00:01:21.930> blue<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.320> yellow<00:01:22.409> kinda<00:01:24.380> clashes

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
transistor blue and yellow kinda clashes

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.950 
transistor blue and yellow kinda clashes
with<00:01:25.590> everything<00:01:26.189> else<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.720> well<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.840> my

opinion overall it's very nice very nice
indeed<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:32.070> transform<00:01:32.579> Mirage<00:01:32.820> hear<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
indeed to transform Mirage hear what you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.609 
indeed to transform Mirage hear what you
basically<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.840> arms<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> stretch<00:01:37.470> them

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
basically is the arms you stretch them

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.200 
basically is the arms you stretch them
out<00:01:39.409> take<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.950> legs<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> pull<00:01:42.090> them

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
out take the legs and kind of pull them

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.170 
out take the legs and kind of pull them
apart<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.860> gonna<00:01:43.860> straighten<00:01:44.159> them<00:01:44.280> out

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.830 

and<00:01:48.180> take<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.770> arms<00:01:50.450> spread<00:01:51.450> them<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.689> like

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and take the arms spread them out like

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.300 
and take the arms spread them out like
so

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.030 

can<00:01:55.310> take<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:56.150> part<00:01:56.480> which<00:01:56.660> is<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:57.050> head<00:01:57.230> and

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
can take this part which is the head and

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.020 
can take this part which is the head and
just<00:01:59.980> fold<00:02:00.980> it<00:02:01.160> up<00:02:01.730> to<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> top<00:02:03.730> turn<00:02:04.730> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
just fold it up to the top turn the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.510 
just fold it up to the top turn the
waist<00:02:05.240> around<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:09.100> close<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:12.160> position<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
waist around so close this position the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:25.410 
waist around so close this position the
arms<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:20.290> fix<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> feet<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:23.240> here<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.750> have

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
arms and fix the feet and here you have

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.470 
arms and fix the feet and here you have
fold<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.480> gun<00:02:26.750> over<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.770> have<00:02:28.480> Mirage

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
fold the gun over and you have Mirage

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.050 
fold the gun over and you have Mirage
Mirage<00:02:30.320> here<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:30.650> robot<00:02:30.920> mode<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.610> could<00:02:31.910> see

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
Mirage here in robot mode you could see

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.620 
Mirage here in robot mode you could see
more<00:02:32.690> yellow<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.700> translucent<00:02:34.700> blue<00:02:35.090> goodness

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
more yellow a translucent blue goodness

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.170 
more yellow a translucent blue goodness
row<00:02:38.630> he's<00:02:39.200> very<00:02:40.540> kind<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.660> blocky<00:02:42.620> looking

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
row he's very kind of blocky looking

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.710 
row he's very kind of blocky looking
very<00:02:44.200> short<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:46.010> makes<00:02:46.190> any<00:02:46.310> sense<00:02:46.720> he's

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
very short that makes any sense he's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.699 
very short that makes any sense he's
small<00:02:48.020> he's<00:02:48.320> pretty<00:02:49.100> much<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:50.350> seat<00:02:51.350> they<00:02:51.500> call

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
small he's pretty much a seat they call

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.770 
small he's pretty much a seat they call
them<00:02:51.890> basics<00:02:52.310> I'm<00:02:52.730> think<00:02:53.240> that's<00:02:53.480> what<00:02:53.690> they

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
them basics I'm think that's what they

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.780 
them basics I'm think that's what they
were<00:02:53.870> called<00:02:54.080> but<00:02:54.709> overall<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.490> do<00:02:55.610> like

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
were called but overall I do like

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.150 
were called but overall I do like
college<00:02:56.300> proportions<00:02:56.930> kind<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.470> funky<00:02:57.920> but

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
college proportions kind of funky but

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.729 
college proportions kind of funky but
you<00:02:58.400> know<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.550> personally<00:02:59.209> do<00:02:59.330> like<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.690> uh<00:02:59.810> I

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
you know I personally do like it uh I

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.430 
you know I personally do like it uh I
will<00:03:01.580> say<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.790> one<00:03:01.970> thing<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.540> he<00:03:03.110> really

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
will say the one thing is that he really

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.759 
will say the one thing is that he really
has<00:03:03.680> no<00:03:03.950> proper<00:03:04.820> neck<00:03:05.180> or<00:03:05.989> kind<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.530> base

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
has no proper neck or kind of base

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.680 
has no proper neck or kind of base
between<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.519> body<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.150> hand<00:03:08.390> if<00:03:08.510> you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
between the body and the hand if you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.960 
between the body and the hand if you
look<00:03:08.900> from<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.230> side<00:03:09.489> kind<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.550> all<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.880> way

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
look from the side kind of all the way

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.720 
look from the side kind of all the way
back<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.160> but<00:03:13.160> that's<00:03:13.400> really<00:03:13.610> my<00:03:13.700> only

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
back like so but that's really my only

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.630 
back like so but that's really my only
real<00:03:14.480> problem<00:03:14.750> with<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.260> figure

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
real problem with the figure

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.000 
real problem with the figure
articulation<00:03:16.640> wise<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.300> head<00:03:17.890> can<00:03:18.890> rotate

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
articulation wise the head can rotate

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.060 
articulation wise the head can rotate
way<00:03:19.850> around<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:20.360> know<00:03:20.780> can<00:03:21.620> move<00:03:21.800> up<00:03:21.980> and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
way around and you know can move up and

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.920 
way around and you know can move up and
down<00:03:22.160> like<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:23.180> gun<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.480> course<00:03:23.510> can

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
down like so and the gun of course can

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.509 
down like so and the gun of course can
move<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:26.090> arms<00:03:26.480> can<00:03:26.930> turn<00:03:27.500> all<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.489> way

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
move the arms can turn all the way

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.710 
move the arms can turn all the way
around<00:03:28.690> moving<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.810> out<00:03:29.930> bend<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.070> whatnot

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
around moving it out bend and whatnot

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.640 
around moving it out bend and whatnot
same<00:03:32.720> with<00:03:33.110> legs<00:03:33.470> can<00:03:33.830> go<00:03:34.450> about<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.750> much<00:03:35.989> to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
same with legs can go about that much to

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.030 
same with legs can go about that much to
do<00:03:36.709> this<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.910> swivel<00:03:38.780> now<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.590> can<00:03:39.860> also

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
do this and swivel now and you can also

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.360 
do this and swivel now and you can also
know<00:03:40.519> move<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.930> around<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:43.570> cuz<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:45.049> know

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
know move this around and cuz you know

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.410 
know move this around and cuz you know
use<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:46.580> as<00:03:46.790> well<00:03:48.430> well<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.820> waist<00:03:50.060> does

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
use this as well well and the waist does

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.690 
use this as well well and the waist does
rotate<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:52.790> terms<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.060> weapons<00:03:53.390> he<00:03:53.720> does<00:03:53.959> have

rotate in terms of weapons he does have

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.070 
rotate in terms of weapons he does have
the<00:03:55.700> molded<00:03:56.239> missiles<00:03:57.170> or<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.739> translucent

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
like both modes I do think he's a much

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.300 
like both modes I do think he's a much
better<00:04:30.470> figure<00:04:30.950> than<00:04:31.900> skydive<00:04:32.900> but<00:04:33.260> you<00:04:34.190> know

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310

better figure than skydive but you know
that's<00:04:34.490> just<00:04:34.700> my<00:04:34.910> opinion<00:04:34.940> my<00:04:35.840> overall

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
that's just my opinion my overall

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.330 
that's just my opinion my overall
