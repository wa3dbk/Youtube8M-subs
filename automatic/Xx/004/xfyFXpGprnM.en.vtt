NFC capability so you don't want to get

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.789 
NFC capability so you don't want to get
a<00:01:02.550> battery<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.090> does<00:01:03.420> not<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.870> NFC<00:01:04.530> and

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
don't have very many options but if you

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.900 
don't have very many options but if you

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
before you stop pulling it out I would

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.620 
before you stop pulling it out I would
highly<00:03:03.150> suggest<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.959> do<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.299> because<00:03:06.299> you

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
highly suggest you do so because you

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.690 
highly suggest you do so because you
could<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.709> could<00:03:07.860> damage<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.400> I'm<00:03:08.489> not<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
could you could damage it and I'm not a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.729 
could you could damage it and I'm not a
real<00:03:09.030> big<00:03:09.269> warning<00:03:09.840> person<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:13.410> actually

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
real big warning person so you actually

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.910 
real big warning person so you actually
go<00:03:13.920> ahead<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.489> can<00:03:14.700> pop<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.920> the

go ahead and you can pop that in and the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.530 
go ahead and you can pop that in and the
curious<00:03:17.250> thing<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.489> found<00:03:17.670> about<00:03:17.849> this<00:03:18.150> again

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
curious thing I found about this again

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.660 
curious thing I found about this again
not<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> big<00:03:18.959> deal<00:03:19.139> it<00:03:19.440> fits<00:03:19.980> through<00:03:20.190> here<00:03:20.519> it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
not a big deal it fits through here it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.229 
not a big deal it fits through here it
hangs<00:03:21.209> off<00:03:21.510> over<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.079> side<00:03:22.380> here<00:03:23.030> but<00:03:24.030> that's

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
hangs off over the side here but that's

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.210 
hangs off over the side here but that's
by<00:03:24.480> design<00:03:24.720> obviously<00:03:25.230> because<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.920> fits

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
by design obviously because it fits
