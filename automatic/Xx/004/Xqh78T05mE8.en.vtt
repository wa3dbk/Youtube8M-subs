00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.890 

all<00:00:48.550> right<00:00:48.850> we<00:00:48.970> got<00:00:49.090> another<00:00:49.270> match<00:00:49.510> out<00:00:49.720> here

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
all right we got another match out here

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.590 
all right we got another match out here
with<00:00:50.050> goby<00:00:50.560> and<00:00:50.740> he's<00:00:51.490> got<00:00:51.640> an<00:00:51.700> arrow<00:00:51.940> lead<00:00:52.300> so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
with goby and he's got an arrow lead so

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.180 
with goby and he's got an arrow lead so
I'm<00:00:52.750> thinking<00:00:53.110> you<00:00:53.200> might<00:00:53.320> want<00:00:53.560> to<00:00:53.590> taunt<00:00:53.920> and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
I'm thinking you might want to taunt and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.120 
I'm thinking you might want to taunt and
block<00:00:54.430> some<00:00:54.640> stealth<00:00:54.910> rock<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.800> I've<00:00:56.800> got

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
block some stealth rock and I've got

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.130 
block some stealth rock and I've got
this<00:00:57.310> guy<00:00:57.490> intended<00:00:58.240> to<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.600> hit<00:00:58.780> Kay<00:00:58.930> with

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
this guy intended to to hit Kay with

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.620 
this guy intended to to hit Kay with
Aquajet<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.890> so<00:01:00.700> hopefully<00:01:00.940> he<00:01:01.210> does<00:01:01.360> want<00:01:01.540> to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
Aquajet and so hopefully he does want to

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.210 
Aquajet and so hopefully he does want to
sit<00:01:01.780> on<00:01:02.020> he'll<00:01:02.320> probably<00:01:02.470> set<00:01:02.770> up<00:01:02.800> rocks<00:01:03.040> of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
sit on he'll probably set up rocks of

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.070 
sit on he'll probably set up rocks of
his<00:01:03.340> own<00:01:03.520> I<00:01:03.820> don't<00:01:04.240> care<00:01:04.390> if<00:01:04.449> he<00:01:04.510> earthquakes<00:01:05.050> I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
his own I don't care if he earthquakes I

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.320 
his own I don't care if he earthquakes I
should<00:01:05.410> to<00:01:05.620> hit<00:01:05.830> calum<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.880> am<00:01:07.030> nowhere

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
should to hit calum and I am nowhere

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.140 
should to hit calum and I am nowhere
near<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:08.230> um<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:08.980> he's<00:01:09.160> got<00:01:09.280> some<00:01:09.310> big<00:01:09.640> defense

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
near it um so he's got some big defense

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.300 
near it um so he's got some big defense
in<00:01:10.360> there<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:11.410> know<00:01:11.560> he's<00:01:11.740> not<00:01:11.860> gonna<00:01:11.980> taunt

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
in there and I know he's not gonna taunt

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.830 
in there and I know he's not gonna taunt
now<00:01:12.520> so<00:01:12.730> I'll<00:01:12.850> get<00:01:12.970> up<00:01:13.000> my<00:01:13.180> rocks<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.630> know<00:01:13.690> I'll

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
now so I'll get up my rocks I know I'll

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.350 
now so I'll get up my rocks I know I'll
live<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.380> if<00:01:15.190> I<00:01:15.340> knew<00:01:15.460> how<00:01:15.610> torrent<00:01:16.060> worked<00:01:16.240> I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
live and if I knew how torrent worked I

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.330 
live and if I knew how torrent worked I
thought<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.570> was<00:01:16.690> 25%<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.650> later<00:01:17.950> found<00:01:18.040> out

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
thought it was 25% I later found out

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.660 
thought it was 25% I later found out
it's<00:01:18.460> 33%<00:01:19.390> if<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.350> knew<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.560> would<00:01:21.040> have<00:01:21.070> gone<00:01:21.310> for

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
it's 33% if I knew I would have gone for

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's 33% if I knew I would have gone for
it<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.940> after<00:01:22.690> doing<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:23.020> calque<00:01:23.290> chant

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it and after doing a calque chant

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.060 
it and after doing a calque chant
hihihihi<00:01:25.780> chances<00:01:26.380> are<00:01:26.530> would<00:01:26.770> have<00:01:26.860> killed

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
hihihihi chances are would have killed

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.950 
hihihihi chances are would have killed
it<00:01:27.190> after<00:01:27.460> touring<00:01:27.760> with<00:01:27.880> Aquajet<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:28.930> I

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
it after touring with Aquajet but I

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.920 
it after touring with Aquajet but I
didn't<00:01:29.260> know<00:01:29.350> any<00:01:29.530> better<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:29.800> I<00:01:30.690> figure<00:01:31.690> going

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
didn't know any better so I figure going

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.510 
didn't know any better so I figure going
to<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.140> crest<00:01:32.410> is<00:01:32.590> probably<00:01:33.130> gonna<00:01:33.310> be<00:01:33.400> the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
to the crest is probably gonna be the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.450 
to the crest is probably gonna be the
safer<00:01:34.030> move<00:01:34.210> anyway<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:35.260> I<00:01:35.530> get<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:35.950> burn<00:01:36.190> on<00:01:36.220> him

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
safer move anyway so I get a burn on him

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.460 
safer move anyway so I get a burn on him
and<00:01:36.580> I<00:01:36.610> see<00:01:36.850> crunch<00:01:37.270> which<00:01:37.869> at<00:01:38.020> first<00:01:38.260> I'm<00:01:38.410> like

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
and I see crunch which at first I'm like

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.260 
and I see crunch which at first I'm like
man<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.740> sucks<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.430> then<00:01:39.550> I<00:01:39.640> realized<00:01:39.970> cress

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
man that sucks and then I realized cress

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.749 
man that sucks and then I realized cress
is<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.479> beast<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:42.130> he's<00:01:42.310> probably<00:01:42.490> got

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
is a beast and because he's probably got

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.490 
is a beast and because he's probably got
a<00:01:42.790> lot<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.000> defense<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.930> speed<00:01:44.140> he<00:01:44.259> probably

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
a lot of defense and speed he probably

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.719 
a lot of defense and speed he probably
doesn't<00:01:44.770> have<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:44.890> lot<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.040> attack<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:45.610> it

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
doesn't have a lot of attack so it

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.790 
doesn't have a lot of attack so it
didn't<00:01:46.030> really<00:01:46.150> hurt<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.630> because<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.590> see

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
didn't really hurt and because I see

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.130 
didn't really hurt and because I see
crunch<00:01:48.160> I'm<00:01:48.400> thinking<00:01:48.759> okay<00:01:49.060> stealth<00:01:49.869> rock

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
crunch I'm thinking okay stealth rock

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.029 
crunch I'm thinking okay stealth rock
crunch<00:01:51.479> well<00:01:52.479> he<00:01:52.720> just<00:01:52.899> used<00:01:53.080> earthquake<00:01:53.530> he's

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
crunch well he just used earthquake he's

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.590 
crunch well he just used earthquake he's
probably<00:01:54.310> got<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.580> rock<00:01:54.850> move<00:01:55.210> which<00:01:55.390> would<00:01:55.509> be

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
probably got a rock move which would be

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.510 
probably got a rock move which would be
stone<00:01:55.929> edge<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.410> don't<00:01:56.679> think<00:01:56.920> he's<00:01:57.100> got<00:01:57.280> ice

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
stone edge so I don't think he's got ice

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.300 
stone edge so I don't think he's got ice
bang<00:01:57.850> because<00:01:58.720> he<00:01:58.929> does<00:01:59.170> not<00:01:59.200> have<00:01:59.440> ice<00:01:59.979> bang

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
bang because he does not have ice bang

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.790 
bang because he does not have ice bang
unless<00:02:00.820> he<00:02:00.940> just<00:02:01.119> has<00:02:01.240> no<00:02:01.420> stab<00:02:01.810> which<00:02:02.619> is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
unless he just has no stab which is

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.419 
unless he just has no stab which is
possible<00:02:03.369> but<00:02:03.610> very<00:02:04.119> very<00:02:04.360> rare<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:05.649> figured

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
possible but very very rare I figured

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.400 
possible but very very rare I figured
tangrowth<00:02:07.030> against<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.569> burned<00:02:07.840> arrow<00:02:08.140> with

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
tangrowth against a burned arrow with

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.900 
tangrowth against a burned arrow with
very<00:02:08.649> little<00:02:08.860> attack<00:02:09.250> investment<00:02:09.850> is

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
very little attack investment is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.880 
very little attack investment is
probably<00:02:10.330> going<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.539> be<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.720> very<00:02:11.110> safe<00:02:11.500> switch

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
probably going to be a very safe switch

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.020 
probably going to be a very safe switch
so<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:14.050> gonna<00:02:14.230> sub<00:02:14.500> some<00:02:14.680> sunny<00:02:14.950> day<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.400> see

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
so I'm gonna sub some sunny day and see

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.910 
so I'm gonna sub some sunny day and see
what<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.390> do<00:02:16.540> from<00:02:16.660> there<00:02:16.920> unfortunately

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
what I can do from there unfortunately

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.490 
what I can do from there unfortunately
gets<00:02:18.100> one<00:02:18.310> flinch<00:02:18.640> which<00:02:19.000> due<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.020> life<00:02:20.260> or

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
gets one flinch which due to life or

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.800 
gets one flinch which due to life or
been<00:02:20.740> residual<00:02:21.160> damage<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.850> I'm<00:02:22.240> afraid<00:02:22.690> of

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
been residual damage and I'm afraid of

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.020 
been residual damage and I'm afraid of
priority<00:02:23.319> attacks<00:02:23.650> starting<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.250> add<00:02:24.400> up<00:02:24.430> but

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
priority attacks starting to add up but

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.390 
priority attacks starting to add up but
uh<00:02:25.060> not<00:02:25.750> too<00:02:26.230> afraid<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.680> think<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.069> should<00:02:27.280> be

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
uh not too afraid I think I should be

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.360 
uh not too afraid I think I should be
okay<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:29.530> gonna<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.830> able<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.069> finish<00:02:30.220> it

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
okay and I'm gonna be able to finish it

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.670 
okay and I'm gonna be able to finish it
off<00:02:30.459> with<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.700> hidden<00:02:31.060> power<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.440> use<00:02:32.650> that

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
off with a hidden power and I use that

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.750 
off with a hidden power and I use that
because<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.069> knew<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.310> wouldn't<00:02:33.490> work<00:02:33.610> very

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
because I knew it wouldn't work very

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.030 
because I knew it wouldn't work very
well<00:02:34.240> but<00:02:34.540> if<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.020> rare<00:02:35.260> case<00:02:35.500> he<00:02:35.650> wanted

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
well but if in the rare case he wanted

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.100 
well but if in the rare case he wanted
to<00:02:36.130> switch<00:02:36.400> he<00:02:36.700> would<00:02:36.970> have<00:02:37.090> been<00:02:37.270> able<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.569> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
to switch he would have been able to it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.570 
to switch he would have been able to it
was<00:02:38.290> gonna<00:02:38.410> kill<00:02:38.680> anyway<00:02:38.980> doesn't<00:02:39.310> reveal<00:02:39.520> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
which I double-check real quick what

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.380 
which I double-check real quick what
electrodes<00:02:44.680> max<00:02:44.890> speed<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:46.060> double

electrodes max speed is and I double

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.380 
electrodes max speed is and I double
check<00:02:46.600> what<00:02:46.690> my<00:02:46.870> speed<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.709> by<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.700> bang<00:02:48.940> I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
check what my speed is and by the bang I

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.050 
check what my speed is and by the bang I
am<00:02:49.690> faster<00:02:50.530> than<00:02:50.680> electrode<00:02:51.280> get<00:02:51.730> some<00:02:51.970> of

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
am faster than electrode get some of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.140 
am faster than electrode get some of
that<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.390> stupid<00:02:52.870> ball<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.550> just<00:02:54.850> hit<00:02:55.000> with

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
that you stupid ball so I just hit with

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.780 
that you stupid ball so I just hit with
an<00:02:55.300> earthquake<00:02:55.689> I<00:02:56.200> figured<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.189> solar<00:02:57.519> beam

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
an earthquake I figured a solar beam

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.399 
an earthquake I figured a solar beam
wouldn't<00:02:58.150> be<00:02:58.239> very<00:02:58.390> effective<00:02:58.780> for<00:02:59.290> some

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
wouldn't be very effective for some

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.400 
wouldn't be very effective for some
reason<00:02:59.739> but<00:03:00.069> it's

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
reason but it's

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.750 
reason but it's
other<00:03:00.530> way<00:03:00.710> around<00:03:01.010> electric<00:03:01.520> isn't

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
other way around electric isn't

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.390 
other way around electric isn't
effective<00:03:02.090> against<00:03:02.300> me<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.140> no<00:03:03.590> Xplode<00:03:04.100> for

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
effective against me so no Xplode for

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.280 
effective against me so no Xplode for
you<00:03:04.580> I<00:03:05.060> hit<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.660> in<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> face<00:03:05.990> with<00:03:06.140> an

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
you I hit you in the face with an

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.680 
you I hit you in the face with an
earthquake<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:07.090> incomes<00:03:08.090> arrived<00:03:08.390> shoot

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
earthquake and incomes arrived shoot

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.780 
earthquake and incomes arrived shoot
which<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:09.020> very<00:03:09.320> very<00:03:09.530> peculiar<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.460> only

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
which is very very peculiar and the only

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.220 
which is very very peculiar and the only
thing<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.120> could<00:03:11.270> mean<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.570> that<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:11.810> scarf

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
thing that could mean is that it's scarf

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.510 
thing that could mean is that it's scarf
and<00:03:13.540> if<00:03:14.540> it's<00:03:14.750> scarfed<00:03:15.200> it's<00:03:15.500> probably<00:03:16.370> gonna

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
and if it's scarfed it's probably gonna

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.700 
and if it's scarfed it's probably gonna
be<00:03:16.640> faster<00:03:17.210> than<00:03:17.330> me<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:17.720> don't<00:03:18.020> know<00:03:18.410> for<00:03:18.680> sure

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
be faster than me I don't know for sure

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.340 
be faster than me I don't know for sure
and<00:03:19.430> I'm<00:03:20.420> thinking<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:20.930> want<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.200> go<00:03:21.290> too

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
and I'm thinking do I want to go too

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.680 
and I'm thinking do I want to go too
crass<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.950> would<00:03:22.040> be<00:03:22.160> really<00:03:22.340> smart<00:03:22.760> going<00:03:23.600> to

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
crass it would be really smart going to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.540 
crass it would be really smart going to
heat<00:03:23.870> transfer<00:03:24.080> torment<00:03:24.770> on<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.950> choice<00:03:25.250> Pope

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
heat transfer torment on a choice Pope

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.670 
heat transfer torment on a choice Pope
would<00:03:25.730> be<00:03:25.820> really<00:03:26.120> smart<00:03:26.360> as<00:03:26.540> well<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.080> just

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
would be really smart as well I just

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.010 
would be really smart as well I just
don't<00:03:27.860> know<00:03:28.160> then<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:28.850> figure<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.660> scarf

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
don't know then I figure if it is scarf

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.620 
don't know then I figure if it is scarf
it<00:03:30.200> still<00:03:30.590> has<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:31.010> be<00:03:31.130> faster<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.000> I've<00:03:32.420> got

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
it still has to be faster and I've got

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.210 
it still has to be faster and I've got
my<00:03:32.780> guy<00:03:32.930> at<00:03:33.080> a<00:03:33.140> very<00:03:33.410> high<00:03:33.620> point<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.100> just

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
my guy at a very high point so I just

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.650 
my guy at a very high point so I just
leave<00:03:34.370> them<00:03:34.520> in<00:03:34.580> for<00:03:34.610> fodder<00:03:34.970> pretty<00:03:35.300> much<00:03:35.480> and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
leave them in for fodder pretty much and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.810 
leave them in for fodder pretty much and
just<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.870> make<00:03:36.020> sure<00:03:36.080> force<00:03:36.950> him<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.220> be<00:03:37.340> scarf

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
just to make sure force him to be scarf

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.420 
just to make sure force him to be scarf
and<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.290> caught<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.440> either<00:03:39.680> called<00:03:39.950> him<00:03:40.100> out<00:03:40.220> or

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
and I caught a either called him out or

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.650 
and I caught a either called him out or
he<00:03:40.460> didn't<00:03:40.730> put<00:03:40.880> in<00:03:40.970> enough<00:03:41.180> speed<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.510> I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
he didn't put in enough speed and I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.660 
he didn't put in enough speed and I
finished<00:03:41.960> that<00:03:42.110> off<00:03:42.290> also<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:43.310> then<00:03:43.400> in<00:03:43.490> comes

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
finished that off also and then in comes

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.280 
finished that off also and then in comes
a<00:03:43.790> Blastoise<00:03:44.420> which<00:03:44.540> makes<00:03:44.720> me<00:03:44.840> think<00:03:44.870> wait<00:03:45.260> a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
a Blastoise which makes me think wait a

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.870 
a Blastoise which makes me think wait a
minute<00:03:45.410> even<00:03:45.800> if<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:45.950> have<00:03:46.070> Aquajet<00:03:46.640> what<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
minute even if you have Aquajet what the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.540 
minute even if you have Aquajet what the
hell<00:03:47.120> are<00:03:47.270> you<00:03:47.420> gonna<00:03:47.600> do<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.280> take<00:03:49.520> a

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
hell are you gonna do so you take a

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
would be a big big big issue with me

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.140 
would be a big big big issue with me
right<00:04:11.930> now<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.680> bring<00:04:13.310> in<00:04:13.490> crest<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:13.940> I<00:04:14.000> can

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
right now so I bring in crest so I can

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.880 
right now so I bring in crest so I can
put<00:04:14.330> something<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.810> sleep<00:04:15.050> with<00:04:15.260> psycho<00:04:15.590> shift

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
put something to sleep with psycho shift

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.640 
put something to sleep with psycho shift
and<00:04:16.570> unfortunately<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.720> misses<00:04:18.109> first<00:04:18.380> and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
and unfortunately it misses first and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.470 
and unfortunately it misses first and
goes<00:04:18.799> for<00:04:19.040> rest<00:04:19.250> but<00:04:19.580> no<00:04:19.940> big<00:04:20.090> deal

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
goes for rest but no big deal

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.000 
goes for rest but no big deal
so<00:04:20.810> I'm<00:04:20.870> gonna<00:04:20.989> try<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.290> again<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.739> he<00:04:21.799> gets<00:04:21.950> a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
so I'm gonna try it again and he gets a

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
Swords Dance at first I was thinking

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.350 
Swords Dance at first I was thinking
that<00:04:25.220> would<00:04:25.370> be<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.760> miss<00:04:26.000> would<00:04:26.180> have<00:04:26.270> been

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
that would be that miss would have been

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.750 
that would be that miss would have been
horrible<00:04:27.050> if<00:04:27.290> he<00:04:27.410> put<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> brain<00:04:27.950> but<00:04:28.310> he<00:04:28.400> didn't

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
horrible if he put a brain but he didn't

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.210 
horrible if he put a brain but he didn't
he<00:04:28.850> danced<00:04:29.300> instead<00:04:29.720> which<00:04:29.930> is<00:04:30.110> again<00:04:31.070> very

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
he danced instead which is again very

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.550

I'm gonna go out to gang gar I'm gonna
get<00:04:38.419> up<00:04:38.510> a<00:04:38.600> sub<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.169> seeing<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:39.950> he's<00:04:40.070> faster

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
get up a sub and seeing that he's faster

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.740 
get up a sub and seeing that he's faster
he's<00:04:40.640> obviously<00:04:40.850> using<00:04:41.300> some<00:04:41.510> sort<00:04:41.690> of

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
he's obviously using some sort of

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.710 
he's obviously using some sort of
priority<00:04:41.990> which<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.500> not<00:04:42.830> good<00:04:43.160> for<00:04:43.430> me<00:04:43.720> not

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
priority which is not good for me not

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.270 
priority which is not good for me not
good<00:04:44.960> at<00:04:45.050> all<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.500> I'm<00:04:45.620> thinking<00:04:45.950> -<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.070> want<00:04:46.220> a

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
good at all so I'm thinking - I want a

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.830 
good at all so I'm thinking - I want a
focus<00:04:46.460> punch<00:04:46.820> or<00:04:46.970> do<00:04:47.030> I<00:04:47.090> want<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.330> shadow<00:04:47.570> ball

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
focus punch or do I want a shadow ball

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.450 
focus punch or do I want a shadow ball
focus<00:04:48.590> punch<00:04:48.800> would<00:04:48.890> be<00:04:48.980> super<00:04:49.250> effective

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
focus punch would be super effective

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.880 
focus punch would be super effective
he's<00:04:50.300> got<00:04:50.450> high<00:04:50.660> defense<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.290> low<00:04:51.410> special

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
he's got high defense and low special

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.110 
he's got high defense and low special
defense<00:04:52.190> though<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.550> I'm<00:04:52.669> just<00:04:52.790> gonna<00:04:52.880> go

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
defense though so I'm just gonna go

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.750 
defense though so I'm just gonna go
Shadow<00:04:53.360> Ball<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:54.680> should<00:04:54.890> be<00:04:54.980> pretty<00:04:55.190> reliable

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
Shadow Ball it should be pretty reliable

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.210 
Shadow Ball it should be pretty reliable
I<00:04:55.940> thought<00:04:56.780> about<00:04:56.900> maybe<00:04:57.140> just<00:04:57.380> subbing<00:04:57.800> up<00:04:57.950> a

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
I thought about maybe just subbing up a

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.610 
I thought about maybe just subbing up a
whole<00:04:58.700> bunch<00:04:58.910> since<00:04:59.480> he<00:04:59.570> is<00:04:59.720> using<00:04:59.960> priority

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
whole bunch since he is using priority

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.620 
whole bunch since he is using priority
and<00:05:00.800> I'd<00:05:01.669> be<00:05:01.850> able<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.060> get<00:05:02.210> down<00:05:02.419> to<00:05:02.600> really

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
and I'd be able to get down to really

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.730 
and I'd be able to get down to really
low<00:05:02.930> hitpoints<00:05:03.340> pain<00:05:04.340> split<00:05:05.350> go<00:05:06.350> from<00:05:06.560> there

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
low hitpoints pain split go from there

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.700 
low hitpoints pain split go from there
but<00:05:06.980> I<00:05:07.070> figured<00:05:07.310> now<00:05:07.430> just<00:05:07.669> get<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:07.910> head<00:05:08.090> off

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
but I figured now just get the head off

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.140 
but I figured now just get the head off
because<00:05:08.979> I<00:05:09.070> still<00:05:09.250> have<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.669> still<00:05:09.699> need<00:05:09.970> a<00:05:10.030> way

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
because I still have I still need a way

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.610 
because I still have I still need a way
to<00:05:10.180> kill<00:05:10.449> him<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:10.810> don't<00:05:11.199> think<00:05:11.380> I<00:05:11.470> would

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
to kill him I don't think I would

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.320 
to kill him I don't think I would
survive<00:05:11.740> any<00:05:12.190> sort<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.520> priority<00:05:13.030> attack

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
survive any sort of priority attack

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.770 
survive any sort of priority attack
after<00:05:13.630> I<00:05:13.930> paint<00:05:14.290> splited<00:05:14.680> so<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:16.180> then<00:05:16.600> I'm

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
after I paint splited so and then I'm

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.570 
after I paint splited so and then I'm

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
a couple of shadow walls so that ends

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.189 
a couple of shadow walls so that ends
the<00:05:21.370> match<00:05:21.550> no<00:05:21.910> rain<00:05:22.150> being<00:05:22.389> up<00:05:22.539> helped<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.900> big

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
the match no rain being up helped a big

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.469
