00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
300 average so I'm doing very very well

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.550 
300 average so I'm doing very very well
considering<00:03:25.950> it's<00:03:26.160> only<00:03:26.340> my<00:03:26.459> second<00:03:27.000> Fosse

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560

baseball<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:30.030> I'm<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.269> doing<00:03:30.600> so

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
baseball but I'm not doing so

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.120

unrealistic<00:03:32.639> that<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.989> becomes<00:03:34.590> on

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
unrealistic that it becomes on

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.540 
unrealistic that it becomes on
so<00:03:35.820> I<00:03:36.120> think<00:03:37.020> I'm<00:03:37.230> right<00:03:37.560> now<00:03:37.740> in<00:03:37.920> my<00:03:38.010> sweet

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
so I think I'm right now in my sweet

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.240 
so I think I'm right now in my sweet
spot<00:03:38.730> as<00:03:39.060> far<00:03:39.270> as<00:03:39.420> difficulty<00:03:40.170> over<00:03:40.590> numbers<00:03:40.980> I

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
spot as far as difficulty over numbers I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.690 
spot as far as difficulty over numbers I
don't<00:03:42.180> want<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.620> obviously<00:03:43.620> hit<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.400> million

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
don't want to obviously hit a million

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.420 
don't want to obviously hit a million
home<00:03:44.970> runs<00:03:45.240> if<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.200> can<00:03:46.380> hit<00:03:46.470> around<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.920> 35

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
home runs if I can hit around the 35

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.240 
home runs if I can hit around the 35
mark<00:03:47.970> 240<00:03:48.660> mark<00:03:48.870> for<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.440> season<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:50.010> think

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
mark 240 mark for the season I think

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.600 
mark 240 mark for the season I think
that's<00:03:50.460> a<00:03:50.870> realistic<00:03:51.870> number<00:03:52.610> especially

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
that's a realistic number especially

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.310 
that's a realistic number especially
considering<00:03:54.090> baseball<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.810> late<00:03:54.930> edition

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
considering baseball the late edition

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.450

specific guys out you have all these
different<00:05:22.920> situation<00:05:23.850> or<00:05:23.940> lefties<00:05:24.330> and

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
different situation or lefties and

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.340 
different situation or lefties and
situational<00:05:25.380> righties<00:05:27.020> it's<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.140> lot

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
situational righties it's a lot

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.440 
situational righties it's a lot
different<00:05:28.620> in<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.130> slot<00:05:29.430> harder<00:05:29.970> especially

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
different in the slot harder especially

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.750 
different in the slot harder especially
late<00:05:30.960> innings<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.560> hit<00:05:31.740> those<00:05:31.890> big<00:05:32.190> monster

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
late innings to hit those big monster

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.310 
late innings to hit those big monster
bombs<00:05:33.470> so<00:05:34.470> I<00:05:34.860> think<00:05:35.550> if<00:05:35.850> you<00:05:35.970> hit<00:05:36.240> around<00:05:36.570> 35<00:05:37.140> to

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
bombs so I think if you hit around 35 to

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.380 
bombs so I think if you hit around 35 to
40<00:05:37.650> home<00:05:37.800> runs<00:05:37.830> you<00:05:38.250> have<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.430> fantastic<00:05:38.910> season

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
40 home runs you have a fantastic season

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.770 
40 home runs you have a fantastic season
so<00:05:40.170> if<00:05:40.920> i<00:05:41.130> can<00:05:41.310> get<00:05:41.460> p<00:05:41.880> rich<00:05:42.120> in<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.390> second

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
so if i can get p rich in the second

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.490 
so if i can get p rich in the second
year<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:43.110> hit<00:05:43.229> around<00:05:43.530> 32<00:05:44.040> 30

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
year to hit around 32 30

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.070 
year to hit around 32 30
five<00:05:44.620> beats<00:05:45.460> a<00:05:45.700> fantastic<00:05:46.480> year<00:05:46.510> but<00:05:46.960> the

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
five beats a fantastic year but the

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.020 
five beats a fantastic year but the
numbers<00:05:47.440> wouldn't<00:05:47.740> be<00:05:47.830> so<00:05:48.100> ridiculous<00:05:48.730> where

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
numbers wouldn't be so ridiculous where

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.570 
numbers wouldn't be so ridiculous where
it's<00:05:49.210> like<00:05:49.450> Janice<00:05:50.140> question<00:05:50.740> he's<00:05:51.340> good<00:05:51.490> to
