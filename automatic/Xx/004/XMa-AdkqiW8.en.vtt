00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
know destroying things one of the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.189 
know destroying things one of the
questions<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.699> found<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> comments

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
questions that I found in the comments

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.740 
questions that I found in the comments
was<00:00:25.380> weird<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.189> find<00:00:26.550> girls<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.180> talk<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
was weird to find girls you can talk to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.230 
was weird to find girls you can talk to
any<00:00:27.990> girl<00:00:28.289> basically<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> know<00:00:29.130> anywhere<00:00:29.609> but

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
any girl basically you know anywhere but

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
any girl basically you know anywhere but
I<00:00:30.269> guess<00:00:30.630> starting<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.439> clubs<00:00:31.710> might<00:00:32.070> be

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
I guess starting up in clubs might be

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
I guess starting up in clubs might be
happier<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.059> lot<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.239> girls<00:00:33.630> are<00:00:33.870> more

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
happier because a lot of girls are more

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.680 
happier because a lot of girls are more
open<00:00:35.160> minded<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.450> might<00:00:36.630> be

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
open minded for it because they might be

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
open minded for it because they might be
looking<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.800> partner<00:00:38.190> since<00:00:38.550> they're<00:00:38.670> in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
looking for a partner since they're in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.040 
looking for a partner since they're in
the<00:00:38.850> club<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.390> saying<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.719> all<00:00:39.750> girls

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the club I'm not saying that all girls

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260 
the club I'm not saying that all girls
in<00:00:40.230> cups<00:00:40.469> are<00:00:40.920> looking<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> partner<00:00:41.969> but

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
in cups are looking for a partner but

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.000 
in cups are looking for a partner but
it's<00:00:42.480> more<00:00:42.660> likely<00:00:42.870> than<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.500> know<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it's more likely than you know when you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.860 
it's more likely than you know when you
find<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> street<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> bus<00:00:45.690> or

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
find one on the street or on the bus or

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
find one on the street or on the bus or
on<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> tram<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.230> whatever<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> hard<00:00:47.100> part<00:00:47.370> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
on a tram or whatever the hard part of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.670 
on a tram or whatever the hard part of
course<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.149> there's<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:49.050> predators

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
course is that there's more predators

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.189 
course is that there's more predators
there<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.360> don't<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.660> those<00:00:51.840> pick<00:00:52.050> up

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
there and you don't have those pick up

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.779 
there and you don't have those pick up
skills<00:00:52.440> yet<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.250> gonna<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> work

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
that off so it doesn't really matter

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.390

what you say you know you can say blah
blah<00:03:04.579> boom<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.780> know<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:07.250> might

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430

enough<00:03:09.319> see<00:03:09.739> but<00:03:09.889> I<00:03:09.920> think<00:03:10.190> there's<00:03:10.340> something

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
enough see but I think there's something

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.009 
enough see but I think there's something
behind<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.329> she<00:03:11.450> might<00:03:11.599> get<00:03:11.720> curious

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
behind it and she might get curious

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.170 
behind it and she might get curious
basically<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.799> can<00:03:13.010> meet<00:03:13.190> them<00:03:13.370> anywhere<00:03:13.880> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
basically you can meet them anywhere and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.180 
basically you can meet them anywhere and
like<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.109> said<00:03:15.170> before<00:03:15.349> maybe<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.829> is<00:03:15.950> good<00:03:16.160> to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
like I said before maybe it is good to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.030 
like I said before maybe it is good to
start<00:03:16.489> off<00:03:16.639> in<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:17.060> club<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.510> just<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.799> it<00:03:18.889> as<00:03:18.980> a
