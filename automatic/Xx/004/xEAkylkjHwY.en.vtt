00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.960
 from the outside seemingly halting like the rush hour when the fans know five 

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:08.459
 Points distance to Münster block the way up 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.459
 but that should change tomorrow when he comes again 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.659
 that means close 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.849
 the 1 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.670
 Schlagerspiel Münster Bielefeld indeed a van e-tron 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.030
 in the office, the ruble rolls against the traditional duel of Westphalia 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.550
 the Ostfalen as none of the fans miss and 900 Courteney 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.260
 Sales proceeds to get baskets 150 pounds tomorrow are all federal and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.010
 already gone 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.520
 Hamminkeln 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.270
 from outside to outside over a total 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.519
 Appraisers for the purpose of the association will make tomorrow on the way 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.679
 some hundreds are expected to the Münster Prussian Stadium 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.679
 and ethics 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 1 0 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.499
 3 1 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.840
 2 1 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.690
 more than one hour final training appointment in the Bielefeld Cycle Track 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.390
 everyone is fit so it was mentally good to hear and highly motivated the 0 to 3 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.230
 They want to make up for defeat in the first leg at home on the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.490
 Alm against the Prussians the tactics for tomorrow will not betray as well in the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.590
 Fog not recognizable anyway certainly not a possible one 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.640
 team's formation, 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.990
 The motivation is definitely percent good against Munster also in view of 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.130
 a week later the match against Verl on television first live 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.130
 be transmitted 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.920
 In addition, player Sprengler is often about that he was allowed 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.260
 exceptional situation although some already played in the professional field 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.830
 but 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.310
 even words play as a game and we know in your games Münster 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.660
 win here is the next week Burlo title follows right 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.250
 We all want to do everything we can to win the game 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 that it did not get any better and maybe a bit luckier though 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.380
 I think that the guys used very well in the game only to win 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.780
 we'll keep our fingers crossed 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.010
 more than a year or tomorrow is the dream of the championship 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.670
 fought 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.210
 Tomorrow evening at this time we are smarter in the thick fog of heavy 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.980
 Gang to Münster by bus and with much hope the Arminen roles but still 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.019
 Abreu Chen not lost
