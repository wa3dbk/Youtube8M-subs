00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.320
 a greeting to all friends 

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.960
 androidworld.it today I want to do a 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.740
 a little atypical comparison between two 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.689
 smartphone or s4 s4 mini because 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.820
 I want to compare obviously there is one 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.680
 you really want to talk 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.830
 a bit of this nice difference 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.750
 and at the same time make you understand better 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.660
 what was lost from a smartphone 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.550
 to the other from the point of view of the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.260
 technical features 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.960
 if we look at connections 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.790
 we can even say that s4000 has 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.559
 something more because even the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.950
 fm radio 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.840
 it's not really true because in any case s4 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:52.040
 supports mhl output via the port 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.149
 micro usb which is present below 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.660
 from the design point of view I would say that 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.239
 there is no need for explanations are two 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.539
 photocopies of each other 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.490
 one is the miniaturized version 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:08.959
 other 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.119
 continuing to talk about hardware instead 

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.679
 I put them a little bit that centered below 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.259
 the video camera will talk about 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.330
 hardware differences come when 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.800
 let's talk about the s4 processor one 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:27.110
 snapdragon 600 pot rope 1.9 gb with gpu 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 adreno a330 s4000 instead of a snack 3 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.429
 with 400 dual core 1.7 giger schon gpu 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.179
 adreno 205 the ram is not so different 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:40.399
 2gb for s4 a round and a half for s4 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.740
 minibatteria 2600 and for milian 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.050
 1,900 million battery for that one 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.970
 a little bit makes the difference even if the two 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.220
 autonomies are not really so 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.130
 the screens are so different 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.690
 both two amoled but here we have a 5 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.619
 499 inches by 1,920 x 1,080 pixels 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.780
 here we have a 4 inch and three with 960 x 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.350
 540 pixels therefore a difference 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.009
 the difference in dpi is substantial 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.100
 however very high here we have 441 dpa 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.450
 and here 256 so you ok this is more 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.370
 large and therefore higher resolution 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.810
 however, there is still a big difference 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.410
 of pixel density between the two 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.190
 smartphone 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.890
 finally the 13 and 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.989
 both are ds4 video at 1080p 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.970
 especially in the photos he takes some shots 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.739
 better but also of these 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.540
 four mini defends itself quite well 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.989
 as regards l 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.459
 the two displays there is to say that then 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.690
 viewing angles are practically 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.750
 the same pressure were used and state 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.010
 the same type of screen could 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.000
 his was also produced 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.100
 company 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.019
 there is something fundamentally different 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.250
 in brightness management 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.769
 automatic this s4 than s4 mini 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.030
 tends to always be darker in the 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.980
 automatic brightness management 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.530
 if we have the automatic measurement e 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.319
 instead we shoot everything to the maximum 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.239
 s4 is brighter ds4 mini though since 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.829
 we often use it in brightness 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.250
 automatic we have to say that if four 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.750
 mini had better management s4 had 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.239
 some small management problems 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.769
 of the loomis automatic age then up 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.359
 both of them 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.950
 we set the desktop view and 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.950
 when they are at ease 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.680
 I remind you that these four minis do not 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.750
 to the vibration in the samsung keyboard e 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.170
 does not have the revelation born astico below 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.180
 we obviously start them together 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.829
 usual loading times here we are 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.250
 under hi fi 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.040
 it depends a little on the camera yes 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.190
 should see the difference a little bit 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.390
 of colors but perhaps could also 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.280
 half be a little high 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.250
 camcorder the colors seem a little bit 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.269
 more faithful on this s4 here tend a 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.940
 little to blue green as often 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.150
 so the quality happens on the amoled 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.909
 this ds4 screen really 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:18.639
 the best or who has a charge 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:20.350
 if both the site repeat that this 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.030
 if four mini seems to behave 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.520
 better this yes and four no more 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:32.050
 even the scrub is not very large 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.600
 you can see differences, though, we have to say 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.169
 that to be a mini defends himself a lot 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.169
 very well 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.310
 once again we do because being 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.620
 four mini had not understood 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.740
 you have therefore seen both defend themselves 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:05:02.710
 recently s4 mini has maybe even 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:05.860
 something more see how s4 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.050
 despite the latest updates not 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.620
 we still haven't done this s4 has not 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.270
 still received jelly beans 4.3 la 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.430
 distribution has begun but in Italy 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.599
 that I know of still shouldn't be 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.650
 come to anyone the moment 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:24.599
 register say finally we also do a 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.599
 text for a moment on the images 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.330
 ok we were already there 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.880
 okay I am not in the same order 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.220
 let's go to load it usually picks up the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.690
 greater definition of these s4 yes 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.090
 see here are for example gods 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.770
 details in this red engraving 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.569
 in fact in yellow 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.660
 here we can really distinguish 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.949
 all the forms all contino here is 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.430
 slightly more mixed but it is 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:06.030
 obviously a problem of size 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.900
 of the screen and while I'm at it, I'm not 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:14.539
 also start a video to say that 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.539
 we really wanted to do everything 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:51.910
 for this comparison between the samsung 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:54.720
 galaxy s 4 and samsung galaxy s 4 mini is 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.720
 all a greeting well but it's not cisotti for 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.720
