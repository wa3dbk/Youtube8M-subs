00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.810 
back so you want to make sure that this
is<00:01:39.979> straight<00:01:40.280> or<00:01:40.460> straight<00:01:40.670> as<00:01:40.759> possible

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
is straight or straight as possible

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.249 
is straight or straight as possible
because<00:01:41.299> you're<00:01:41.539> actually<00:01:41.659> going<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.020> see

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.649 
because you're actually going to see
that<00:01:42.859> line<00:01:43.130> right<00:01:43.369> here<00:01:43.549> ok<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:44.420> look

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
that line right here ok so this look

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.709 
that line right here ok so this look
requires<00:01:45.229> some<00:01:45.950> teasing<00:01:46.280> or<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:47.060> curling<00:01:47.570> iron

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
requires some teasing or a curling iron

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.319 
requires some teasing or a curling iron
so<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.710> can<00:01:48.950> either<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.520> kind<00:01:49.759> of<00:01:49.880> wrap<00:01:50.119> your

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
up here or you can actually use a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.410 
up here or you can actually use a
curling<00:01:54.920> iron<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.159> give<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.460> some<00:01:55.700> lift<00:01:55.939> so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
curling iron to give you some lift so

for the curling iron what you would do

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.050 
for the curling iron what you would do
is<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.829> would<00:01:57.950> take<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:58.399> right<00:01:58.609> here<00:01:58.820> at<00:01:58.850> the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
is you would take it right here at the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.620 
is you would take it right here at the
root<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.570> you<00:02:00.350> would<00:02:00.469> wind<00:02:00.710> that<00:02:00.950> up<00:02:01.420> all<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.360 
tightening up just a little bit just let
you<00:03:08.250> know<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:08.580> secure<00:03:10.069> could<00:03:11.069> probably<00:03:11.220> do

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
you know it's secure could probably do

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.339 
you know it's secure could probably do
it<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.549> every<00:03:11.580> other<00:03:11.910> inch<00:03:12.269> just<00:03:12.989> put<00:03:13.200> them

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
it like every other inch just put them

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.839 
it like every other inch just put them
where<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.590> need<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.950> I'm<00:03:14.190> used<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.519> my<00:03:14.670> you're

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
where you need to I'm used to my you're

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.190 
where you need to I'm used to my you're
so<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.000> know<00:03:15.150> exactly<00:03:15.209> where<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:15.690> need<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> put<00:03:16.110> it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
so I know exactly where I need to put it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.380 
so I know exactly where I need to put it
but<00:03:16.319> just<00:03:16.470> kind<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.799> maybe<00:03:16.950> every<00:03:17.670> inch<00:03:17.880> do<00:03:18.239> one

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
but just kind of maybe every inch do one

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.940 
but just kind of maybe every inch do one
of<00:03:18.420> these<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.959> should<00:03:19.140> be<00:03:19.170> secure<00:03:19.590> enough<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
of these it should be secure enough that

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.979 
of these it should be secure enough that
when<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.459> let<00:03:20.970> go<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.450> still<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.870> this
