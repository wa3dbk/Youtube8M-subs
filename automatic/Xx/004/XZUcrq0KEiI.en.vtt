00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hy lake las in january and his time 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.540
 movie tribute by panem smoking jacket 1 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.840
 go do these underdogs always 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:18.359
 the more people will look worse 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:21.289
 You do not hear that from anyone but her 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.289
 can do it 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.960
 she will not finish it 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.099
 she destroys you become her 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.689
 personal concerns 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.820
 she should see what the capital is with 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.129
 district 12 I want that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.670
 Every one of them immediately sees his weapons 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.670
 laying down 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 he is the captain's trump like you 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.230
 our best 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 You will be peter as soon as possible 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640
 save or you can change your mind 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 district of the soya after the 75 100 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 playing catniss with the rebels in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.710
 District 13 accommodated 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.590
 but she is physical and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.239
 mentally a complete wreck in front of everyone 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.979
 also because Peter after the hunger 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.680
 game could not be saved and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.690
 so that is now used by the capitol 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 government gets real fire again 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.590
 thinks with katniss per day 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.510
 propaganda videos to shoot around the world 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.119
 out there showing what the capitol 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.009
 everything makes for terrible things 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.500
 for the rebels knowledgeable take 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.940
 in the destroyed districts and what is there 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.350
 happened and whether the rebellions 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.840
 ever has a chance 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.399
 that's what you'll find out in the cinema of the first of the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.960
 both movies focus 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.020
 not on the war between regions 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.940
 capitol autumn but also propaganda 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 you notice in the film about three 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.300
 Quarter of the film is actually more 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 production of television propaganda so 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.560
 announce and wait for the reaction 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.300
 the opposite represents and that thereby 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.680
 the voltage level very quickly in the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.460
 Keller is rushing that is actually 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.479
 preprogrammed 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.490
 unfortunately, the towering 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.880
 Jennifer Lawrence no longer has this soup 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.700
 rescue 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.170
 and despite that, that's actually 98 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.159
 percent of all scenes turned up 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.140
 therefore actually on the shoulder 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.210
 knock it should be enough here, unfortunately 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.770
 not the environment as well as the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.990
 destroyed districts are again 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.650
 film technically really really great 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.840
 shown 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.610
 Unfortunately that does not help 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.530
 the fact that the film 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.570
 story-technically just too little too 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.910
 now has the share here 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.920
 opinion because some say it is good im 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.390
 third part in two parts allotment i 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.040
 personally say it is nonsense 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.180
 what is your opinion let me 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.049
 just below in the comments 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.090
 knowledge 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.610
 the fact is that the movie 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.060
 with just over two hours to run 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.010
 would have much more to tell than he did in the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.750
 end effect really does my opinion 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.670
 after you have the film in good the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.130
 half of the time can tell and 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.930
 so you would have walking day part 1 &amp; 2 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.880
 can just throw over board and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.980
 the whole third part in a movie 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.150
 filming could certainly have done that 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.010
 also liked some 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.959
 Fans of the film can still be on 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.280
 a new very memorable tribute of 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.810
 look forward to a panem film 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.340
 the cast really works here 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.570
 outstanding work and also the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.190
 this tribute to the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.140
 deceased philip seymour hoffman for 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.459
 his grandiose 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.640
 despite all this, the first part succeeds 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.970
 from the walking chair movies not 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.709
 Approach to the two predecessors zoom 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.970
 and for the unread among us 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.020
 it is also an insane one 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.580
 surprise that the first three 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.390
 quarter of the movie so insane 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.920
 are boring 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.569
 though the two single exciting 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.130
 scenes that occur in spite of good 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.640
 performance is unfortunately not 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.190
 save more 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.550
 yes, he gets from us five out of ten 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.709
 points is just a cinema cinema 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.599
 So film for the fans look at you country 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.310
 he really is a cinema for cinema fans 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.260
 film and for the people now 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.030
 look forward to the grandiose second part 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.989
 so much more exciting and exciting 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.420
 krachen filmed 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.680
 no, forget it is not so 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.680
 unfortunately you can fold that 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.099
 you just see this typical one again 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.290
 development from underdog to blockbuster 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.180
 because cannibalized the end of the day 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.170
 is a pity but unfortunately so and 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.160
 We Do not want the course 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.500
 withheld because this is about 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.269
 Honest opinion of two young men 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.880
 the on youtube a channel 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.380
 the added burdens magical if 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.730
 you want to see more through it 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.290
 Subscribe and in the car also the still 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.549
 possibility you the trailer of 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.010
 pretty cool is probably even 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.700
 smaller than the film again more accurate 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.890
 to look 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.850
 yes what movie song as 66 write 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.560
