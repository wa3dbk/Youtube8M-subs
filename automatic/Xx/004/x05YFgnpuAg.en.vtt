00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
 two hours drive from Los Angels, on the other hand, the entertainer of the 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.230
 American crisis 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.019
 from CNOOC buys Christof k 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.169
 Skion the better times of the US hold 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.169
 the Oscar-winning for seven years here 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.689
 this business much better 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.699
 how much every day like percent getting the same cars getting thinner and thinner 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.759
 The people are selling by heart 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.569
 The prices of the ball will drop by 5000 dollars after 14 days 3500 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.980
 Prices are falling so fast people need the money Philippe Leroy cents 

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:34.900
 pay more 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.000
 Berlin their jobs so now you can bargain 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.120
 Kalinka's winner cars because 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.780
 the care people offer cars in packages 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.780
 Four cars for one price or two cars were circular 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.270
 if that does not go off and can only say the money out because very slowly 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
 in two weeks, the four dollars so far has come 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.150
 So go for a bargain 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.500
 Franz take over but are for one or the other Americans too 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.460
 as hostile felt 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.040
 if you know against Offenbach what he did 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.600
 from the Americans 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.760
 that is a more i want to catch up with someone nice american 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.490
 maybe just a man who maybe builds 18 of the Suntech Garden Massacre 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.260
 that hurt me a bit but Daimler said that they did not have any trouble 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.760
 make that 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.109
 as the first goal 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.310
 it is suffered instead 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.030
 the American classics the court 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.030
 is particularly pleased tend this goal against 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.679
 but worth it 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.090
 Eva Lohse closer now 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.410
 it's only me now that the car for sale Yes Red 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.479
 Percent grow class of Manchester 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.749
 That's a 1970 Ford Mustang convertible 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.369
 The seller has found the 49-year-old car in a parking lot 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.780
 the car was completely rusted a total of two years had a good one 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.400
 screwed and that many are now pay 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.520
 20,000 tons required for the piece of jewelry 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.959
 He proudly presents us with the power of the American dream 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.749
 point to it 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:29.109
 Eat-west very high but that of all they realized that them 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.809
 all for the transmission 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:34.469
 From this August, only 32 was built with this gearbox 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.499
 So the second 20 pigeons are not justified but for us 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.629
 difficult to sell it 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.269
 we will try 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.719
 but it is difficult for Werner Shining 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.729
 Four testers will wait until we become the right partner 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.749
 So probably buy rating 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.950
 and the observatories want the work or the car wants to have 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:59.939
 Although not a bargain but at least a new classic for Frank's homepage 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 for which certainly no buyer will be found in Germany 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.549
 next stop 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.549
 This unassuming house in the mountains of Sentix 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.019
 in the driveway is a replica of the original Ethno Beats from the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.969
 Sixties parked 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.029
 still under construction but clear that the car to recognize 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.379
 by the superhero in the tv series once go criminals 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.309
 Frankenburg has commissioned the fiberglass replica from SGi for a customer 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:40.239
 given 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.889
 Hub is running so well I'm working on some of them dividing the sheet with the first 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:44.889
 Chords very much 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.409
 The buyer called me and asked how far we are and wanted 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.439
 I'll take a look 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.629
 He is terribly excited but he knows that I will be one more year 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.659
 until we finish this effect 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.949
 For five months Berkels deep already in the black racer around an end 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.529
 is not yet foreseeable if EHEC 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:06.469
 I've already read percent of each reading down here on the engine 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.959
 While the North Face takes eleven years to do that, it's normal for us to fix 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.620
 still need to fix the rhetoric 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.310
 for that the engine removed everything must be cleaned times just explained that way 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.729
 and what a real picture is mobile 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.810
 Of course this can also be behavioral with the tourist effect 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.919
 During the Sail project sea work of both Rainer you can do it that way 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.849
 a radar comes out that you can let out of colors and rotate 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.199
 however, the original had a kind of big eruption so far would be about 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.509
 so big out of the mud came Obus clear that Bert Neumann is yes 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.240
 also powered by nuclear power I will also rebuild exactly if I do 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.610
 Men who do not do that he will live with Rüdiger Pape Ears 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.729
 Reason for the front, we also have a few good ideas, among other things 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.889
 will be able to build a frame spur here »said friend 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.729
 around the 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.089
 and in the back we will install three pipes from the rockets 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:11.900
 we may probably question them with the tailwind of the shoot 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.879
 League of Nations question if I think in Worms 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.219
 Only the question remains to clarify which real superhero to send such a 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.949
 makes 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.069
 that goes to Germany to Berlin 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:24.839
 Among others, the 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:26.430
 eat-we will be away 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.719
 as almost everything from dotMobi reform from works to the for the car 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.169
 what will this cost about barely Andreas Andreas Evers 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.169
 So the purchase is no price say 80 00 dollars 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.889
 a car will even ship Frank to Germany today 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:41.889
 more on that later
