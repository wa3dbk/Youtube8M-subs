00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
and mass hacking but uh what they would

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.309 
and mass hacking but uh what they would
they<00:03:44.250> what<00:03:44.700> they<00:03:44.819> basically<00:03:45.209> said<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.750> wanted

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
they what they basically said I wanted

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.960 
they what they basically said I wanted
to<00:03:46.470> begin<00:03:46.770> with<00:03:47.010> was<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:48.120> stable<00:03:49.020> bot<00:03:49.200> uh<00:03:49.970> and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
to begin with was a a stable bot uh and

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.150 
to begin with was a a stable bot uh and
they<00:03:51.540> can't<00:03:52.050> he<00:03:52.140> didn't<00:03:52.410> even<00:03:52.530> hey<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.770> think

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
they can't he didn't even hey I think

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.550 
they can't he didn't even hey I think
that<00:03:53.610> if<00:03:53.730> they<00:03:53.850> had<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.239> much<00:03:54.480> like<00:03:54.810> accounts

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
that if they had that much like accounts

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.940 
that if they had that much like accounts
how<00:03:55.650> much<00:03:55.830> gold<00:03:56.160> as<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.989> US<00:03:57.989> Coast<00:03:58.350> claims<00:03:58.800> to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
how much gold as the US Coast claims to

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.220 
how much gold as the US Coast claims to
have<00:03:59.130> or<00:03:59.610> even<00:04:00.120> even<00:04:00.390> if<00:04:00.510> he<00:04:00.600> doesn't<00:04:00.810> claim<00:04:01.080> to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
have or even even if he doesn't claim to

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.710 
have or even even if he doesn't claim to
have<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.590> much<00:04:01.800> like<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.640> figured<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.360> they

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
have that much like I figured that they

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.570 
have that much like I figured that they
at<00:04:03.840> least<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:04.260> somewhere<00:04:04.590> around<00:04:04.770> 13<00:04:05.400> bill

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
at least have somewhere around 13 bill

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.690 
at least have somewhere around 13 bill
right<00:04:05.790> now<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:07.230> would<00:04:07.920> say<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:08.100> they<00:04:08.489> still

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
right now I would say so they still

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.630 
right now I would say so they still
around<00:04:08.840> 14,000<00:04:09.840> accounts<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.890> would<00:04:11.040> be<00:04:11.160> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
around 14,000 accounts that would be a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.150 
around 14,000 accounts that would be a
massive<00:04:12.239> amount<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:12.900> gold<00:04:13.140> because<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.800> lot<00:04:14.130> of

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
massive amount of gold because a lot of

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.770 
massive amount of gold because a lot of
the<00:04:14.310> people<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.820> are<00:04:14.880> bought<00:04:15.420> with<00:04:15.450> us

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
the people that are bought with us

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.659 
the people that are bought with us
