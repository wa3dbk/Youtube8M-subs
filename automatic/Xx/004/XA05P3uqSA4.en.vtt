00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.870
Today is a special day for Arthur Hart.

00:00:09.357 --> 00:00:11.619
Today is National Signing Day.

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:15.986
Arthur Hart is signing his Letter of Intent...

00:00:16.077 --> 00:00:21.731
To play for the University of North Carolina at Charlotte '49ers on a full scholarship.

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:24.581
It is a very exciting time for him.

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:29.717
Our school is so proud to have given him the opportunity to grow as a person and as a student-athlete.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.481
I have papers for you to sign.

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:34.248
This is a Letter of Intent.

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:36.755
Signing this means you accept their scholarship offer.

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:45.946
I immediately saw that he was an elite football player, given his knowledge and leadership.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.280
The other boys looked up to him.

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.263
It has been a honor having him here.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.990
I will never see someone like him again.

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:56.018
A great athlete, with a great attitude and serious academic focus.

00:00:57.736 --> 00:01:01.648
Coaching him has been a big honor not only for me, but for all others on the coaching staff.

00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:06.394
We have worked together, encouraging him to pursue his dreams, and today he has achieved them.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.736
Now you are a '49er!

00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:40.881
Congratulations.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:44.657
I'm proud of you.

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:53.830
Wow. It feels great.

00:01:54.153 --> 00:01:57.408
It has been a good experience, but it was long and stressful.

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:01.367
So, now it's over. I'm relieved.

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:05.204
I know where I'm going for college. I know where my future is.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.353
Everything is set.

00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:08.829
It feels really good.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.006
Well, my dad played a big part in my recruitment process.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.761
My dad contacted a company that developed a website for my athlete profile.

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:29.489
After that was set up, we started emailing colleges and contacting coaches.

00:02:30.777 --> 00:02:35.196
We sent my profile to maybe 300 colleges.

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:42.373
After I started to get responses, I then knew my interest was in schools on the East Coast.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.729
Virginia and North Carolina, mostly the eastern states.

00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:54.061
So, the summer following my junior year in high school, I decided to take a big trip.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.717
I visited many different college campuses.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.334
I participated in around 10 different camps in nine days.

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.260
I was very busy, and it was very hard.

00:03:07.283 --> 00:03:08.928
But it was worth it.

00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:13.694
I met with many college coaches, and got a lot of interest from talking with different people.

00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:15.818
Basically, I recruited myself.

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:22.911
Well, Charlotte was the first school to offer me a full scholarship.

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:27.894
After I met with the coaches and saw the campus...

00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:29.548
Well, the campus was beautiful...

00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:32.162
Everything felt perfect... it felt like a perfect fit.

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:36.084
I felt I wanted to go there, not like it was a last resort.

00:03:39.034 --> 00:03:41.333
I wanted to be there.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.813
All the coaches were easy to talk with, and understood that I was deaf.

00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:48.877
They didn't care that I was deaf.

00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.873
So, it was a good environment.

00:03:52.697 --> 00:03:55.703
First of all, I would like to thank my dad.

00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:59.590
He had the biggest role in my recruitment process.

00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:03.388
He was the one who sent all the emails.

00:04:03.403 --> 00:04:07.634
He was the one who took me on trips to visit college campuses.

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:14.368
I was behind him the entire time; he really showed me the way.

00:04:15.997 --> 00:04:18.479
It was a great bonding experience with my dad.

00:04:19.122 --> 00:04:22.232
I'd like to thank the athletics department at MSSD... Athletic Director Mark Burke...

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:27.038
Head coach Jimmy, and everyone else who were involved with my athletics here at MSSD.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.672
I'm proud of you.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.256
I'll miss you.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:36.364
Take care. Stay in touch with us.

00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:44.767
Students come here from all over the country, and come with different backgrounds, interests, and goals.

00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:47.613
We at MSSD are thrilled to have them here...

00:04:47.613 --> 00:04:52.415
And to provide them with many programs and activities to help them in achieving their goals.

00:04:53.818 --> 00:04:55.633
I would like to congratulate Arthur.
