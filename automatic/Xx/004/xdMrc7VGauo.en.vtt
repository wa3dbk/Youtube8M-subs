00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
three so that's the specific set that I

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.540 
three so that's the specific set that I

to<00:00:23.760> something<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.029> has<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> seven<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.320> here

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
to something that has a seven up here

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.179 
to something that has a seven up here
which<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.769> probably<00:00:26.359> used<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.599> age

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
which is probably used for the age

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.589 
which is probably used for the age
usable<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.550> children<00:00:29.939> over<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> age<00:00:30.420> of

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
usable for children over the age of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.269 
usable for children over the age of
seven<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.349> don't<00:00:31.500> swallow<00:00:31.710> any<00:00:31.890> small

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
seven so they don't swallow any small

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.760 
seven so they don't swallow any small
parts<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.719> moving<00:00:34.350> limbs

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
parts they do have moving limbs

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.920 
parts they do have moving limbs
this<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.370> toadstool<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.480> normally<00:00:36.750> when<00:00:36.840> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
this one is toadstool so normally when I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.400 
this one is toadstool so normally when I
first<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.950> stapled<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> top

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
first get it it is stapled at the top

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.290 
first get it it is stapled at the top
into<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.530> cardboard<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.910> let<00:00:42.059> me<00:00:42.120> just

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
into this cardboard and then let me just

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.799 
into this cardboard and then let me just
close<00:00:43.489> on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> original<00:00:44.910> wrapper<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.660> there's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
close on the original wrapper so there's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
close on the original wrapper so there's
a<00:00:45.870> bag<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:46.559> he<00:00:46.649> comes<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:46.950> another<00:00:47.190> bag

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a bag there then he comes in another bag

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.319 
a bag there then he comes in another bag
usually<00:00:48.739> Molineux<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.210> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
usually Molineux and this is what this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.540 
usually Molineux and this is what this
one<00:00:51.480> looks<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.100> hard<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> tell

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
one looks like it's really hard to tell

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.160 
one looks like it's really hard to tell
because<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.879> don't<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.390> HD<00:00:54.629> camera<00:00:54.899> yet

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
because I don't have my HD camera yet

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.069 
because I don't have my HD camera yet

these<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.479> authentic<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
these are all authentic because the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410 
these are all authentic because the
price<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:16.830> very<00:01:17.040> inexpensive<00:01:17.939> normally<00:01:18.240> for

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
price was very inexpensive normally for

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.640 
price was very inexpensive normally for
authentic<00:01:18.810> figures<00:01:19.080> they<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.500> much

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
authentic figures they would be much

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
authentic figures they would be much
much<00:01:19.830> more<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.610> does<00:01:20.790> say<00:01:20.970> Nintendo<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.479> the

much more it does say Nintendo at the
bottom<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.380> does<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> copyright<00:01:23.280> symbol

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
bit odd there is a Wario but it looks

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.880 
bit odd there is a Wario but it looks
extremely<00:04:06.510> hard<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.049> there's<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.290> Bowser<00:04:07.500> that

extremely hard and there's a Bowser that

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.590 
extremely hard and there's a Bowser that
looks<00:04:08.100> terrible<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.180> don't<00:04:09.299> think<00:04:09.390> I'm<00:04:09.510> ever

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
looks terrible so I don't think I'm ever

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.879 
looks terrible so I don't think I'm ever
going<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.810> get<00:04:09.930> those<00:04:10.139> as<00:04:10.319> part<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.650> set

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
going to get those as part of the set

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.740 
going to get those as part of the set
which<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.609> why<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:11.850> was<00:04:12.120> led<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.299> believe<00:04:12.389> maybe

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
which is why I was led to believe maybe

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.270 
which is why I was led to believe maybe
these<00:04:12.930> are<00:04:13.079> not<00:04:13.230> authentic<00:04:13.590> but<00:04:13.980> they<00:04:14.100> still

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
these are not authentic but they still

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.460 
these are not authentic but they still
look<00:04:14.370> great<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.870> might<00:04:16.049> get<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.260> Bowser

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
