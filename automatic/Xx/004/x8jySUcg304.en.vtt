00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 elop hi everybody today we 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.980
 can be found on call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.989
 today small climb on black ops 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.730
 are you asked me for black ops from 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.500
 1 because it's true, well, I'm here 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.140
 start getting a little tired of it 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.780
 look forward to know and bmw 2 so 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.090
 here I am asking you and gameplay 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.040
 on a game I give it to you there is no 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.110
 worry so here it is a little gameplay 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.960
 in parentheses that I found on 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.400
 the word studio so that's it's done 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.930
 always pleasure to find long 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.589
 above diaw that's it's really a 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.540
 missing thing 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.680
 like Thursday in parentheses it's a 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.070
 missing thing on the new call 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.720
 of duty 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.739
 the studio mode because there is 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.900
 a lot of youtube hours they 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.089
 could edit editing 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.619
 thanks to this studio mode and or so 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.420
 Stored gameplay as I like 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.680
 do can store gameplay on the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.720
 studio fashion was really expecting 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.979
 always pleasure writing then really 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.840
 surprised to find a gameplay that 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.090
 I had done a very long time ago 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.439
 So here I close the parenthesis is 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.740
 of our little old people who really miss 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.369
 a lot 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.610
 so that's small climbed with the n 7 in 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.560
 gold killstreaks is the turret the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.640
 dog he scolds scores the dog that 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.859
 I do not know if I can 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.219
 unlock so I let you see the 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.439
 gameplay 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.300
 so the little topic today is 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.280
 of course that's where 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.710
 as are rendered on the title this is a 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.860
 total eclipse of the sun that will take place 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.530
 March 20th at home so here it is 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.920
 in the hemisphere g of m here the little 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.980
 graphic 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.230
 these last deny north sphere so you 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.120
 can really look at everything that is 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.290
 in red this is where we can observe the 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.090
 phenomenon in its totality 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.520
 for 10 minutes there will be more than 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.830
 sun so that's it if you see it 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.330
 there is more sun with respect was not going 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.250
 make a sacrifice like in a jar 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.810
 and everything is not it's not at all 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.040
 it 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.110
 so here it's just a team this 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.230
 is not the end of the world 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.140
 so that's so if for example I 'll go 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.790
 take an example in France in the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.740
 north we can observe the phenomenon 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.590
 80%, that is to say in Lille for example 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.620
 at 80% and then in the south will say 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.950
 marseille in corsican or bordeaux 1-1 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.540
 just like that you will want to 60% of his 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.920
 totality ie 60% 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.450
 the sun will be hidden as little info 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.030
 who really is they have less 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.810
 important do not watch clips 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.520
 with solar clips with glasses 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.910
 normal ie glasses of 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.739
 Sun 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.870
 you really need special glasses 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.340
 is to read nudes all black that you 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.489
 find in a pharmacy or at a 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.010
 optician of course on sale pretty much 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.970
 three four days before the phenomenon 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.470
 so validly from the east are we 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.270
 pharmacists 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.500
 it will cost between 1 and 2 euros I 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.880
 do not advance too much on the price but good 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.610
 it must be rejected adopted the same 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.810
 matter that you see as masters of 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.670
 cinema you go it's pretty much the nun 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.709
 ironmonger so it's not going to cost a 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.720
 arm but that's it's really limit 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.520
 special for that to watch that so 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.810
 that would be really stupid to 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.580
 Gaulle was very small I found a 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.950
 little fragile while there you can buy 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.739
 a letter 2 euros 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.530
 so that's the phenomenon as I said 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.569
 it will be between 9h and 11h 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.180
 here in France to observe it between 9am 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.040
 and 11h so that's if that day the 20 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.739
 March you see it's dark does not surprise you 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.370
 not it's just an eclipse it's not the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.400
 end of the world 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.040
 so here on this I tell you later 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.290
 it will surely be on a gameplay 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.569
 maybe I test the harmonics because 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.720
 that I unlocked the age berra 3b reflects 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.040
 so here is a shit weapon between 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.260
 parentheses it's a sea weapon and 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.599
 I offer to the PÃ¢quis here it is a man 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.549
 modern and then and so here I am 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:00.230
 tell me later and then on this mosquito 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:03.760
 the mosquitoes of attac so that's it on this 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.760
 Thursday to later and then ciao
