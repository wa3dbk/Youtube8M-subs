techniques knowing the ratios and from

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189 
techniques knowing the ratios and from
there<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.460> sky<00:00:29.669> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> limit<00:00:30.079> working<00:00:31.079> in<00:00:31.140> a

restaurants really exciting you know

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.540 
restaurants really exciting you know
it's<00:00:33.300> fast-paced<00:00:33.920> it's<00:00:34.920> almost<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.340> going

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it's fast-paced it's almost like going

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310 
it's fast-paced it's almost like going
in<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.570> knowing<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.080> to<00:00:37.200> expect

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
in and just not knowing what to expect

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260 
in and just not knowing what to expect
because<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.010> variables<00:00:38.520> come<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.060> so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
because the variables come at you so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510 
because the variables come at you so
fast<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.320> all<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.590> reaction<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
fast and it's all about reaction and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400 
fast and it's all about reaction and
being<00:00:42.150> prepared<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.080> a<00:00:43.110> whole<00:00:43.290> lot

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
being prepared and that was a whole lot

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.810 
being prepared and that was a whole lot
of<00:00:43.530> fun<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.040> while<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.580> then<00:00:44.640> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
of fun for a little while and then it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.540 
flaky or both not this is this amount of
butter<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.410> this<00:01:47.530> amount<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.860> flour<00:01:48.040> but<00:01:48.430> the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
butter and this amount of flour but the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.580 
butter and this amount of flour but the
technique<00:01:48.910> that<00:01:49.090> goes<00:01:49.240> into<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:49.720> we're<00:01:50.410> really

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
technique that goes into it we're really

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.870 
technique that goes into it we're really
teaching<00:01:51.100> people<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.400> same<00:01:51.550> things<00:01:51.790> you're

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
teaching people the same things you're

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.100 
teaching people the same things you're
going<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.090> learn<00:01:52.180> in<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.390> culinary<00:01:52.600> school

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
going to learn in the culinary school

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.889 
going to learn in the culinary school
just<00:01:53.740> in<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.920> more<00:01:54.100> condensed<00:01:54.580> fashion<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.390> try

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
just in a more condensed fashion I try

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:56.999 
just in a more condensed fashion I try
to<00:01:55.930> break<00:01:56.229> it<00:01:56.380> down<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.979> the

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
to break it down to the to the

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.249 
to break it down to the to the
essentials<00:01:57.640> so<00:01:58.149> that<00:01:58.300> folks<00:01:58.420> not<00:01:58.720> only<00:01:58.960> know

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
essentials so that folks not only know

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.540 
essentials so that folks not only know
what<00:01:59.500> they're<00:01:59.649> doing<00:01:59.920> but<00:02:00.040> why<00:02:00.250> they're<00:02:00.520> doing

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
what they're doing but why they're doing

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.389 
what they're doing but why they're doing
it<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.090> how<00:02:01.660> changing<00:02:02.290> things<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.860> little<00:02:03.220> bit

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
it and how changing things a little bit

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.070 
it and how changing things a little bit
here<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.759> there<00:02:03.820> will<00:02:04.149> change<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.630> outcome

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
here and there will change the outcome

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:15.059 
here and there will change the outcome
so<00:02:05.590> they<00:02:05.830> can<00:02:05.979> develop<00:02:06.250> their<00:02:06.610> own<00:02:06.640> recipes

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.320 

you

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.390
