I found myself a vr6 so I was building a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.540 
I found myself a vr6 so I was building a
turbo<00:00:13.250> motor<00:00:13.490> for<00:00:13.790> the<00:00:13.880> 2.0<00:00:14.480> and<00:00:14.960> I<00:00:15.110> was<00:00:15.290> just<00:00:15.620> I

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
turbo motor for the 2.0 and I was just I

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.189

kind<00:00:17.150> of<00:00:17.240> want<00:00:17.390> a<00:00:17.419> little<00:00:17.630> bit<00:00:17.720> more<00:00:17.869> power<00:00:18.050> I

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
kind of want a little bit more power I

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.169 
kind of want a little bit more power I
was<00:00:18.380> thinking<00:00:18.710> and<00:00:19.220> I've<00:00:19.310> always<00:00:19.519> been<00:00:19.789> a<00:00:19.849> fan

a Jetta I went ahead and got the whole

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.249 
a Jetta I went ahead and got the whole
motor<00:00:28.279> it's<00:00:28.579> pretty<00:00:28.820> much<00:00:28.939> complete<00:00:29.329> now<00:00:30.169> I've

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
motor it's pretty much complete now I've

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.749 
motor it's pretty much complete now I've
got<00:00:30.380> most<00:00:30.529> of<00:00:30.679> everything<00:00:31.130> it's<00:00:31.519> got<00:00:31.609> the

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759

got most of everything it's got the
exhaust<00:00:31.970> on<00:00:32.300> it<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:33.079> intake<00:00:33.350> was<00:00:33.500> on<00:00:33.710> one<00:00:34.250> of

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
exhaust on it the intake was on one of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.950 
exhaust on it the intake was on one of
the<00:00:34.430> things<00:00:34.579> I'm<00:00:34.760> not<00:00:34.910> too<00:00:35.239> happy<00:00:35.390> about<00:00:35.570> is<00:00:35.930> a

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
the things I'm not too happy about is a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.049 
the things I'm not too happy about is a
fly-by-wire<00:00:36.440> rather<00:00:37.070> be<00:00:37.309> a<00:00:37.340> regular<00:00:37.670> throttle

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
fly-by-wire rather be a regular throttle

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.349 
fly-by-wire rather be a regular throttle
cable<00:00:38.420> but<00:00:39.230> that's<00:00:39.800> ok<00:00:40.280> everything<00:00:41.210> was

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
cable but that's ok everything was

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.830 
cable but that's ok everything was
complete<00:00:41.809> on<00:00:42.289> the<00:00:42.469> front<00:00:42.769> side<00:00:43.070> AC<00:00:43.840> power

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
complete on the front side AC power

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.110 
complete on the front side AC power
steering<00:00:45.500> I<00:00:45.769> mean<00:00:46.190> all<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.519> stuff<00:00:46.579> was<00:00:46.910> there

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
steering I mean all that stuff was there

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.380 
steering I mean all that stuff was there
the<00:00:47.840> other<00:00:48.019> thing<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.559> it<00:00:49.429> wasn't<00:00:49.640> automatic

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
the other thing is it wasn't automatic

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.610 
the other thing is it wasn't automatic
so<00:00:50.570> I'm<00:00:50.629> going<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.870> go<00:00:51.109> ahead<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.320> order<00:00:51.440> a

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
so I'm going to go ahead and order a

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.099 
so I'm going to go ahead and order a
light<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.129> flywheel<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:52.879> probably<00:00:53.449> stage<00:00:53.750> 3

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
light and flywheel and probably stage 3

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.869 
light and flywheel and probably stage 3
clutch<00:00:54.320> Forks<00:00:54.920> since<00:00:55.070> I'll<00:00:55.250> probably<00:00:55.550> end<00:00:55.760> up

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
clutch Forks since I'll probably end up

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.939 
clutch Forks since I'll probably end up
turbo<00:00:56.359> in<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:56.660> thing<00:00:56.870> I've<00:00:57.620> pretty<00:00:57.859> much

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
turbo in this thing I've pretty much

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.979 
turbo in this thing I've pretty much
gotten<00:00:58.309> all<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.789> hoses<00:00:58.969> that<00:00:59.239> were<00:00:59.359> there<00:00:59.600> so

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
gotten all the hoses that were there so

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.169 
gotten all the hoses that were there so
next<00:01:00.260> up<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:01.010> do<00:01:01.160> some<00:01:01.370> checking<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:01.969> see

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
next up is to do some checking and see

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.660 
next up is to do some checking and see
what<00:01:02.359> will<00:01:02.480> actually<00:01:02.870> fit<00:01:03.649> in<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.220> Jetta<00:01:04.549> and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
what will actually fit in the Jetta and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.880 
what will actually fit in the Jetta and
what<00:01:04.909> I'll<00:01:05.030> have<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.360> modify<00:01:05.659> I've<00:01:06.380> got<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
what I'll have to modify I've got the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.530 
what I'll have to modify I've got the
original<00:01:06.979> wiring<00:01:07.700> harness<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.119> pigtails

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
original wiring harness the pigtails

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.399 
original wiring harness the pigtails
from<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.140> ECU<00:01:09.670> from<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.850> donor<00:01:11.060> car<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.259> I'm

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
from the ECU from the donor car but I'm

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.990 
from the ECU from the donor car but I'm
just<00:01:12.619> going<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.890> see<00:01:13.100> how<00:01:13.340> they'll<00:01:13.579> actually

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
just going to see how they'll actually

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.539 
just going to see how they'll actually
match<00:01:14.210> up<00:01:14.450> with<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.290> car<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.740> had<00:01:15.829> the<00:01:15.890> 2.0

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
match up with the car that had the 2.0

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.710 
match up with the car that had the 2.0
this<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:18.189> different<00:01:19.189> conversion<00:01:19.670> swap<00:01:20.509> here

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
this is a different conversion swap here

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.630 
this is a different conversion swap here
but<00:01:21.020> uh<00:01:21.049> I<00:01:21.380> think<00:01:21.680> it'd<00:01:21.770> be<00:01:21.799> fun<00:01:22.040> I'd<00:01:22.310> rather<00:01:22.430> go

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
but uh I think it'd be fun I'd rather go

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.490 
but uh I think it'd be fun I'd rather go
with<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.820> VR<00:01:23.000> 6<00:01:23.450> got<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.750> little<00:01:23.960> bit<00:01:24.049> more<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.470> it

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
with a VR 6 got a little bit more to it

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.639 
with a VR 6 got a little bit more to it
than<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.009> 2.0<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.600> is<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:26.869> timing<00:01:27.229> belt<00:01:27.259> car

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
than the 2.0 this is a timing belt car

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.310 
than the 2.0 this is a timing belt car
so<00:01:28.719> makes<00:01:29.719> me<00:01:29.899> a<00:01:29.930> little<00:01:29.990> bit<00:01:30.170> more

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
so makes me a little bit more

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.080 
so makes me a little bit more
comfortable<00:01:30.740> when<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:31.100> start<00:01:31.340> turbo<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.790> them

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
comfortable when I start turbo in them

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.149 
comfortable when I start turbo in them
anyways<00:01:32.780> that's<00:01:33.320> what's<00:01:33.649> getting<00:01:33.860> ready<00:01:34.009> to

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
anyways that's what's getting ready to

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.039 
anyways that's what's getting ready to

got<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.210> 2.0<00:01:47.719> out<00:01:47.930> of<00:01:48.079> it<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.469> this<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.369> going

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
got the 2.0 out of it and this is going

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.039 
got the 2.0 out of it and this is going
to<00:01:49.610> be<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.700> pretty<00:01:49.939> good<00:01:50.090> car<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.509> start<00:01:50.810> with

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
to be a pretty good car to start with

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.319 
to be a pretty good car to start with
it's<00:01:51.560> pretty<00:01:52.369> much<00:01:52.490> empty<00:01:52.789> and<00:01:53.000> ready<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.180> go

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
it's pretty much empty and ready to go

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.590 
it's pretty much empty and ready to go
now<00:01:54.289> everything<00:01:54.740> I've<00:01:54.860> seen<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:55.430> far<00:01:55.460> seems<00:01:56.210> to

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
now everything I've seen so far seems to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.569 
now everything I've seen so far seems to
be<00:01:56.869> looks<00:01:57.439> like<00:01:57.649> it's<00:01:57.859> going<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.100> go<00:01:58.250> ahead<00:01:58.310> and

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
be looks like it's going to go ahead and

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.050 
be looks like it's going to go ahead and
go<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:58.789> here<00:01:59.060> pretty<00:01:59.689> easily<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.859> this<00:02:01.579> weekend

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
go in here pretty easily so this weekend

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.310 
go in here pretty easily so this weekend
I'm<00:02:02.180> going<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.329> go<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.570> test<00:02:02.780> fit<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.049> motor

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
I'm going to go and test fit the motor

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.630 
I'm going to go and test fit the motor
in<00:02:03.500> here<00:02:03.680> I'm<00:02:03.770> looking<00:02:03.890> for<00:02:04.189> a<00:02:04.219> transmission

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
in here I'm looking for a transmission

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.480 
in here I'm looking for a transmission
right<00:02:05.060> now<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.979> we'll<00:02:06.979> switch<00:02:07.159> out<00:02:07.340> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
right now and we'll switch out the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.959 
right now and we'll switch out the
brakes

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
brakes

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.850 
brakes
apparently<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.569> vr6<00:02:09.019> has<00:02:09.289> bigger<00:02:09.500> brakes

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
apparently the vr6 has bigger brakes

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.420 
apparently the vr6 has bigger brakes
than<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.489> 2.0<00:02:11.180> car<00:02:11.750> also<00:02:12.410> we're<00:02:12.860> going<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.040> go

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
than the 2.0 car also we're going to go

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.599 
than the 2.0 car also we're going to go
it<00:02:13.549> and<00:02:13.760> check<00:02:14.060> into<00:02:14.359> this<00:02:14.750> I'm<00:02:15.200> o2<00:02:15.469> and<00:02:15.920> i'm<00:02:16.010> o3

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
it and check into this I'm o2 and i'm o3

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.089 
it and check into this I'm o2 and i'm o3
on<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.569> clusters<00:02:18.109> and<00:02:18.349> we're<00:02:18.709> going<00:02:18.829> to<00:02:18.890> see

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
on the clusters and we're going to see

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.830 
on the clusters and we're going to see
what<00:02:19.280> we're<00:02:19.430> going<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.609> be<00:02:19.730> dealing<00:02:19.969> with<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
what we're going to be dealing with the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.589 
what we're going to be dealing with the
computers<00:02:21.409> are<00:02:21.620> up<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:22.010> here<00:02:22.579> you'll<00:02:23.209> have<00:02:23.299> two

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
computers are up in here you'll have two

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.640 
computers are up in here you'll have two
of<00:02:23.629> them<00:02:23.870> if<00:02:23.959> it's<00:02:24.109> an<00:02:24.230> automatic

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
of them if it's an automatic

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.899 
of them if it's an automatic
transmission<00:02:24.950> for<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.459> transmission

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
transmission for the transmission

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.580 
transmission for the transmission
control<00:02:26.150> module<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.989> then<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.349> have<00:02:27.469> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
control module and then you have the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.410 
control module and then you have the
other<00:02:27.769> computer<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.760> we've<00:02:29.000> got<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> couple

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
other computer so we've got a couple

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.670 
other computer so we've got a couple
other<00:02:29.659> things<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:30.139> we're<00:02:30.379> going<00:02:30.409> to<00:02:30.560> be

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
other things that we're going to be

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.699 
other things that we're going to be
doing<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.189> here<00:02:32.019> but<00:02:33.019> right<00:02:33.139> now<00:02:33.319> we're<00:02:33.620> going

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
doing in here but right now we're going

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.679 
doing in here but right now we're going
to<00:02:33.769> go<00:02:33.980> ahead<00:02:34.069> I've<00:02:34.519> got<00:02:34.730> almost<00:02:35.090> everything

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
to go ahead I've got almost everything

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.809 
to go ahead I've got almost everything
on<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.930> vr6<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:37.280> get<00:02:37.430> me<00:02:37.549> started<00:02:37.939> and<00:02:39.819> then

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
on the vr6 to get me started and then

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.129 
on the vr6 to get me started and then
we're<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.030> going<00:02:41.359> to<00:02:41.389> start<00:02:41.689> piecing<00:02:41.930> it

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
we're just going to start piecing it

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.679 
we're just going to start piecing it
together<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.769> going<00:02:43.519> but<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:44.480> is

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
together and get it going but this is

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.000 
together and get it going but this is
going<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.900> be<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.109> swap

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
going to be the swap

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.759 
going to be the swap
I've<00:02:46.310> built<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.849> 2.0<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.810> actually<00:02:48.409> put

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
I've built a 2.0 that actually put

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.710 
I've built a 2.0 that actually put
brainy<00:02:49.010> Pistons<00:02:49.489> bring<00:02:49.879> to<00:02:50.000> everything<00:02:50.419> in<00:02:50.569> it

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
brainy Pistons bring to everything in it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.140 
brainy Pistons bring to everything in it
and<00:02:50.900> was<00:02:51.439> going<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.650> turbo<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.280> I've<00:02:52.790> got<00:02:53.000> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
and was going to turbo it I've got the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.740 
and was going to turbo it I've got the
manifold<00:02:53.659> and<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:55.010> just<00:02:55.760> really<00:02:56.299> want<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.629> go

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
manifold and I just really want to go

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.959 
manifold and I just really want to go
with<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.959> vr6<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.769> think<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.099> vr6<00:02:58.549> is<00:02:58.760> going<00:02:58.909> to

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:58.969 
with a vr6 I think the vr6 is going to

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.199 
with a vr6 I think the vr6 is going to
be<00:02:59.120> more<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.599> an<00:02:59.689> interesting<00:02:59.989> build<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:02.180> know

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
be more of an interesting build you know

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.379 
be more of an interesting build you know
timing<00:03:02.689> belt<00:03:02.870> on<00:03:03.139> it<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:05.030> know<00:03:05.120> boots

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
timing belt on it and you know boots

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.670 
timing belt on it and you know boots
should<00:03:05.569> make<00:03:05.780> some<00:03:05.959> good<00:03:06.139> torque<00:03:06.469> and

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
should make some good torque and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.530 
should make some good torque and
horsepower<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.760> what<00:03:07.879> we're<00:03:07.969> going<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> do<00:03:08.269> is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
horsepower so what we're going to do is

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.300 
horsepower so what we're going to do is
this<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:08.930> going<00:03:09.109> to<00:03:09.169> be<00:03:09.260> pretty<00:03:09.439> much<00:03:09.680> what's

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
this is going to be pretty much what's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.670 
this is going to be pretty much what's
coming<00:03:10.730> up<00:03:10.849> on<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.090> project<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.810> from<00:03:12.260> here

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
coming up on the project and from here

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.440 
coming up on the project and from here
we're<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.400> go<00:03:13.549> ahead<00:03:13.639> and<00:03:14.120> start

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
we're going to go ahead and start

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.089 
we're going to go ahead and start
building<00:03:14.719> it<00:03:15.019> I'm<00:03:15.139> going<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.290> show<00:03:15.409> you<00:03:15.469> as<00:03:15.799> I

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
building it I'm going to show you as I

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.520 
building it I'm going to show you as I
do<00:03:16.159> the<00:03:16.370> brakes<00:03:16.669> if<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.629> actually<00:03:18.109> is<00:03:18.229> bigger

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
do the brakes if it actually is bigger

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.719 
do the brakes if it actually is bigger
I'm<00:03:18.829> going<00:03:18.979> to<00:03:19.069> pick<00:03:19.250> those<00:03:19.430> up

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729 
I'm going to pick those up

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.729 
I'm going to pick those up
we'll<00:03:20.209> pull<00:03:20.419> these<00:03:20.569> off<00:03:20.629> and<00:03:21.109> see<00:03:21.319> we've<00:03:21.500> got

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
we'll pull these off and see we've got

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.830 
we'll pull these off and see we've got
we'll<00:03:22.549> pull<00:03:22.729> out<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.909> dash<00:03:23.120> cluster<00:03:23.449> I'm

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840

what<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.489> look<00:03:43.669> for<00:03:43.970> what<00:03:44.540> transmissions

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
what you look for what transmissions

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.449 
what you look for what transmissions
work<00:03:45.500> which<00:03:45.769> ones<00:03:45.979> don't

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459

here<00:03:49.299> I'm<00:03:50.299> pretty<00:03:50.780> much<00:03:50.959> streamlined<00:03:51.530> this

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
here I'm pretty much streamlined this

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.899 
here I'm pretty much streamlined this

taking<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:00.949> front<00:04:01.099> clip<00:04:01.340> off<00:04:01.959> I'm<00:04:02.959> not<00:04:03.019> going

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
taking the front clip off I'm not going

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.210 
taking the front clip off I'm not going
to<00:04:03.290> show<00:04:03.349> you<00:04:03.439> how<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.590> take<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.799> front<00:04:03.949> clip

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
to show you how to take the front clip

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.219 
to show you how to take the front clip
off<00:04:04.400> it's<00:04:04.669> pretty<00:04:04.849> easy<00:04:05.000> do<00:04:05.359> you<00:04:05.569> need<00:04:06.109> help

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
off it's pretty easy do you need help

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:07.270 
off it's pretty easy do you need help
with<00:04:06.409> that<00:04:06.470> you<00:04:06.620> probably<00:04:06.919> shouldn't<00:04:07.189> be

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
with that you probably shouldn't be

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.979 
with that you probably shouldn't be
doing<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.579> swap<00:04:07.759> so<00:04:08.540> we're<00:04:08.689> just<00:04:08.720> going<00:04:08.930> to

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
doing the swap so we're just going to

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.719 
doing the swap so we're just going to
concentrate<00:04:09.229> it<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.680> swap<00:04:09.979> the<00:04:10.340> parts<00:04:10.639> you

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
concentrate it on the swap the parts you

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.699 
concentrate it on the swap the parts you
need<00:04:10.909> what<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.329> got<00:04:11.449> to<00:04:11.540> look<00:04:11.659> for<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.169> go

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
need what you got to look for and go

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.879 
need what you got to look for and go
from<00:04:12.889> there<00:04:13.069> so<00:04:13.489> this<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.329> part<00:04:14.540> one<00:04:14.859> got<00:04:15.859> the

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
from there so this is part one got the

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.449 
from there so this is part one got the
motor<00:04:16.250> got<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.389> car<00:04:17.859> got<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.949> wiring<00:04:19.099> harness

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
motor got the car got the wiring harness

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.899 
motor got the car got the wiring harness
got<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.090> computer<00:04:20.359> so<00:04:21.289> next<00:04:21.529> up<00:04:21.769> part<00:04:22.729> two

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
got the computer so next up part two

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.760 
got the computer so next up part two
we're<00:04:23.120> going<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.270> be<00:04:23.360> getting<00:04:23.659> the<00:04:23.750> brakes<00:04:23.990> we

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
we're going to be getting the brakes we

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.660 
we're going to be getting the brakes we
got<00:04:24.889> to<00:04:24.950> work<00:04:25.039> on<00:04:25.190> transmission<00:04:25.880> probably

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
got to work on transmission probably

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.210 
got to work on transmission probably
the<00:04:26.970> lightened<00:04:27.270> flywheel<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.620> probably

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
the lightened flywheel and a probably

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.990 
the lightened flywheel and a probably
stage<00:04:29.520> 3<00:04:29.910> stage<00:04:29.970> 4<00:04:30.540> clutch<00:04:31.820> we're<00:04:32.820> going<00:04:32.940> to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
stage 3 stage 4 clutch we're going to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.490 
stage 3 stage 4 clutch we're going to
start<00:04:33.180> bouncing<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:33.960> what<00:04:34.140> we're<00:04:34.260> going<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.410> do

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
start bouncing in what we're going to do

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.430 
start bouncing in what we're going to do
on<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.740> turbo<00:04:35.100> on<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.340> what<00:04:35.550> we<00:04:35.670> need<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.060> do

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
on the turbo on it what we need to do

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.070 
on the turbo on it what we need to do
and<00:04:37.440> also<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.310> dash<00:04:38.580> cluster<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.990> know<00:04:40.050> a

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
and also the dash cluster you know a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.840 
and also the dash cluster you know a
gauge<00:04:40.470> cluster<00:04:40.920> is<00:04:40.980> pretty<00:04:41.400> important

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
gauge cluster is pretty important

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.940 
gauge cluster is pretty important
apparently<00:04:42.210> if<00:04:42.300> it's<00:04:42.390> a<00:04:42.450> IMO<00:04:42.780> 3<00:04:43.290> you<00:04:43.680> can<00:04:43.800> have
