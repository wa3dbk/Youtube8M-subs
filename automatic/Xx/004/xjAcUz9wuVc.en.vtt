00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.080
 is 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:54.370
 beauty now to put in manual mode 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:59.590
 you exit the vehicle to deactivate and 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:04.990
 enters the new vehicle then you press 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.630
 now keys and look I change already changes 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.440
 appears number 11 that is engaged with 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.440
 bottom gear 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.100
 in her is the first march always walk 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.980
 in first gear 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.340
 the first shift key you will use the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.959
 shift keys and the alt key on the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.810
 left and the keyboard the two shift goes 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.950
 slow down here in england 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:40.420
 disappears, it 's late there he tries 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.510
 Here the defendant but is still adding that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.800
 I think it's because of the slingshot and 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.420
 The first one here is the alt key and 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.170
 bottom gear 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.700
 It's only the 1st speed you'll keep 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.710
 constant to always 20 and 30 kilometers 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.080
 OK 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.030
 damn motor seems to increase more 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.460
 always maintains the same speed and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.810
 This is cool in this delusion you want 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:13.770
 keep a constant speed then ok 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.670
 if you press out again it engages the 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.670
 second gear 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.439
 then the 3rd clause so I do not 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.230
 mistake 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:30.340
 male marten fifth 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.340
 is and the maximum is here that although in q1 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.610
 The wind if you leave on the fifth it goes 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.920
 Quitting too slow comes not going fast 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.360
 If it were true then press shift to 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:48.810
 reduce money background 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.350
 the third can 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.980
 it's the fifth 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.980
 just left the thigh 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:09.439
 It's the look I did wrong and I think 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:17.660
 that has the right pace and then one again 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:20.090
 here and it increases from 1 to 0 a third 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.730
 Such a macho man. 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.070
 until you have to wait 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.220
 when there will increase the maximum 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.220
 velocity 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:36.390
 I waited then I guess damaschun night 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.390
 that complied with the same automatic 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.810
 not a catch 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.920

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.950
 limit is one 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.950

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.550
 fourth 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.910

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.910
 home here 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.660
 it's a challenge to the good track 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.190
 That's it people who wants to play a game. 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.430

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:14.120
