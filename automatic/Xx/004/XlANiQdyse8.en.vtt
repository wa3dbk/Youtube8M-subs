 Hello g1 friends, the tip I bring to you today is related to 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.730
 subject extremely present in the second phase of the vestibular exams 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.960
 formerly geography was a science that took care of several aspects of nature 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.220
 and often dealt with vegetation 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.410
 nowadays the geography has a proper concept to deal with vegetation 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.319
 which is the concept that will show this class today 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.319
 a concept is called dead deadly domains the idea of ​​dead domains 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.249
 to create a concept that synthesizes 

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:35.540
 vegetation to other elements of nature 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.960
 it is therefore considered a synthesis concept insofar as it integrates reiner 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.700
 climate vegetation in soil 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.460
 and considers the interactions in crisis these elements from the point of view of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.309
 geography what matters is that dead deadly domains the subject 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.690
 of the interaction between these factors 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 for example altitude relief features can affect the climate 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.570
 and changes in the climate affect the vegetation and consequently the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.810
 then this idea that there is a 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.950
 between these natural elements 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.840
 is what comes in terms and concepts and from the least to the highest 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.760
 practically every year in the second phase we have at least one question 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.180
 about this topic 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.110
 exploring these elements that the vestibulando must know for the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.250
 main 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.549
 Brazilian climate domains 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.780
 and combining the characteristics of the domain with human use and occupation and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.909
 with any environmental problems arising from such occupation 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.500
 so I've done it here review it's important that we remember the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.350
 domains are often divided into three domains 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.579
 arboreal 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.510
 those structured in extracts high on trees 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.960
 the cost - below the land where shrubs and undergrowth predominate 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.780
 in the domains you approach we have three major big names in the woods 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.830
 atlantic 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.350
 in the southeast region uplands 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.350
 in protest began near the Great Northern River region 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.450
 and there is Masonic in the northern portion of the country and the forest of araucarias killed it 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.470
 very homogeneous Brazilian subtropical forest that already makes the transition 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.989
 with climates to the south 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.199
 of neighboring countries with Brazil 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.780
 and we also have the three main airbus domains of the types that are 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.189
 the party planters mainly dominate the cerrado that occupies 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.959
 The central portion of Brazil 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.200
 the domination of the caatinga in the northeastern interior characterized by drought 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.929
 extreme 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:35.939
 and the dominion of the pampas in the extreme south in the great region that this is for Brazil 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.010
 and uruguay 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.249
 we have already constituted a plain 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.269
 is practically uninterrupted that it goes towards people 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:47.369
 then the main players of the same climatic type 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:52.889
 david also add the study of some natural phenomena that 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.919
 are bound to vegetation but are not linked to a specific domain 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:01.329
 for example remember Diego if this but as mendes restingas rocky shores 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.340
 in other types of intervention 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.960
 is natural of natural phenomena that will result in plant formations 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.409
 This was my tip for you. Thank you.
