00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
actually so I thought that's pretty cool

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.120 
actually so I thought that's pretty cool
I<00:01:10.979> made<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.530> don't<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.650> how<00:01:13.860> well

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I made that up I don't know how well

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.749 
I made that up I don't know how well
hold<00:01:14.520> though<00:01:15.650> but<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> holds<00:01:16.920> decently<00:01:17.580> enough

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
hold though but it holds decently enough

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.410 
hold though but it holds decently enough
so<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.310> also<00:01:20.460> gave<00:01:20.790> him<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> little

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
really hard to make cutting out this

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.990 
really hard to make cutting out this
face<00:02:23.870> decal<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.620> eye<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.370> then<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.790> mouth
