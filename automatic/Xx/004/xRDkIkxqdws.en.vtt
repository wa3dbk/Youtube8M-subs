develop a few machines and here's a

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.599 
develop a few machines and here's a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
racket power machine which is there to

racket power machine which is there to
mimic<00:00:28.000> always<00:00:28.710> worked<00:00:29.710> at<00:00:30.340> how<00:00:30.699> he<00:00:30.760> wanted<00:00:31.210> now

mimic always worked at how he wanted now
why<00:00:32.529> would<00:00:32.800> we<00:00:32.829> even<00:00:33.039> want<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.609> machine<00:00:33.940> like

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
why would we even want a machine like

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.630 
why would we even want a machine like
this<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:35.440> of<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.829> way<00:00:35.949> in<00:00:36.069> which<00:00:36.100> tennis

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
this because of the way in which tennis

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.549 
this because of the way in which tennis
racket<00:00:36.969> technology<00:00:37.449> is<00:00:37.539> changing<00:00:38.019> for<00:00:38.289> many

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
racket technology is changing for many

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.239 
racket technology is changing for many
many<00:00:38.800> years

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:39.249 
many years

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:41.040 
many years
all<00:00:39.519> rackets<00:00:40.059> were<00:00:40.179> the<00:00:40.269> same<00:00:40.479> size<00:00:40.749> they<00:00:40.989> were

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
all rackets were the same size they were

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.919 
all rackets were the same size they were
27<00:00:41.620> inches<00:00:42.010> long<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.489> 9<00:00:42.670> inches<00:00:43.030> wide<00:00:43.089> but

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
27 inches long and 9 inches wide but

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.809 
27 inches long and 9 inches wide but
when<00:00:44.079> how<00:00:44.350> I've<00:00:44.530> had<00:00:44.769> found<00:00:45.370> that<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:45.670> could

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
when how I've had found that you could

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:47.610 
when how I've had found that you could
make<00:00:46.059> ruckus<00:00:46.479> out<00:00:46.629> of<00:00:46.780> different<00:00:47.139> materials

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
make ruckus out of different materials

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.520 
make ruckus out of different materials
that<00:00:47.679> were<00:00:47.949> bigger<00:00:48.460> longer<00:00:49.149> wider<00:00:49.420> than<00:00:50.229> the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
that were bigger longer wider than the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.069 
that were bigger longer wider than the
old<00:00:50.649> wooden<00:00:50.889> rackets<00:00:51.399> then<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:52.179> ITF<00:00:52.600> decided

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
old wooden rackets then the ITF decided

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.449 
old wooden rackets then the ITF decided
that<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:53.350> better<00:00:53.679> write<00:00:53.949> some<00:00:54.190> rules<00:00:54.399> for

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:54.459 
that it better write some rules for

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:56.969 
that it better write some rules for
tennis<00:00:54.789> rackets<00:00:55.089> so<00:00:55.809> we've<00:00:55.959> got<00:00:56.109> a<00:00:56.350> rule<00:00:56.679> for

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
tennis rackets so we've got a rule for

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.770 
tennis rackets so we've got a rule for
the<00:00:57.010> rackets<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.729> then<00:00:58.209> sometimes<00:00:58.600> other

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
the rackets and then sometimes other

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.079 
the rackets and then sometimes other
things<00:00:58.839> come<00:00:59.350> up<00:00:59.469> like<00:00:59.949> like<00:01:00.280> spin<00:01:00.639> for

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
things come up like like spin for

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.809 
things come up like like spin for
instance<00:01:01.449> so<00:01:02.079> what<00:01:03.039> expense<00:01:03.369> we<00:01:03.489> got<00:01:03.639> for<00:01:03.789> that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
instance so what expense we got for that

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.450 
instance so what expense we got for that
once<00:01:04.449> you<00:01:04.629> found<00:01:04.809> out<00:01:05.080> how<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.710> ball<00:01:06.040> comes

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
once you found out how the ball comes

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.490 
once you found out how the ball comes
off<00:01:06.730> the<00:01:07.000> rack<00:01:07.150> in<00:01:07.300> terms<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.660> speed<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.350> need

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
off the rack in terms of speed you need

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.540 
off the rack in terms of speed you need
to<00:01:08.590> know<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.830> amount<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.160> spin<00:01:09.430> that's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
to know the amount of spin that's

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.730 
to know the amount of spin that's
generated<00:01:10.180> as<00:01:10.300> well<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:11.080> device<00:01:11.410> here

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
generated as well and this device here

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.880 
generated as well and this device here
allows<00:01:12.460> us<00:01:12.730> to<00:01:12.940> quantify<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:14.170> amount<00:01:14.470> of<00:01:14.590> spin

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
allows us to quantify the amount of spin

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.200 
allows us to quantify the amount of spin
that<00:01:15.130> different<00:01:15.490> racket<00:01:15.760> and<00:01:15.970> string

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
that different racket and string

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.390 
that different racket and string
combinations<00:01:16.810> can<00:01:17.020> generate<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:18.190> we've<00:01:18.310> got

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
combinations can generate so we've got

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.640 
combinations can generate so we've got
spin<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:20.080> next

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
spin what next

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.980 
spin what next
well<00:01:21.040> then<00:01:21.310> we<00:01:21.520> need<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.850> know<00:01:21.880> how<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:22.480> spin

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
well then we need to know how that spin

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.120 
well then we need to know how that spin
affects<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.440> flight<00:01:23.620> of<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.800> ball<00:01:23.920> through

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
affects the flight of the ball through

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.380 
affects the flight of the ball through
the<00:01:24.190> air<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:24.910> means<00:01:25.090> we<00:01:25.150> go<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.300> the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
the air so that means we go to the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.860 
the air so that means we go to the
window

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
window

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.399 
window
indeed<00:01:26.440> they<00:01:26.860> don't<00:01:27.010> lead<00:01:27.430> on

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.550 

Wow<00:01:32.249> I<00:01:32.640> forgot<00:01:33.240> how<00:01:33.420> beautiful<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:34.200> thing<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
Wow I forgot how beautiful this thing is

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
Wow I forgot how beautiful this thing is
it's<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> space<00:01:35.369> shuttle<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.819> a<00:01:35.880> rocket<00:01:36.240> or

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's like a space shuttle or a rocket or

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.380 
it's like a space shuttle or a rocket or
something<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.859> we<00:01:38.009> open<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.640> working

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
something so if we open up the working

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.399 
something so if we open up the working
section<00:01:39.899> here<00:01:40.789> right<00:01:41.789> so<00:01:41.819> we've<00:01:42.060> got<00:01:42.090> our<00:01:42.409> ball

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
section here right so we've got our ball

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.639 
section here right so we've got our ball
on<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:43.950> axle<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.380> while

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
on a little axle here so it's a while

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.319 
on a little axle here so it's a while
since<00:01:46.979> I've<00:01:47.159> looked<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.609> can<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.000> remind

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
since I've looked at this can you remind

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.419 
since I've looked at this can you remind
me<00:01:48.569> of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.840> specifications<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.039> winter

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
me of the specifications of this winter

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.149 
me of the specifications of this winter
it<00:01:50.880> simulates<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.899> aerodynamic<00:01:52.590> effects<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it simulates the aerodynamic effects and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.319 
it simulates the aerodynamic effects and
measures<00:01:53.520> those<00:01:53.700> aerodynamic

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
measures those aerodynamic

to 160 miles per hour which is just a
little<00:01:59.640> bit<00:01:59.789> faster<00:01:59.969> than<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> fastest<00:02:00.869> serve

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
little bit faster than the fastest serve

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.649 
little bit faster than the fastest serve
that's<00:02:01.289> ever<00:02:01.469> been<00:02:01.649> recorded<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.909> also<00:02:03.209> allows

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that's ever been recorded it also allows

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.139 
that's ever been recorded it also allows
us<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:04.020> spin<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.619> ball<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:05.429> speeds<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
us to spin the ball at speeds of up to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.969 
us to spin the ball at speeds of up to
six<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> half<00:02:07.020> thousand<00:02:07.379> revolutions<00:02:07.530> per

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
six and a half thousand revolutions per

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.979 
six and a half thousand revolutions per
minute<00:02:08.129> which<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.329> a<00:02:09.390> bit<00:02:09.539> faster<00:02:09.750> than

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
minute which is just a bit faster than

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.569 
minute which is just a bit faster than
the<00:02:10.079> fastest<00:02:10.530> spin<00:02:10.829> rate<00:02:11.009> that's<00:02:11.280> ever<00:02:11.400> been

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
the fastest spin rate that's ever been

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.729 
the fastest spin rate that's ever been
recorded<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.750> means<00:02:13.019> with<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.379> device

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
recorded so that means with this device

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.039 
recorded so that means with this device
we<00:02:14.280> can<00:02:14.430> simulate<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:15.239> about<00:02:15.390> any<00:02:15.660> tennis

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
we can simulate just about any tennis

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.800 
we can simulate just about any tennis
shot<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.620> generated<00:02:17.209> now<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.269> spin

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
shot that can be generated now the spin

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.069 
shot that can be generated now the spin
rate<00:02:18.989> has<00:02:19.200> gone<00:02:19.349> up<00:02:19.410> since<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.250> first

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
rate has gone up since we first

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.539 
rate has gone up since we first
developed<00:02:22.079> this<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.829> that's<00:02:23.010> changed<00:02:23.310> what

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
developed this so that's changed what

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.430 
developed this so that's changed what
what<00:02:23.700> other<00:02:23.879> things<00:02:24.209> might<00:02:24.359> change<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.079> tennis

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
what other things might change in tennis

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.410 
what other things might change in tennis
well<00:02:26.129> really<00:02:26.400> we're<00:02:26.670> not<00:02:26.700> sure<00:02:27.060> because

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
well really we're not sure because

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.180 
well really we're not sure because
that's<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.200> some<00:02:28.590> ways<00:02:28.769> up<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.099> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
that's in some ways up to the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.490 
that's in some ways up to the
manufacturers<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.450> what<00:02:30.629> we<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:31.079> do<00:02:31.230> through

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
manufacturers but what we can do through

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.949 
manufacturers but what we can do through
these<00:02:31.620> experiments<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.579> assess<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.480> effects

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
these experiments is assess the effects

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.750 
these experiments is assess the effects
of<00:02:34.049> those<00:02:34.230> changes<00:02:34.859> and<00:02:35.190> when<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.400> put<00:02:35.609> them

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
of those changes and when we put them

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.509 
of those changes and when we put them
together<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.209> tennis<00:02:36.540> gut<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.319> allows<00:02:37.650> us<00:02:38.340> to

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
together in tennis gut that allows us to

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.949 
together in tennis gut that allows us to
predict<00:02:38.910> what<00:02:39.209> might<00:02:39.420> happen<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> future

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959
