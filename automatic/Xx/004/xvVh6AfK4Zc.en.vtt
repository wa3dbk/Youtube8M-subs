00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.050
 we went to the presentation of the reptiles 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.029
 of the third generation of the porsche 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.189
 cayenne the center ports puerto banÃºs 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.020
 there they weakened us with an exquisite 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.939
 cocktail and various 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.110
 alternative activities for all 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.110
 members of the old 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.950
 in the forest well went out to the market in the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.010
 year 2002 and it was a revolutionary car 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.020
 the desire of every car lover in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
 those years had few competitors the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.690
 bmw x5 the mercedes class m the volvo xc90 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.699
 the range rover now there are many models 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.430
 more but the cayenne continues to stand out 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.010
 especially because of his driving 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.320
 it's practically a 911 high race 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.180
 in the year 2007 the second one was presented 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.159
 more stylized street version 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.049
 efficient and above all you could write 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.070
 the first version with diesel engine 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.070
 the history of porsche 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.899
 and in 2010 the third one started selling 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.090
 generation with aesthetic changes 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.969
 important efficiently improved 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.560
 both in weight and in consumption are also 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.570
 presented a hybrid version a bit 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.310
 light since in this case the duration of 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.789
 the battery in electric was barely 2 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.789
 km 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.430
 and now the ready line of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.140
 this third generation that has been 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.580
 made aesthetic changes in both the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.580
 front as in the back 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.840
 how 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.200
 one 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.459
 no no 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 how 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.590
 the variations in the front do not 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.930
 they are only in the optics but also in 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.640
 he is for this art only one opened 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.480
 small part of it and now it opens 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.310
 until the lighthouse this makes you have a 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.350
 more stylized and pointed line the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.770
 bumper also changes now is more 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.810
 similar to the one in the part 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.350
 rear changes its optics and also the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.350
 bumper 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.350
 in the interior there is only one change 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.140
 highlight the steering wheel uses the same as 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:06.890
 the marking and also expands on 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.570
 equipment options after the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.060
 presentation we get anxiety 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.240
 proof of this successful almost 5 meters 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.240
 in length 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.960
 Now more attractive if possible 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.120
 because we were able to try the diesel cayenne 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.450
 a car with a 3.0 cylinder 6- cylinder engine 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.640
 that generates a power of 262 horses 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.160
 accelerating hold has 7 builds 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.530
 seconds with a combined consumption of 7 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.530
 with two liters each meter tests with 9 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.530
 kilometer 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.090
 is impressive and how it responds to 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.090
 edition 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.010
 although comparing it with the pagan is a 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.140
 little easier because this is more 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.000
 big and it weighs more but it has those 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.390
 centimeters from the back and in the 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.390
 trunk 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.440
 the interior is still wide and 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.479
 elegant the change of the steering wheel has been 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:47.080
 successful although perhaps insufficient for 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:48.850
 a restyling of more than three years other than 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.639
 the important news that brings in the 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.500
 plug-in hybrid model this mounts the 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.330
 same engine as the Panamanian and the 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.770
 benefits are a tad worse because 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.770
 to the weight and height of the vehicle 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.910
 with the full article of our website 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.910
 dot com 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:38.750
 of 670 liters that is extended to the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.750
 1700 killed doing 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.970
 it retreats from the volcano and improves its 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.970
 predecessor both in design and in 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.520
 efficiency the changes have been 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.200
 accepted and if your sale does not increase 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.890
 that is because of his little brother 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.890
 the cow 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.020
 and remember the caution on the road 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:28.449
 is a fundamental part of his life and of 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.449
 of others leads with care
