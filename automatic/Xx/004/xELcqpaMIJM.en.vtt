to<00:01:18.880> stay<00:01:19.270> spread<00:01:19.600> out<00:01:19.899> just<00:01:20.259> like<00:01:20.350> with<00:01:20.560> the

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
to stay spread out just like with the

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.350 
to stay spread out just like with the
first<00:01:20.860> ability<00:01:21.340> this<00:01:21.850> will<00:01:22.000> reduce<00:01:22.149> the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
first ability this will reduce the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.090 
first ability this will reduce the

beneath another group member the third
ability<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:27.189> he<00:01:27.340> does<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:28.030> set<00:01:28.360> of

ability that he does is a set of

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.880 
ability that he does is a set of
missiles<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:28.899> he<00:01:29.049> shoots<00:01:29.289> in<00:01:29.469> a<00:01:29.560> straight

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890
