00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 that all of these people are in a 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.299
 new tutorial this time we are in 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.460
 tutorial on how to use the number 4 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.370
 of playstation 4 control in the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.019
 playstation 3 and good these times of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.690
 wireless way since launch 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.960
 of the playstation 4 console you could already 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.730
 use this control but you needed 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.189
 be connected all the time to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.710
 precision 3 for the usb cable that we 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.849
 it came with the console and well now 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.320
 with the latest update of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.960
 Playstation 3 is possible to play 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 wirelessly with this control and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 good one of the disadvantages that has 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.270
 before progressing with this is that no 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.950
 you can use the de jong button on 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.960
 playstation to get this menu 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.390
 when you are inside a game and good 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.890
 so I think it's the only 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.750
 disadvantage today too that you can not 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.210
 vibrate the control just like when 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.579
 is connected but good for me 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 does something not be a good edition for 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.030
 precise between I really like this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.000
 control is much more comfortable than the one that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.520
 the 83 but good to record this 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.199
 control is in the console that we can 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.970
 use it wirelessly we have to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.190
 go to options 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.790
 some accessories options we give 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.400
 x and now we're going here in this 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.630
 manage bluetooth devices if it's 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.810
 who has it in Spanish I think so 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.980
 call and well we give it here and it says that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.020
 there are no bluetooth devices 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.990
 registered in the beginning / is that if 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.240
 we want to register one we give yes and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.600
 well there when before we give 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.000
 in x I want to explain to you that when 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.680
 start scanning the principle in three 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 we have to leave kept in it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.590
 Precision control 4 share button 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.970
 and the play station button the home button 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.880
 that is these two buttons we leave them 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.250
 pressed when it starts to register 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.680
 the console just when we see x was going to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.800
 start to flicker the light a bit more 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.940
 how it flashed and when it finishes 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.590
 blinking like that is already going to be 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.890
 registered the command and will tell us here 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.420
 in the console good I'm going to give 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.640
 just as I give it I will leave kept 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.149
 the two buttons button share and home 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.540
 if we got pressed ok and started to 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.640
 blink like a flash in the light of 84 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.160
 he already tells me that he registered it wireless 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.750
 controller I give x with the button 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.230
 prison 3 because it is also very good 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.570
 registered is already saving the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.910
 configurations and all that is already 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.240
 registration completed now no longer what 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.640
 detected there is there is in show the 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.780
 console and right now I'm 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.650
 using the control of playstation 4 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.739
 wirelessly 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.200
 ok but good as I told you the only ones 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.569
 disadvantages because that does not vibrate the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.010
 control games and whatnot so 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.629
 then I did not feel a little strange the war 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.750
 call of duty or this kind of game like 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.879
 races and things like that but well I think that 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.970
 that is the biggest disadvantage but in 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.470
 yes the control is very comfortable so if 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.510
 they like the control quoted and still 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.280
 they want to continue with their playstation 3 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.220
 already have a chance to play with him 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.670
 so well then if you have any doubt 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.900
 if it did not work for you, I'm going to 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.090
 help you if you leave me a comment here 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.530
 down saying your problem and all this and 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.319
 well let's see if we can 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.629
 fix it and well I hope that you 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.950
 have liked to give favorites things 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.690
 subscribe without including that is in the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.690
 description and good bye
