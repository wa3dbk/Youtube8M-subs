couldn't leave you behind the Boxster
which<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.710> best<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.060> different

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
which is the best it's a different

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.270 
which is the best it's a different
calling<00:03:57.050> I<00:03:57.230> don't<00:03:57.350> think<00:03:57.620> there<00:03:57.770> is<00:03:57.800> a<00:03:57.890> best<00:03:58.130> I

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
calling I don't think there is a best I

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.350 
calling I don't think there is a best I
mean<00:03:58.310> there's<00:03:58.520> certain<00:03:58.760> bits<00:03:59.030> I<00:03:59.090> like<00:03:59.210> about

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
mean there's certain bits I like about

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.940 
mean there's certain bits I like about
both<00:03:59.690> cars<00:03:59.960> I<00:04:00.080> like<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.320> gearbox<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.830> this

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
both cars I like the gearbox and this

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.980 
both cars I like the gearbox and this
sit<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.310> six-speed<00:04:01.760> was<00:04:01.970> much<00:04:02.600> smoother

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
sit the six-speed was much smoother

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.080 
sit the six-speed was much smoother
James<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.710> think<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:04.010> engine<00:04:04.160> feels<00:04:04.640> stronger

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
James I think the engine feels stronger

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.460 
James I think the engine feels stronger
on<00:04:05.210> this<00:04:05.330> but<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.600> don't<00:04:05.660> think<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:05.990> is<00:04:06.020> then

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
on this but I don't think it is then

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.930 
on this but I don't think it is then
your<00:04:06.650> brakes<00:04:06.890> started<00:04:07.280> running<00:04:07.520> out<00:04:07.640> yeah

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
your brakes started running out yeah

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.340 
your brakes started running out yeah
that<00:04:08.150> was<00:04:08.270> me<00:04:08.480> trying<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.840> get<00:04:08.960> away<00:04:09.020> from<00:04:09.110> you

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
that was me trying to get away from you

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.860 
that was me trying to get away from you
I<00:04:09.380> think<00:04:09.650> but<00:04:09.860> we're<00:04:10.820> not<00:04:10.970> drove<00:04:11.210> the<00:04:11.360> Boxster

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
I think but we're not drove the Boxster

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.900 
I think but we're not drove the Boxster
I'll<00:04:12.350> prefer<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.830> handling<00:04:13.220> it's<00:04:13.400> nicer<00:04:13.850> on

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
I'll prefer the handling it's nicer on

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.280 
I'll prefer the handling it's nicer on
the<00:04:13.970> Liberty<00:04:14.390> it's<00:04:14.510> easier<00:04:14.960> in<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.140> quick

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
the Liberty it's easier in the quick

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.690 
the Liberty it's easier in the quick
course<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:15.680> this<00:04:15.800> can<00:04:16.010> be<00:04:16.040> a<00:04:16.130> bit<00:04:16.310> edgy<00:04:16.459> at

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
course but this can be a bit edgy at

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.890 
course but this can be a bit edgy at
speed<00:04:16.940> corners<00:04:17.330> I've<00:04:17.450> just<00:04:17.630> sitting<00:04:17.870> there
