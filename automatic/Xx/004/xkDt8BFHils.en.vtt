00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.510
 Russian city in maynkrafte Well 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.570
 today's update will be about 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.970
 the power station is small and I'm also here 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 I'll see the population of the city here first 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.859
 the phenomenon is that I increased the population 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.529
 cities up to 375 people 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.309
 But if the ball for such from the five-story building 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.870
 gaga series and it seems to be that very 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 say i replaced here by the way yet 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.760
 textures but rather a picture of textures 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.739
 changed the pictures now so here we are 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.690
 crosswalk fun turns out well 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.219
 I don't know, I like it, and I think 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.730
 I will share the resource pack with 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.649
 card 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.140
 and the card will be in the fifth issue, remember 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.610
 once and for all that's reached us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.379
 crosswalks can of course still 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.930
 put different signs whether five more 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.270
 pictures and type of Terek and all that but it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.710
 there will be a pointer to the skull later 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 let's see these residential building by the way yet 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.470
 make there a playground here that is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.090
 Five-story building showed in the first issue 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 here are two tick just here apple Tim show 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.130
 how are we all arranged here back 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.070
 standard will be a Russian courtyard 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 somehow do here that we gain 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 all here is the turn of things from us and here we are 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
 5 floor some distance between them and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.759
 Here is the playground itself 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.409
 a small turned out that's what we have 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.540
 there are benches where parents can 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.420
 sit there don't know with a look out 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.670
 with your children now have such a swing and 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.090
 month like a little sandbox by me 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.119
 In principle, the whole site is yes here 0 times 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.439
 Now let's see our power station 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.970
 your vodka speak a bunch of scroll very 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.320
 big but for such a city where 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.710
 400 people live in general 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.090
 power plants need usually fit 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.320
 here is electricity from other cities 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.900
 but in principle built his own 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.080
 before this city the Kraków hail skeletons 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.690
 Well, so will our powerhouse here us 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.520
 There are types of insulator or how these 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.280
 here things are called types not lykov 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.869
 roofs so I will say minelab like this 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.869
 are they here but after the wire go and 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.140

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.700
 as we have everything there is equipped here that is 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.830
 look for us here a huge generator 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.310
 Now there was to stand still and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:27.400
 we put the lever for a change like this 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.230
 so this generator is different 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.900
 city ​​control buttons 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.820
 let's say we are different for a cup too 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.070
