00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:29.340
 extreme is panic and the sport begins 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.530
 with two bored police officers 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.940
 by a funkspruch on a car 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.940
 to be made aware 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.180
 is rotated with original 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.550
 police cars and a motorcycle 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.830
 The police will be as well as the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.150
 other people who appear in the spot 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.150
 represented by actors 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.210
 we are still in good shape in the schedule 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.390
 the night before some scenes in the 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:12.510
 bring box but finds itself very well 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:13.890
 very constructive conference 19 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.870
 But then the book happens 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.760
 calculable despite good 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.690
 weather forecasts are more violent 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.060
 snowfall 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.040
 the whole crew and even the producer 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.610
 grab the scoop and broom around the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.080
 road ready for the stand 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.420
 is decided in spite of the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.380
 precarious road conditions further 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.380
 to turn almost scenes 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.980
 masalskis on the street 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.789
 he is missing the viewer that the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.800
 chase at the end on one 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.319
 misunderstanding is based in the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.660
 police headquarters gives a policeman one 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.700
 colleague keywords to search on car 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:35.459
 Ricardo and does not realize that 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:37.049
 radio microphone while it is open it was a 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.580
 tough day but i think we have 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.230
 really great pictures captured 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.870
 I'm curious what I'm cutting 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.489
 it results because we have felt 40 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.810
 attitude turned and probably 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.549
 After that, maybe only in the cut 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.560
 20 I do not know because we only have 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.790
 30 seconds time 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.209

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.209

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.819
