instead<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.039> going<00:02:10.160> into<00:02:10.459> hardwood<00:02:10.970> and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
instead of just going into hardwood and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.810 
instead of just going into hardwood and
then<00:02:11.270> back<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.690> your<00:02:11.780> ears<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:13.489> really

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
then back to your ears and I really

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.100 
then back to your ears and I really
should<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.060> brought<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.450> speaker's<00:02:14.810> forward

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
should I brought the speaker's forward

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.420 
should I brought the speaker's forward
and<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.230> should<00:02:15.380> bring<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:15.709> forward<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.340> go

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and I should bring this forward and go

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.310 
and I should bring this forward and go
try<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.820> keep<00:02:20.030> them<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.570> main<00:02:20.780> reflection

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
try to keep them the main reflection

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.590 
try to keep them the main reflection
points<00:02:21.680> when<00:02:21.830> you're<00:02:21.950> sitting<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.299> think

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
points when you're sitting do you think

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.640 
points when you're sitting do you think
it<00:02:23.720> would<00:02:23.810> bounce<00:02:23.959> from<00:02:24.230> there<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.500> there

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
it would bounce from there to there

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.559 
it would bounce from there to there
probably<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.610> call<00:02:25.760> it

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.709 

and<00:02:31.469> it<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:32.090> killer<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.329> here

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
and it is killer in here

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.959 
and it is killer in here
so<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.829> one<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.099> sale<00:02:35.370> again<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.849> back

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
so this one on sale again this is back

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.300 
so this one on sale again this is back
to<00:02:36.090> 170<00:02:36.870> dollars<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.319> their<00:02:37.500> website<00:02:37.920> direct

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
which is roughly 60 but I probably got a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.449 
which is roughly 60 but I probably got a
topping<00:02:50.720> just<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.439> don't<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.430> no

no general reason to suggest one over

no general reason to suggest one over
the<00:02:56.159> other<00:02:56.189> and<00:02:56.519> then<00:02:58.189> of<00:02:59.189> course<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.609> best

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
the other and then of course the best

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.420 
the other and then of course the best
seat<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> house<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.659> I'd<00:03:00.750> love<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.430> get

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
seat in the house and I'd love to get

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.830 
seat in the house and I'd love to get
some<00:03:02.700> more<00:03:02.819> paint<00:03:03.060> cans<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.629> get<00:03:03.720> these

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
some more paint cans and get these

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.270 
some more paint cans and get these
really<00:03:04.139> high<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.439> but<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.739> high<00:03:05.010> as<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.220> can

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
really high up but this is high as I can

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.629 
really high up but this is high as I can
get<00:03:05.400> them<00:03:05.519> up<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:07.500> paint<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.189> stands

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
get them up on a the paint can stands

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.830 
get them up on a the paint can stands
that<00:03:08.909> I've<00:03:09.030> fashioned<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:11.389> the<00:03:12.389> base<00:03:12.599> isn't

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
that I've fashioned and the base isn't

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.449 
that I've fashioned and the base isn't
bad<00:03:13.079> it's<00:03:13.290> nice<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.739> neutral<00:03:13.980> here<00:03:14.159> so<00:03:14.189> when

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
bad it's nice and neutral here so when

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:21.740 
bad it's nice and neutral here so when
you<00:03:14.549> walk<00:03:19.340> here<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.700> then<00:03:20.909> that<00:03:21.090> base<00:03:21.329> comes

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
you walk here and then that base comes

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.699 
you walk here and then that base comes
and<00:03:22.049> just<00:03:22.139> fills<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.709> kitchen<00:03:23.099> up

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.729 

yes<00:03:28.400> let's<00:03:28.670> actually<00:03:29.060> demo<00:03:29.299> what<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.230> problem

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
yes let's actually demo what the problem

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:48.740 
yes let's actually demo what the problem
is<00:03:30.829> with<00:03:31.040> most<00:03:31.189> bees

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:57.610 

and<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:49.930> what<00:03:50.050> people<00:03:50.200> worry<00:03:50.470> about

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.080 

so<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.050> solid<00:04:01.560> wood<00:04:01.770> door<00:04:02.010> solid<00:04:02.730> fire

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
so it's a solid wood door solid fire

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.750 
so it's a solid wood door solid fire
door<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.660> still<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.550> right<00:04:05.550> through

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
door and it's still just right through

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.110 
door and it's still just right through
it<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:06.180> not<00:04:06.390> even<00:04:06.510> there<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:08.120> board

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
it like it's not even there the board

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.479 
it like it's not even there the board
guy<00:04:09.630> said<00:04:09.930> these<00:04:10.110> hot<00:04:10.319> walls<00:04:10.620> are<00:04:10.890> hollow<00:04:11.160> and

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
guy said these hot walls are hollow and

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.970 
guy said these hot walls are hollow and
they<00:04:11.819> are<00:04:11.910> plaster<00:04:12.569> which<00:04:13.110> usually<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.800> good

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
they are plaster which usually is good

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.090 
they are plaster which usually is good
for<00:04:14.190> sound<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:15.350> not<00:04:16.350> here<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.829> is<00:04:17.010> a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
for sound but not here and that is a

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.129 
for sound but not here and that is a
solid<00:04:17.519> concrete<00:04:17.760> wall<00:04:18.239> because<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.810> separates

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
solid concrete wall because it separates

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.500 
solid concrete wall because it separates
for<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.440> building's<00:04:19.799> tonight<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:21.150> he's<00:04:21.359> got

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
for the building's tonight so he's got

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.090 
for the building's tonight so he's got
quite<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.780> bit<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:21.989> an<00:04:22.109> acoustic<00:04:22.320> mess<00:04:22.740> in<00:04:22.950> here

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
quite a bit of an acoustic mess in here

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.330 
quite a bit of an acoustic mess in here
and<00:04:23.750> from<00:04:24.750> my<00:04:25.020> three<00:04:25.620> hours<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:26.040> dicking

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
and from my three hours of dicking

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.310 
and from my three hours of dicking
around<00:04:26.400> I've<00:04:26.820> managed<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.330> piece<00:04:28.110> together

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
around I've managed to piece together

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.820 
around I've managed to piece together
some<00:04:29.100> sort<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.340> semblance<00:04:29.580> of<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.830> reflection

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
some sort of semblance of a reflection

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.790 
some sort of semblance of a reflection
cutting<00:04:32.190> with<00:04:32.669> just<00:04:32.910> garbage<00:04:33.270> if<00:04:33.530> dug<00:04:34.530> out<00:04:34.680> of

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
cutting with just garbage if dug out of

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.190 
cutting with just garbage if dug out of
piles<00:04:35.040> so<00:04:35.430> there<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.210> go<00:04:36.360> that's<00:04:36.780> what<00:04:36.960> Zeos

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
piles so there you go that's what Zeos

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.110 
piles so there you go that's what Zeos
