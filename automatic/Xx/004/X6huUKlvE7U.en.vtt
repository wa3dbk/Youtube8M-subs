00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
reason why I'm doing this is actually

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.310 
reason why I'm doing this is actually
because<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.579> guys<00:01:54.049> messaged<00:01:55.049> me

as some of you guys might know I dated
someone<00:02:19.410> between<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.190> ages<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.550> 16<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.330> 19

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
someone between the ages of 16 and 19

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.229 
someone between the ages of 16 and 19
and<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:23.340> were<00:02:23.430> actually<00:02:23.550> best<00:02:24.090> friends

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
and we were actually best friends

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.839 
and we were actually best friends
between<00:02:25.190> before<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.310> actually<00:02:26.459> got<00:02:26.670> together

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
between before we actually got together

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.900 
between before we actually got together
so<00:02:27.330> when<00:02:28.170> we're<00:02:28.290> about<00:02:28.380> 12<00:02:28.709> 13<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:29.489> became<00:02:29.730> best

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
so when we're about 12 13 we became best

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.699 
so when we're about 12 13 we became best
friends<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.480> we<00:02:30.510> started<00:02:31.140> dating<00:02:31.290> when<00:02:31.650> we

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
friends and we started dating when we

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.550 
friends and we started dating when we
got<00:02:31.920> older<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:33.300> I'm<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.720> reason<00:02:33.870> why<00:02:34.290> we

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
got older so I'm the reason why we

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830 
got older so I'm the reason why we
actually<00:02:34.739> broke<00:02:35.190> up<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:35.730> related<00:02:36.600> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
actually broke up is related to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.300 
actually broke up is related to
something<00:02:37.200> else<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.709> guys<00:02:37.890> might<00:02:38.100> know

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
something else that you guys might know

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.720 
something else that you guys might know
which<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.910> um<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.510> I'll<00:02:39.600> had<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.989> leave<00:02:40.170> home

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
which is um that I'll had to leave home

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.780 
which is um that I'll had to leave home
so<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.150> thing<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.860> um<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.310> relationship

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
so the thing is um in a relationship

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.350 
so the thing is um in a relationship
things<00:02:45.300> change<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.170> lot<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.739> you'll<00:02:47.370> sort<00:02:48.239> of

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
things change a lot and you'll sort of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.390 
things change a lot and you'll sort of
realize<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.800> don't<00:02:49.830> really<00:02:50.100> know

after that but on that night was a big
eye-opener<00:03:55.319> for<00:03:56.280> me<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:57.150> he<00:03:57.959> literally<00:03:58.350> just

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
eye-opener for me and he literally just

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.860 
eye-opener for me and he literally just
like<00:03:58.769> took<00:03:59.010> my<00:03:59.190> heart<00:03:59.370> smashed<00:03:59.819> it<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.269> put<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
like took my heart smashed it and put it

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.690 
like took my heart smashed it and put it
back<00:04:01.049> in<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:02.100> know<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.220> lot<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.670> guys

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
back in and you know a lot of you guys

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.090 
back in and you know a lot of you guys
might<00:04:03.269> have<00:04:03.680> experienced<00:04:04.680> something<00:04:04.950> like

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
might have experienced something like

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.830 
might have experienced something like
that<00:04:05.400> because<00:04:05.609> you<00:04:05.940> know<00:04:05.970> when<00:04:06.450> you're<00:04:06.600> young

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
that because you know when you're young

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.759 
that because you know when you're young
and<00:04:07.049> when<00:04:07.200> you're<00:04:07.350> in<00:04:07.440> your<00:04:07.470> first

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
and when you're in your first

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.220 
and when you're in your first
relationship<00:04:08.269> that<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.480> what<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.840> feels<00:04:09.870> like

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
relationship that is what it feels like

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.870 
relationship that is what it feels like
because<00:04:10.620> you've<00:04:10.950> never<00:04:11.220> had<00:04:11.489> your<00:04:11.549> heart

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
because you've never had your heart

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.539 
because you've never had your heart
broken<00:04:11.970> before<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.870> just<00:04:13.139> feels<00:04:13.549> terrible

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
broken before and it just feels terrible

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.360 
broken before and it just feels terrible
so<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.660> wanted<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.440> share<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.799> with<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.190> guys

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so I wanted to share that with you guys

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.029 
so I wanted to share that with you guys
just<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.940> note<00:04:18.180> just<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:18.930> guys<00:04:19.169> could<00:04:19.709> sort

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
just to note just so you guys could sort

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.399 
just to note just so you guys could sort
of<00:04:20.130> understand<00:04:20.880> me<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.419> little<00:04:21.630> bit<00:04:21.900> better<00:04:22.080> and

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
of understand me a little bit better and

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.620 
of understand me a little bit better and
I<00:04:22.560> guess<00:04:22.770> maybe<00:04:23.070> because<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.849> can<00:04:24.030> relate<00:04:24.419> to

I guess maybe because you can relate to
this<00:04:24.750> story

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
I actually want to give I don't know I

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.120 
I actually want to give I don't know I
guess<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.780> little<00:04:29.050> bit<00:04:29.229> of<00:04:29.320> advice<00:04:29.680> as<00:04:30.100> well

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
guess a little bit of advice as well

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.330 
guess a little bit of advice as well
from<00:04:30.639> someone<00:04:31.090> who<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.600> older<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:32.290> mean<00:04:33.040> I<00:04:33.070> have

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
from someone who is older I mean I have

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.310 
from someone who is older I mean I have
been<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:33.669> long-term<00:04:34.300> relationships<00:04:34.660> after

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
been in long-term relationships after

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.719 
been in long-term relationships after
that<00:04:35.740> so<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.840> realize<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.680> lot<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:39.040> things<00:04:39.460> as

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
that so you realize a lot of things as

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.110 
that so you realize a lot of things as
you<00:04:40.180> get<00:04:40.479> older<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.169> one<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.280> these<00:04:42.490> things<00:04:42.820> is

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
you get older and one of these things is

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.900 
you get older and one of these things is
that<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.870> end<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.290> relationship<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:45.310> the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
that the end of a relationship and the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.480 
that the end of a relationship and the
feeling<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.870> get<00:04:47.229> when<00:04:47.470> your<00:04:47.949> heart<00:04:48.280> has

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
feeling that you get when your heart has

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.150 
feeling that you get when your heart has
been<00:04:48.760> smashed<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.690> not<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:50.380> end<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:50.919> you

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
been smashed is not the end and you

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.390 
been smashed is not the end and you
shouldn't<00:04:51.930> try<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.110> think<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.770> as<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.220> end

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
shouldn't try and think of it as the end

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.450 
shouldn't try and think of it as the end
as<00:04:54.699> well<00:04:55.030> because<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.780> know<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:56.560> lot<00:04:56.770> of<00:04:56.979> the

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
as well because I know a lot of the

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.909 
as well because I know a lot of the
times<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:58.330> can<00:04:58.510> feel<00:04:58.750> really<00:04:59.050> depressed<00:04:59.229> and

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
times you can feel really depressed and

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.090 
times you can feel really depressed and
you<00:05:00.370> might<00:05:00.580> feel<00:05:00.910> like<00:05:01.120> doing<00:05:01.780> something

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
you might feel like doing something

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.700 
you might feel like doing something
irrational<00:05:03.100> but<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.960> have<00:05:05.139> to<00:05:05.289> realize<00:05:05.470> that

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
irrational but you have to realize that

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.070 
irrational but you have to realize that
the<00:05:06.280> end<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.610> relationship<00:05:06.729> is<00:05:07.449> just<00:05:07.960> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
the end of a relationship is just the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.650 
the end of a relationship is just the
beginning<00:05:08.229> of<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.979> possible<00:05:09.520> new<00:05:10.120> one<00:05:10.360> and

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
beginning of a possible new one and

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.529 
beginning of a possible new one and
that's<00:05:10.900> a<00:05:11.080> really<00:05:11.710> great<00:05:12.010> thing<00:05:12.160> because<00:05:12.789> you

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
that's a really great thing because you

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.320 
that's a really great thing because you
learn<00:05:13.810> as<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:14.169> go<00:05:14.560> along<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:15.220> you<00:05:15.729> want<00:05:16.240> to

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
learn as you go along and you want to

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.650 
learn as you go along and you want to
take<00:05:16.600> on<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.590> things<00:05:17.860> that<00:05:18.070> you've<00:05:18.190> learnt

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
take on the things that you've learnt

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.480 
take on the things that you've learnt
the<00:05:19.660> mistakes<00:05:20.169> you've<00:05:20.470> made<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:21.039> mistakes

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
the mistakes you've made the mistakes

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.640 
the mistakes you've made the mistakes
that<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.880> other<00:05:22.030> person<00:05:22.270> is<00:05:22.539> made<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:23.020> you

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
that the other person is made and you

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.640 
that the other person is made and you
know<00:05:23.770> really<00:05:23.800> make<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:25.120> new<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.690> next<00:05:26.080> one<00:05:26.350> a

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
know really make the new the next one a

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.340 
know really make the new the next one a
better<00:05:27.310> one<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.789> it's<00:05:28.180> going<00:05:28.479> to<00:05:28.660> just<00:05:28.960> be

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
better one and it's going to just be

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.830 
better one and it's going to just be
better<00:05:29.590> in<00:05:29.860> general<00:05:29.889> as<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:30.580> learn<00:05:31.150> if<00:05:31.479> that

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
better in general as you learn if that

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.830 
better in general as you learn if that
makes<00:05:32.080> sense<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:33.729> other<00:05:33.940> thing<00:05:34.270> that<00:05:34.300> you

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
makes sense the other thing that you

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.960 
makes sense the other thing that you
should<00:05:34.870> try<00:05:35.289> and<00:05:35.349> keep<00:05:35.620> in<00:05:35.830> mind<00:05:36.130> when<00:05:36.789> you're

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
should try and keep in mind when you're

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.670 
should try and keep in mind when you're
going<00:05:37.210> through<00:05:37.330> something<00:05:37.630> like<00:05:38.050> this<00:05:38.260> is
