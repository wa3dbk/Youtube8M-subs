to<00:00:25.350> an<00:00:25.439> imaginary<00:00:25.619> film<00:00:26.189> crew<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
to an imaginary film crew and then I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.759 
to an imaginary film crew and then I
heard<00:00:27.689> someone<00:00:28.080> say<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.680> had

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
heard someone say that they had

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.109 
heard someone say that they had
memorized<00:00:29.189> something<00:00:29.580> forwards<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
memorized something forwards and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
memorized something forwards and
backwards<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> did<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.080> too<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.669> guess<00:00:32.669> if

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
backwards so I did that too I guess if

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.040 
backwards so I did that too I guess if
you<00:00:32.880> were<00:00:32.940> driving<00:00:33.059> around<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.540> country<00:00:33.570> rose

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you were driving around the country rose

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.840 
you were driving around the country rose
you<00:00:34.260> saw<00:00:34.469> some<00:00:34.680> kid<00:00:34.890> walking<00:00:35.190> backwards<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
you saw some kid walking backwards and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.340 
you saw some kid walking backwards and
talking<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.300> himself<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.780> probably<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.200> he

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
talking to himself you probably think he

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.470 
talking to himself you probably think he
