00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
down to Turin Lakes in Doncaster we

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.470 
down to Turin Lakes in Doncaster we
started<00:00:54.199> doing<00:00:54.379> it<00:00:54.530> as<00:00:54.590> a<00:00:55.090> hobby<00:00:56.090> in<00:00:56.390> the

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480

there's very few female involved in the
sport<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:09.920> since<00:02:10.369> I've<00:02:10.520> started<00:02:10.820> I've<00:02:11.150> always

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
sport and since I've started I've always

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.120 
sport and since I've started I've always
realized<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.990> it's<00:02:12.140> very<00:02:12.380> heavily<00:02:12.650> heavily

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
realized that it's very heavily heavily

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.460 
realized that it's very heavily heavily
male-dominated<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.510> there's<00:02:14.900> always<00:02:15.050> only

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
male-dominated and there's always only

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.110 
male-dominated and there's always only
been<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.100> handful<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:16.580> females<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.030> have

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
been a handful of females that have

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.270

completed and when I started there was

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.920 
completed and when I started there was
only<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.580> think<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.910> couple<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.720> we're<00:02:20.840> doing

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
only I think a couple that we're doing

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
was the only pit only females or as it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.030 
was the only pit only females or as it
was<00:02:26.690> competing<00:02:29.380> hopefully<00:02:30.380> in<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> future

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040

more<00:02:31.820> females<00:02:32.180> will<00:02:32.270> get<00:02:32.390> involved<00:02:32.840> but<00:02:33.110> at

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
more females will get involved but at

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.740 
more females will get involved but at
the<00:02:33.980> moment<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.670> like<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.030> said<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.540> very

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
the moment it like I said it is a very

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.070 
the moment it like I said it is a very
male-dominated<00:02:35.990> sport<00:02:37.630> I've<00:02:38.630> don't<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:38.959> an

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
male-dominated sport I've don't have an

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.660 
male-dominated sport I've don't have an
issue<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.410> competing<00:02:39.770> with<00:02:39.950> males<00:02:40.220> obviously

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
issue in competing with males obviously

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.850 
issue in competing with males obviously
how<00:02:40.850> are<00:02:41.030> there<00:02:41.120> other<00:02:41.270> choice<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.620> do

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
how are there other choice and I do

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.040 
how are there other choice and I do
think<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.250> all<00:02:43.400> down<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.150> know<00:02:44.870> the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
think it's all down to you know the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.510 
think it's all down to you know the
skill<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> talent<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.950> you've<00:02:46.130> got<00:02:46.310> and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
skill and the talent that you've got and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.830 
skill and the talent that you've got and
the<00:02:46.550> amount<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:46.940> time<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.330> put<00:02:47.450> into<00:02:47.480> it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
the amount of time that you put into it

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.910 
the amount of time that you put into it
so<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.320> know<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.470> shouldn't<00:02:48.770> matter

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
so it you know it shouldn't matter

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.380 
so it you know it shouldn't matter
whether<00:02:49.190> you're<00:02:49.459> you're<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:49.970> male<00:02:50.180> or<00:02:50.360> female

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
whether you're you're a male or female

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.930 
whether you're you're a male or female
and<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:51.650> honest<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.310> gives<00:02:52.550> me<00:02:52.760> more

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
and to be honest it it gives me more

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.430 
and to be honest it it gives me more
determination<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.750> go<00:02:53.870> out<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.200> prove<00:02:54.380> that
