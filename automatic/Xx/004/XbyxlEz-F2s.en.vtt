00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.630
 his volunteers went through the place and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.120
 gave notice of the incident the origin of the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.430
 flames would have been on a mezzanine floor 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.100
 old commercial premises which for its 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.470
 item kept in its different warehouses 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.230
 types of highly flammable materials 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.580
 that there are carbides there are paint and solvents 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.780
 in which it's just that you hear the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.450
 spread and we request support 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.980
 carabinero to be able to cover the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.310
 area and avoid any risk to 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.310
 civilians 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.470
 although there were people in the frater and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.390
 when starting the fire as 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.610
 it worked normally there was no 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 seriously injured and although the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.600
 causes of the fire are not yet 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.440
 finished there are presumptions to 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.060
 respect 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.710
 would be only hypotheses that could 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.540
 do some electrical failure given that 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.850
 we did not receive any kind of call from 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.960
 owner to the property only one 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.820
 moment that is already being the place 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.290
 gave the fire alarm the information 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.290
 preliminary is that he gave us the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.470
 owner of the hardware store has 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.560
 indicates that there was no outside work 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.930
 to what they do daily therefore 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.850
 the causes are going to be critical the going 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.190
 to investigate specialized personnel 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.390
 of the establishment so far not 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.640
 has had a problem that is what we have 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.100
 been monitoring to analyze it and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.250
 then suddenly we go but do not fear they say 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.350
 that are super are very very unfortunate 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:00.440
 since 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:03.050
 damage the history of the only person 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.420
 that is at risk was this neighbor 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.730
 from the hardware store that was quickly 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.730
 removed from the place by carabineros 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.950
 to see if he had caught fire 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:22.359
 the only one who dropped a lot of water with the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.569
 carpet artifacts everything is full of 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.569
 Water 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.060
 according to one of the owners of the 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.680
 antonio mancini hardware store there is no 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.410
 insurances committed for what 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.630
 begin again will be difficult in total 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.230
 There were 18 cars and about 100 volunteers 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.810
 of firefighters those who could to the fire 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.730
 without a doubt it is one of the most tragic 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.010
 last time with the fire and the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.989
