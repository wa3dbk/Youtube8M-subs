00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.210
 I'm 10 and today I'm here to talk. 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.429
 of the book the coldest girl to find 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.070
 de holly black this was the first book 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 that I took from my thyroid at this 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.130
 month and if she wants to say but anyway I 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.080
 I was very very excited for him I 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 I bought it because it would come out in a video 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
 My already but the tite I remembered remember 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.910
 when he still did not have in Brazil 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.890
 by amazon and took so much longer 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 It has taken months that I do not understand the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.450
 happened because not normally in the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.579
 Amazon between miranda I know what 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.559
 It happened but hefty any 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.300
 way I discovered that I actually 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.690
 I know they will ask to outsource 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.789
 so that ended up there a lot that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.370
 I throw here in Brazil and nothing of mine. 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.149
 book then get created with the tantrum 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.520
 coolest girl from koh so I did not read 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.410
 She went up to work but she never had or I was 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.129
 well I have good expectations for this 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.100
 book 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.000
 I know the extreme well so let's go 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.860
 log in 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.890
 in this book that has the most beautiful cover 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.290
 that I have seen in my entire life is 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.350
 basically the story is of the era a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.590
 girl she lives a reality where 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.000
 the existing vampires 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 everyone knows the existence of vampires 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.970
 people know that there are 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 people know that's what they're there for 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.909
 and obviously very very afraid of them 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.700
 and you turn to one vampire gift pedro has 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.470
 that you have an infection that does not 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.170
 book he calls leather which is kind 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.360
 cold if you feed on blood 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.280
 as long as you have this 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.310
 The race turns but if you pass 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.180
 85 days of running without feeding 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.979
 human blood 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.300
 You're probably not going to come there. 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.150
 It will turn out, it's going to happen again. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.820
 and the history of sugarcane begins when 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.660
 she at a high school party and not 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.920
 know what 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.290
 and she wakes up and everyone is dead and she 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.240
 saw that it was an attack of a vampire and 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.310
 she stands by my god 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.620
 and when she enters the room in a room 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.550
 to see if she can find someone 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.560
 that is alive 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.790
 She met her ex-boyfriend and a 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.040
 vampire in bed just lying in front of the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.950
 her address the afternoon commented and a 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.750
 vampire too and she helped escape 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.360
 even without knowing the vampire who 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.090
 gay flame I finally in this reality 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.280
 accounts also exist for those who are 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.320
 closed cities to house the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.420
 vampires and people were infected 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.170
 also some people who want to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.310
 enter to quote one of their own accord 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.450
 tam does not think she was infected 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.640
 during the party 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.660
 without going into too many details to 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.480
 do not spoil 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.600
 history will follow them and more 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.489
 some people trying to figure out 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.950
 exactly what to do with the situation and 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.290
 whether or not he would enter into such and such 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.930
 these things I personally liked the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.790
 I found the book interesting but like 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.540
 had high expectations regarding 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.190
 he 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.470
 I was a bit disappointed with 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.080
 some things I could not me 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.110
 connect with any of the characters and 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.150
 no tam no gay no one nobody 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.980
 appeared to be able to create any kind of 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.900
 I do not think they are 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.780
 superficial 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.300
 I just think I really do not have it. 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.550
 a story long behind life 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.950
 of them so dattani obviously has 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.890
 because she's the main story 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.600
 In other people's lives, then I could not 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.880
 create anything like that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.530
 and I started there I too 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.600
 Strange the beginning I was very 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.190
 interested very very interested in the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.160
 that happens because it begins in a way 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.220
 very intense, but then in the middle of the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.500
 story is only getting dull and despite 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.820
 research and good gets through 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.520
 tiring of law 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.850
 I have a little trouble with 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.830
 put one in you too I know it's a 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.630
 weird thing is something out of the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.820
 our reality that after all the fight 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.380
 vampires and people infected by a 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.290
 viruses and people who want to 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.880
 virus but I was annoyed by the 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.590
 things that happened there the way the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.600
 things happened there I could not 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.390
 really buy the idea of ​​one with such 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:24.220
 and more than the drama no areas or there 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.000
 there was a way that a secondary story 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.680
 to the whole group alone to make this 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.380
 story involves the gay veil and things 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.690
 so what I really won is 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.730
 I found it interesting but I found the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.260
 story was not too deep gave me 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.830
 an anger and a half of a blog 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.770
 the guy's business there watching the name 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.620
 because I was going to take a few days but the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.100
 lance and elizabeth that where with the 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.460
 fuck champions there I thought that's it 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.050
 same goes half past and 96 and the bed what it is 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.580
 cool but at the same time the story does not 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.710
 was deepened so I could not see 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.570
 right is happening and there are some 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.510
 flashbacks in this story that I just 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.860
 I find some shopping is looking like 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.290
 This book was horrible that I'm 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.050
 talking even though I'm not leaving because I 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.910
 I love eiko the way it ended I think 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.430
 it ended the way it had to 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.380
 End up not to be cliché for not 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.690
 stay in otto so I can not just turn the 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.990
 and store a book on the shelf without 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.690
 Nothing else the last chapter actually 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.610
 I found it very cool, I like the fact 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.490
 not have a photo of a continuation and the 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.430
 brush is more or less a cliffhanger I 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.280
 I think this is cool because of a conclusion 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.440
 which was in fact a conclusion but 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.800
 At the same time I do not like God 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.040
 I ended up giving 7.5 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.480
 because it was not a bad book either 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.970
 it was a great book 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.380
 not at all I think it's a medium book I 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.330
 I think if I did not have the 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.430
 expectations so was that in high in 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.470
 about this book might not have 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.510
 disappointed I think the fact that I 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.700
 not particularly liked the 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.440
 was the fact that it really had 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.060
 very high expectations in 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.400
 about this book then I just 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.040
 I disappointed a little and I found it 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.710
 forced only by trying to thirst through 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.690
 10 in the end these things and also the 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.280
 title is now more physical only the girl is 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.580
 do not be the older girl boy more 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.370
 old that virtual mines cold so not 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.010
 she noticed ice queen they a 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.110
 normal person who is a little quieter 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.330
 than normal 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.490
 we arrived and good is this was the end of 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.830
 but I want to warn you that 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.240
 This is the last video I'm going to bet 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.250
 this season that the end of 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.990

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.760
 my classes will come back will be possible 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.370

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.900
 Let's go back and see us all just 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.790
 Sunday I have some projects in 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.350
 looked at me and fuck I think it goes 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.540
 keep talking about things that are not 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.830
 can be captured we had great 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.260
 conquest to indicate I indicated 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:59.070
 because it was a long time ago and I was in the 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:01.810
 bathroom and the line warns 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.150
 is due to the elite with the letters that require 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.310
 great time so I wanted to have 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.630
 raised in the joints and forced to 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.630
 watch people kisses 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
 is
