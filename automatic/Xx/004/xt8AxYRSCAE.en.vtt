00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
all the firmware installed into it and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.580 
all the firmware installed into it and
all<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> light<00:00:13.969> before<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.269> can<00:00:15.420> fly<00:00:15.690> you

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
all the light before you can fly you

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.470 
all the light before you can fly you
have<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:17.130> what<00:00:17.279> they<00:00:17.400> call<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.640> nozzle<00:00:18.000> dance

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
have to do what they call a nozzle dance

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.679 
have to do what they call a nozzle dance
and<00:00:18.810> that's<00:00:18.900> calibrating<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.210> MC<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
and that's calibrating the MC with the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.410 
and that's calibrating the MC with the
compass<00:00:22.550> and<00:00:23.550> I'm<00:00:23.760> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> show<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.119> how<00:00:24.359> to

lock to do this so I'll go ahead and
show<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.670> how<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> after<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.660> bound

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
show you how to do it after it's bound

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.650 
show you how to do it after it's bound
okay<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.430> bound<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.789> at<00:00:44.789> Adi

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
okay it's it's bound so I have my at Adi

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.490 
okay it's it's bound so I have my at Adi

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.220 
three-way switch in order for it to work
you<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.850> put<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:54.000> switch<00:00:54.300> over<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you have to put your switch over to the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.430 
you have to put your switch over to the
manual<00:00:55.680> mode<00:00:55.890> first<00:00:56.780> okay<00:00:57.780> once<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.079> haven't
