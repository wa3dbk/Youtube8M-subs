going<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.819> little<00:02:33.060> distant<00:02:33.629> might<00:02:33.840> be

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
going to be a little distant might be

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.259 
going to be a little distant might be
different<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.829> get<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.189> for<00:02:35.700> example<00:02:35.790> these

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
different to get to for example these

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.750 
different to get to for example these
frame<00:02:36.599> in<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.079> frame<00:02:37.409> it's<00:02:37.890> actually<00:02:38.340> easier
