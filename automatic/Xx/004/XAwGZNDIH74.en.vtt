00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 i 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:13.250
 and still several years working for 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.120
 contracted and then we wanted to 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.080
 try to have our own business 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.910
 do things in our own way and 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.619
 also a little bit of continuing to train and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.310
 form a bit also because our 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.310
 own company 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.400
 that at first you're a bit lost 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.620
 because you do not know where to throw on 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.560
 everything for funding issues and where 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.920
 this one sets a pattern you have to 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.050
 fix you have to fix your idea 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.030
 in a series of patterns and little by little 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.000
 then it has helped us a lot about 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.160
 all for yourself to do a little 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.239
 more orderly things do not do everything 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.590
 because he has chosen to start from an idea 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.590
 but you do not know where to start 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.770
 so a very positive balance we 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.239
 we opened in the time of christie's and 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.670
 we started from scratch then only 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.260
 we could grow then for now 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.390
 since then we have had people 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.090
 every day and we could only go 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.010
 growing little by little never with a 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.660
 business doing everything wonderful from the 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.410
 principle but good you always have to 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.410
 continue adapting 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.240
 we offer you a pretty deal 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.730
 Personalized above all is a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.980
 very vocational profession then and 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.200
 We treat animals as if they were 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.290
 our each one of them and above all 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.250
 we try to update all the techniques 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.070
 we try to continue doing courses 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.730
 learning more and more and doing it 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730
 best possible 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.830
 and we try to make it a complete deal 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.010
 we have from people who come to do 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.100
 hairdresser to start with their hygiene 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.440
 to continue with things for the ride 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 things for home and then of course your 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.060
 health that is our main objective
