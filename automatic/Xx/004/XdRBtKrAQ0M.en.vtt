00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
turns to unlimited view woman is on

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.229 
turns to unlimited view woman is on
brightness<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.500> 50%<00:00:46.940> particles<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.090> turn

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
brightness is 50% particles if I turn

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.020 
brightness is 50% particles if I turn
this<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:48.780> which<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.370> obviously<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
this on to all which I can obviously you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.729 
this on to all which I can obviously you
get<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:51.329> particles<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> don't<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
get more particles but I don't see I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.260 
get more particles but I don't see I
don't<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.370> much<00:00:53.640> difference<00:00:54.120> I've

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
don't see that much difference I've

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
don't see that much difference I've
actually<00:00:54.420> seen<00:00:54.690> no<00:00:55.410> difference<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.890> think

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
actually seen no difference I think

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
actually seen no difference I think
between<00:00:56.420> particles<00:00:57.420> being<00:00:57.600> an<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
between particles being an all and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.540 
between particles being an all and
decreased<00:01:00.440> vsync<00:01:01.440> turning<00:01:01.800> off<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.370> just

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
decreased vsync turning off that just

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
decreased vsync turning off that just
basically<00:01:02.699> stabilizes<00:01:03.449> fes<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.049> will<00:01:04.170> turn

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
basically stabilizes fes that will turn

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.230 
basically stabilizes fes that will turn
you<00:01:04.530> down<00:01:04.710> that'll<00:01:05.460> turn<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.760> FPS<00:01:05.880> don't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you down that'll turn your FPS don't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.920 
you down that'll turn your FPS don't
like<00:01:06.390> fur<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:07.140> 60<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.799> nice<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.180> terrible

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
like fur or 60 a nice you know terrible

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.109 
like fur or 60 a nice you know terrible
because<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.229> always<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:11.100> always<00:01:11.250> goes<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
because it always it always goes down to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.899 
because it always it always goes down to
59<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.869> stuff<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.729> might<00:01:14.880> not

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
59 and stuff in it I know it might not

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.640 
59 and stuff in it I know it might not
seem<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> big<00:01:15.540> deal<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:15.900> see<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.560> a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
64-bit texture pack of some reason I've

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.949 
64-bit texture pack of some reason I've
got<00:03:50.069> more<00:03:50.310> FPS<00:03:50.760> on<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.060> texture<00:03:51.419> that<00:03:51.659> requires

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
got more FPS on a texture that requires

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.430 
got more FPS on a texture that requires
more<00:03:52.319> pixels<00:03:53.190> per<00:03:53.489> block<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:55.260> yeah<00:03:55.379> I'm

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
more pixels per block so yeah I'm

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.280 
more pixels per block so yeah I'm
sticking<00:03:55.799> around<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.129> same<00:03:56.310> FPS<00:03:57.049> let<00:03:58.049> me<00:03:58.109> just

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
sticking around the same FPS let me just

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.020 
sticking around the same FPS let me just
get<00:03:58.409> down<00:03:58.590> here<00:03:58.829> just<00:03:58.979> Serkan<00:03:59.430> run<00:03:59.909> around

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
like no minecraft so for some reason I'm

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.159 
like no minecraft so for some reason I'm
on<00:04:01.859> 300<00:04:02.280> FPS<00:04:02.639> using<00:04:03.629> a<00:04:03.690> texture<00:04:03.900> pad<00:04:04.079> that

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
on 300 FPS using a texture pad that

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.119 
on 300 FPS using a texture pad that
takes<00:04:04.229> more<00:04:05.269> more<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.419> run<00:04:06.709> see<00:04:07.709> I'm<00:04:07.829> sticking

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
takes more more to run see I'm sticking

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.949 
takes more more to run see I'm sticking
it<00:04:08.190> around<00:04:08.400> about<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.639> same<00:04:08.879> FPS<00:04:09.659> I<00:04:09.780> think<00:04:09.900> I

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
it around about the same FPS I think I

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.750 
it around about the same FPS I think I
just<00:04:10.079> dropped<00:04:10.229> like<00:04:10.409> 10<00:04:10.829> there<00:04:11.280> just<00:04:11.579> drop

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
like 10 from my average using this I

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.909 
like 10 from my average using this I
dropped<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:13.889> a<00:04:13.979> 17-hour<00:04:14.459> will<00:04:14.729> say<00:04:15.680> yes<00:04:16.680> you

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:28.689 
I put that cause of decreases and don't

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.689 
I put that cause of decreases and don't
see<00:04:28.810> much<00:04:28.990> difference<00:04:29.310> turn<00:04:30.310> all<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.520> these
