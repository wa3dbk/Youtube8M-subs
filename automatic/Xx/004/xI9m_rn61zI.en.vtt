00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.650
 chipotle on this side and good for 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.600
 salt and pepper and good for 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.449
 start I'll start with the dressing 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.429
 here I have the mayonnaise and the chipotle 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.940
 to grab some of the caldillo 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:38.940
 chipotle 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.680
 and I'm going to mix it 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.260
 It can be to taste if you do not like it very 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.880
 spicy you can take little nothing more 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.190
 so that it gives the flavor that the 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.990
 combination of seafood with this 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.240
 type of sauces is very very good and very 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.240
 recommended so here I am mixing 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.890
 you can do it with a tartar sauce 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.300
 as well 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.360
