00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.680 
building we can do the simulation from
the<00:06:28.100> Turkish<00:06:28.430> in<00:06:28.550> revision<00:06:28.820> to<00:06:29.150> our<00:06:29.360> location

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
the Turkish in revision to our location

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.310 
the Turkish in revision to our location
it<00:06:32.690> works<00:06:32.930> like<00:06:33.050> that<00:06:33.169> and<00:06:33.760> if<00:06:34.760> the<00:06:35.270> radio<00:06:36.139> is

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
it works like that and if the radio is

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.430 
it works like that and if the radio is
background<00:06:36.560> running<00:06:37.039> then<00:06:37.990> you<00:06:38.990> can<00:06:39.199> still

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
background running then you can still

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.700 
background running then you can still
turn<00:06:40.039> right<00:06:40.460> each<00:06:40.669> other<00:06:40.970> then<00:06:41.210> key<00:06:41.690> right<00:06:42.169> and

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
turn right each other then key right and

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.730 
turn right each other then key right and
enter<00:06:43.580> the<00:06:43.870> expressway<00:06:46.360> key<00:06:47.360> right<00:06:47.840> ah<00:06:48.229> you

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
enter the expressway key right ah you

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.730 
enter the expressway key right ah you
can<00:06:48.949> hear<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:49.280> video<00:06:49.639> on<00:06:49.850> the<00:06:49.880> grass<00:06:50.210> is<00:06:51.110> great

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
guide for the navigation then the radio

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.250 
guide for the navigation then the radio
will<00:06:57.710> will<00:06:58.699> be<00:06:58.850> a<00:06:58.880> bit<00:06:59.150> louder<00:06:59.360> and<00:06:59.690> if<00:07:00.050> there
