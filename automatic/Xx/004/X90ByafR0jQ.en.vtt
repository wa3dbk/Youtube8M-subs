00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.520
 hey people here is a magnet again 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.299
 happy New Year 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.129
 in this video I want to meet with you once 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.670
 I want to pass reviews in 2014 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.430
 show you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.600
 by 2015 so everything will work and how 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.110
 is it actually with my channel 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.240
 on 25 march there were similar to the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.010
 First year will be three experts report 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.080
 souls also called adil auction house na 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.879
 yes in any case after initial hype 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.710
 is the playing fun in escape relatively 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.850
 quickly after 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.040
 Therefore , somehow first tried 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.329
 by many nerds bachs and changes 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.220
 a good balance of the classes 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.050
 that has also added to mine 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.430
 opinion meets gotten by just fine 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.390
 should then new for the endgame 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.610
 create content 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.660
 but in my opinion they did 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.360
 limited 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.079
 the start of 71 was a pretty good one 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 disaster 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.829
 there was wax and exploits and somehow 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.450
 not really new content so 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.100
 now 2015 starts first with 7 2 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.909
 besides , new items and sets are 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.909
 announced 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.380
 I hope this one sees the endgame 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.570
 is too lean and improves afterwards 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.290
 suggestions from the community give it up 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.540
 every case more than enough 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.430
 the next game that will be me pretty 2014 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.710
 In any case, it has almost become enthusiastic 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.180
 without it was officially on the 11th 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.970
 third after a fairly long time 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.520
 released after the mini extension 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.770
 There was flood of max ramas on 8 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.640
 Dec even the first right one 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.009
 Expansion Link Stock Exchange Taken 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.500
 pretty fast a sports scene 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.590
 developed and also gamer 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.579
 different areas such as 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.729
 Criteria or turn off the one yes rather 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.190
 from diablo 3 knows or also starcraft 2 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.929
 sizes like the in or athos offer 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.020
 pretty much hate and content 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.090
 I believe 2015 will be for you to 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.220
 every case is very big 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.780
 give expansion and the tournament scene 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.539
 will definitely be through the ceiling 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.049
 just go with the new spectator 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.310
 Mode is one of my goals for 2015 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.819
 will definitely be 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.530
 reach legend and you too 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.600
 a bit more hate content to deliver 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.859
 and it does not stop with the blizzard 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.620
 on 13 november there was the 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.950
 latest world of warcraft expansion 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.510
 molotov trainer 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.329
 I thought it was cool it was on everyone 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.440
 if witty the garnison build up 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:48.819
 play new character from level 90 onwards 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.220
 can and could the new leveling to 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.109
 enjoy 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.790
 the endgame does not have me then again 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.690
 so tied up it's just still 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.420
 exactly the same and before and that 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.040
 boot item level 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.050
 that does not irritate me anymore 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.690
 so much fun in itself 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.390
 and the announcement of my leveling let's 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.310
 play will definitely go on and on 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.440
 I want to show you the content because 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.290
 that still binds me 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.840
 Warcraft is definitely the story 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.260
 and with wallace of trailer on 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.520
 every case got really good 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.710
 but then I have in any case 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.530
 still not a blizzard game what me 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.280
 2014 has been very tied up and that is 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.340
 Of course, the path of exile Chris Wilson has 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.810
 then nice forums post published in 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.480
 which he summarizes again 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.880
 how 2014 went for her 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.330
 For example, you have two awards 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.400
 get out of 2013 for best game of 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.370
 the year from different websites 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.380
 they have doubled their player base 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.790
 So at least the players the 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.050
 were online at the same time 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.560
 the player base probably has 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.790
 even more than doubled and total 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.600
 So you have published 51 patches 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.280
 Path of exile Giant respect every week 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.080
 there is in patch there are always 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.980
 improvements always small 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.220
 tricks little things and two expansions 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.760
 they have published sacrifice off 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.140
 the wall includes masters at 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.430
 definitely agree on the games 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.140
 Giant respect I'll be on everyone in 2015 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.030
 case a lot more passive excel 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.419
 play especially when diablo 3 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.530
 not really noticeably improved and 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.540
 There is good reason to do so because of it 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.390
 will soon give a new nude in 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.440
 Passau sex a new expedition 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.600
 probably around march it will be 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.440
 whole released and I'm looking forward to it 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.580
 any case insane 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.560
 but now I want to conclude briefly 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.520
 synonymous again on my channel 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.140
 So in 2014 I had a great time 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.120
 have met many new people for 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.950
 example form there we have a bit 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.910
 what was done on youtube that should too 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.430
 make in the future 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.290
 I'll let you know I have 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.610
 get recognition for my guides 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.940
 that was awesome i have for example here 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.620
 so a diablo 3 mouse won that 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.630
 was great 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.760
 and yes that was just a blast 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.490
 and of course 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.620
 thank you so many thanks to you for that 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.700
 that you visit so many here 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.100
 on a canal 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.810
 I have a new facebook page there 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.210
 are still a little bit likes though 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.970
 that will hopefully change now and 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.420
 I have a new website I blog 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.630
 relatively often even and I want that 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.720
 make a lot more in 2015 too 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.510
 So what's 2015 here on the channel 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.700
 I want to continue to deliver content 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.240
 but it also brings you naturally 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.300
 fun and I want to continue my 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.700
 Mission follow the gaming scene like this 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.380
 a little bit better in the light 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.990
 So that's definitely a goal of 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.270
 I will definitely be new 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.730
 try formats so I'm always 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.090
 a little bit in the 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.250
 experimental phase 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.530
 even if the channel already has a 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.770
 year old or me over 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.870
