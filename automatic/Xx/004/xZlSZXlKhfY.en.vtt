really nice you can also change that to
the<00:01:51.040> blue<00:01:51.280> compaq<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.270> this<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.600> how<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.650> looks

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
the blue compaq so this is how it looks

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.490 
the blue compaq so this is how it looks
like<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.810> going<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:56.140> change<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:57.180> appearance

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
like just going to change it appearance

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.520 
like just going to change it appearance
we're<00:01:59.500> going<00:01:59.800> to<00:01:59.979> go<00:02:00.160> with<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.610> blue<00:02:00.910> compaq

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
we're going to go with the blue compaq

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.980 
we're going to go with the blue compaq
apply

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.940 

and<00:02:10.230> basically<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.140> how<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.530> looks<00:02:13.710> like

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and basically this is how it looks like

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.580 
and basically this is how it looks like
so<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.790> icons<00:02:15.380> will<00:02:16.380> appear<00:02:16.410> instead<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
so the icons will appear instead of the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.290 
so the icons will appear instead of the
titles<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.280> your

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
titles of your

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.970 
titles of your
icons<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.280> anyway<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.620> change<00:02:26.770> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
icons so anyway I have to change the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.220 
icons so anyway I have to change the
background<00:02:27.130> suit<00:02:28.090> mice<00:02:28.330> theme<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.740> this<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.160> it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
background suit mice theme so this is it

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.130 
background suit mice theme so this is it
so<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.380> comes<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:33.580> whole<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.420> folder<00:02:34.930> of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
so it comes this whole a folder of

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.910 
so it comes this whole a folder of
wallpapers<00:02:35.830> comes<00:02:36.070> with<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:37.350> zip<00:02:38.350> file<00:02:38.590> I'm

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
wallpapers comes with the zip file I'm

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.540 
wallpapers comes with the zip file I'm
just<00:02:39.490> going<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:40.020> set<00:02:41.020> possess<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.040> background

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
slick really cool and this is again

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.650 
slick really cool and this is again
ubuntu<00:02:49.780> for<00:02:50.170> windows<00:02:50.590> XP<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.390> where
