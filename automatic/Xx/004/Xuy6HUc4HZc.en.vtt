00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello everyone, Max again and I think 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.880
 everyone in his life at least once 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.490
 encountered errors during installation or 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.179
 launching any game and many these 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.839
 mistakes 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.840
 but rather all the errors not only because of the games 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.090
 happen because of the bugs themselves 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.750
 installation but due to lack of 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.990
 additional components of them in this 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.850
 will help the program which I honestly 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.610
 not so long ago did one thing I and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.210
 not long because nothing 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.710
 this is not difficult but for me personally 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.430
 the essence of this program is here 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 than if you have when you start the game 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.950
 there is some kind of mistake for example you are not 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 there is not updated over the framework or you 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.020
 direct x is not installed on the computer 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.180
 This program will help you solve all these 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.600
 errors because all the extra 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.370
 Components need precisely for games 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.670
 they are provided in this program 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.150
 because I know all the extras 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.880
 components like popular and in general 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:16.770
 need for stable gameplay 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.520
 and so run the program the link will be in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.220
 description and after a while it starts 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.110
 will create a folder called component and 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.079
 now it even starts antivirus 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.170
 included and so welcome you master 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.049
 load additional components and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.340
 here we have 4 components 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.890
 which are generally needed for games to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.930
 they were launched namely microsoft net 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.070
 net framework 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.439
 direct x sti plus plus components and more 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.460
 one pack plus plus 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.369
 and so here you are running the program and you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.469
 think what to do now one 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.369
 some we have dinner we have what we need 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.459
 press the download button and wait 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.400
 each component downloads these two 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.350
 component even three and the last 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.290
 load very quickly 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.120
 and the third component, whichever you have 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.240
 internet speed so fast he 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.510
 and this component will load enough 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.270
 there are just a few variations 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.010
 operating systems so it weighs 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.590
 more and not without reason in the program folder 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.670
 Created created component folder 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.150
 components in Russian, I will immediately 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.050
 speak and here as you see 42 archives and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.350
 2 installers you can either run 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.910
 from here or click install here so 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.790
 you click install it 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.580
 microsoft.net framework click 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.470
 install direct x you all have it 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.900
 I install for example, I do not have 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.200
 direct x as you can see it started 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.630
 i click accept do not install these 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.990
 bing panels but now it will give me 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.290
 that I have installed the last or 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.020
 newer version so update 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.460
 I basically direct x and does not need me so 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.740
 I think it is initializing but this is already up 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.910
 installation is completed newer or 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.580
 well, or the same version installed on 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.620
 your computer 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.560
 they also install this framework 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.350
 which I have also installed and two 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.580
 the archive that opens telling 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.010
 it means you choose 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:44.190
 operating system if you have 32 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.870
 select x86 bit if the 60 4 x64 in 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.830
 In principle, it is better to install both 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.080
 because for some books for example 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.660
 time there was a mistake and some 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.540
 installed framework install b 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.940
 plus plus but it did not help them and 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.180
 it helped only the installation is for 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.940
 other versions are poor and 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.190
 Well, I know this because my friends 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.540
 talked about it that they were exactly that 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.530
 helped and also so the archive is corrupted or 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.530
 does not have an unknown format and so 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.680
 go now everything should work 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.800
 upload again and yes he is on load too 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.740
 slowly enough but it loads exactly 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.520
 archive because 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.120
 there are also several several variations on 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.250
 every bit their system let's 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.300
 wait and see what's in 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.569
 I want to show you all this archive 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.729
 because everyone has a question 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.509
 when he jumps out any 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.030
 error because of what it is I advise here those 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.250
 Who does this occur in any games 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.919
 immediately install all additional 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.770
 components are not any separately all 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.139
 because even if they were not needed 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.080
 you will need them now 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.560
 believe me further and now we have 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.199
 almost loaded click install and 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:18.659
 damn we have such a daddy more precisely 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:24.750
 archive in her folder and the folder in it and 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:28.270
 choose each its version of Windows and 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.190
 I personally set everything to myself 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.500
 additional components never more 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.539
 not steamed with any mistakes even 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.110
 if at all I had errors 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:41.440
 then it is more pure gaming errors and already 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.530
 the bugs in the game itself it was I looking for them 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.740
 on the forums spoke with other people 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.590
 learned from friends and so on 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.759
 I think this video helped you all thanks 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.759
 for watching and all bye
