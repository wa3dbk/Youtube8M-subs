00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
another thing that can come in handy for

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
another thing that can come in handy for
a<00:02:01.350> situation<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> drop<00:02:02.670> cue<00:02:02.969> so

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
to the ground for the reward that's on

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.280 
to the ground for the reward that's on
the<00:02:14.770> ground<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.850> clip<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.300> from<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.780> end<00:02:17.020> of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
the ground this clip is from the end of

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.080 
the ground this clip is from the end of
our<00:02:17.560> training<00:02:17.830> session<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.400> did<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.790> for

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
our training session we did this for

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.520 
our training session we did this for
about<00:02:19.120> five<00:02:19.510> minutes<00:02:19.660> straight<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.410> is

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
about five minutes straight so this is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.470 
about five minutes straight so this is
toward<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.770> end<00:02:20.860> end<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
toward the end end of that and in the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.970 
toward the end end of that and in the
beginning<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:22.990> little<00:02:23.230> clip<00:02:23.410> here<00:02:23.440> he

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
beginning of this little clip here he

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.950 
beginning of this little clip here he
goes<00:02:24.490> out<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.850> Latian<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.240> came<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.570> drop<00:02:25.750> it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
goes out to the Latian I came to drop it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.810 
goes out to the Latian I came to drop it
then<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.320> basically<00:02:26.860> get<00:02:27.190> him<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.430> look<00:02:27.580> at<00:02:27.670> me

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
then I basically get him to look at me

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.490 
then I basically get him to look at me
and<00:02:27.910> start<00:02:28.150> walking<00:02:28.570> with<00:02:28.720> him<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.050> give<00:02:29.380> him<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
and start walking with him I give him a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.620 
and start walking with him I give him a
reward<00:02:29.830> there<00:02:30.010> for<00:02:30.250> walking<00:02:30.520> with<00:02:30.670> me<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.450> my

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
reward there for walking with me so my

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.840 
reward there for walking with me so my
goal<00:02:31.810> here<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.560> continue<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.190> increase<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
goal here is to continue to increase the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.160 
goal here is to continue to increase the
amount<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.060> steps<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.720> take<00:02:34.930> in

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
amount of steps that I can take in

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.410 
amount of steps that I can take in
between<00:02:35.320> rewards<00:02:35.860> now<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:37.090> goal<00:02:37.270> with<00:02:37.390> that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
between rewards now the goal with that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.630 
between rewards now the goal with that
is<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.290> more<00:02:38.440> steps<00:02:38.710> I<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:38.890> take<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.370> between

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
is the more steps I can take in between

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.360 
is the more steps I can take in between
rewards<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:41.320> longer<00:02:41.650> he's<00:02:41.800> going<00:02:42.100> without

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
rewards the longer he's going without

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
rewards the longer he's going without
getting<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.790> rewards<00:02:43.210> so<00:02:43.450> my<00:02:43.960> goal<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.350> then

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
getting the rewards so my goal is then

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.870 
getting the rewards so my goal is then
to<00:02:44.680> keep<00:02:44.860> spreading<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.310> out<00:02:45.430> further<00:02:45.700> and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
to keep spreading that out further and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.370 
to keep spreading that out further and
further<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.300> ultimately<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.780> do<00:02:46.900> not<00:02:47.050> need<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
further so ultimately I do not need the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.840 
further so ultimately I do not need the
reward<00:02:47.680> towards<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.370> end<00:02:48.490> of<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.670> five

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
reward towards the end of this five

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.280 
reward towards the end of this five
