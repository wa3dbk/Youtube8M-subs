00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.090 
you will need a big foam ball I'm using

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.150 
you will need a big foam ball I'm using
right<00:00:07.390> now<00:00:07.420> a<00:00:07.720> 10<00:00:07.990> inch<00:00:08.290> but<00:00:08.830> it<00:00:08.860> really

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
right now a 10 inch but it really

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.890 
right now a 10 inch but it really
depends<00:00:09.670> on<00:00:09.700> the<00:00:09.820> size<00:00:10.180> that<00:00:10.210> you<00:00:10.570> want<00:00:10.690> your

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
depends on the size that you want your

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.830 
depends on the size that you want your
bouquet<00:00:11.200> to<00:00:11.260> be<00:00:11.530> it<00:00:12.129> could<00:00:12.309> be<00:00:12.369> a<00:00:12.490> 8<00:00:12.850> or<00:00:13.209> it<00:00:13.570> also

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
bouquet to be it could be a 8 or it also

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.640 
bouquet to be it could be a 8 or it also
depends<00:00:14.469> on<00:00:14.590> that<00:00:14.830> the<00:00:15.480> size<00:00:16.480> of<00:00:16.900> your<00:00:17.170> flowers

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
depends on that the size of your flowers

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.860 
depends on that the size of your flowers
is<00:00:17.920> if<00:00:18.310> they're<00:00:18.640> large<00:00:18.970> or<00:00:19.300> not<00:00:19.510> if<00:00:19.720> they're

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 
is if they're large or not if they're

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.460 
is if they're large or not if they're
flat

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
flat

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.670 
flat
so<00:00:20.950> obviously<00:00:21.730> the<00:00:22.270> thicker<00:00:22.540> they<00:00:22.780> are<00:00:23.020> the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
so obviously the thicker they are the

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.800 
so obviously the thicker they are the
smaller<00:00:23.980> your<00:00:24.250> foam<00:00:24.460> ball<00:00:24.910> should<00:00:25.210> be<00:00:25.240> because

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
smaller your foam ball should be because

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.110 
smaller your foam ball should be because
this<00:00:25.960> is<00:00:26.170> going<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.440> stick<00:00:26.710> out<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.220> then<00:00:27.880> you

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 
this is going to stick out and then you

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.120 
this is going to stick out and then you
would<00:00:28.240> need<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:28.600> purchase<00:00:28.930> also<00:00:29.350> so<00:00:29.830> wooden

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
would need to purchase also so wooden

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.150 
would need to purchase also so wooden
rods<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:30.789> I<00:00:31.450> purchased<00:00:32.169> mine<00:00:32.379> at<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.950> dollar

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
rods and I purchased mine at the dollar

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.790 
rods and I purchased mine at the dollar
store<00:00:33.340> I<00:00:33.730> think<00:00:33.820> there<00:00:34.210> were<00:00:34.329> like<00:00:34.440> $84<00:00:35.440> for

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
store I think there were like $84 for

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.869 
store I think there were like $84 for
this<00:00:36.699> project<00:00:36.969> you<00:00:37.390> will<00:00:37.420> only<00:00:38.199> need<00:00:38.620> four<00:00:39.249> the

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
this project you will only need four the

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.569 
this project you will only need four the
reason<00:00:40.179> why<00:00:40.300> I'm<00:00:40.390> using<00:00:40.600> four<00:00:41.109> and<00:00:41.350> not<00:00:41.559> one<00:00:42.100> is

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
reason why I'm using four and not one is

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.220 
reason why I'm using four and not one is
just<00:00:42.850> because<00:00:43.120> it's<00:00:43.359> going<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.839> give<00:00:44.019> that

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
just because it's going to give that

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.340 
just because it's going to give that
nice<00:00:44.440> thickness<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:45.129> it<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:45.909> what<00:00:46.749> you<00:00:46.870> do<00:00:47.050> is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
nice thickness to it and what you do is

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.099 
nice thickness to it and what you do is
that<00:00:47.409> you<00:00:47.739> cut<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:48.249> size<00:00:48.489> what<00:00:49.449> you<00:00:49.749> really

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109

that you cut to size what you really
want<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.850> side<00:00:52.179> that<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:52.929> cut<00:00:53.350> right<00:00:53.589> here
