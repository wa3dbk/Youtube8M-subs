00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.570 

some<00:01:07.580> freakin<00:01:08.580> hell<00:01:09.830> not<00:01:10.830> quite<00:01:11.070> sure<00:01:11.100> what's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
that until just now this is probably the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.969 
that until just now this is probably the
most<00:01:42.869> inventive<00:01:43.500> nes<00:01:44.100> game<00:01:44.369> yet<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:46.650> warp

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
so I'm not really sure what's going on I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.870 
so I'm not really sure what's going on I
assume<00:02:21.750> these<00:02:21.960> circles<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.830> random<00:02:23.640> things

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
assume these circles and random things

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.460 
assume these circles and random things
that<00:02:24.120> fly<00:02:24.330> into<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.720> distance<00:02:25.140> or<00:02:25.320> bad<00:02:25.590> but

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
that fly into the distance or bad but

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.540 
that fly into the distance or bad but
for<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.560> most<00:02:28.680> part<00:02:28.800> they're<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:29.250> trying<00:02:29.460> to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
