day I got my flight on youtube I didn't
know<00:00:10.590> his<00:00:11.360> performance<00:00:12.360> was<00:00:12.900> pretty<00:00:13.200> good

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
know his performance was pretty good

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.550 
know his performance was pretty good
initially<00:00:14.780> but<00:00:15.780> as<00:00:16.880> time<00:00:17.880> ticked<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:19.350> note

was get a bit sluggish and the end of
the<00:00:23.519> day<00:00:24.500> ran<00:00:25.500> about<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:26.039> where<00:00:26.939> my<00:00:26.970> eec<00:00:27.689> was

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the day ran about here where my eec was

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.849 
the day ran about here where my eec was
pretty<00:00:28.740> much<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.130> middle<00:00:30.140> 30m<00:00:31.140> redbrick

EEOC<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.940> fusillade<00:00:33.660> year<00:00:33.899> was<00:00:34.079> absolutely

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
EEOC this fusillade year was absolutely

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.080 
EEOC this fusillade year was absolutely
boiling<00:00:36.710> what<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> did<00:00:38.010> before<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.790> did<00:00:38.969> have

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
boiling what I did before is I did have

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.470 
boiling what I did before is I did have
a<00:00:39.120> whole<00:00:39.469> but<00:00:40.469> I've<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:41.640> increased<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
a whole but I've really increased it a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
a whole but I've really increased it a
lot<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.610> probably<00:00:44.610> only<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.879> third

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
lot it was it was probably only a third

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.959 
lot it was it was probably only a third
of<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.570> size<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.670> I<00:00:47.670> love<00:00:47.910> channel<00:00:48.390> 2<00:00:48.510> l<00:00:49.969> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
of that size and I love channel 2 l and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.860 
of that size and I love channel 2 l and
scooped<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:52.670> boy<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.940> blocked<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> front<00:00:54.690> hole

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
scooped it boy I blocked the front hole

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.350 
scooped it boy I blocked the front hole
up<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> Bixler<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.090> hasn't<00:00:57.090> got

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
up because the Bixler one hasn't got

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.229 
up because the Bixler one hasn't got
that<00:00:57.390> vent<00:00:57.750> hole<00:00:57.930> there<00:00:58.140> anyway<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.090> my<00:01:00.090> back

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that vent hole there anyway and my back

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.549 
that vent hole there anyway and my back
was<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.750> front<00:01:00.899> anyway<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
was right at the front anyway and it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
was right at the front anyway and it
wasn't<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.609> blocking<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> hallway<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.449> was

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
wasn't just blocking the hallway it was

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.820 
wasn't just blocking the hallway it was
doing<00:01:03.780> useless<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.080> needed<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.650> some

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
doing useless so I needed to get some

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.870 
doing useless so I needed to get some
venting<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.460> basically<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.780> i've<00:01:09.869> done<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
venting so basically what i've done is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.080 
venting so basically what i've done is
really<00:01:11.880> opened<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.869> lot<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.700> i'm<00:01:14.760> getting<00:01:15.060> a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
really opened up a lot so i'm getting a

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630 
really opened up a lot so i'm getting a
lot<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> airflow<00:01:15.780> through<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.290> now<00:01:16.640> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
lot of airflow through there now and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.240 
lot of airflow through there now and
i've<00:01:18.540> moved<00:01:18.840> also<00:01:19.790> my<00:01:20.790> esc<00:01:21.229> was<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:23.009> in

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
i've moved also my esc was right in

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.130 
i've moved also my esc was right in
between<00:01:23.460> those<00:01:23.850> two<00:01:24.030> plastic<00:01:24.240> tubes<00:01:24.720> writing

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
between those two plastic tubes writing

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.679 
between those two plastic tubes writing
the<00:01:25.259> fuse<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:26.640> couldn't<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.000> any<00:01:27.150> any<00:01:27.450> any

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the fuse you couldn't see any any any

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.920 
the fuse you couldn't see any any any
wise<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.890> I've<00:01:28.979> moved<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.930> but

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
wise at all so I've moved it out but

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.710 
wise at all so I've moved it out but
also<00:01:31.079> well<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.680> I've<00:01:31.770> done<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.570> with<00:01:33.570> some

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
also well what I've done it with some

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.190 
also well what I've done it with some
thermal<00:01:34.110> paste<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> I've<00:01:36.750> took<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> new

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
thermal paste I put it I've took a new

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.690 
thermal paste I put it I've took a new
year<00:01:37.500> read<00:01:38.009> shrink<00:01:38.369> wrap<00:01:38.579> off<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> top<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
year read shrink wrap off the top and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.999 
year read shrink wrap off the top and
exposed<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:42.180> thin<00:01:42.840> aluminum<00:01:43.670> plate<00:01:45.229> so<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> we

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
exposed a thin aluminum plate so I we

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.770 
exposed a thin aluminum plate so I we
took<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.340> off<00:01:47.549> put<00:01:47.970> some<00:01:48.210> thermal<00:01:48.600> compound

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
took that off put some thermal compound

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.679 
took that off put some thermal compound
on<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.259> chips<00:01:49.619> put<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.640> plate<00:01:50.909> back<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.210> then

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
on the chips put that plate back on then

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.539 
on the chips put that plate back on then
thermal<00:01:52.110> compound<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.860> put<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.100> heat<00:01:53.280> sink

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
thermal compound and put that heat sink

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.569 
thermal compound and put that heat sink
on<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.290> around<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> top<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
on then just around the top there and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.429 
on then just around the top there and
Bob<00:01:56.790> bottom<00:01:57.329> RAM<00:01:57.509> size<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.990> keep<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.259> heat

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
Bob bottom RAM size to keep that heat

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.840 
Bob bottom RAM size to keep that heat
sink<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:59.960> some<00:02:01.729> high<00:02:02.729> temperature<00:02:03.619> ceylon

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
sink on some high temperature ceylon

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:21.410 
sink on some high temperature ceylon
silicon<00:02:06.590> Spacely<00:02:07.590> let's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.850 

what<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> heat<00:02:22.260> down<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:22.860> well

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.690 

Oh

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
Oh

00:02:32.700 --> 00:03:27.260 
Oh
pocket<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.330> pants<00:02:34.170> going

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:04:38.629 

all<00:03:27.510> day

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.120 

so<00:04:39.639> it's<00:04:40.539> improved<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.199> lot<00:04:41.470> because<00:04:41.919> without

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
so it's improved a lot because without

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.300 
so it's improved a lot because without
that<00:04:42.310> he<00:04:42.729> sink<00:04:43.090> on<00:04:43.300> my<00:04:43.449> tested<00:04:43.900> it<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.229> it<00:04:45.130> was

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
that he sink on my tested it and it was

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.969 
that he sink on my tested it and it was
going<00:04:45.729> up<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.650> 140<00:04:47.650> Fahrenheit<00:04:48.190> 60<00:04:49.060> degrees<00:04:49.979> so

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
going up to 140 Fahrenheit 60 degrees so

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.379 
going up to 140 Fahrenheit 60 degrees so
that's<00:04:51.160> brought<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.759> temperature<00:04:52.210> down

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
that's brought that temperature down
