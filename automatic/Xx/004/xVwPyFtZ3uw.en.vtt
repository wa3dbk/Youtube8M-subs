00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 netted spectaris and cordial 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.089
 Welcome to another tutorial 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.230
 from the series rome 2 I totally was 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.730
 the aunt patron and I will be you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.320
 a little something about this game today 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.670
 and I hope so 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
 enable a better start 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.029
 we start today off you go to the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.699
 characteristics of generals but not 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.609
 these properties are meant to be these 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 properties your generals have 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.210
 Features like authority spying 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.340
 or cunning and devotion in that of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 here secret action is called the whole and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.649
 the question is of course what bring 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.570
 these things 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.829
 it's really just what you do 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.989
 at the generals on the battlefield 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.360
 First, bring authority increased 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.370
 the sphere of influence of your commander 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.680
 in that case , even reduce it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.960
 value is so low 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.840
 that means the range with the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.250
 Commander orders can grant 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.500
 for example, a collective command of the moral 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.309
 the units in the environment increases will 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.890
 more if you give him more authority 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.210
 secret action allows yours 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.309
 commanders additional maneuvers 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.250
 learn or additional information about 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.799
 learn interesting but here are the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.770
 special actions that exist as well 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.330
 So for example, these commands he commands 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.619
 then distribute on the battlefield 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.900
 which now either the example 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.110
 moral increase the melee damage 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.180
 that or that he is so exactly moral 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 melee damage speed and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.220
 similar so additional maneuver the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.860
 are unlocked by this value 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.070
 In addition, these values ​​are suitable 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 around the fragility of the general 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.990
 towards opposing agents too 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 to reduce 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.899
 devotion is important to the lifeguard 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.250
 to motivate your generals and before 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.350
 to strengthen all things 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.909
 the devotion is that you too 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.979
 possible here for additional skills 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.009
 to unlock and the fortune of all 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.799
 of course, these features here 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.210
 is possible here in the case 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.530
 now the ability to intimidate or 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.479
 to use war cry 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.680
 that's important because you can do it 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.899
 the morale of opposing units 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.189
 reduced in authority, however 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.000
 above all things, the moral of the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.210
 own unit 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.950
 Strengthened it increases the fight damage 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.960
 and damage the floor and that is 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.460
 also very very interesting 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.890
 property on her necessarily in the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.240
 have view is this is actually her 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.430
 essentially what this is about 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.810
 characteristics for yours generally goes down 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.370
 The spies see something again 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.050
 I'm different from that too 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.300
 some said and a separate part 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.880
 made 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.420
 please do not forget your characteristics 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.010
 the characteristics euro generals 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.250
 also change through this 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.140
 tradition not the tradition in the military 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.120
 rubbish the clean as the household and 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.040
 the characteristics and the crafts 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.780
 which your general obtains this 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.790
 crafts can be multiplied 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.200
 So there are always higher ones 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.870
 level you can then choose and at 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.239
 By the way, it's the same with your household 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.380
 that you choose different ones 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.580
 So if you can not do one 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.190
 then you like the old one more 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.230
 Nine also pays attention to him outside 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.300
 here on these characteristics 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.980
 For example, it is important to see 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.160
 if your general is the public order 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.810
 pull down or not have as well 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.580
 the general special skills the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.239
 on the campaign card insert in the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.230
 provinces 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.430
 that is very very very important 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.350
 especially if you have one 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.549
 province should have taken again 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.290
 you make sure that you with the 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.190
 generally does the public 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.739
 increase order 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.049
 that is very important or that you have to 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.030
 example in a province where you many 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.500
 building erected or in a city where 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.000
 just built many buildings that we there 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.459
 a general in the building costs 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.870
 sinks that are also very often pays attention 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.370
 in this special are crafts 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.540
 show up and throw yourself down here 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.610
 always a close look and look 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.350
 ye very carefully 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.049
 and these qualities like authority 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.610
 to influence secret action and devotion 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.400
 these very qualities are yours 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.410
 character because that gets the whole 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.700
 Exactly mechanics wonder it works 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.769
 is not so well known but it will 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.060
 not too long 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.430
 and maybe it will soon 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.660
 I'll give you more tutorials 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.980
 thank you for the spot with you 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.540
 I wish all the best 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.110
