00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
heart disease we did an analysis on

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.730 
heart disease we did an analysis on
those<00:01:10.040> samples<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:12.050> extracted<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.200> fat<00:01:13.440> from

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
those samples and extracted the fat from

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
those samples and extracted the fat from
them<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:15.890> evaporate<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.130> water<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.930> solvent

them and evaporate the water the solvent

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.040 
them and evaporate the water the solvent
and<00:01:19.759> did<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:22.369> fatty<00:01:23.369> acid<00:01:23.540> analysis<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.810> that

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
and did a a fatty acid analysis on that

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.830 
and did a a fatty acid analysis on that
and<00:01:25.550> found<00:01:26.899> that<00:01:27.899> it<00:01:28.229> contained<00:01:29.450> 14<00:01:30.450> different

you<00:01:39.630> might<00:01:39.840> say<00:01:40.110> tore<00:01:41.100> our<00:01:41.490> body<00:01:42.060> system<00:01:42.660> to

you might say tore our body system to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.530 
you might say tore our body system to
our<00:01:43.229> enzyme<00:01:43.860> system<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> showed<00:01:46.490> by

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
our enzyme system that I showed by

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.130 
our enzyme system that I showed by
feeding<00:01:48.540> rats<00:01:49.110> trans<00:01:50.010> fat<00:01:50.540> but<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.720> was<00:01:51.930> in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
feeding rats trans fat but it was in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.220 
feeding rats trans fat but it was in
their<00:01:52.440> tissue<00:01:52.740> too<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:54.120> we<00:01:54.330> knew<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:56.240> this

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
their tissue too so we knew that this

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.420 
their tissue too so we knew that this
I<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:59.160> actually<00:01:59.460> in<00:02:00.080> tissue

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
I was actually in tissue

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.120 
I was actually in tissue
whenever<00:02:02.430> somebody<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.300> even<00:02:03.890> humans<00:02:04.890> ate
