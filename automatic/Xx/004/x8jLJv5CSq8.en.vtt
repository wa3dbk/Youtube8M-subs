 Hello everyone! I am Brandon of Shotgun. 

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:05.134
 I am very happy to introduce the application of Shotgun in the field of games. here we come to find out. 

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.466
 Shotgun helps you track all your projects. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.366
 Projects contain a lot of content, such as assets and levels, and the work they need to do them. 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.033
 Here are the various assets that are being produced for my game. 

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.066
 Clicking on an asset will display its details on the right. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.266
 The overview view shows all the activities that occurred for this task, such as status updates or comments given during the audit. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 The task view helps us organize the work that needs to be done. 

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:34.966
 We can also assign tasks quickly or change the schedule. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.366
 The version view is used to track the media submitted by artists for review. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.633
 Click the play icon to view the media directly in your browser. 

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.999
 We can even check the level of the asset. 

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.933
 The link between assets and levels is two-way. 

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.767
 So when viewing the details of the level, 

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:55.466
 You can also view a list of all the assets displayed on that level. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.899
 Now let's go back to the asset page. 

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:01.366
 A real-time spreadsheet is provided in the list view with all the assets made for the game. 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.433
 These views are designed with the needs of the production staff in mind. 

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:09.499
 It also includes powerful features such as filtering and layout customization. 

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.933
 By helping the producer to transfer information from the spreadsheet to Shotgun, 

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:18.300
 The entire team has access to these important real-time production information. 

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:23.333
 Artists have their own set of tools to help them organize and track feedback. 

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:27.999
 The inbox shows all the activities in my task, as well as the various things I care about. 

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.933
 I can focus on people, assets and tasks. 

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:35.633
 I will be notified when the relevant person completes the work, so I can start my own work. 

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:39.300
 On the My Tasks page, you can see a list of all the tasks assigned to me. 

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:42.333
 When I click on the texture mapping task for this asset that is being processed, 

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:48.599
 All details about this task will be displayed, including comments and the version I submitted. 

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:51.933
 I can also directly launch the various programs that I need to use to get into the job. 

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:55.299
 For this texture mapping task, I started into Photoshop. 

00:01:55.333 --> 00:02:00.133
 A series of applications loaded within the program that allow me to continue the work I left before. 

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:05.533
 Make changes and then publish the work results when you are done. 

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:09.699
 Because Shotgun knows the names of the tasks and assets I am dealing with, it will handle all the naming for me. 

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:14.933
 It will put my work in the correct location on disk or in a source file library like Perforce. 

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:19.133
 This will save artists time and focus on art creation. 

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:20.333
 In addition to Photoshop, 

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:27.966
 We also support existing integrations with programs such as Maya, MotionBuilder, and 3d Studio Max. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.599
 At the same time, after the supervisor pays attention to their artists, when there is a new job to be reviewed, the relevant notice will be received in the inbox. 

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:39.333
 They can play the media, annotate the frames, and send the comments back directly to the artist. 

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:45.199
 Since all of this is done in the browser, the team can easily provide and receive feedback no matter where they are. 

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:50.433
 The artist will receive feedback in the inbox and proceed to the next round of work. 

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:53.833
