00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.990
 tell them that for this start of 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.990

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.210
 mind level while the fringe 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.680
 cross section we can observe already in high 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.280
 verapaz to the place of the city ​​of 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.960
 guatemala a maximum of law 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.790
 the afternoon weather conditions 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.620

 degrees centigrade we already have in the 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.440
 minimal and as well informed them in 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.089
 register in angola itself could 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.430
 reach even 0 degrees in hours 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.710
 at dawn in ruling the minimum 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.690

 while none with 14 degrees 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.530
 centigrade the recommendations that 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.880
 you warm up very well in hours of 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.320
 the night since the temperatures 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.540
 will decrease this because 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.340
 we continue with north wind you have to 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.830
 embrace the soldier since this moment 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.390

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.550
 the 17 hours with 31 minutes the phase 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.500
 mole for tonight is for new moon and 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.970
 this is how we conclude this journey 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.560
 what we do for the national territory 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.060

 minimums could drastically decrease 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.289
 reaching reaching even 0 degrees 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.520

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.700
