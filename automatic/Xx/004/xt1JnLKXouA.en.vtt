melee weapon in there that's something I

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.880 
melee weapon in there that's something I
don't<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.049> we've<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.530> quite<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.710> while

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
be the best and also when will these be

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
be the best and also when will these be
coming<00:01:47.009> we're<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.250> too<00:01:47.430> sure<00:01:47.460> yet<00:01:47.939> maybe<00:01:48.180> they

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
coming we're not too sure yet maybe they

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.490 
coming we're not too sure yet maybe they
could<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.689> coming<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> highest

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
could be coming out when the highest

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800 
could be coming out when the highest
mouth<00:01:49.890> maybe<00:01:50.490> these<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> heist<00:01:51.420> weapons

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
mouth maybe these are the heist weapons

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.149 
mouth maybe these are the heist weapons
who<00:01:51.930> knows<00:01:52.170> maybe<00:01:52.439> they<00:01:52.619> could<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.890> used<00:01:53.070> for

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
who knows maybe they could be used for

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.649 
who knows maybe they could be used for
the<00:01:53.280> highest<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.670> would<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.820> awesome<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.329> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the highest that would be awesome but I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.030 
the highest that would be awesome but I
think<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.170> we're<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.560> getting<00:01:55.680> two

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
think that we're going to be getting two

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
think that we're going to be getting two
of<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:57.030> two<00:01:57.270> different<00:01:57.630> DLC<00:01:58.079> pipes

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
of them in there two different DLC pipes

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.170 
of them in there two different DLC pipes
because<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> DLC<00:01:59.399> pack<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.729> normally<00:02:00.060> have

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
because in a DLC pack we normally have

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.929 
because in a DLC pack we normally have
one<00:02:00.390> weapon<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:00.990> maybe<00:02:01.590> there's<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> food<00:02:02.399> for

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
one weapon so maybe there's a food for

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.020 
one weapon so maybe there's a food for
DLC<00:02:03.450> packs<00:02:03.899> coming<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.649> soon<00:02:04.860> maybe<00:02:05.189> wear<00:02:05.460> one
