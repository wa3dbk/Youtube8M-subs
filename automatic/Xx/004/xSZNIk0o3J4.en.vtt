except when I need to chaff to reach my
hands<00:00:24.660> over<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:26.060> I'm<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.660> review<00:00:27.779> this

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
hands over and I'm here to review this

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.429 
hands over and I'm here to review this
so<00:00:29.160> basically<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> think<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:31.170> pretty

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
so basically what I think is it's pretty

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.430 
so basically what I think is it's pretty
good<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.769> fits<00:00:31.890> my<00:00:32.189> hand<00:00:32.219> well<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:34.020> too<00:00:34.170> bad<00:00:34.290> it

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
good it fits my hand well but too bad it

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.080 
good it fits my hand well but too bad it
can't<00:00:34.469> show<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> other<00:00:34.980> hand<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.760> if

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
can't show the other hand because I if

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
can't show the other hand because I if
you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> reflection<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.590> am

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
you can see the reflection I am

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260 
you can see the reflection I am
recording<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> other<00:00:38.399> hand<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.120> it's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
recording to the other hand but if it's

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.049 
recording to the other hand but if it's
the<00:00:39.629> my<00:00:39.960> hand<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.309> thing<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.640> find<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the my hand well the thing I find is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.290 
the my hand well the thing I find is
that<00:00:42.410> this<00:00:43.410> trigger<00:00:43.860> here<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.399> little<00:00:44.910> too

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that this trigger here is a little too

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.470 
that this trigger here is a little too
stiff<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> little<00:00:46.710> too<00:00:46.829> far<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.149> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
stiff and a little too far down so I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.290 
stiff and a little too far down so I
have<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> bend<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.739> finger<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:51.030> reach<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
have to bend my finger it to reach the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.770 
have to bend my finger it to reach the
trigger<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.420> does

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
trigger as you can see like that it does

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.139 
trigger as you can see like that it does
not<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.199> comfortable<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.969> get

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
not look comfortable and but you get

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
not look comfortable and but you get
used<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.809> guess<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
used to it I guess and then the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.270 
used to it I guess and then the
joysticks<00:00:59.850> when<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> move<00:01:00.750> down<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.410> kind<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
joysticks when you move down it kind of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.579 
joysticks when you move down it kind of
stretches<00:01:02.579> your<00:01:02.850> hand<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:03.870> oh<00:01:04.049> I'm

back<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.170> review<00:01:11.600> when<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.689> put<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.930> down

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
back to the review when you put it down

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
back to the review when you put it down
you<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.439> little<00:01:13.740> stretches<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:14.400> thumb<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> bit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000

and<00:01:15.259> I<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.799> know<00:01:16.979> why<00:01:17.100> they<00:01:17.280> put<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and I don't know why they put the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
and I don't know why they put the
joystick<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.000> me<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.560> might

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
joystick here me for like if they might

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.440 
joystick here me for like if they might
get<00:01:20.040> sued<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.520> put<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> where<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> Xbox

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
get sued if they put it where the Xbox

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.440 
get sued if they put it where the Xbox
control<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.020> from<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> original<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:26.450> yeah

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
control is from the original one so yeah

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990 
control is from the original one so yeah
and<00:01:27.960> what<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> find<00:01:29.250> interesting<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.729> there's<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and what I find interesting is there's a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.590 
and what I find interesting is there's a
robot<00:01:30.270> vibration<00:01:31.020> thing<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.670> there

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
robot vibration thing on it right there

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.950 
robot vibration thing on it right there
so<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.100> want<00:01:35.600> vibrating<00:01:36.600> which

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so if you don't want vibrating which

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
so if you don't want vibrating which
some<00:01:37.200> people<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.860> annoyed<00:01:38.070> by<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.700> press

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
some people get annoyed by just press

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.100 
some people get annoyed by just press
that<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> vibration<00:01:39.720> will<00:01:39.810> turn<00:01:39.960> off

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that and the vibration will turn off

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.249 
that and the vibration will turn off
also<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.549> program<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.750> any<00:01:43.020> game

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
also you can program this with any game

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
also you can program this with any game
works<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.619> any<00:01:43.770> game<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.820> it's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
works with any game I think is it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.170 
works with any game I think is it's
Wireless<00:01:45.950> like<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> Xbox<00:01:47.430> controller<00:01:47.909> but

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
Wireless like the Xbox controller but

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.510 
Wireless like the Xbox controller but
with<00:01:48.329> PC<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.049> only<00:01:49.170> needs<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.619> two<00:01:49.979> double-a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
with PC it only needs these two double-a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.090 
with PC it only needs these two double-a
batteries<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.229> thing<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.560> quite<00:01:52.799> heavy

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
batteries and this thing is quite heavy

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.560 
batteries and this thing is quite heavy
I<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.329> that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
I like it like that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.170 
I like it like that
