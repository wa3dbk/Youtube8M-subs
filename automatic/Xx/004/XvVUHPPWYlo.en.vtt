with<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.880> frog<00:02:03.180> who<00:02:03.750> I've<00:02:03.899> become<00:02:04.310> well

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
with this frog who I've become well

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
with this frog who I've become well
acquainted<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.479> what<00:02:06.689> does<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.869> actually

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
acquainted to but what does it actually

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.160 
acquainted to but what does it actually
look<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> picture<00:02:08.910> at<00:02:09.239> 1.8

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
look like when you get a picture at 1.8

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.400 
look like when you get a picture at 1.8
first<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.800> picture<00:02:10.830> at<00:02:11.330> 22<00:02:12.330> what's<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:13.230> on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
first a picture at 22 what's going on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.820 
first a picture at 22 what's going on
here

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
here

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.730 
here
well<00:02:14.250> what's<00:02:14.430> going<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.930> your<00:02:16.440> depth

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
well what's going on is that your depth

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.820 
well what's going on is that your depth
of<00:02:16.920> field<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.460> changing<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:18.330> shallow<00:02:19.230> depth<00:02:19.680> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
of field is changing a shallow depth of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.140 
of field is changing a shallow depth of
field<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.250> what<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.580> see<00:02:20.850> when<00:02:21.030> you're

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
field is what you see when you're

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.960 
field is what you see when you're
shooting<00:02:21.330> at<00:02:21.570> 1.8<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:22.350> very<00:02:22.710> narrow<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.820> your

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
shooting at 1.8 it's very narrow so your

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.600 
shooting at 1.8 it's very narrow so your
focus<00:02:24.420> point<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:25.050> your<00:02:25.620> area<00:02:25.980> focus<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.550> very

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
focus point or your area focus is very

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.630 
focus point or your area focus is very
small<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.990> numbers<00:02:28.410> go<00:02:28.650> up<00:02:28.950> all<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.400> way

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
small as the numbers go up all the way

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.540 
small as the numbers go up all the way
here<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:29.970> 22<00:02:30.630> your<00:02:31.380> focus<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.950> changing<00:02:32.520> so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
here to 22 your focus is changing so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.860 
here to 22 your focus is changing so
more<00:02:32.880> things<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.270> going<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.630> focus

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
more things are going to be in focus

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.560 
more things are going to be in focus
from<00:02:34.200> front<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.770> back<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:36.000> important

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
from front to back so that's important

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.480 
from front to back so that's important
to<00:02:36.660> keep<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.960> mind<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.860> we're<00:02:38.010> doing<00:02:38.310> here

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
to keep in mind so what we're doing here

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.830 
to keep in mind so what we're doing here
is<00:02:38.520> i'm<00:02:38.640> going<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.820> photograph<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.450> frog<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
is i'm going to photograph the frog and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.380 
is i'm going to photograph the frog and
i'm<00:02:40.500> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.740> focus<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.340> its<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.640> at<00:02:41.970> one

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
i'm going to focus in on its I at one

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.970 
i'm going to focus in on its I at one
point<00:02:42.630> eight<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.470> then<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:43.650> going<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.800> work

point eight and then I'm going to work

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.070 
point eight and then I'm going to work
my<00:02:44.040> way<00:02:44.340> all<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.820> way<00:02:44.850> up<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> 22<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.930> you

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
can see what's happening to the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.650 
can see what's happening to the
background<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.150> we're<00:02:48.240> going<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.390> talk

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
background then we're going to talk

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.630 
background then we're going to talk
about<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.200> figure<00:02:49.290> out<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.340> know<00:02:50.370> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
about it and figure out you know the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.790 
about it and figure out you know the
little<00:02:50.760> subtleties<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.660> are<00:02:51.870> going<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.290> so

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
little subtleties that are going on so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.290 
little subtleties that are going on so
right<00:02:53.160> now<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.760> camera<00:02:54.030> set<00:02:54.209> to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
right now I have the camera set to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.449 
right now I have the camera set to
aperture<00:02:54.720> priority<00:02:55.080> but<00:02:55.860> aperture<00:02:56.220> priority

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
aperture priority but aperture priority

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.970 
aperture priority but aperture priority
means<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.910> i<00:02:57.090> am<00:02:57.240> setting<00:02:57.540> my<00:02:57.870> aperture<00:02:58.260> i'm

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
means that i am setting my aperture i'm

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.760 
means that i am setting my aperture i'm
picking<00:02:59.580> where<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> want<00:03:00.209> it<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:01.170> camera

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
picking where I want it and the camera

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.770 
picking where I want it and the camera
is<00:03:01.890> then<00:03:02.370> going<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.820> select<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.480> shutter

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
is then going to select the shutter

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.590 
is then going to select the shutter
speed<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> proper<00:03:05.160> exposure<00:03:05.640> let's<00:03:06.450> shoot

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
speed for a proper exposure let's shoot

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.900 
speed for a proper exposure let's shoot
at<00:03:06.750> one<00:03:06.900> point<00:03:07.140> eight<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.890> I'm<00:03:07.980> wet<00:03:08.130> 1.8<00:03:08.730> right

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
at one point eight so I'm wet 1.8 right

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.110 
at one point eight so I'm wet 1.8 right
now<00:03:09.030> I'm<00:03:09.330> focused<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.380> frogs<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.220> boom

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
now I'm focused in on the frogs I boom

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.500 
now I'm focused in on the frogs I boom
that's<00:03:12.870> one<00:03:13.170> point<00:03:13.410> eight<00:03:14.030> let's<00:03:15.030> take<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.390> to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
that's one point eight let's take it to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.270 
that's one point eight let's take it to
f<00:03:15.660> 2.8<00:03:16.850> there<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> nice<00:03:18.300> smile<00:03:19.130> now<00:03:20.130> I'm

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
f 2.8 there is a nice smile now I'm

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280 
f 2.8 there is a nice smile now I'm
making<00:03:20.489> sure<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.239> almost<00:03:21.570> did<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:21.989> here<00:03:22.230> I'm

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
making sure I almost did this here I'm

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.410 
making sure I almost did this here I'm
going<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.500> shoot<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.830> there<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.580> cut<00:03:23.940> her<00:03:24.060> finger

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
going to shoot it there I cut her finger

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.120 
going to shoot it there I cut her finger
off<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.750> saw<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.530> that's<00:03:25.709> why<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:25.920> didn't

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
off and I saw it so that's why I didn't

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.920 
off and I saw it so that's why I didn't
shoot<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.370> initially<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:27.239> I'm

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
shoot it initially but now I'm

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.449 
shoot it initially but now I'm
recomposing<00:03:29.989> boom<00:03:30.989> I'm<00:03:31.650> making<00:03:32.070> sure<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.400> I

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
recomposing boom I'm making sure that I

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.790 
recomposing boom I'm making sure that I
have<00:03:32.610> her<00:03:32.790> finger<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.330> there<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:34.290> do<00:03:34.350> so

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
have her finger in there and I do so

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.220 
have her finger in there and I do so
that<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.040> really<00:03:35.489> sharp<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.750> see<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.140> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
that is really sharp you can see in the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.930 
that is really sharp you can see in the
pictures<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.830> background<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.550> nice<00:03:38.760> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
pictures that the background is nice and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.580 
pictures that the background is nice and
blown<00:03:39.150> out<00:03:39.390> when<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.630> talk<00:03:39.840> about<00:03:39.870> blowing<00:03:40.350> out

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
blown out when we talk about blowing out

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.280 
blown out when we talk about blowing out
it's<00:03:41.130> compressed<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.239> that's<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.019> point<00:03:43.170> of

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
it's compressed so that's the point of

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.470 
it's compressed so that's the point of
using<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.620> piece<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.220> glass<00:03:44.400> like<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.390> i'm

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
using a piece of glass like this and i'm

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.820 
using a piece of glass like this and i'm
probably<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.989> switch<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.530> bigger

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
probably going to switch to the bigger

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.860 
probably going to switch to the bigger
piece<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.190> glass<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.670> 300<00:03:48.150> 28<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.660> few

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
piece of glass of 300 28 in a few

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.810 
piece of glass of 300 28 in a few
minutes<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.560> we<00:03:49.830> can<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:50.190> how<00:03:50.550> we<00:03:50.610> can

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
minutes so that we can see how we can

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.759 
minutes so that we can see how we can
really<00:03:51.360> compress<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.900> background<00:03:52.320> step<00:03:52.620> away

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
really compress the background step away

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.650 
really compress the background step away
from<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.070> tree<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.580> make<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> parking<00:03:54.540> lot

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
from the tree and make a parking lot

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.180 
from the tree and make a parking lot
look<00:03:55.260> really<00:03:55.530> awesome<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.920> we're<00:03:56.010> going<00:03:56.100> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
look really awesome so we're going to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.690 
look really awesome so we're going to
come<00:03:56.370> back<00:03:56.550> to<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.820> in<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.690> couple<00:03:57.840> seconds

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
come back to that in a couple seconds

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.120 
come back to that in a couple seconds
well<00:03:59.700> why<00:03:59.820> don't<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.090> sit<00:04:00.330> back<00:04:00.510> on<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:01.130> just

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
well why don't you sit back on it just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.100 
well why don't you sit back on it just
face<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:02.820> way<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.209> rest<00:04:03.570> your<00:04:03.660> tuchus

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
face that way but just rest your tuchus

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.370 
face that way but just rest your tuchus
own<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.570> now<00:04:06.600> we're<00:04:06.870> ready<00:04:07.050> to

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
own on it so now we're ready to

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.680 
own on it so now we're ready to
photograph<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.310> swing<00:04:08.580> here<00:04:08.850> I'm<00:04:09.060> locking<00:04:09.360> in

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
photograph the swing here I'm locking in

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.860 
photograph the swing here I'm locking in
on<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.410> tripod<00:04:10.680> just<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.610> have<00:04:11.730> a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
on the tripod just so that I have a

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.360 
on the tripod just so that I have a
something<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:13.110> not<00:04:13.230> moving<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.250> each

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
something that's not moving so that each

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.729 
something that's not moving so that each
image<00:04:14.610> kind<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.360> stays<00:04:15.510> similar<00:04:15.959> right<00:04:16.590> now

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
image kind of stays similar right now

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.280 
image kind of stays similar right now
I'm<00:04:16.890> set<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.419> shutter<00:04:18.419> priority<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.200> that

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
I'm set to shutter priority and that

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.080 
I'm set to shutter priority and that
means<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.160> i<00:04:20.340> am<00:04:20.400> setting<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.880> shutter

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
means that i am setting the shutter

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.400 
means that i am setting the shutter
speed<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.630> camera<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:22.020> going<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
speed and the camera is going to do the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.900 
speed and the camera is going to do the
rest<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:22.979> work<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.310> make<00:04:23.460> sure<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.760> it's

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
rest of the work to make sure that it's

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.000 
rest of the work to make sure that it's
exposed<00:04:24.390> properly<00:04:25.080> so<00:04:25.260> i'm<00:04:25.620> going<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.830> start

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
exposed properly so i'm going to start

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.379 
exposed properly so i'm going to start
at<00:04:26.160> one-tenth<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.180> a

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
at one-tenth of a

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.719 
at one-tenth of a
second<00:04:27.689> remember<00:04:28.319> how<00:04:28.409> slow<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.740> was<00:04:28.949> you

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
second remember how slow that was you

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.239 
second remember how slow that was you
could<00:04:29.879> hear<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.419> sound<00:04:30.719> of<00:04:31.080> how<00:04:31.919> slow<00:04:32.219> that

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:32.249 
could hear the sound of how slow that

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.489 
could hear the sound of how slow that
was<00:04:32.580> when<00:04:32.789> we<00:04:32.909> were<00:04:33.120> testing<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.229> letting<00:04:34.439> you

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:34.499 
was when we were testing and letting you

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.230 
was when we were testing and letting you
hear<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.919> different<00:04:35.280> shutter<00:04:35.490> speeds<00:04:35.789> now

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
hear the different shutter speeds now

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.909 
hear the different shutter speeds now
let's<00:04:36.479> see<00:04:36.599> what<00:04:36.749> happens<00:04:37.080> when<00:04:37.289> we<00:04:37.650> move<00:04:37.889> the

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
let's see what happens when we move the

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.029 
let's see what happens when we move the
swing<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:39.259> shoot<00:04:40.259> it<00:04:40.409> at<00:04:40.529> a<00:04:40.560> tenth<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:40.949> a

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
swing and shoot it at a tenth of a

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.589 
swing and shoot it at a tenth of a
second<00:04:43.849> so<00:04:44.849> I'm<00:04:44.939> going<00:04:44.969> to<00:04:45.120> try<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.300> capture

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
second so I'm going to try to capture

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.499 
second so I'm going to try to capture
the<00:04:45.810> swing<00:04:46.020> at<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.229> very<00:04:46.409> bottom<00:04:46.650> boom<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.909> as

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
the swing at the very bottom boom and as

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.089 
the swing at the very bottom boom and as
we<00:04:48.659> look<00:04:48.840> at<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.050> swing<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.710> can<00:04:49.889> see<00:04:50.069> that

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
we look at the swing you can see that

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.679 
we look at the swing you can see that
it's<00:04:50.580> kind<00:04:50.789> of<00:04:50.849> hard<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.120> see<00:04:51.300> because<00:04:51.419> it's

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
it's kind of hard to see because it's

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.230 
it's kind of hard to see because it's
actually<00:04:51.930> blurring<00:04:52.639> its<00:04:53.639> blurring<00:04:53.939> because

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
actually blurring its blurring because

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.360 
actually blurring its blurring because
the<00:04:54.330> shutter<00:04:54.569> is<00:04:54.659> moving<00:04:55.139> really<00:04:55.529> slow<00:04:56.099> and

the shutter is moving really slow and

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.610 
the shutter is moving really slow and
there<00:04:56.909> is<00:04:57.029> some<00:04:57.180> motion<00:04:57.629> to<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.050> swing<00:04:58.409> so<00:04:58.529> we

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
there is some motion to the swing so we

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.249 
there is some motion to the swing so we
have<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.889> think<00:04:59.129> what<00:04:59.849> do<00:05:00.270> we<00:05:00.389> need<00:05:00.539> to<00:05:00.599> do<00:05:00.900> to

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
have to think what do we need to do to

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.379 
have to think what do we need to do to
freeze<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.919> swing<00:05:02.279> that<00:05:02.460> is<00:05:02.580> moving<00:05:02.939> let's
