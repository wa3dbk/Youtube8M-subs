has brought us a drive that has much

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.160 
has brought us a drive that has much
more<00:00:52.860> capacity<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.120> costs<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> fraction<00:00:54.719> of

more capacity but costs a fraction of
the<00:00:55.350> amount<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.680> would<00:00:55.739> pay<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.190> an<00:00:56.280> SSD<00:00:56.960> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the amount you would pay for an SSD so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.330 
the amount you would pay for an SSD so
let's<00:00:58.109> start<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.440> by<00:00:58.469> taking<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.920> closer<00:00:59.160> look

let's start out by taking a closer look
at<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> goflex<00:01:00.090> system<00:01:00.660> right<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.410> have

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
at the goflex system right here we have

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.200 
at the goflex system right here we have
two<00:01:01.800> versions<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.309> their<00:01:02.460> drives<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.180> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
mention this will only provide data so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.370 
mention this will only provide data so
it<00:02:31.170> actually<00:02:31.350> won't<00:02:31.710> work<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:33.380> eSATA

now the momentus xt actually has a

now the momentus xt actually has a
built-in<00:04:12.060> algorithm<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.320> it's<00:04:13.530> independent

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
built-in algorithm so it's independent

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.740 
built-in algorithm so it's independent
of<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.190> operating<00:04:14.580> system<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.630> will

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
determine which data you access on the

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.490 
determine which data you access on the
drive<00:04:17.730> most<00:04:17.970> often<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.720> will<00:04:18.870> preload<00:04:19.320> that

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
drive most often it will preload that

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.650 
drive most often it will preload that
data<00:04:19.739> onto<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.280> SSD<00:04:20.850> portion<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.390> drive

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
so when you're accessing it so for

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.190 
so when you're accessing it so for

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
momentus xt actually improved over time

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.450 
momentus xt actually improved over time
as<00:04:40.229> we<00:04:40.350> tested<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.830> more<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:41.160> more<00:04:41.310> often

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
as we tested it more and more often

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.950 
as we tested it more and more often
that's<00:04:41.820> because<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.240> algorithm<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:42.870> the

that's because the algorithm in the

that's because the algorithm in the
drive<00:04:43.199> was<00:04:43.500> learning<00:04:43.949> what<00:04:44.100> data<00:04:44.340> we<00:04:44.430> were
