00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.560
 Hmm 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.840
 Simply put, the body and mind were set for the final qualifying, so we decided to prepare 23 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.140
 By saying 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:21.730
 Since a 9 Kawachi masu painful it from the opposite Kanto that you have Well failed function 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:27.459
 Stimulate the muscles and bring them to the final state in the best condition 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.160
 Then it was decided to be 23, so my team's sense of oneness or my own opinion 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:36.340
 To hear off people of opinion and say properly 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.130
 And the player who thinks of various things can pull out and can play an adjustment role 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.690
 Wind say selfish 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.930
 Is it going to be preparing the mind whether you can get the communication properly? 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.000
 Got a week with two goals 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.260
 Well that Maeko clearly also target if you are prima facie relieved or wait 23 days 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.540
 What 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.470
 It became clear that the goal time was to start from September 6th, so something about that 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.610
 I have to 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:06.519
 How in terms of seek Fu thing Tteyuu say that knowing the so-so results rose 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:10.250
 I think, but I still think about 60% and 70% of the finish for myself 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:14.069
 I will go to Thailand just before that 26th, so in that 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.940
 Is in something good something that over and sperm us 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:22.970
 It is more often the Fu that Do When you go to make 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:25.930
 The team was able to leave even voice in many parts in that name to the application-finally 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.790
 Overall and 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.540
 I feel like I'm getting well and I'm well prepared at first . 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.520
 Yes as an individual 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.689
 The other day specific minute 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.080
 There also 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.980
 Is a spiritual part 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.950
 In a difficult situation 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:49.100
 As we are confronted from now on 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:51.300
 Therefore we control the kind of spirit that we can control ourselves 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.510
 I think I was trained 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:59.380
 At first the flight as a team is also Kyoto ok 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.440
 Because it is the first goal is to say final new species 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.070
 While being aware of that 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.340
 I also play my team 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:12.370
 I think Fu called Do not want full accuracy that you can now own while also thinking play 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:19.060
 If it was a challenge in the previous camp 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:25.000
 But because there was a hand that ends up a little stall the last to go is used aware of there 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.249
 I always try to play the same thing on the last day, so I can do the best play on the last day 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.460
 I was conscious of 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:31.700
 The task is 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:36.540
 I think it has become, but after all it is one's own taste 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:42.510
 Or a tool path we become care If you do not pursue there Nakatani aimed Yamada 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:47.070
 Made in Asia is close, there is a sense of unity as a team and after all everyone is excited 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:51.150
 I think I 'm going to enjoy there and try it there 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.390
 It is also possible for this team to go to the world after all in this team 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.060
 Yappa carriage Den also probably so 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:01.889
 It is your goal to be an Asian champion and go to the world tournament 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.820
 Both myself and as a team 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.880
 Put out seminal full force 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.410
 Asia 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.410
 I think if I become an Asian champion
