your<00:04:51.960> laptop<00:04:52.350> that's<00:04:52.710> pretty<00:04:52.890> cool<00:04:54.410> yeah<00:04:56.210> so

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
your laptop that's pretty cool yeah so

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.540 
your laptop that's pretty cool yeah so
um<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:58.710> got<00:04:58.890> your<00:04:59.010> browser<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:02.040> camcorder

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
you can get a driver for your laptop
