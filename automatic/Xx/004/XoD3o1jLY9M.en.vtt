00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
interesting feature that I've never seen

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.359 
interesting feature that I've never seen
wide<00:01:45.360> before<00:01:45.540> from<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> Happy<00:01:46.320> Meal<00:01:46.439> toy<00:01:46.649> has<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
wide before from a Happy Meal toy has a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.530 
wide before from a Happy Meal toy has a
smelling<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.540> scent<00:01:49.399> scented<00:01:50.399> feature<00:01:50.640> so

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
smelling or scent scented feature so

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.600 
smelling or scent scented feature so
that's<00:01:51.780> interesting<00:01:51.990> okay<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that's interesting okay so I think I

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.060 
that's interesting okay so I think I
just<00:01:53.640> fixed<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> thing<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:55.439> mechanism<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
just fixed the thing the mechanism it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.499 
just fixed the thing the mechanism it
didn't<00:01:56.490> seem<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.729> he<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:56.969> moving<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.360> lot

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
didn't seem like he was moving a lot

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.069 
didn't seem like he was moving a lot
earlier<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> when<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.700> push<00:01:59.909> them<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.990> like

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
earlier so when you push them just like

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.330 
earlier so when you push them just like
any<00:02:01.259> dog<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.210> they<00:02:03.329> walk

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.249 

so<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.180> tell<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.570> he<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.080> move

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so you can you can tell that he you move

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.280 
so you can you can tell that he you move
side<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.530> side<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> there<00:02:12.570> you<00:02:12.720> go<00:02:12.870> that's<00:02:13.050> his

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
Louise definitely is a nice toy I do I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.160 
Louise definitely is a nice toy I do I
kind<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.310> wish<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.489> you'd<00:03:18.300> be<00:03:18.720> able<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.959> walk

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
kind of wish that you'd be able to walk

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.780 
kind of wish that you'd be able to walk
a<00:03:19.200> little<00:03:19.440> more<00:03:19.560> move<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.220> little<00:03:20.310> bit<00:03:20.430> more<00:03:20.489> but

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
a little more move a little bit more but

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.130 
a little more move a little bit more but
I<00:03:20.820> guess<00:03:21.060> that's<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.330> best<00:03:21.510> they<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.750> do<00:03:21.930> and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
I guess that's the best they can do and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.340 
I guess that's the best they can do and
that's<00:03:22.320> totally<00:03:22.470> fine<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:24.050> as<00:03:25.050> long<00:03:25.170> as<00:03:25.260> you

guys<00:03:25.470> can<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.550> guess<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.300> faster<00:03:27.660> you

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750

push<00:03:27.930> him<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.260> faster<00:03:28.650> he<00:03:28.680> moves<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:30.239> there

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
push him the faster he moves so there

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:39.590
