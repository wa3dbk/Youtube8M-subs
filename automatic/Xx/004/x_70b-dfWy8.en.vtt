00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 all right 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.389
 hello fans and creatives of the comic 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.580
 I am big welcome to my studio 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.040
 as I had told you in other videos 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.930
 one of the many when he believes the 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.699
 channel is that I really like to teach 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.289
 I like that people know what they already know 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.119
 learned during the time I've been 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.500
 working comics investigating comics me 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.150
 the theory part really interests me 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.679
 It is very interesting to know how the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.929
 things just by reading the comics and 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.279
 not how their creatives work and I think that 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.740
 I can teach many things for that 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.079
 I decided to open a course on how to draw 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.000
 comic books with comic jan something that gave me 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.980
 a lot that is that I for a long time 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.990
 when I started bringing comics 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.700
 base that I put on is that I wanted 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.830
 write a book on how to draw comics 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.360
 not the fact that he wanted to get me 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.160
 just make this book for 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.260
 published someday but logical one 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.460
 kind of homework if in little style book 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 how to stop comics would touch 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.850
 learn all aspects of how 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.640
 draw to be able to teach that 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.590
 efficiently I will finally share 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.360
 the work that I have done for many 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.530
 years in the creation of this book that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.220
 is basically summarized these two 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.220
 stretches 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.530
 and here in these pages you will find 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.040
 all the material that I am going to teach you 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.860
 in the course of how to draw comics 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.260
 let's see anatomy for our 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.900
 activities let's see how to leave fabrics 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.870
 how to draw action figures how 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.370
 draw textures we will see many 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.230
 themes that you can serve them 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.720
 what the composition the layout 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.370
 club have realized the first 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.080
 channel videos so many focus on the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.390
 theoretical part or concepts of early 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.520
 creation but not so much towards the part of 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.080
 game because he did or at least had the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.360
 concept that there was already a lot of content 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.950
 with respect to how to draw comics but 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.690
 then researching more I realized 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.000
 that what there is to draw at least 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.410
 what in Spanish is not very complete or 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.820
 what made another video also in others 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.220
 channels that how to leave anatomy for 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.600
 comics between begin in the arm the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.990
 arm muscles is called the deltoid 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.670
 the triceps the biceps the blah blah blah blah 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.550
 That does not interest me because not aware 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.560
 the function that have the form that 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.810
 they have different muscles 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.280
 different bones in office and why 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.709
 They are there and how can it help us 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.360
 create or dissect how muscles work 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.900
 it seems very little to what he spoke only 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.239
 the education video 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.610
 and he knows how to draw well but he does not have the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.530
 clear concepts of why or how the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.819
 drawing is mixed with the narrative part 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.620
 in young people it's not just about 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.970
 drawing then I want to do a course 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.129
 first, it is quite practical that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.689
 serve you who works for you 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.959
 I realized that I need to make a 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.280
 course that is truly useful and that deals 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.569
 all those things that suddenly are not 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.459
 in our books are not other courses 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.750
 that I even realized how I 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.040
 he told people that suddenly he is 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.810
 riding videos that do not know much what 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.269
 what are you doing a few things 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 try to give a knowledge that does not 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.120
 they also have their people who are 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.269
 publishing free is posting things 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.859
 that are copied from other people and that 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.989
 us life because then people 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.940
 there is that kind of type of videos 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.230
 books are sharing us the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.150
 knowledge as I would simply say 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.439
 they are seeing what is another person and 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.629
 has copied them as is in Haiti 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.920
 they know about those videos since they do not learn 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.909
 because how can you learn a 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.439
 person who does not know what he is doing 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.019
 regarding this course is something that 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.189
 Inma also enough power sharing 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.019
 all of these suddenly believe all 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.519
 things that I learned from how to draw and 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.560
 certain data I do not know to try to 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.420
 teach them formulas but a way 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.069
 different from thinking to go to the world to 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.840
 that you are the ones who can 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.700
 implement their own formulas 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.290
 in an efficient way that is not treated 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.640
 of copying work other people by is 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.680
 that I want that is known very practical and 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.110
 encompass everything that has to do with the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.599
 drawing so that truth can be removed 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.190
 taste and learn a lot from the first 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.900
 video of the course is going to be a bit like 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.400
 that part watching how to change the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.410
 mentality to be able to translate into the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.330
 drawing obviously if they want everyone 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.690
 the videos reach you among your customers 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.519
 tn channel and I like to share what 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.140
 than other people who suddenly 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.510
 are interested in the subject they can 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.730
 access it I hope you enjoy it very much 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.380
 the drawing course but they learn 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.380
 quite and I'm sorry day
