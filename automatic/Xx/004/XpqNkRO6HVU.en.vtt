00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.650
 the regional forum of orchids 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.059
 It is a well-proposed proposal 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 which will introduce the local people to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.939
 all in the kindness that the orchids offer us not from having a pretty 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:18.679
 flower 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.249
 have a perfect aromas 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.939
 from having 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.999
 they exhibit the economy 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.559
 and more than anything the benefit that our idea is to be able to keep our children 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.280
 grow up 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
 water 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.440
 I've been in the wild orchid research for four years 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.890
 for living in the region 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.040
 we have therefore the idea of â€‹â€‹being able to manage a forum 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.420
 is so that all people can visualize 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 and to know the orchids from its structure 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.500
 but in a way in the dialect that we handle 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.539
 must translate all the work that is going is going to do 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.820
 and to be able to let them know about the objective of the work we have 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.900
 turn on 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.479
 of this forum before which we are little aware of the community 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.310
 and teach them work of 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.380
 care 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.780
 In the environment, a tree was finally taken care of 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 and from there they will see many things you see us on TV we have to teach 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.550
 to our people 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.260
 I think it is impossible 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.540
 It will be a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.070
 a very important event not only at the local level its national level 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.670
 because we are invited 'specialist set points in the matter will show 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.670
 their experiences and show before how to produce 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.540
 in its natural environment without so many expenses without so many inputs 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 then the local people will be able to appreciate this knowledge and develop it 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.790
 it is very important that this forum be held 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.370
 so that it is made known to the people the great importance that our 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.310
 society 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.850
 and that they need it 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.459
 it's an idea to remove or ravines 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.730
 According to some witnesses, it takes a whole process and it is also possible to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.760
 get in some other way an economic opportunity for them 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.819
 botanical garden like 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.399
 ac 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.609
 despite the fact that the first dismissals really worried 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.129
 for the experience in this case 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.909
 that is drivers 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.349
 this campaign practically 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.009
 it is designed 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.059
 so that the young Chinese and adults 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:49.579
 there when they give those tours through the countryside for certain regions do not see 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:55.219
 tempted plucked the flora a plant I did not come to this campaign to be able to give 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.489
 and spread 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.489
 the in some of these plants the destruction 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.669
 with this campaign we intend to impact 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.549
 regionally in the population 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.639
 why before doing that look for advice 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.870
 and can consider 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.829
 a sustainable situation 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.249
 we hope it has a great impact from the children so that it gives them 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.839
 small from 5 to 6 years old on then it was to work with excellent in 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.079
 port 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.669
 all the vegetation 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.919
 here we are also making invitation for all those who do 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:29.689
 you have to see 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.409
 this kind of work for 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.289
 jobim colo 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.599
 that are participants in the objectives I have 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.989
 and together 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.399
 Reserve 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:41.049
 this type of 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.609
 the hope is that it is a beauty
