00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
gonna pull back on it just by pulling

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.069 
gonna pull back on it just by pulling
back<00:02:33.879> just<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.329> little<00:02:34.359> bit<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.810> know<00:02:37.840> when

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
back just a little bit you know when

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.479 
back just a little bit you know when
it's<00:02:38.200> over<00:02:38.379> if<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.709> pull<00:02:38.889> back<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.069> little<00:02:39.189> bit

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
it's over if you pull back a little bit

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.339 
it's over if you pull back a little bit
you<00:02:40.000> can<00:02:40.120> bring<00:02:40.329> everything<00:02:40.599> right<00:02:40.900> back<00:02:41.109> and

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
you can bring everything right back and

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.530 
you can bring everything right back and
you<00:02:41.439> saw<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.680> let's<00:02:42.040> let's<00:02:42.310> reset<00:02:42.939> it<00:02:43.090> we'll

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
you saw that let's let's reset it we'll

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.879 
you saw that let's let's reset it we'll
take<00:02:43.689> it<00:02:43.750> back<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.989> zero<00:02:44.379> you<00:02:44.439> can<00:02:44.560> see<00:02:44.739> it's<00:02:44.859> a

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
take it back to zero you can see it's a

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.069 
take it back to zero you can see it's a
little<00:02:44.920> over<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.489> one<00:02:45.939> wait<00:02:46.180> what<00:02:46.810> are<00:02:46.930> some

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
little over so one wait what are some

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.659 
little over so one wait what are some
ways<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.260> we<00:02:47.500> could<00:02:47.650> cure<00:02:48.189> this<00:02:48.400> being

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
ways that we could cure this being

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.879 
ways that we could cure this being
overexposed<00:02:49.329> me<00:02:49.599> too<00:02:49.930> much<00:02:50.079> light<00:02:50.439> is<00:02:50.650> being

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
overexposed me too much light is being

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.270 
overexposed me too much light is being
led<00:02:51.159> in<00:02:51.450> well<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.870> could<00:02:53.019> bump<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.560> shutter

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
led in well we could bump the shutter

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.819 
led in well we could bump the shutter
speed<00:02:54.549> up<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:55.000> 18<00:02:55.689> hundredth<00:02:56.169> of<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.379> second<00:02:56.769> we

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
speed up to 18 hundredth of a second we

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.440 
speed up to 18 hundredth of a second we
could<00:02:56.950> bump<00:02:57.129> it<00:02:57.250> faster<00:02:57.639> six<00:02:57.879> 40th<00:02:58.299> eight

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
could bump it faster six 40th eight

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.000 
could bump it faster six 40th eight
hundred<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.379> would<00:02:59.530> do<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.769> same<00:02:59.799> thing

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
hundred and that would do the same thing

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.039 
hundred and that would do the same thing
pretty<00:03:00.790> much<00:03:00.939> as<00:03:01.209> going<00:03:01.450> like<00:03:01.599> this<00:03:01.840> and

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
pretty much as going like this and

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.440 
pretty much as going like this and
bringing<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.099> back<00:03:03.280> because<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.639> am<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:04.269> looks

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
bringing it back because I am it looks

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.869 
bringing it back because I am it looks
like<00:03:04.480> I'm<00:03:04.629> off<00:03:04.780> by<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:04.989> almost<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.099> stop<00:03:06.370> we'll

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
like I'm off by a almost a stop we'll

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.699 
like I'm off by a almost a stop we'll
say<00:03:07.030> about<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.269> stop<00:03:07.569> so<00:03:07.750> yeah<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.049> went<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.319> 18

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
say about a stop so yeah if I went to 18

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.699 
say about a stop so yeah if I went to 18
hundredth<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.579> second<00:03:09.939> that's<00:03:10.000> one<00:03:10.389> stop<00:03:10.780> we

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
hundredth of a second that's one stop we

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.500 
hundredth of a second that's one stop we
would<00:03:11.829> have<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:12.430> or<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.760> could<00:03:13.030> go<00:03:13.060> from<00:03:13.299> F

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
would have that or I could go from F

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.949 
would have that or I could go from F
3.22<00:03:14.290> F<00:03:14.620> like<00:03:15.510> we<00:03:16.510> could<00:03:16.659> technically

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
3.22 F like we could technically

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.050 
3.22 F like we could technically
technically<00:03:17.620> go<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:17.859> f4<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.639> that<00:03:18.940> would<00:03:19.030> be

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
technically go to f4 and that would be

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.879 
technically go to f4 and that would be
close<00:03:19.389> we<00:03:19.599> could<00:03:19.720> drop<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.109> ISO<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> little

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
close we could drop the ISO a little

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.979 
close we could drop the ISO a little
lower<00:03:21.099> in<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.849> case<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.299> would<00:03:22.599> either<00:03:22.720> go<00:03:22.959> to

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
lower in this case I would either go to

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.159 
lower in this case I would either go to
f4<00:03:23.500> or<00:03:24.389> you<00:03:25.389> know<00:03:25.479> I<00:03:25.510> like<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.810> blow<00:03:26.049> the

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
f4 or you know I like to blow the

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.599 
f4 or you know I like to blow the
background<00:03:26.530> out<00:03:26.650> as<00:03:26.799> much<00:03:26.949> as<00:03:27.010> possible<00:03:27.129> so

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
background out as much as possible so

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.009 
background out as much as possible so
I'd<00:03:27.699> probably<00:03:27.879> just<00:03:28.120> go<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.299> 18<00:03:28.629> hundredth<00:03:28.959> of

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
I'd probably just go to 18 hundredth of

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.839 
I'd probably just go to 18 hundredth of
a<00:03:29.109> second<00:03:29.439> so<00:03:29.769> those<00:03:29.949> are<00:03:30.129> the<00:03:30.159> options<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
a second so those are the options the

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.089 
a second so those are the options the
things<00:03:31.090> going<00:03:31.299> through<00:03:31.629> my<00:03:31.959> mind<00:03:32.319> when<00:03:32.949> I'm

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
things going through my mind when I'm

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.830 
things going through my mind when I'm
shooting<00:03:33.310> or<00:03:33.579> now<00:03:33.760> when<00:03:33.970> I'm<00:03:34.090> editing<00:03:34.209> what

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
shooting or now when I'm editing what

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.649 
shooting or now when I'm editing what
could<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.139> have<00:03:35.229> done<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.590> make<00:03:35.889> this<00:03:35.949> picture

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
could I have done to make this picture

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.300 
could I have done to make this picture
right<00:03:37.659> on<00:03:37.930> in<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.409> camera<00:03:38.769> in<00:03:38.889> terms<00:03:39.159> of

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
right on in the camera in terms of

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.909 
right on in the camera in terms of
composite<00:03:39.819> in<00:03:40.090> terms<00:03:40.329> of<00:03:40.540> exposure<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.439> those

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
composite in terms of exposure and those

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.559 
composite in terms of exposure and those
are<00:03:42.129> the<00:03:42.220> things<00:03:42.370> because<00:03:42.759> it's<00:03:42.939> overexposed

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
are the things because it's overexposed

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.289 
are the things because it's overexposed
I<00:03:43.780> could<00:03:44.290> bump<00:03:45.129> my<00:03:45.370> shutter<00:03:45.639> speed<00:03:45.729> up<00:03:46.090> higher

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
I could bump my shutter speed up higher

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.860 
I could bump my shutter speed up higher
I<00:03:46.629> could<00:03:47.409> bump<00:03:47.949> my<00:03:48.220> F<00:03:48.549> stop<00:03:49.000> or<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:49.359> could<00:03:49.659> drop

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
I could bump my F stop or I could drop

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.679 
I could bump my F stop or I could drop
my<00:03:50.079> ISO<00:03:50.590> or<00:03:50.620> do<00:03:51.069> a<00:03:51.099> combination<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.939> the<00:03:52.540> other

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:52.689 
my ISO or do a combination of the other

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.809 
my ISO or do a combination of the other
