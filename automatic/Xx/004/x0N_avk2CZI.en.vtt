00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.930
 hello how about my name is nora couple and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.500
 let's continue the first proposal 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.199
 that we started the previous edition and already 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.570
 see how we keep this 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.880
 remember that we had started 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.610
 putting acrylic with spatula 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.369
 we work with rubber spatulas also 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.480
 to wear paint without generating these 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.329
 effects 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.150
 and we advanced much more by filling several 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.220
 parts of the fabric and merging the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.250
 different colors what we are going to do 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.370
 now it 's a stage where we started to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.870
 take out some situations that we 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.420
 They drove here but they are not 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.510
 useful to follow that is the way 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.489
 we should always work that is 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.020
 spotted I have fun and then in a 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:02.350
 stage the son that I follow and with that 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.560
 to do those cleanings and generate those 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 quieter, quieter spaces we 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.350
 we can help with white acrylic 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.240
 I can mix it a little with yellow 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.910
 naples too so that the effect does not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.310
 be so cold if it is not what I want and 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.790
 start 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.570
 to enter planes where I want 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.570
 more tranquility 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.640
 it is very likely that a lot of all the 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.190
 paint that I have from below if 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.850
 this was not a job that I did often 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.690
 I have it dry so I need to go back to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.820
 generate points of where to grab me that in 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.729
 a continuous workshop work this is going 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.970
 resolving as I am doing it 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:55.280
 Here I need to recreate that blue 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.890
 to be able to bite and stretch it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.990
 and from there I choose what I'm left with 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.850
 what fragments of that yellow I'm going 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.650
 leaving 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.050
 and what parts I extend 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.340
 without fear of covering without fear of losing 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.340
 parts of the table 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.070
 as I overcome these areas 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.290
 the hour begins to have another course 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.350
 begins to have more character begins to 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.460
 give me back a picture a tour that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.950
 I have to see it as I go 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.420
 working 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.150
 to go composing and what 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.269
 this that started as a gesture stain 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 have a little more poetry and count a 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.260
 little more of us 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.430
 ultimately that is what brings us 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.880
 up here and what we want to achieve 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.060
 we want to imitate any other work but 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.380
 that the canvas returns an image that 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.380
 we need to show 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.080
 but 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.560
 if the acrylic 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.980
 I mix it a little with varnish 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.150
 for acrylic I can explain it 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.150
 almost as I read it 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.330
 I keep adding a little more blue to 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.360
 be able to hook me this plane 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.610
 go 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.560
 seeing the route the color map that 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.350
 I already have at work, it's just going to 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.880
 go guiding they go seeing what color I have 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.020
 what color registration do I have and with what 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.020
 color I'm going to continue 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.010
 remember that this type of work 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.590
 we made in the intensive days 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.220
 as well 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.590
 are dictated in my workshop of bouquets mejÃ­a 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.470
 They are dictated on the coast in Pinamar at sea 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.490
 of silver- and in capital also the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.990
 intensive day has the 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.820
 particularity that the work is 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.130
 resolves on that same day and it 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.130
 can they have raised the work 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.750
 we continue for another part of the work 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.579
 they constantly have to go running 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.209
 the box do not remain sectored in 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.650
 a piece and take it almost to finalize what 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.690
 they have to walk around the work 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.979
 remember the always that does not matter in 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.979
 what stage are the picture 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.820
 this way I go 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.560
 composing this that was a 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.310
 demonstration of how to start a 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.950
 work with acrylics without copying without 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.140
 no previous image without any idea and 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.500
 solving based on what is going 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.500
 arising 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.860
 and we can add 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:00.110
 to give a few more touches of good light 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.360
 this obviously we could continue and 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.439
 well see you in the next in another 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.439
 I find thanks 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.180
 and
