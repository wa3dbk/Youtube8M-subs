brings each in ABS in the screen because

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.969 
brings each in ABS in the screen because
that's<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.840> downloads<00:01:55.320> are<00:01:55.470> located

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that's where the downloads are located

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.580 
that's where the downloads are located
then<00:01:56.880> click<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> toolbar<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.249 

so<00:02:08.119> while<00:02:08.240> you're<00:02:08.360> doing<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.930> exit

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
so while you're doing that you can exit

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.240 
so while you're doing that you can exit
out<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.530> some<00:02:09.680> of<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.800> stuff<00:02:10.009> you're<00:02:10.100> not

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.949 

so<00:02:16.110> now<00:02:16.379> when<00:02:17.129> this<00:02:17.459> finishes<00:02:17.670> looting<00:02:18.299> you're

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
so now when this finishes looting you're

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:29.440 
so now when this finishes looting you're
going<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.170> extract<00:02:19.470> all<00:02:19.950> files

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:38.560 

you

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.770 

and<00:02:39.890> now<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:40.980> can<00:02:41.400> get<00:02:41.610> rid<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.030> unex

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and now you can get rid of the unex

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.360 
and now you can get rid of the unex
tracted<00:02:43.290> ones<00:02:43.500> because<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.190> need<00:02:44.310> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
