solid<00:00:06.660> axle<00:00:07.170> rear<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> Ford<00:00:09.440> was<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.620> neutral

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
solid axle rear on a Ford was in neutral

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.760 
solid axle rear on a Ford was in neutral
I<00:00:11.370> put<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> into<00:00:12.179> gear<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:13.290> drive<00:00:15.260> and<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I put it into gear and to drive and the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.439 
I put it into gear and to drive and the
next<00:00:17.100> thing<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.310> got<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.270> I've

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
next thing you got to do which I've

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.679 
next thing you got to do which I've
already<00:00:18.690> done<00:00:19.039> is<00:00:20.039> I've<00:00:20.789> spun<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.449> wheel

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
already done is I've spun this wheel

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.890 
already done is I've spun this wheel
forward<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.580> direction<00:00:26.150> until<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
forward in this direction until the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.250 
forward in this direction until the
driveshaft<00:00:28.289> locked<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.310> aussies<00:00:29.820> locked<00:00:30.260> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
driveshaft locked and aussies locked and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.229 
driveshaft locked and aussies locked and
then<00:00:31.769> since<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.279> don't<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.669> second<00:00:33.090> person

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
then since I don't have a second person

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.360 
then since I don't have a second person
to<00:00:33.600> hold<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.930> wheel<00:00:34.200> I'll<00:00:34.920> go<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> other

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
to hold this wheel I'll go to the other

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.610 
to hold this wheel I'll go to the other
one<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.790> jumped<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.540> spare<00:00:36.899> tire<00:00:37.200> under<00:00:37.469> here

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
one I jumped this spare tire under here

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.959 
one I jumped this spare tire under here
you<00:00:37.710> could<00:00:37.860> probably<00:00:37.980> use<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> wood<00:00:38.460> block<00:00:38.640> or

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
you could probably use a wood block or

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.990 
you could probably use a wood block or
something<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:40.200> keep<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> from<00:00:41.100> moving<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.700> if

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
something to keep it from moving as if

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.459 
something to keep it from moving as if
somebody<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.660> holding<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.739> still<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:46.379> then

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
somebody was holding it still and then

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.639 
somebody was holding it still and then
the<00:00:46.559> next<00:00:46.890> thing<00:00:46.980> I'm<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:48.410> is<00:00:49.410> I'm

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.910 
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> spin<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.850> opposite<00:00:51.329> wheel<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.920> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
going to spin the opposite wheel in the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.369 
going to spin the opposite wheel in the
reverse<00:00:53.280> direction<00:00:53.390> from<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> forward<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
reverse direction from the forward that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.650 
reverse direction from the forward that
I<00:00:55.410> spun<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.190> wheel<00:01:01.309> Locker<00:01:02.660> already

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
I spun in the first wheel Locker already

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.270 
I spun in the first wheel Locker already
dropped<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:05.840> right<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> spin

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
dropped in right there and when I spin

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.910 
dropped in right there and when I spin
the<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.479> wheel<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.799> reverse<00:01:12.500> since<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.619> spun

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the right wheel and reverse since I spun

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.130 
the right wheel and reverse since I spun
the<00:01:13.950> left<00:01:14.340> wheel<00:01:14.549> forward<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.600> should<00:01:15.659> see

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the left wheel forward you should see

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:33.470 
the left wheel forward you should see
this<00:01:16.350> Aussie<00:01:16.770> lock<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.130> ratchet

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.810 

what<00:01:34.480> you<00:01:34.630> did<00:01:34.840> there<00:01:35.490> because<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.760> next

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
what you did there because then the next

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.580 
what you did there because then the next
thing<00:01:37.240> I'm<00:01:37.390> going<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.570> do<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.050> I'm<00:01:38.410> going<00:01:38.440> to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.900 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
spin<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.700> left<00:01:39.730> wheel<00:01:40.180> backwards<00:01:40.900> and<00:01:41.260> then

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
spin the left wheel backwards and then

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.340 
spin the left wheel backwards and then
spin<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:42.940> right<00:01:43.300> wheel<00:01:43.540> forward<00:01:44.170> which<00:01:44.320> is

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
spin the right wheel forward which is

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.310 
spin the right wheel forward which is
just<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.190> flip-flop<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.090> then<00:01:46.840> we'll<00:01:47.020> see<00:01:47.200> if

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
just a flip-flop and then we'll see if

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.610 
just a flip-flop and then we'll see if
it<00:01:47.440> unlocks<00:01:47.800> to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.970 

so<00:01:56.620> I'm<00:01:56.770> spinning<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.220> left<00:01:57.310> wheel<00:01:57.730> backwards

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
so I'm spinning the left wheel backwards

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.130 
so I'm spinning the left wheel backwards
and<00:01:59.980> now<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.220> can<00:02:00.370> see<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.840> whole<00:02:02.110> thing

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
and now you can see the whole thing

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.080 
and now you can see the whole thing
moving<00:02:03.300> has<00:02:04.300> one<00:02:04.720> lock<00:02:04.990> together<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.940> I'll

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
moving has one lock together and I'll

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.270 
moving has one lock together and I'll
leave<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.380> can<00:02:08.560> see<00:02:08.770> inside<00:02:09.100> the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
leave it so that you can see inside the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.620 
leave it so that you can see inside the
carrier<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.810> now<00:02:12.390> off-camera<00:02:15.150> I'm<00:02:16.150> taking

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
carrier and now off-camera I'm taking

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.680 
carrier and now off-camera I'm taking
that<00:02:16.810> spare<00:02:17.200> wheel<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.680> have<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.820> Jam<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.480> on

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
that spare wheel I have and Jam is on

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.710 
that spare wheel I have and Jam is on
the<00:02:19.810> other<00:02:19.900> side<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.410> tire<00:02:21.480> which<00:02:22.480> it's

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
the other side of this tire which it's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.300 
the other side of this tire which it's
in<00:02:22.930> now<00:02:23.940> solid<00:02:24.940> right<00:02:25.090> under<00:02:25.330> there<00:02:29.310> spinning

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
in now solid right under there spinning

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.560 
in now solid right under there spinning
it<00:02:30.430> backwards<00:02:30.910> I'm<00:02:31.030> going<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.210> spin<00:02:31.450> it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
it backwards I'm going to spin it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.720 
it backwards I'm going to spin it
forward<00:02:32.100> basically<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.160> opposite<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.550> what<00:02:33.700> I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
forward basically the opposite of what I

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.640 
forward basically the opposite of what I
just<00:02:33.790> did

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
just did

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.960 
just did
another<00:02:35.650> right<00:02:35.860> wheel<00:02:36.070> should<00:02:36.400> spin<00:02:36.460> forward

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
another right wheel should spin forward

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.400 
another right wheel should spin forward
