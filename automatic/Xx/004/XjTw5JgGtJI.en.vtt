00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
guys shoot video so the way your camera

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
guys shoot video so the way your camera
works<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.750> digital<00:00:51.899> sensor<00:00:52.260> light

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
works is you have a digital sensor light

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
works is you have a digital sensor light
comes<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.550> hits<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.850> sensor<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> sensor

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
comes in hits of sensor that sensor

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.090 
comes in hits of sensor that sensor
turns<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.170> light<00:00:55.320> into<00:00:55.530> electrical<00:00:55.770> ones

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
turns that light into electrical ones

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
turns that light into electrical ones
and<00:00:56.309> zeros<00:00:56.579> sends<00:00:57.059> them<00:00:57.149> off<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:57.390> cameras

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and zeros sends them off to your cameras

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.330 
and zeros sends them off to your cameras
processor<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.680> camera<00:00:58.980> takes<00:00:59.219> those

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
processor your camera takes those

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
processor your camera takes those
signals<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.910> turns<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.359> into<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.629> image<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
signals and turns them into an image and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
signals and turns them into an image and
now<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> finally<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:02.940> little

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the light hits the sensor that's all

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.149 
the light hits the sensor that's all
baked<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.110> good<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.650> can't<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:16.979> back<00:01:17.130> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
baked in for good you can't go back and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
baked in for good you can't go back and
change<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.360> when<00:01:18.450> you're<00:01:18.509> shooting<00:01:18.630> in

hits the sensor the only things that you
can't<00:01:32.520> adjust<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> things<00:01:33.840> from<00:01:34.020> before

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
can't adjust are the things from before

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.170 
can't adjust are the things from before
the<00:01:34.350> light<00:01:34.470> hits<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> sensor<00:01:34.920> are<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.060> in

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the light hits the sensor are you in

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.780 
the light hits the sensor are you in
focus<00:01:36.329> your<00:01:37.259> shutter<00:01:37.470> speed<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:38.490> aperture

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
focus your shutter speed your aperture

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.609 
focus your shutter speed your aperture
those<00:01:39.780> three<00:01:39.960> things<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.290> basically<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
those three things are basically the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.899 
those three things are basically the
only<00:01:40.860> things<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> worry<00:01:41.460> about<00:01:41.579> with

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
only things you have to worry about with

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.609 
only things you have to worry about with
this<00:01:42.000> camera<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.420> makes<00:01:42.600> things<00:01:42.750> much<00:01:43.409> quicker

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
this camera it makes things much quicker

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
this camera it makes things much quicker
and<00:01:43.829> easier<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.280> shoot<00:01:44.460> you're<00:01:45.000> rolling

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and easier to shoot you're rolling

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.840 
and easier to shoot you're rolling
running<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> car<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:47.220> cloud<00:01:47.520> goes<00:01:47.700> with

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
running in a car and a cloud goes with

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.280 
running in a car and a cloud goes with
the<00:01:47.939> Sun<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.600> suddenly<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> temperature

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the Sun and suddenly the temperature

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050 
the Sun and suddenly the temperature
changes<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> light<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.790> don't<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
changes of the light you don't have to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.399 
changes of the light you don't have to
worry<00:01:51.180> about<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.750> fix<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.990> later<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
worry about it you can fix it later so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.530 
worry about it you can fix it later so
for<00:01:52.829> us<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.759> big<00:01:53.939> thing<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.390> got<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
for us that's a big thing so we got a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.880 
for us that's a big thing so we got a
small<00:01:54.659> crew<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.229> run<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> gun

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
small crew and we run a gun

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.080 
small crew and we run a gun
so<00:01:56.159> another<00:01:56.399> special<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:56.820> about<00:01:56.880> this

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
so another special thing about this

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.780 
so another special thing about this
camera<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.810> shoots<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.350> 4k<00:01:58.380> resolution

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
camera is that shoots in 4k resolution

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.249 
camera is that shoots in 4k resolution
now<00:01:59.790> what<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.360> cait

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
now what is a cait

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.010 
now what is a cait
4k<00:02:01.799> 2k<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.310> it'll<00:02:02.549> mean<00:02:02.700> basically<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.509> K<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
4k 2k was it'll mean basically a K is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.289 
4k 2k was it'll mean basically a K is
the<00:02:04.170> horizontal<00:02:04.469> resolution<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.759> image<00:02:05.880> for

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the horizontal resolution and image for

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.320 
the horizontal resolution and image for
example<00:02:06.360> 1080p<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.320> roughly<00:02:07.680> 2k<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.330> 1920

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
example 1080p is roughly 2k it's 1920

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.430 
example 1080p is roughly 2k it's 1920
pixels<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.899> K<00:02:10.470> 1.9<00:02:11.310> K<00:02:11.580> or<00:02:11.940> 2k<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> round<00:02:13.170> up

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
pixels a K 1.9 K or 2k if you round up

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.770 
pixels a K 1.9 K or 2k if you round up
this<00:02:14.040> camera<00:02:14.340> shoots<00:02:14.700> 4k<00:02:14.910> generally<00:02:15.450> most<00:02:15.630> of

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
this camera shoots 4k generally most of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.500 
this camera shoots 4k generally most of
the<00:02:15.840> stuff<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:16.440> shoot<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.740> at<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> resolution<00:02:17.220> of

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the stuff we shoot is at a resolution of

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.980 
the stuff we shoot is at a resolution of
3840<00:02:18.510> by<00:02:19.190> 2160<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.060> got<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.240> lot<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.570> pixels

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
3840 by 2160 so you got a lot of pixels

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.780 
3840 by 2160 so you got a lot of pixels
to<00:02:22.110> play<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.950> means<00:02:23.190> if<00:02:23.460> we<00:02:23.580> need<00:02:23.760> to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
to play with that means if we need to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.370 
to play with that means if we need to
stabilize<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.330> shot<00:02:24.660> afterwards<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.290> it's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
stabilize a shot afterwards and it's

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.010 
stabilize a shot afterwards and it's
cropped<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.860> or<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.490> pull<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.480> close<00:02:27.690> up<00:02:27.720> for

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
cropped in or you pull it close up for

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.570 
cropped in or you pull it close up for
medium<00:02:28.350> shot<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.070> can<00:02:29.190> do<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.400> with<00:02:29.490> this

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
medium shot we can do it with this

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.160 
medium shot we can do it with this
camera<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.390> guys<00:02:30.510> can't<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:30.840> notice

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
camera and you guys can't really notice

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.090 
camera and you guys can't really notice
the<00:02:31.230> difference<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.620> YouTube<00:02:31.890> because

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the difference on YouTube because

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.590 
the difference on YouTube because
there's<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.460> much<00:02:32.580> extra<00:02:32.850> resolution<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.480> play

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
there's so much extra resolution to play

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.570 
there's so much extra resolution to play
with<00:02:33.810> everything<00:02:34.680> looks<00:02:34.860> better<00:02:34.980> down<00:02:35.250> scaled

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
with everything looks better down scaled

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.950 
with everything looks better down scaled
and<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:35.910> camera<00:02:36.150> gives<00:02:36.390> us<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.540> chance<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.870> do

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
and this camera gives us a chance to do

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.260 
and this camera gives us a chance to do
that<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.800> 4k<00:02:38.130> resolution<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.940> thought<00:02:39.150> we

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
that so 4k resolution we thought we

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.330 
that so 4k resolution we thought we
would<00:02:39.330> never<00:02:39.510> use<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.870> but<00:02:40.290> guess<00:02:40.500> what<00:02:40.740> it's

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
would never use it but guess what it's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.360 
would never use it but guess what it's
super<00:02:41.580> convenient<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.830> one<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.160> things

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
super convenient so one of the things

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.760 
super convenient so one of the things
that<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.660> filmmakers<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.350> probably<00:02:46.680> all

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
that we as filmmakers and probably all

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.170 
that we as filmmakers and probably all
you<00:02:46.860> guys<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.220> internet<00:02:47.490> have<00:02:47.850> sought

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you guys on the internet have sought

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.750 
you guys on the internet have sought
after<00:02:48.390> for<00:02:48.870> all<00:02:49.050> these<00:02:49.260> years<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.490> film

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
after for all these years it's the film

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.000 
after for all these years it's the film
look<00:02:50.970> what<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> film<00:02:51.870> look<00:02:52.050> at<00:02:52.500> first<00:02:52.800> ever

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
look what is the film look at first ever

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.130 
look what is the film look at first ever
thought<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.280> was<00:02:53.520> 24<00:02:53.910> frames<00:02:54.120> per<00:02:54.240> second<00:02:54.690> so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
thought that was 24 frames per second so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.750 
thought that was 24 frames per second so
all<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.350> cameras<00:02:55.620> got<00:02:55.710> 24<00:02:56.130> frames<00:02:56.280> per<00:02:56.370> second

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
all the cameras got 24 frames per second

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.580 
all the cameras got 24 frames per second
and<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.120> helped<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.110> wasn't<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.410> film

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
and that helped but that wasn't the film

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.070 
and that helped but that wasn't the film
look<00:02:58.740> shallow<00:02:59.160> depth-of-field<00:02:59.520> lenses<00:03:00.360> that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
look shallow depth-of-field lenses that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.020 
look shallow depth-of-field lenses that
went<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.350> long<00:03:01.560> ways<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.130> now<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:02.790> things

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
went a long ways and now I have things

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.210 
went a long ways and now I have things
like<00:03:03.180> DSLRs<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.990> let<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.170> shoot<00:03:04.350> video<00:03:04.500> with

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
like DSLRs that let you shoot video with

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.830 
like DSLRs that let you shoot video with
those<00:03:05.370> nice<00:03:05.520> lenses<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.330> big<00:03:06.510> format

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
those nice lenses in the big format

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.940 
those nice lenses in the big format
censors<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.290> gives<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.740> really

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
censors that gives you that really

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.250 
censors that gives you that really
cinematic<00:03:08.490> shallow<00:03:09.090> depth<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.420> field<00:03:09.480> and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
cinematic shallow depth of field and

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260 
cinematic shallow depth of field and
that's<00:03:10.470> close<00:03:10.740> but<00:03:11.520> that's<00:03:11.700> still<00:03:12.030> not<00:03:12.210> the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
that's close but that's still not the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.020 
that's close but that's still not the
film<00:03:12.510> look<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.900> film<00:03:13.170> look<00:03:13.640> comes<00:03:14.640> from<00:03:14.820> high

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
film look the film look comes from high

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.479 
film look the film look comes from high
dynamic<00:03:15.480> range<00:03:15.630> what<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.740> well

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
dynamic range what is that well

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.390 
dynamic range what is that well
basically<00:03:17.820> your<00:03:18.630> camera<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.920> sensor<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.280> your

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
basically your camera the sensor on your

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.160 
basically your camera the sensor on your
camera<00:03:20.640> has<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.820> range<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.420> light<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.050> can

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
camera has a range of light that it can

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.810 
camera has a range of light that it can
take<00:03:22.320> in<00:03:22.500> there's<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.190> certain<00:03:23.459> point<00:03:23.610> where

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
take in there's a certain point where

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.670 
take in there's a certain point where
the<00:03:23.970> light<00:03:24.090> gets<00:03:24.270> too<00:03:24.450> dark<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.380> goes<00:03:25.530> to

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
the light gets too dark and it goes to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.560 
the light gets too dark and it goes to
black<00:03:25.860> basically<00:03:26.520> it<00:03:26.610> turns<00:03:26.790> into<00:03:26.940> noise<00:03:27.180> you

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
black basically it turns into noise you

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.670 
black basically it turns into noise you
can<00:03:27.690> boost<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.110> but<00:03:28.260> you're<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.380> gonna<00:03:28.560> get

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
can boost it but you're just gonna get

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.220 
can boost it but you're just gonna get
snow<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.610> then<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.450> have<00:03:30.540> another<00:03:30.690> point<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
snow and then you have another point I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.600 
snow and then you have another point I
wish<00:03:31.470> would<00:03:31.560> sensor<00:03:31.830> clips<00:03:32.070> like<00:03:32.250> it's<00:03:32.459> too

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
wish would sensor clips like it's too

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.850 
wish would sensor clips like it's too
much<00:03:32.640> light<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.600> get<00:03:33.720> white<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.770> the

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
much light and you just get white so the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.320 
much light and you just get white so the
range<00:03:35.040> between<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.520> part<00:03:35.730> where<00:03:35.940> your<00:03:36.060> sensor

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
range between the part where your sensor

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.080 
range between the part where your sensor
clips<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.959> was<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.650> black<00:03:37.950> noise<00:03:38.220> that's

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
clips and was just black noise that's

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.120 
clips and was just black noise that's
your<00:03:39.239> dynamic<00:03:39.600> range<00:03:39.840> some<00:03:40.680> cameras<00:03:41.010> like

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
your dynamic range some cameras like

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.070 
your dynamic range some cameras like
your<00:03:41.250> iPhone<00:03:41.340> only<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> couple<00:03:42.540> stops<00:03:42.780> and

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
your iPhone only have a couple stops and

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.699 
your iPhone only have a couple stops and
dynamic<00:03:43.410> range

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
dynamic range

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.170 
dynamic range
if<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.950> go<00:03:44.040> outside<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.519> take<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> picture<00:03:45.060> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
if you go outside you take a picture and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
if you go outside you take a picture and
the<00:03:45.300> sunlight<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.739> shadow<00:03:46.980> side<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.310> your

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the sunlight the shadow side of your

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.530 
the sunlight the shadow side of your
face<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.730> going<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.030> black

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
face is going to be black

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.750 
face is going to be black
while<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> sunny<00:03:49.019> side<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.350> exposed<00:03:49.739> or<00:03:50.040> if

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
while the sunny side is exposed or if

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.070 
while the sunny side is exposed or if
you<00:03:50.820> expose<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.180> shadow<00:03:51.420> side<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.900> sunny

you expose to the shadow side the sunny

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.690 
you expose to the shadow side the sunny
side's<00:03:52.320> gonna<00:03:52.410> be<00:03:52.530> blown<00:03:52.920> out<00:03:53.040> white<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.640> if

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
side's gonna be blown out white but if

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.280 
side's gonna be blown out white but if
you<00:03:53.760> use<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.880> better<00:03:54.090> camera<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:55.050> actually

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
you use a better camera you can actually

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.900 
you use a better camera you can actually
see<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> detail<00:03:55.800> in<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:55.980> shadow<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.820> can

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
see the detail in the shadow and you can

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.370 
see the detail in the shadow and you can
see<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> detail<00:03:57.420> in<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.600> bright<00:03:57.780> part<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:58.260> for

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
see the detail in the bright part so for

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.770 
see the detail in the bright part so for
example<00:03:58.709> this<00:03:58.860> camera<00:03:59.250> if<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.330> fill<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.540> shot

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
example this camera if I fill a shot

here<00:04:01.050> looking<00:04:01.350> out<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.709> garage<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.310> can

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
here looking out the garage I can

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.699 
here looking out the garage I can
actually<00:04:03.180> get<00:04:03.420> all<00:04:03.630> these<00:04:03.900> stuff<00:04:04.110> outside<00:04:04.620> of

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
actually get all these stuff outside of

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.680 
actually get all these stuff outside of
the<00:04:04.769> garage<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.220> direct<00:04:05.610> sunlight<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:06.180> expose

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
the garage in direct sunlight to expose

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.720 
the garage in direct sunlight to expose
without<00:04:06.989> clipping<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:08.160> can<00:04:08.400> get<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.580> stuff

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
without clipping and I can get the stuff

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.699 
without clipping and I can get the stuff
inside<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.330> garage<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:10.050> expose<00:04:10.410> without

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
inside the garage to expose without

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.410 
inside the garage to expose without
descending<00:04:11.040> into<00:04:11.280> noise<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:12.120> can<00:04:12.239> try<00:04:12.360> to

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
descending into noise you can try to

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.729 
descending into noise you can try to
deal<00:04:12.600> with<00:04:12.630> another<00:04:12.900> camera<00:04:13.110> like<00:04:13.290> an<00:04:13.380> iPhone

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
deal with another camera like an iPhone

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.770 
deal with another camera like an iPhone
or<00:04:13.769> even<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.190> fs100<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:15.330> can't<00:04:15.570> get<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.750> same

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
or even the fs100 you can't get the same

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.990 
or even the fs100 you can't get the same
amount<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.200> range<00:04:16.380> now<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.250> thing<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.549> your

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
amount of range now the thing is your

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.449 
amount of range now the thing is your
eyes<00:04:18.180> as<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.900> human<00:04:19.230> being<00:04:19.440> have<00:04:20.010> way<00:04:20.430> more

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
eyes as a human being have way more

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.310 
eyes as a human being have way more
stops<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.120> dynamic<00:04:21.150> range<00:04:21.539> than<00:04:21.840> any<00:04:21.930> camera

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
stops of dynamic range than any camera

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.800 
stops of dynamic range than any camera
so<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.100> more<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.310> camera<00:04:23.669> can<00:04:23.760> mimic<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
so the more a camera can mimic that the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.460 
so the more a camera can mimic that the
more<00:04:25.110> vibrant<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:25.979> alive

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
more vibrant and alive

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.650 
more vibrant and alive
and<00:04:26.590> painterly<00:04:27.430> an<00:04:27.640> image<00:04:27.940> becomes<00:04:28.240> so

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
and painterly an image becomes so

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.520 
and painterly an image becomes so
another<00:04:28.870> thing<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.110> makes<00:04:29.230> us<00:04:29.290> camera

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
another thing that makes us camera

you<00:04:32.260> might<00:04:32.440> notice<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.830> camera<00:04:33.220> body<00:04:33.400> itself

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520

bunch of things added on to it got a
battery<00:04:37.330> plate<00:04:37.570> back<00:04:37.720> here<00:04:37.960> for<00:04:38.110> putting

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
battery plate back here for putting

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
side handle that bolts onto the side and

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.040 
side handle that bolts onto the side and
of<00:04:45.490> course<00:04:45.700> I<00:04:45.820> have<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:45.970> lens<00:04:46.120> on<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.330> front<00:04:46.390> you

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
of course I have a lens on the front you

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.480 
of course I have a lens on the front you
can<00:04:47.170> actually<00:04:47.260> take<00:04:47.500> all<00:04:47.680> this<00:04:47.800> stuff<00:04:47.860> off<00:04:48.190> and

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
can actually take all this stuff off and

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.460 
can actually take all this stuff off and
rearrange<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.060> however<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.540> want<00:04:49.690> rather

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
rearrange it however you want rather

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.080 
rearrange it however you want rather
than<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.740> camera<00:04:50.980> according<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.430> CF<00:04:52.060> card

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
than the camera according to a CF card

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.690 
than the camera according to a CF card
or<00:04:52.450> SD<00:04:52.690> card<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.050> actually<00:04:53.320> cords<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:54.370> solid

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
or SD card it actually cords to solid

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.490 
or SD card it actually cords to solid
state<00:04:54.910> drives<00:04:55.240> known<00:04:55.780> as<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.930> red<00:04:56.320> Meg

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
state drives known as a red Meg

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.720 
state drives known as a red Meg
basically<00:04:56.890> it's<00:04:56.980> just<00:04:57.010> a<00:04:57.220> solid-state<00:04:57.700> drive

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
basically it's just a solid-state drive

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.570 
basically it's just a solid-state drive
inside<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.420> this<00:04:58.540> little<00:04:59.320> expensive<00:04:59.950> but

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
inside of this little expensive but

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.040 
inside of this little expensive but
they're<00:05:00.670> also<00:05:00.790> very<00:05:01.060> fast<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.660> very<00:05:01.780> durable

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
they're also very fast and very durable

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.960 
they're also very fast and very durable
so<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.590> can<00:05:02.680> offload<00:05:02.890> 64<00:05:03.460> gigabytes<00:05:03.850> of

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
so you can offload 64 gigabytes of

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.950 
so you can offload 64 gigabytes of
footage<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.330> like<00:05:04.450> 10<00:05:04.600> minutes

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
people actually wonder how you can work

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.770 
people actually wonder how you can work
with<00:05:42.280> these<00:05:42.460> new<00:05:42.610> files<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.180> keep<00:05:43.330> it<00:05:43.419> as<00:05:43.510> fast

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
with these new files and keep it as fast

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.060 
with these new files and keep it as fast
as<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.110> need<00:05:44.140> to<00:05:44.260> be<00:05:44.410> when<00:05:44.560> you're<00:05:44.650> on<00:05:44.740> YouTube

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
as you need to be when you're on YouTube

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.070 
as you need to be when you're on YouTube
but<00:05:45.610> actually<00:05:45.880> works<00:05:46.030> great<00:05:46.240> for<00:05:46.270> us<00:05:46.510> we<00:05:46.960> turn

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
but actually works great for us we turn

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.480 
but actually works great for us we turn
it<00:05:47.229> around<00:05:47.260> just<00:05:47.560> as<00:05:47.740> fast<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.130> would<00:05:48.250> in<00:05:48.370> any

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
it around just as fast and would in any

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.520 
it around just as fast and would in any
other<00:05:48.550> case<00:05:48.790> also<00:05:49.780> assume<00:05:50.260> you<00:05:50.320> guys<00:05:50.440> are
