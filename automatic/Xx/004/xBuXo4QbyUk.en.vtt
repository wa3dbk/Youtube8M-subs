00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
that Jim Brown it for a long time and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.970 
that Jim Brown it for a long time and
then<00:03:07.610> giving<00:03:07.910> uh<00:03:08.060> some<00:03:08.300> bad<00:03:08.480> publicity<00:03:09.380> about

then giving uh some bad publicity about

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.500 
then giving uh some bad publicity about
Franco<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.610> Franco<00:03:10.970> has<00:03:11.090> been<00:03:11.120> kind<00:03:11.450> of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
Franco and Franco has been kind of

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.300 
Franco and Franco has been kind of
nonchalant<00:03:12.230> about<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.650> when<00:03:12.890> he<00:03:12.920> was<00:03:13.070> in<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
nonchalant about it when he was in the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.970 
nonchalant about it when he was in the
NFL<00:03:13.519> Dottie<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.690> guess<00:03:15.140> it's<00:03:15.320> in<00:03:15.440> time<00:03:15.680> where

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
NFL Dottie so I guess it's in time where

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.449 
NFL Dottie so I guess it's in time where
both<00:03:16.550> of<00:03:16.760> them<00:03:16.910> can<00:03:17.269> capitalize<00:03:18.140> on<00:03:18.250> their<00:03:19.250> so

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
both of them can capitalize on their so

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.940 
both of them can capitalize on their so
ability<00:03:19.940> yeah<00:03:20.330> so<00:03:20.930> they're<00:03:21.230> gonna<00:03:21.320> race<00:03:21.620> each

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
ability yeah so they're gonna race each
