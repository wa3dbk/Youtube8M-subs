 amt 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.590
 I did not feel sorry for the 10-year chaos time limit of 30 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.610
 This time, you're done. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.600
 In the meantime, we talked about this, 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.599
 There is no tree for the first time. 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.939
 Let's find out what you need. 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.640
 As soon as I told you about the revised fire department, 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.159
 Best 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.969
 You can comfortably make the Betty royalty so lightly. 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.089
 From the first step on the market, I'm now swarming my fingers. 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:36.890
 Finger is more than a laptop pc 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.500
 I'm going to continue to build this poetry. 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 The power of the product is part 4 of the theme tent 60 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.130
 I'll tell you the budget. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.950
 I've just run a business that advised me about 35. 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.510
 Yes, it's only $ 14 an hour. 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.030
 I did a class. 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.270
 Normally, you should now go to Sim Basic Platform and practice 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.159
 The same visit to the same shrine again to drink properly 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.950
 It seems good. And when the way down 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.990
 I'll let you know. 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 Yes I have just 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.299
 This is how I got it. 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.770
 In this way, Gyeryongsi keeps a sense of time 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.510
 I am confident that I will be more helpful to you. 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.509
 I did the beginning of this when 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.900
 a18. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.920
 I will show my will. 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 I will do it the way 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.069
 Now let's look at the committee method for the next four years. 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.069
 I'll do it. 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.529
 So far, I am now in the system, 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.099
 I found out. 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.269
 From the beginning of the practice of new new mission 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.269
 I'll show you. 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.479
 Egret about how to refer to a winning streak at 20% 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.459
 The basic rule is always to be through TV pitching now 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.260
 I'm going to reduce it all the way from town to town. 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.180
 One thing to watch out for when you apply for retirement benefits in 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.930
 The dots are like these little fingers every five minutes. 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.309
 It rains 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.639
 And there are those who are pushing in this way 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.339
 This is why the window was so long that it could not 

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:27.339
 I did not know if I could keep Chungbuk 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.079
 I'll do it. 

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.379
 Because you are pitching, this index gives you a lot of credit 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.599
 You will get a clearer tax exemption for fishing. 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.339
 Let me now show you how to understand these pitchings through 

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:43.339
 I'll do it 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.020
 Now new 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.020
 I will look at Jinju City at once. 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.059
 Yes Swimmer Prometric Accident Motorcycle Insurance 3 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:04.069
 I found out. 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.539
 I will continue to deny the shipment in this work. 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.009
 At present, Dokdo is now 62 but ends only in Mother 62 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.009
 I will continue to practice. 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.699
 It is true, but you are up until 9 o'clock. 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.099
 There will be no one. And now the metronome sandwich 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.349
 962.7780 rather than suddenly isolating 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:29.840
 30-day common sense or 50 50 is supported in the middle 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.539
 You'll be a lot better at finding out who you are. 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:37.930
 Because it is spotted by an event, 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.969
 It's important, 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:43.749
 The people who say that it is related to the great circle 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:46.879
 Kim Jung-wu is no one to say that metro metro Wigan 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.249
 Because of this, it is always Gimje 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:54.149
 As a phone model, you drink in it and practice. 

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:57.149
 It would be best. Practice up to the hair 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.330
 Even if you have a legal and national law to have 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.520
 It's going to be fairly late, 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.029
 As far as I know, 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.049
 It would be difficult for you to have such a life of 50,000 people per worker 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.349
 For a good performance 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.159
 TuMedia is not a service provider. 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:19.710
 It will be unlocked and you will not hear from the Institute 

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:22.580
 I'm sure it was a lot of help. 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.080
 Some such time allowance 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.889
 Some 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:29.369
 Practicing public comedy hitting guitar 

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:32.860
 First of all, the market and women are playing 45 minutes of guitar 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.089
 Do you think it will become a telecom stock market? 

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:38.669
 Members of Parliament are not pardoned for a 3-under-par alone incident 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:42.019
 If a simple spread is low, it is not an hour. 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.900
 Opinions discuss 8 innings. Now it's not painful 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.099
 The remaining position, but the open position of the finger 

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:51.500
 It's off. 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.500
 A question raised to the pole 

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:58.009
 People who have seen the exercise again after a considerable drop 

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:00.849
 It was from far away. Last year 

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:03.849
 Yonsei University Goals More 

00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:07.469
 Quickassist is a quiet place close to the catchment point. 

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.460
 You did it. 

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.460
 2. 

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.469
