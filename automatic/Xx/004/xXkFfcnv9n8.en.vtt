00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.480
 Carlo, of course, I'm a man to do 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.510
 for unknown reasons, no idea why 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.529
 I have a little tip for you today 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.149
 and indeed yesterday I did the masts myself with my girlfriend 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:13.759
 or a mask 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.429
 and 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.150
 by Dietmar Hecht succeeded with a directly elected differently 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.929
 she likes working so much today likes my skin again 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.730
 One last time it was so much so my skin so the gates were so 

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:27.599
 are big 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.859
 I always had the feeling that I have so very many inconsistencies he 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.750
 also that here are two small ones 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.160
 to the dismantling is and then we get fit again 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.700
 Do not eat a real pimple but always have to 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.960
 no other choice 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.970
 and then we were even selected in the club that she was good 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.620
 against Petit is as I said 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.039
 the car is right 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.939
 Peaq for thus soon should have but so if smaller units so 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.330
 I know them because the core problem he is familiar with was that we had 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.790
 And then I figured I'll be right next to what ingredients 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.430
 Jamie did well as agreed after ten minutes 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.460
 should pay attention first 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.060
 so he is the area and so on 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.300
 she was very dissatisfied because it made Crameri very familiar throughout the second half of the season 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.950
 I was not completely satisfied 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.810
 Percent estimates their spaces such a big goal in mind and today 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.780
 What is there for me that is and I liked it so then it was called 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.630
 that's what it's all about 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.760
 this whole 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.930
 I do not like those who watch all of this in my sport anymore 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.360
 sure really disgusting nice pure skin 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.140
 I still have her the special unit for Richemont after this 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.750
 match 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.760
 but that's really healed in the pretty well 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.570
 I do not know exactly this mask is that the pimples active 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.300
 Expansion plans what your life can better express or what you can do 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.730
 to go completely the way I thought there is not 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.800
 In any case, I can help those who made them very good 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.720
 Recommend 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.080
 to invest invested naturally 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.440
 I will become myself now 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.930
 The ingredients quantities for about two masts I should appreciate that now 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.790
 also money is still much much too much 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.889
 around me treasures to GDP 2 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.569
 Mast portions 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.559
 do you need 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.280
 second 3 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.470
 about as big tomatoes so not these very small cocktail tomatoes but 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.329
 thus for the first Kita these 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.609
 but not so big but even food went two to three 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.829
 of which TUI AG would like to thank you for starting this is that I am pretty fluent 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:34.330
 and then on the Internet just look that you should give to honey 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.940
 so a teaspoon to two teaspoons and again by brewing 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.890
 never done that, but it was far too many to be sure 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.639
 it also had done because it all holds so good dapd and that's it 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.629
 mannier better but that Quark remains refined 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.179
 in Vienna 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.649
 Kacar Dennis was bad, we thought 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:56.569
 and then he comes with Amazon raised to ten beds Estler leading 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.800
 taylor-ann just with the spoon proof 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.570
 and that had good so it is currently not as solid as its values 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.239
 or so 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.359
 but not so much for that will go underground 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.009
 So it is well kept 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.089
 Century herbicides can also be 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.419
 first cosmetics cloths short and then washed off 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.449
 and yes as I said I'm not satisfied with that 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.449
 around Messi after his point deduction at the tomatoes 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.319
 that one might still like them the whole core of this trend then maybe 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.489
 It should be daily on the skin but that does not matter that I would 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.289
 He's worth it for me, "Kelber said 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.289
 Settlers from fish that's not necessary at all 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.199
 So I think that would have two to three servings because I guess that 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.069
 everything is just 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.149
 So we have five of these save but if two tablespoons of honey so who 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.339
 way too much 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.369
 Herbert, however, if your opponents are all friends for you, we will stay that way for you 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:53.309
 he goes on to give that they are less of surgery 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.189
 watching scr-trainer 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.400
 how many needs and maybe he has no real perfect dimensions 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.479
 say 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.159
 I have that under Tel 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.299
 Verbs «speak» beautiful scissors beat and then imagine yourself 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:05.799
 morning
