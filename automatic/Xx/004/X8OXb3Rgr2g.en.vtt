00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello to my benders today show 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.880
 something unusual is not likely 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.710
 not what I thought, even though I'm afraid 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.480
 imagine something thought i don't know what 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.020
 I thought 1 maybe I thought theories 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.880
 Einstein 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.380
 let's not talk about it today 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.539
 There will be several reviews of mods that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.400
 will leave with great frequency 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.199
 thats right today sunday number not 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.119
 I know I just wanted to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 and perhaps start the first mod adds 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 here is a creature let's 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.719
 consider it green correctly 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.200
 correct green yes I agree to live 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.079
 he and where 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.390
 in the swamp well yes you need a swamp but a bandana 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.620
 water in the swamp well, so here it looks 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.980
 Well, I don't know. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.469
 pull the cat over and it's a frog this frog 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.600
 guys are you you are just about I don't really know 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.910
 This is like a frog remotely but 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.359
 nevertheless but you cannot call it 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.770
 love whom i will such yes it is 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.480
 frogs who will now spawn 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.100
 your world of minecraft which is pretty 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.720
 funny way spawns not only 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.750
 only just just in the swamp 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.930
 terrain and plus them that they can 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.400
 pepper and kill and if you kill one 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 you can tame another one 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.990
 Now I will show you everything in detail 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 on top they can spawn with 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.799
 such an egg that is let's turn on 2 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.460
 us keys sound is on and now later 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.920
 zaspavnit many many many frogs so 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.210
 they croak that rather weighed 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.799
 there really is a sound waka not 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.070
 although it's more like a grunt but 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.810
 okay okay so i'm saying that they can 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.460
 beat them 10 on you can kill we take a diamond 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.360
 sword in hand then then you come here 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.659
 give a friend beat her somewhere 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.180
 hid inspect we killed the frog and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.439
 because of her gender what was right of him 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.570
 two league frog 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.240
 i.e. it is not frog of course I am leg 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.979
 the tortoise and the frogs are like damn guys 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.380
 I honestly think that there are legs 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.509
 frogs it's like dublin below yes 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
 my God do frog singing since childhood 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.070
 see because although there is nothing 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.610
 I'm afraid your mother still okay 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.690
 and we will clean as we think 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.490
 in short, see these frogs legs can 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.440
 eat they will restore you 2 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.870
 if 2 in real life would n't eat 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.850
 but maykraft can they tell you two 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.160
 units of hunger and it's pretty cool 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.780
 that is, the infinite source can 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.030
 say because the frogs both saw 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.160
 spawn a lot and i don't spawn just 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.600
 in the swamps is equal if the beam area then 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.340
 with food you board will and let's 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.760
 let's see what else we can do 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.340
 can name another frog and 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.290
 feed her 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.000
 ligusha 7 paws you just think it 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.220
 worse than hannibal lecturer 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.630
 through several applications we were able 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.709
 tame and and now we have 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.780
 own 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.060
 frog we can make her stand on 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.530
 place with you while we walk we can deliver 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.790
 and go after us that is when what 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.739
 you actually she goes after us but 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.410
 now apparently failed but nonetheless 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.220
 that is, it is damn hell can these 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.050
 to breed well 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.330
 oh my god oh my god oh my gosh guys and 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.650
 best I saw it okay 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.050
 This is where the first mod ends. 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.489

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.690
