monitor the audio you can do so just by

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.520 
monitor the audio you can do so just by
plugging<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.170> audio<00:00:40.170> port<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.410> now

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
plugging it into the audio port and now

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
plugging it into the audio port and now
by<00:00:43.680> doing<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.340> can<00:00:44.579> clearly<00:00:44.820> hear<00:00:45.120> my

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
by doing this I can clearly hear my

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.200 
by doing this I can clearly hear my
audio<00:00:45.840> running<00:00:46.260> through<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:48.059> just

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
audio running through this and it just

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
audio running through this and it just
makes<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> whole<00:00:48.870> process<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.469> lot<00:00:49.500> easier

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
makes the whole process a lot easier

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.500 
makes the whole process a lot easier
although<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.460> does<00:00:50.610> look<00:00:50.789> kind<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.030> weird<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
although it does look kind of weird the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
although it does look kind of weird the
headphones<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> video

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
headphones on in the video

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.319 
headphones on in the video
maybe<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.579> an<00:00:53.640> excuse<00:00:54.000> where<00:00:54.239> I'm

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
maybe I just get an excuse where I'm

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.110 
maybe I just get an excuse where I'm
though<00:00:54.860> mm-hmm<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.340> doesn't<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
though mm-hmm it doesn't have one of the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.389 
though mm-hmm it doesn't have one of the
big<00:00:57.449> mic<00:00:57.870> inputs<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> does<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> small

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
big mic inputs but it does have a small

big mic inputs but it does have a small
mic<00:00:59.699> input<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:00.840> you'd<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.760> what<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> got<00:01:03.149> is

changing really fast anyways so you can

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.520 
changing really fast anyways so you can
do<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.420> by<00:01:27.720> plugging<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.229> into<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
do that just by plugging it into the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.780 
do that just by plugging it into the
line<00:01:29.400> input<00:01:29.990> which<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.290> microphone

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
line input which is your microphone

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.300 
line input which is your microphone
again<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.090> small<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.710> what<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:34.950> worth

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
again it's a small one what is so worth

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.850 
again it's a small one what is so worth
here's<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> box<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.720> comes<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.680> pretty

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
here's the box it comes in it's pretty

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.550 
here's the box it comes in it's pretty
pretty<00:01:38.369> standard<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.990> mean<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.229> guess<00:01:40.380> it's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
pretty standard but I mean I guess it's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.190 
pretty standard but I mean I guess it's
kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.799> flashy<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:42.030> got<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.450> zoom<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
kind of flashy it's got the zoom on the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.609 
kind of flashy it's got the zoom on the
side<00:01:43.470> got<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> front<00:01:45.259> it's<00:01:46.259> got<00:01:46.409> some

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
side got on the front it's got some

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.429 
side got on the front it's got some
information<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
information on the back and I think I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.100 
information on the back and I think I
paid<00:01:49.740> around<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.850> hundred<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.570> thirty<00:01:52.020> dollars

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
paid around a hundred and thirty dollars

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.609 
paid around a hundred and thirty dollars
for<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.820> zoom<00:01:54.060> h1<00:01:54.570> end<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
for this and the zoom h1 end I think you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
for this and the zoom h1 end I think you
can<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:55.950> around<00:01:56.189> $90<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.939> decided<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.659> pick

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
can get for around $90 I decided to pick

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.270 
can get for around $90 I decided to pick
this<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.070> higher<00:01:59.250> quality

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
this up because it's higher quality

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.610 
this up because it's higher quality
audio

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.380 

so<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.740> higher<00:02:06.830> quality<00:02:07.250> audio<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.790> such

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
so the higher quality audio and such

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.150 
so the higher quality audio and such
that's<00:02:08.810> why<00:02:08.990> I<00:02:09.050> picked<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.440> it<00:02:09.710> has<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.860> lot<00:02:10.130> of

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
that's why I picked this it has a lot of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.700 
that's why I picked this it has a lot of
things<00:02:10.399> on<00:02:10.580> top<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:11.600> allows<00:02:11.780> me<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.050> spin

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
things on top that allows me to spin

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.770 
things on top that allows me to spin
around<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.520> give<00:02:13.820> me<00:02:13.970> different<00:02:14.330> directions

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
around and give me different directions

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.200 
around and give me different directions
of<00:02:14.900> input<00:02:15.350> for<00:02:16.040> instance<00:02:16.490> if<00:02:16.670> I'm<00:02:16.820> looking<00:02:16.970> at

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
of input for instance if I'm looking at

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.610 
of input for instance if I'm looking at
it<00:02:17.390> from<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.720> backside

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it from the backside

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.670 
it from the backside
it'll<00:02:19.070> monitor<00:02:19.520> me<00:02:19.760> doing<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.330> video<00:02:20.510> or<00:02:21.110> from

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it'll monitor me doing a video or from

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.350 
it'll monitor me doing a video or from
doing<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.100> for<00:02:22.250> someone<00:02:22.520> else<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.090> want<00:02:23.240> to

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
doing it for someone else and I want to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.510 
doing it for someone else and I want to
monitor<00:02:23.690> their<00:02:24.020> audio<00:02:24.380> I'd<00:02:25.040> switch<00:02:25.370> this

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
monitor their audio I'd switch this

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.320 
monitor their audio I'd switch this
little<00:02:25.790> thing<00:02:25.910> around

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
little thing around

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.250 
little thing around
so<00:02:26.480> it'd<00:02:26.570> be<00:02:26.600> facing<00:02:26.930> them<00:02:28.300> or<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.960> could<00:02:30.080> just

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
so it'd be facing them or you could just

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.780 
so it'd be facing them or you could just
switch<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.040> doing<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.520> 360<00:02:32.240> degree

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
switch it so it's doing a 360 degree

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.760 
switch it so it's doing a 360 degree
surveillance<00:02:34.930> audio<00:02:35.930> monitoring<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.680> guess

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
surveillance audio monitoring I guess

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.330 
surveillance audio monitoring I guess
but<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.220> pretty<00:02:40.790> cool<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:42.040> mean<00:02:43.040> some<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
but it is pretty cool I mean some of the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.650 
but it is pretty cool I mean some of the
controlling<00:02:43.640> zuv<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.270> little<00:02:44.540> bit

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
controlling zuv it is a little bit

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.210 
controlling zuv it is a little bit
difficult<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:45.200> go<00:02:45.320> through<00:02:45.350> all<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.740> systems

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
difficult to go through all the systems

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.400 
difficult to go through all the systems
and<00:02:46.520> stuff<00:02:46.730> but<00:02:47.000> I'm<00:02:47.510> ok<00:02:47.780> with<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.170> kind<00:02:48.380> of

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
and stuff but I'm ok with it I kind of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.320 
and stuff but I'm ok with it I kind of
like<00:02:48.560> it

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
like it

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.460 
like it
and<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:51.830> certainly<00:02:52.220> beats<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.940> audio<00:02:53.720> on<00:02:54.050> the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
and it certainly beats the audio on the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.040 
and it certainly beats the audio on the
actual<00:02:54.830> camera<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.520> have<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
actual camera I have this is on the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.800 
actual camera I have this is on the
Canon<00:02:57.380> t3i<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:58.220> here's<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.670> test<00:02:58.910> with<00:02:59.360> just

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
Canon t3i so here's the test with just

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.090 
Canon t3i so here's the test with just
the<00:03:00.410> t3i<00:03:01.270> now<00:03:02.270> maybe<00:03:02.660> doing<00:03:03.560> this<00:03:03.680> test<00:03:03.950> you

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
the t3i now maybe doing this test you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.970 
the t3i now maybe doing this test you
can<00:03:04.130> kind<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.490> hear<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.820> light<00:03:05.000> up<00:03:05.120> there<00:03:05.300> as<00:03:05.690> a

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
can kind of hear the light up there as a

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.230 
can kind of hear the light up there as a
sound<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.260> that's<00:03:09.260> my<00:03:09.560> light<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.240> usually

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
sound to it that's my light and usually

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.480 
sound to it that's my light and usually
I<00:03:11.270> don't<00:03:11.420> get<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.780> on<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.930> Zune<00:03:12.370> maybe<00:03:13.370> this

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
I don't get it on the Zune maybe this

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.430 
I don't get it on the Zune maybe this
just<00:03:13.610> goes<00:03:13.790> I'm<00:03:13.819> close<00:03:14.060> enough<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.900> it's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
just goes I'm close enough and it's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.380 
just goes I'm close enough and it's
specifically<00:03:16.069> picking<00:03:16.490> up<00:03:16.610> me<00:03:16.819> and<00:03:17.060> not

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
specifically picking up me and not

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.090 
specifically picking up me and not
trying<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.720> pick<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:18.020> every<00:03:18.560> sound<00:03:18.860> in<00:03:19.010> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
trying to pick up every sound in the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.150 
trying to pick up every sound in the
room<00:03:19.130> now<00:03:20.030> let's<00:03:20.150> go<00:03:20.240> back<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.630> zoom<00:03:20.810> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
room now let's go back to the zoom and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.880 
room now let's go back to the zoom and
this<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.310> what<00:03:22.490> the<00:03:22.640> zoom<00:03:23.090> h2n<00:03:23.530> will<00:03:24.530> sound

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
this is what the zoom h2n will sound

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.340 
this is what the zoom h2n will sound
like<00:03:25.120> probably<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.270> lot<00:03:26.450> smoother<00:03:27.050> like

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
like probably a lot smoother like

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.260 
like probably a lot smoother like
crispier<00:03:27.830> I<00:03:28.130> would<00:03:28.580> like<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.940> get<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.090> pop

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
crispier I would like to get a pop

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.820 
crispier I would like to get a pop
filter<00:03:29.480> for<00:03:29.810> this<00:03:29.930> for<00:03:30.140> when<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.290> do<00:03:30.380> focal

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
filter for this for when I do focal

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.930 
filter for this for when I do focal
covers<00:03:31.100> on<00:03:31.280> my<00:03:31.400> other<00:03:31.490> channel<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:32.620> don't<00:03:33.620> know

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
covers on my other channel I don't know

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.199 
covers on my other channel I don't know
but<00:03:35.110> yeah<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.410> would<00:03:36.920> say<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.220> because<00:03:37.670> when<00:03:38.180> I

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
but yeah I would say that because when I

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.280 
but yeah I would say that because when I
do<00:03:38.300> vocal<00:03:39.050> cover<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.470> blow<00:03:41.080> into<00:03:42.080> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
do vocal cover you blow into the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.470 
do vocal cover you blow into the
microphone<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.950> know<00:03:43.280> kind<00:03:43.520> of<00:03:43.580> pop<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.239> out

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
microphone you know kind of pop it out

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.970 
microphone you know kind of pop it out
and<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.920> if<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.130> get<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.340> pop<00:03:46.459> filter<00:03:47.800> it<00:03:48.800> kind

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
and so if you get the pop filter it kind

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.009 
and so if you get the pop filter it kind
of<00:03:49.010> maxes<00:03:49.340> out<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.550> blowing<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.090> can<00:03:50.300> go<00:03:50.420> and

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
of maxes out the blowing so I can go and

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.320 
of maxes out the blowing so I can go and
it<00:03:51.410> won't<00:03:51.590> affect<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.730> sound<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.180> the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
it won't affect the sound of the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.590 
it won't affect the sound of the
microphone<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.840> won't<00:03:54.019> make<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.410> max<00:03:54.950> out<00:03:55.280> in

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
microphone it won't make it max out in

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.449 
microphone it won't make it max out in
terms<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.840> how<00:03:57.110> high<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.380> audio<00:03:57.860> spike<00:03:58.250> will

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
terms of how high the audio spike will

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.610 
terms of how high the audio spike will
go<00:04:00.670> but<00:04:01.670> let's<00:04:01.940> do<00:04:02.120> some<00:04:02.390> close-ups<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.320> this

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
go but let's do some close-ups of this

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.759 
go but let's do some close-ups of this
because<00:04:04.480> I've<00:04:05.480> just<00:04:05.930> been<00:04:06.080> talking<00:04:06.410> here

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
because I've just been talking here

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:19.750 
because I've just been talking here
randomly<00:04:07.220> about<00:04:16.419> so<00:04:17.419> here<00:04:17.900> on<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.229> side<00:04:18.760> you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
say 36 and then there'll be the light

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.810 
say 36 and then there'll be the light
under<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:06.020> zoom<00:06:06.310> which<00:06:07.310> is<00:06:07.490> lighting<00:06:07.760> up

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
under the zoom which is lighting up

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.990 
under the zoom which is lighting up
right<00:06:08.090> now<00:06:08.300> and<00:06:08.720> that<00:06:09.650> indicates<00:06:09.980> that<00:06:10.370> right

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
right now and that indicates that right

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.530 
right now and that indicates that right
now<00:06:11.210> it<00:06:11.540> is<00:06:11.750> recording<00:06:12.500> and<00:06:12.940> then<00:06:13.940> under<00:06:14.510> that

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
now it is recording and then under that

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.490 
now it is recording and then under that
is<00:06:15.260> the<00:06:16.190> stop<00:06:16.760> button<00:06:17.120> let<00:06:17.990> me<00:06:18.080> turn<00:06:18.230> up<00:06:18.380> the

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
is the stop button let me turn up the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.180 
is the stop button let me turn up the
gain<00:06:19.690> comes<00:06:20.690> them<00:06:20.780> farther<00:06:21.050> away<00:06:21.200> so<00:06:21.440> my<00:06:21.950> gain

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
gain comes them farther away so my gain

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:37.630 
gain comes them farther away so my gain
is<00:06:22.220> at<00:06:22.640> five<00:06:33.160> from<00:06:34.160> the<00:06:34.250> front<00:06:34.580> as<00:06:34.760> I<00:06:35.600> talk<00:06:36.640> it

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
is at five from the front as I talk it

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:45.580 
is at five from the front as I talk it
gets<00:06:37.880> louder<00:06:38.090> and<00:06:43.060> but<00:06:44.060> I<00:06:44.180> like<00:06:44.930> this<00:06:45.110> thing<00:06:45.350> it

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
gets louder and but I like this thing it

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.560 
gets louder and but I like this thing it
has<00:06:45.740> a<00:06:45.770> really<00:06:46.100> clean<00:06:46.340> audio<00:06:47.000> source

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
has a really clean audio source

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.160 
has a really clean audio source
I<00:06:47.600> bought<00:06:48.320> this<00:06:48.530> over<00:06:48.980> the<00:06:49.220> rode<00:06:49.490> videomic

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
I bought this over the rode videomic

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.470 
I bought this over the rode videomic
simply<00:06:51.170> because<00:06:51.500> I<00:06:51.860> thought<00:06:52.790> this<00:06:52.970> would<00:06:53.210> give

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
simply because I thought this would give

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.390 
simply because I thought this would give
me<00:06:53.510> a<00:06:53.630> lot<00:06:53.810> better<00:06:53.960> audio<00:06:54.320> from<00:06:54.980> the<00:06:55.220> rode

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
me a lot better audio from the rode

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.970 
me a lot better audio from the rode
videomic<00:06:55.730> does<00:06:56.090> and<00:06:57.050> I<00:06:57.440> can't<00:06:57.650> really<00:06:57.770> say

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:57.980 
videomic does and I can't really say

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.110
