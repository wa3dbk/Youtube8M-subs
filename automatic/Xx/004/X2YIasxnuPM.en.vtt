00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
I made this is the reason why I said the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.979 
I made this is the reason why I said the
other<00:02:09.649> heavy<00:02:10.340> conversion<00:02:11.060> beaver<00:02:11.239> he's<00:02:11.780> got

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
other heavy conversion beaver he's got

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.660 
other heavy conversion beaver he's got
conversion<00:02:12.530> beam<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.950> now<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.100> idea<00:02:13.310> what<00:02:13.640> I

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
conversion beam and now the idea what I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.850 
conversion beam and now the idea what I
made<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.390> separate<00:02:15.290> shoulder<00:02:15.650> pads

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
made this one separate shoulder pads

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.490 
made this one separate shoulder pads
several<00:02:16.550> hours<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.510> then<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.290> your

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
several hours so then you can have your

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.590 
several hours so then you can have your
own<00:02:18.650> master<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.190> forge<00:02:19.489> with<00:02:20.030> conversion

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
own master of the forge with conversion

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.740 
own master of the forge with conversion
via<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:25.610> other<00:02:25.760> reason<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.090> make<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.450> I've
