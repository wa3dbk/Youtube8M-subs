actually<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.759> slightly<00:01:39.240> higher

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
actually going to be slightly higher

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.840 
actually going to be slightly higher
rank<00:01:39.900> than<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.290> teammates<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.610> have

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
rank than your teammates now if you have

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.330 
rank than your teammates now if you have
no<00:01:42.180> synergy<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.259> no<00:01:43.470> communication

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
no synergy and have no communication

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.770 
no synergy and have no communication
because<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> don't<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.600> person

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
because you don't really know the person

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.109 
because you don't really know the person
then<00:01:46.439> you're<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.920> making<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> game<00:01:47.640> harder

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
then you're just making the game harder

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.359 
then you're just making the game harder
for<00:01:48.270> yourself<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.930> no<00:01:49.140> reason<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
for yourself for no reason at all the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
for yourself for no reason at all the
only<00:01:50.549> times<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.299> good<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.899> are

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
only times I think it's good to do are

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.200 
only times I think it's good to do are
when<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.860> play<00:01:53.100> roles<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.700> affect<00:01:54.060> each

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
when you play roles that affect each

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.690 
when you play roles that affect each
other<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> jungle<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.130> solo<00:01:56.430> Lane

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
other so like a jungle and a solo Lane

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
other so like a jungle and a solo Lane
where<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.210> gank<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.719> them<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.049> ad<00:01:58.590> carry

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
where you can gank for them or ad carry

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.560 
where you can gank for them or ad carry
and<00:01:59.250> support<00:01:59.790> where<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> communication

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and support where the communication

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.530 
and support where the communication
actually<00:02:01.200> makes<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.920> difference<00:02:02.119> now<00:02:03.119> next<00:02:03.360> up

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
actually makes a difference now next up

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.649 
actually makes a difference now next up
is<00:02:03.750> crowd<00:02:04.409> control<00:02:04.439> wins<00:02:05.280> games<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.509> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
is crowd control wins games now this is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.600 
is crowd control wins games now this is
a<00:02:06.689> bigger<00:02:07.020> thing<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.619> lower<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.039> low<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.250> get

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
a bigger thing the lower a low you get

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.969 
a bigger thing the lower a low you get
but<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.209> still<00:02:09.629> true<00:02:09.869> at<00:02:10.200> higher<00:02:10.530> reloads

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
but it is still true at higher reloads

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
but it is still true at higher reloads
and<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.700> general<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.629> T

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and in general the T

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.660 
and in general the T
with<00:02:13.079> more<00:02:13.260> crowd<00:02:13.530> control<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.189> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.489> have

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
with more crowd control is going to have

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.940 
with more crowd control is going to have
the<00:02:14.879> stronger<00:02:15.239> teamfight<00:02:15.720> now<00:02:16.260> crowd<00:02:16.560> control

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the stronger teamfight now crowd control

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.369 
the stronger teamfight now crowd control
is<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.610> easiest<00:02:18.180> way<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> setting<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:18.989> kills

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
is the easiest way of setting up kills

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.679 
is the easiest way of setting up kills
which<00:02:19.829> then<00:02:20.129> gives<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.640> an<00:02:20.790> advantage<00:02:20.970> and

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
which then gives you an advantage and

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.569 
which then gives you an advantage and
lets<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.140> take<00:02:22.290> objectives<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.159> from<00:02:23.400> that

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
lets you take objectives just from that

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.580 
lets you take objectives just from that
now<00:02:24.120> there<00:02:24.269> are<00:02:24.360> two<00:02:24.540> things<00:02:24.780> here<00:02:24.930> which<00:02:25.319> make

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
now there are two things here which make

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.009 
now there are two things here which make
this<00:02:25.769> even<00:02:26.310> better<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:27.000> aren't<00:02:27.569> particularly

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
this even better and aren't particularly

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.589 
this even better and aren't particularly
obvious<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.189> you're<00:02:29.340> behind<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.329> have

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
obvious so if you're behind but you have

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.539 
obvious so if you're behind but you have
hard<00:02:30.900> crowd<00:02:31.170> control<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.099> can<00:02:32.250> turn

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
hard crowd control then you can turn

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.869 
hard crowd control then you can turn
fights<00:02:32.909> you've<00:02:33.299> all<00:02:33.540> seen<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.170> wombo-combo

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
fights you've all seen that wombo-combo

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.849 
fights you've all seen that wombo-combo
annihilate<00:02:35.879> everyone<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.470> means<00:02:37.680> you

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
annihilate everyone and that means you

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.530 
annihilate everyone and that means you
always<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> chance<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:38.909> winning<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.329> game

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
always have a chance at winning the game

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.380 
always have a chance at winning the game
the<00:02:40.260> second<00:02:40.680> thing<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.189> that<00:02:41.670> crowd<00:02:41.909> control

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the second thing is that crowd control

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.140 
the second thing is that crowd control
kind<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.959> naturally<00:02:43.530> works<00:02:43.769> together<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.730> when

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
kind of naturally works together so when

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.819 
kind of naturally works together so when
you<00:02:45.269> layer<00:02:45.480> something<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.230> an<00:02:46.409> Oreo

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
you layer something like an Oreo

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.460 
you layer something like an Oreo
ultimate<00:02:47.489> into<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> Malphite<00:02:48.659> ultimate<00:02:48.810> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
ultimate into a Malphite ultimate you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.649 
ultimate into a Malphite ultimate you
don't<00:02:49.739> even<00:02:49.920> have<00:02:50.129> to<00:02:50.310> use<00:02:50.519> them<00:02:50.700> together<00:02:50.940> but

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
don't even have to use them together but

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.720 
don't even have to use them together but
they<00:02:51.900> make<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.409> effect<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.159> other<00:02:53.430> role

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
they make the effect of the other role

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.690 
they make the effect of the other role
used<00:02:54.120> even<00:02:54.599> better<00:02:54.840> now<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:55.980> also<00:02:56.220> kind<00:02:56.549> of

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
used even better now this also kind of

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.670 
used even better now this also kind of
leads<00:02:56.879> on<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.389> next<00:02:57.629> point<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.079> that's

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
leads on to the next point and that's

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.069 
leads on to the next point and that's
look<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.189> take<00:02:59.370> objectives<00:02:59.939> whenever<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.750> can

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
look to take objectives whenever you can

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.259 
look to take objectives whenever you can
especially<00:03:01.859> Baron<00:03:02.159> and<00:03:02.310> dragon<00:03:02.340> now<00:03:03.180> I'm

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
especially Baron and dragon now I'm

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.449 
especially Baron and dragon now I'm
actually<00:03:03.389> going<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.049> separate<00:03:04.799> video<00:03:04.950> on

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
actually going to do a separate video on

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.429 
actually going to do a separate video on
how<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.819> take<00:03:06.000> these<00:03:06.239> properly<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:07.109> with

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
how to take these properly but with

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.229 
how to take these properly but with
dragon<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.129> want<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.459> be<00:03:08.549> taking<00:03:08.939> this<00:03:09.030> as

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
dragon you want to be taking this as

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.289 
dragon you want to be taking this as
early<00:03:09.900> as<00:03:10.109> possible<00:03:10.459> now<00:03:11.459> when<00:03:11.609> I<00:03:11.639> say<00:03:11.939> this<00:03:12.060> is

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
early as possible now when I say this is

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.899 
early as possible now when I say this is
really<00:03:12.599> obvious<00:03:13.139> but<00:03:13.500> taking<00:03:14.129> it<00:03:14.280> early<00:03:14.639> means

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
really obvious but taking it early means

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.970 
really obvious but taking it early means
you<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.239> take<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.599> again<00:03:15.689> sooner<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.769> get

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
you can take it again sooner and you get

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.069 
you can take it again sooner and you get
even<00:03:17.160> more<00:03:17.609> gold<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.449> experience<00:03:19.019> that

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
even more gold and the experience that

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.349 
even more gold and the experience that
it<00:03:19.260> gives<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:19.799> well<00:03:20.129> it's<00:03:20.699> not<00:03:20.879> just<00:03:21.150> you

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
it gives you as well it's not just you

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.990 
it gives you as well it's not just you
either<00:03:21.690> remember<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> team<00:03:23.250> game<00:03:23.699> and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
either remember this is a team game and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.479 
either remember this is a team game and
your<00:03:24.299> entire<00:03:24.780> team<00:03:25.199> is<00:03:25.530> going<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.949> get<00:03:26.310> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
your entire team is going to get the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.939 
your entire team is going to get the
gold<00:03:26.699> and<00:03:26.879> experience<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.870> even<00:03:28.500> if<00:03:28.680> one<00:03:28.889> of

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
gold and experience so even if one of

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.740 
gold and experience so even if one of
your<00:03:29.159> teammates<00:03:29.639> isn't<00:03:30.060> playing<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.540> well

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
your teammates isn't playing that well

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.080 
your teammates isn't playing that well
there<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.949> useful<00:03:32.010> with<00:03:32.579> more<00:03:32.819> gold

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
there can be more useful with more gold

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.210 
there can be more useful with more gold
so<00:03:33.389> it<00:03:33.510> does<00:03:33.690> make<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> difference<00:03:34.139> in<00:03:35.010> my

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
so it does make a difference in my

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.250 
so it does make a difference in my
opinion<00:03:35.639> you<00:03:35.849> can't<00:03:36.150> really<00:03:36.449> afford<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.900> just

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
opinion you can't really afford to just

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.559 
opinion you can't really afford to just
ignore<00:03:37.500> dragon<00:03:38.159> in<00:03:38.370> soloqueue<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.329> you'll

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
ignore dragon in soloqueue and you'll

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.899 
ignore dragon in soloqueue and you'll
notice<00:03:39.840> when<00:03:40.199> you<00:03:40.319> watch<00:03:40.500> any<00:03:40.829> pro<00:03:41.190> stream<00:03:41.669> or

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
notice when you watch any pro stream or

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.509 
notice when you watch any pro stream or
the<00:03:42.269> LCS<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.199> they<00:03:43.319> take<00:03:43.620> dragon<00:03:43.919> normally

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
the LCS that they take dragon normally

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.610 
the LCS that they take dragon normally
before<00:03:44.760> 10<00:03:45.269> minutes<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:45.870> that's<00:03:46.199> a<00:03:46.379> lot

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
before 10 minutes and that's a lot

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.979 
before 10 minutes and that's a lot
quicker<00:03:46.919> than<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:47.340> lower<00:03:47.519> ELO's<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.810> next

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
quicker than in lower ELO's so the next

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.110 
quicker than in lower ELO's so the next
game<00:03:49.199> you<00:03:49.260> jump<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.829> try<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.430> does<00:03:50.790> when<00:03:51.000> you

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
game you jump in to try it does when you

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.030 
game you jump in to try it does when you
get<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.299> kill<00:03:51.599> bot<00:03:51.840> lane<00:03:52.019> or<00:03:52.260> mid<00:03:52.319> lane<00:03:52.829> just

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
get a kill bot lane or mid lane just

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.399 
get a kill bot lane or mid lane just
call<00:03:53.489> for<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.760> dragon<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.389> take<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.959> if<00:03:55.169> the

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
call for the dragon and take it if the

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.559 
call for the dragon and take it if the
enemy<00:03:55.769> team<00:03:55.799> do<00:03:56.280> come<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.729> try<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.090> stop<00:03:57.359> you

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
enemy team do come to try and stop you

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.839 
enemy team do come to try and stop you
you<00:03:57.840> can<00:03:58.049> turn<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.650> fight<00:03:58.949> and<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.459> just<00:03:59.489> makes

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
you can turn and fight and it just makes

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.789 
you can turn and fight and it just makes
you<00:04:00.060> even<00:04:00.269> more<00:04:00.599> kills<00:04:01.019> because<00:04:01.560> they're

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
you even more kills because they're

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.189 
you even more kills because they're
going<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.190> be<00:04:02.310> player<00:04:02.579> down<00:04:02.849> already<00:04:03.209> okay<00:04:04.139> so

going to be player down already okay so

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.080 
going to be player down already okay so
you<00:04:04.409> guys<00:04:04.590> know<00:04:04.889> that<00:04:04.919> I<00:04:05.400> don't<00:04:05.699> believe<00:04:05.879> in

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
you guys know that I don't believe in

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.490 
you guys know that I don't believe in
this<00:04:06.180> whole<00:04:06.419> just<00:04:06.810> having<00:04:07.229> a<00:04:07.319> positive

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
this whole just having a positive

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.460 
this whole just having a positive
attitude<00:04:07.979> wins<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.790> games<00:04:09.060> but<00:04:09.540> there<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:10.049> one

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
attitude wins you games but there is one

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.349 
attitude wins you games but there is one
aspect<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:11.129> that<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.669> I<00:04:11.729> actually<00:04:11.909> think<00:04:12.209> is

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
aspect of that that I actually think is

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.689 
aspect of that that I actually think is
really<00:04:12.780> important<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:13.500> that's<00:04:13.949> don't<00:04:14.400> ever

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
really important and that's don't ever

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.000 
really important and that's don't ever
argue<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:15.989> as<00:04:16.139> soon<00:04:16.320> as<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.590> argue<00:04:16.829> with

someone even if you're right you lower
the<00:04:19.560> chances<00:04:19.949> of<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.280> winning<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:21.090> aren't

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
the chances of you winning you aren't

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.390 
the chances of you winning you aren't
concentrating<00:04:21.750> as<00:04:22.289> much<00:04:22.650> because<00:04:22.919> you're

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
concentrating as much because you're

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.580 
concentrating as much because you're
frustrated<00:04:24.060> at<00:04:24.300> them<00:04:24.599> and<00:04:24.840> they<00:04:25.289> aren't<00:04:25.500> going

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
frustrated at them and they aren't going

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.060 
frustrated at them and they aren't going
to<00:04:25.770> be

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
to be

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.860 
to be
trying<00:04:26.280> as<00:04:26.430> hard<00:04:26.670> because<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:27.300> annoyed<00:04:27.690> it

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
trying as hard because that annoyed it

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.840 
trying as hard because that annoyed it
either<00:04:27.990> calling<00:04:28.500> them<00:04:28.620> out<00:04:28.740> or<00:04:29.010> they<00:04:29.640> just

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
either calling them out or they just

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.730 
either calling them out or they just
realize<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.480> they<00:04:30.600> are<00:04:30.720> actually<00:04:31.230> wrong<00:04:31.500> and

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
realize that they are actually wrong and

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.320 
realize that they are actually wrong and
they're<00:04:32.100> embarrassed<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:32.790> they<00:04:32.910> just<00:04:33.120> stop

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
they're embarrassed so they just stop

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.980 
they're embarrassed so they just stop
trying

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
trying

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.200 
trying
honestly<00:04:34.560> it's<00:04:34.890> really<00:04:35.550> not<00:04:35.700> worth<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
honestly it's really not worth the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.450 
honestly it's really not worth the
argument<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.260> hate<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.860> think<00:04:38.130> how<00:04:38.370> many

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
argument and I hate to think how many

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.850 
argument and I hate to think how many
games<00:04:38.790> I've<00:04:39.030> lost<00:04:39.450> because<00:04:39.930> I've<00:04:40.110> pointed<00:04:40.560> out

now at lower ELO's this is a bigger

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.620 
now at lower ELO's this is a bigger
problem<00:04:52.350> i<00:04:52.800> watch<00:04:53.280> people<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:54.060> they<00:04:54.360> have

now<00:05:26.160> this<00:05:26.310> last<00:05:26.550> tip<00:05:26.850> is<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.390> hardest<00:05:27.870> to

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
now this last tip is the hardest to

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.050 
now this last tip is the hardest to
start<00:05:28.290> putting<00:05:28.710> into<00:05:28.980> practice<00:05:29.550> because<00:05:29.730> you

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
start putting into practice because you

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.880 
start putting into practice because you
have<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.420> learn<00:05:30.600> how<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:30.900> push<00:05:31.320> your<00:05:31.350> lead<00:05:31.680> in

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890

have to learn how to push your lead in
the<00:05:32.160> first<00:05:32.460> place<00:05:32.730> so<00:05:33.030> I'll<00:05:33.360> probably<00:05:33.810> do<00:05:34.110> a

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
the first place so I'll probably do a

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.170 
the first place so I'll probably do a
video<00:05:34.440> on<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.890> type<00:05:35.160> of<00:05:35.400> things<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.700> can<00:05:35.970> do

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
video on the type of things you can do

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.330 
video on the type of things you can do
but<00:05:36.660> take<00:05:36.960> those<00:05:37.170> examples<00:05:37.530> for<00:05:37.980> now<00:05:38.130> that

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
but take those examples for now that

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.400
