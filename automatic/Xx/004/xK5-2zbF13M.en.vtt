00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.629
 and that and 8 people 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.559
 what do we need we go and dough 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.360
 put 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.800
 100 grams of powdered sugar 100 grams of butter 250 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.849
 grams of flour 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.529
 half a teaspoon of salt as the flour 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.390
 because of the butter and the sugar 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.460
 I a crumb dough 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.619
 then the two eggs butter and powdered sugar 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.270
 knead together 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.969
 of course you can do this at home with 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.140
 assemble the mixer and the hook 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.600
 but I already like it 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.810
 visibly there to leave it that way 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.280
 would almost forget the salt this is 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.680
 3 grams of salt butter powdered sugar and it 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.650
 salt aim at a whole 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.890
 bakers and very economical and pastry chef 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.630
 always has a scratch on everything 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.540
 what he uses braced to the 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.370
 breakdown always we have them this 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.050
 indispensable 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.149
 well look my hands are wonders now 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.430
 does not matter now I come with the flour 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.750
 100 grams of butter 100 grams of powdered sugar 250 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.600
 grams of flour 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.659
 You understand that's one for the attitude 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.690
 that's so much flour 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.659
 we can never knead this 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.280
 can make a crumble dough but 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.280
 I will not get further 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.350
 we call this this by his Arnhem dough 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.440
 with a lot of flour a little butter and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.229
 little sugar but suitable for that 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.909
 the cake and as we are going to make it 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.530
 those eggs at the end 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.720
 going through it causes this 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.960
 a tie dough we call it 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.040
 pate's sucre but you can do it 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.530
 also mention 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.100
 and thay dough with little butter and little 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.110
 sugar a lot of flour and eggs 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.380
 now I do this suit just a little flour 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.430
 this dough is free by kneading 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.130
 become soft 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.770
 there you get a dough that you can roll out 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.450
 you can see that the tough she is 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.040
 totally the intention 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.470
 we take it easy now 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.250
 refrigerator discard the dough was your lies 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.349
 to rest 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.080
 we go for a pan of 24 centimeters 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.540
 Melt 50 grams of butter in the microwave 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.159
 it is poured on the bottom and 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.370
 divide that with a brush and me 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.100
 do it 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.760
 with a brush so cutting edges 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.090
 make sure that it is nicely equal to 50 grams 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.459
 sugar 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.770
 we season with cinnamon well 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.420
 very simple cinnamon stirring the bee 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.430
 do you have cinnamon sugar 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.430
 and then we come with the cinnamon sugar 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.480
 they are this 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.040
 Jonagold I have and also of the week 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.050
 I defied tarts when I got up 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.380
 recommend from my greengrocer elstar 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.709
 also uses a perfect apple 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.870
 nice and fresh in there as your apples 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.790
 buy from the supermarket and they will be 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.860
 offered very cheaply 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.820
 then you can say that 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.880
 cool 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.680
 House apples are those that look good 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.450
 but they just have a year or 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.280
 perhaps even a longer one 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.080
 cool house and who needs that 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.730
 are then dumped 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.230
 And then you think you put a nice apple in it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.700
 house but there is absolutely no 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.239
 taste to it 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.390
 so then you should check with the 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:21.489
 specialist of this is a good acids 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.489
 solid apple well that is in this case 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:30.290
 we put them in the pan 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:32.840
 with the point to the center I have four 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.620
 dough you flowers on the bench I 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.130
 must say that this is a bit 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.470
 for fries twice and but it is almost 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.459
 not to do to such a very small recipe 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.730
 to roll out 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.370
 so a piece of dough becomes common 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.620
 Stored in the freezer with a 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.019
 sticker on it when it entered 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.070
 is and especially what is in it is one 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.750
 tip that 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.549
 you have to take that to heart because if you 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.040
 just a piece of dough in the freezer 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.290
 explain then you really do not know next week 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.760
 more what you put into it I want this 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.250
 nice and thin skin 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.709
 the advantage of this language is your dough 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.750
 it does not get stuck on the couch 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.660
 you can see that i was a little sorry 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.450
 turn around and search with the roll stop 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.019
 where there is still a thick place this seems to me 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.380
 pretty nice here I have a lid that something 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.250
 larger than the pan and I cut with one 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.540
 chef's knife 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.480
 is 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.310
 so cut it off look this is near 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.090
 together the other half of the dough 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.980
 what I said in the plastic sticker 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.450
 on it and then you have it next time 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.730
 ready your dough 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.370
 I pick up the dough now I put it on you 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.230
 the apple and I stop 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.390
 as if you make a bed on the dough 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.630
 between the apple and the rim 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.360
 the apple then stands up and that 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.690
 I do this back and make it in it 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.640
 center a small hole so that the steam 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.870
 have it apples and moisture can 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.800
 escape 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.660
 so goes the half an hour in the oven at 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.990
 220 degrees is the now fifteen minutes 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.990
 in 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.160
 cake goes very well and goes there 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.890
 now out 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.910
 and let's leave that for four to five minutes 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.840
 so the syrup is in the apples for a moment 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.720
 to draw 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.760
 so just leave it alone about 5 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.570
 minutes we turn on a flat 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.300
 Scale 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.480
 I grab a cloth and turn it in one go 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.480
 to 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.540
 Yes 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.830
 that's true
