the pointer finger and you pluck on the
5th<00:01:52.250> fret<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.850> b-string

so when you slide to the seventh fret so

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.830 
so when you slide to the seventh fret so
let's<00:02:00.320> do<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.500> again<00:02:00.590> here<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:05.570> it's<00:02:05.720> gonna

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
let's do it again here so it's gonna

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.050 
let's do it again here so it's gonna
make<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.200> sound<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:07.100> don't<00:02:07.190> plug<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.880> both

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
