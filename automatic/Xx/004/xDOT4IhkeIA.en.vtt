00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
missing the fender so I'm have to try to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.299 
missing the fender so I'm have to try to
find<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.800> fenders<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.309> will<00:00:35.760> match<00:00:36.510> this

find some fenders that will match this

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.020 
find some fenders that will match this
bike<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.969> arrow<00:00:39.480> bike<00:00:40.190> as<00:00:41.190> best<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.579> can

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
bike this arrow bike as best I can

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.840 
bike this arrow bike as best I can
now<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> chain<00:00:42.989> guard<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
now the chain guard I think this is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.260 
now the chain guard I think this is
original<00:00:45.270> I've<00:00:45.450> seen<00:00:45.719> some<00:00:45.870> pictures<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.590> some

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
original I've seen some pictures of some

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.119 
original I've seen some pictures of some
Indian<00:00:48.270> scouts<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.140> had<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.680> chain<00:00:49.980> guard

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
Indian scouts that had a chain guard

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.869 
Indian scouts that had a chain guard
like<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> chain<00:00:52.110> ring<00:00:52.379> there

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
like this and now the chain ring there

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.479 
like this and now the chain ring there
I've<00:00:53.879> seen<00:00:54.590> pictures<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.800> Indian<00:00:56.070> scouts<00:00:56.309> with

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I've seen pictures of Indian scouts with

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
I've seen pictures of Indian scouts with
a<00:00:56.520> different<00:00:56.910> style<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.449> chain<00:00:57.840> ring<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
a different style of chain ring on that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.119 
a different style of chain ring on that
than<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.809> chain<00:01:01.620> ring<00:01:01.800> here

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
than this one but this chain ring here

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.179 
than this one but this chain ring here
does<00:01:02.460> seem<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.170> match<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:04.500> I've<00:01:04.619> seen<00:01:04.890> on

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
does seem to match what I've seen on

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
does seem to match what I've seen on
some<00:01:05.820> mid<00:01:06.210> 50s<00:01:07.670> Phillips<00:01:08.670> bikes<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:09.720> not

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
some mid 50s Phillips bikes so I'm not

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
some mid 50s Phillips bikes so I'm not
quite<00:01:10.049> sure<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.220> original<00:01:11.340> chain

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
quite sure if this is the original chain

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
quite sure if this is the original chain
ring<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> cotter<00:01:14.369> pins

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
ring or not now one of the cotter pins

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.270 
ring or not now one of the cotter pins
is<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:16.110> incorrectly<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.159> there

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
is in there incorrectly it's in there

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.600 
is in there incorrectly it's in there
backwards<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> bells<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> phase

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
backwards so the bells are out of phase

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.460 
backwards so the bells are out of phase
they<00:01:20.939> should<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.570> 180<00:01:22.140> degrees<00:01:22.409> from

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
they should be like 180 degrees from

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
they should be like 180 degrees from
each<00:01:22.619> other<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:22.950> they're<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.369> quite<00:01:23.670> exactly

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
each other but they're not quite exactly

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.600 
each other but they're not quite exactly
Bank<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.740> probably<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.340> cotter

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
Bank that so this probably this cotter

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.740 
Bank that so this probably this cotter
pin<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:27.930> kind<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.829> norm<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
pin here because kind of the the norm is

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.740 
pin here because kind of the the norm is
that<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.439> nut<00:01:31.829> when<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> downstroke

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that the nut when the on the downstroke

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.690 
that the nut when the on the downstroke
here<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.380> nut<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.070> top<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
here the nut is going to be on top so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640 
here the nut is going to be on top so
right<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> pins<00:01:37.079> sticking<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
right now it's the pins sticking out of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170 
right now it's the pins sticking out of
there<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.070> I'm<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.939> pin<00:01:39.150> out

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
there so I'm going to take this pin out

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
there so I'm going to take this pin out
and<00:01:39.750> reverse<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.920> got<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.189> ugly

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and reverse it it's got this ugly

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
and reverse it it's got this ugly
reflector<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.210> there<00:01:42.450> which<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.720> obviously

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
reflector on there which is obviously

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.749 
reflector on there which is obviously
not<00:01:43.259> original<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.070> I'll<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.340> coming<00:01:44.490> off

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
not original so that I'll be coming off

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.300 
not original so that I'll be coming off
it's<00:01:45.659> got<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> Brooks<00:01:46.470> saddle<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.220> which

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it's got a Brooks saddle on there which

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.260 
it's got a Brooks saddle on there which
is<00:01:47.430> kind<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.670> cool

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
is kind of cool

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.580 
is kind of cool
though<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.750> some<00:01:48.899> reason<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> big

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
though for some reason it's got a big

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
though for some reason it's got a big
lump<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> middle<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.509> this

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
lump right in the middle of it but this

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.030 
lump right in the middle of it but this
is<00:01:51.689> probably<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:52.170> original<00:01:52.470> saddle<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.920> would

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
is probably an original saddle I would

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.399 
is probably an original saddle I would
think<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.820> bike<00:01:54.000> has<00:01:54.270> been<00:01:54.299> repainted<00:01:54.960> very

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
think the bike has been repainted very

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.249 
think the bike has been repainted very
poorly<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.689> probably<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
poorly and so I'm probably have it

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.709 
poorly and so I'm probably have it
stripped<00:01:58.560> down<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.430> repainted<00:02:00.360> I'm<00:02:00.570> gonna

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
stripped down and repainted I'm gonna

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.959 
stripped down and repainted I'm gonna
try<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> figure<00:02:01.079> out

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
try to figure out

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.029 
try to figure out
the<00:02:02.329> original<00:02:02.719> color<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.530> bike<00:02:03.770> I'll

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
the original color of the bike I'll

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.010 
the original color of the bike I'll
probably<00:02:04.219> strip<00:02:04.610> off<00:02:04.759> some<00:02:05.000> layers<00:02:05.570> of<00:02:05.840> paint

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
probably strip off some layers of paint

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.650 
probably strip off some layers of paint
and<00:02:06.259> see<00:02:06.409> what's<00:02:06.619> under<00:02:06.829> there<00:02:07.039> so<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.450> it's

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
and see what's under there so and it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.359 
and see what's under there so and it's
also<00:02:08.750> missing<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.410> decals<00:02:09.920> there<00:02:10.130> should<00:02:10.280> be

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
also missing the decals there should be

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.300 
also missing the decals there should be
a<00:02:10.399> decal<00:02:10.849> an<00:02:11.180> Indian<00:02:11.780> decal<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.410> seat<00:02:13.069> tube

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
a decal an Indian decal on the seat tube

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.240 
a decal an Indian decal on the seat tube
and<00:02:13.610> also<00:02:14.569> an<00:02:14.720> Indian<00:02:15.019> scout<00:02:15.230> decal<00:02:15.709> here<00:02:16.040> on

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
and also an Indian scout decal here on

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.250 
and also an Indian scout decal here on
the<00:02:16.430> chain<00:02:16.670> guard<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.360> both<00:02:17.540> those<00:02:17.810> are<00:02:18.050> gone

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
the chain guard so both those are gone

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.960 
the chain guard so both those are gone
I'll<00:02:18.650> need<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.980> get<00:02:19.069> some<00:02:19.220> new<00:02:19.370> ones<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:19.760> those

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
I'll need to get some new ones for those

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.270 
I'll need to get some new ones for those
hopefully<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.840> find<00:02:21.170> them<00:02:21.349> it's<00:02:22.040> got<00:02:22.160> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
hopefully I can find them it's got the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.460 
hopefully I can find them it's got the
Indian<00:02:22.640> scout<00:02:22.970> head<00:02:23.330> badge<00:02:23.599> on<00:02:23.959> here<00:02:24.290> it's

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
Indian scout head badge on here it's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.770 
Indian scout head badge on here it's
riveted<00:02:24.800> onto<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> frame<00:02:25.519> so<00:02:26.300> when<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.510> go<00:02:26.630> have

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
riveted onto the frame so when I go have

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.960 
riveted onto the frame so when I go have
a<00:02:26.870> repaint<00:02:27.380> hid<00:02:27.620> I'm<00:02:27.769> gonna<00:02:27.890> have<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:28.250> remove

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
a repaint hid I'm gonna have to remove

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.729 
a repaint hid I'm gonna have to remove
the<00:02:29.150> rivets<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.720> then<00:02:30.019> figure<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:30.530> how<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
the rivets and then figure out how to

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.250 
the rivets and then figure out how to
rivet<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.099> back<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.430> after<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.269> fact<00:02:32.510> these

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
rivet it back on after the fact these

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.440 
rivet it back on after the fact these
strips<00:02:33.560> are<00:02:33.769> not<00:02:34.069> original<00:02:34.760> probably<00:02:35.420> I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
strips are not original probably I

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110 
strips are not original probably I
seriously<00:02:36.410> doubt<00:02:36.799> they<00:02:37.310> came<00:02:37.580> out<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.030> this

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
seriously doubt they came out and this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.820 
seriously doubt they came out and this
sort<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.420> metallic<00:02:38.690> green<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:41.290> brake<00:02:42.290> levers

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
sort of metallic green the brake levers

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.330 
sort of metallic green the brake levers
are<00:02:43.160> not<00:02:43.910> matched<00:02:44.450> I'm<00:02:44.840> leaning<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.319> -<00:02:45.500> that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
are not matched I'm leaning the - that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.190 
are not matched I'm leaning the - that
this<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:47.299> original<00:02:47.739> brake<00:02:48.739> lever<00:02:49.099> and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
this is the original brake lever and

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.720 
this is the original brake lever and
that<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.380> brake<00:02:51.680> lever<00:02:51.950> here<00:02:52.340> has<00:02:52.549> been

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
that this brake lever here has been

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.710 
that this brake lever here has been
replaced<00:02:53.150> because<00:02:53.360> there<00:02:53.480> are<00:02:53.540> two<00:02:53.630> different

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
replaced because there are two different

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.949 
replaced because there are two different
styles<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:56.060> try<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.239> figure<00:02:56.540> out<00:02:56.630> which<00:02:56.780> one

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
styles so to try to figure out which one

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.259 
styles so to try to figure out which one
was<00:02:57.079> original<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.680> then<00:02:57.950> match<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:59.090> has

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
was original and then match it it has

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.839 
was original and then match it it has
the<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.750> mount<00:02:59.930> here<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> headlamp<00:03:01.099> so<00:03:01.549> I

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
the the mount here for a headlamp so I

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.819 
the the mount here for a headlamp so I
may<00:03:02.000> try<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.269> find<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.810> headlamp<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.410> fit<00:03:03.620> this

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
may try to find a headlamp to fit this

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.110 
may try to find a headlamp to fit this
and<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:05.269> came<00:03:05.450> with<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.930> Dino<00:03:06.350> hub<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:07.579> this<00:03:08.000> is

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
and it came with a Dino hub so this is

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.789 
and it came with a Dino hub so this is
pretty<00:03:08.299> cool<00:03:08.600> it's<00:03:08.870> basically<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.319> generator

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
pretty cool it's basically a generator

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.330 
pretty cool it's basically a generator
that<00:03:09.890> fits<00:03:10.160> on<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> front<00:03:10.700> wheel<00:03:10.940> hub<00:03:11.359> and<00:03:12.340> so

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
that fits on the front wheel hub and so

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.330 
that fits on the front wheel hub and so
that<00:03:13.579> this<00:03:14.569> you<00:03:14.930> hook<00:03:15.260> up<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.440> little<00:03:15.980> power

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
that this you hook up the little power

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.410 
that this you hook up the little power
here<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.739> power<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.950> light<00:03:19.160> for<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.060> headlamp

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
here to power the light for the headlamp

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.420 
here to power the light for the headlamp
looks<00:03:21.139> like<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.319> had<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> speedometer<00:03:21.980> type

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
looks like you had a speedometer type

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.879 
looks like you had a speedometer type
mount<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:22.970> here<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.780> that's<00:03:24.290> broken<00:03:24.769> off

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
mount on here and that that's broken off

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.759 
mount on here and that that's broken off
so<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.519> check<00:03:25.790> in<00:03:26.420> two<00:03:26.600> battens<00:03:26.989> see

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
so I have to check in two battens see

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.800 
so I have to check in two battens see
what<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:27.980> could<00:03:28.069> do<00:03:28.220> about<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.700> it's<00:03:29.510> not<00:03:29.780> a

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
what I could do about that it's not a

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.050 
what I could do about that it's not a
stormy<00:03:30.139> arch<00:03:30.290> or<00:03:30.500> three<00:03:30.680> speed<00:03:30.950> up<00:03:31.130> on<00:03:31.430> here

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
stormy arch or three speed up on here

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.750 
stormy arch or three speed up on here
it's<00:03:32.209> an<00:03:32.299> AW<00:03:32.750> model<00:03:33.139> and<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.620> date<00:03:33.769> code<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.040> 54

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
it's an AW model and the date code is 54

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.569 
it's an AW model and the date code is 54
now<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.019> video<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.410> overhauling<00:03:37.040> an<00:03:37.130> AW

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
now I have a video of overhauling an AW
