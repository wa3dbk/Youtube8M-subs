 tank divisions on this border and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.800
 only those allied divisions are holding back 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.189

 disembark there before the birthday of a friend 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.270

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.710
 and feared 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.940
 this plant was our main facility 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.310

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.229

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.680
 Caspian gorodenka 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.950
 I do not know where Einstein yet, but we 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.470
 get on his trail 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.009
 we have to find it it should we 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.950
 help make resistance forces 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.229
 he must die a traitor's death you 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.149
 have to smell everything about him and 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.149
 find where he took refuge 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.400
 one in so let's immediately save in 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:24.530

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.319
 by the way in the cartoons 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.019
 Well, the video sequences we could notice such 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.239
 wilderness peasant came many who 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.310
 just played the laptop room 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.129
 but now the leopard so on probably 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.689
 immediately recognized him as a famous hero 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.599
 this kind of series 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:47.430
 He appeared in the very first part of it 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:49.139
 chapter not new there is a villain and he then 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.450
 appeared several times in time 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.909

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.400
 my day they don't say it's kane but 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.150
 and throughout the series from the early 90s 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.120
 until the end of 2010 when the last part 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.389
 entered and he always was and always was 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:11.579
 the main character of the game as if so 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:15.090

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.650
 Good such a lanko let's so this 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.109
 mission is very dull because of 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.569
 a traitor to run into time 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.389

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.630
