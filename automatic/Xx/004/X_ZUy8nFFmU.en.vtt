I'm getting this magic damage and I'm
speculating<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.780> people<00:01:31.049> might<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
speculating so some people might have a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.410 
speculating so some people might have a
little<00:01:31.409> bit<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> resistance<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.490> maybe<00:01:32.820> not

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
little bit of resistance to it maybe not

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.469 
little bit of resistance to it maybe not
quite<00:01:33.689> sure<00:01:34.130> might<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.250> both<00:01:35.460> might<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.820> enough

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
quite sure might be both might be enough
