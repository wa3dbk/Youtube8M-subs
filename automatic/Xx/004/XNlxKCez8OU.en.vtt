00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
definitely one of the more difficult

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.880

very<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.160> different<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
very very different because it is the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600 
very very different because it is the
only<00:00:48.149> burst<00:00:48.510> weapon<00:00:48.960> SMG<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> game<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.520> was

only burst weapon SMG in the game it was

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.160 
only burst weapon SMG in the game it was
far<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:50.850> difficult<00:00:51.149> than<00:00:51.420> i<00:00:51.570> expected<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
far more difficult than i expected to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.470 
far more difficult than i expected to
get<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> headshots<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.120> overall<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> gun<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
get the headshots and overall the gun is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.729 
get the headshots and overall the gun is
great<00:00:54.660> though<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.050> gun<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.230> definitely<00:00:55.649> one

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
great though the gun is definitely one

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.930 
great though the gun is definitely one
of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> best<00:00:56.070> guns<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.550> game<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
of the best guns in the game in the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
of the best guns in the game in the
right<00:00:57.120> hands<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.050> definitely<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
right hands it is definitely more of a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.319 
right hands it is definitely more of a
veteran<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.460> noob<00:00:59.789> friendly<00:01:00.059> as

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
veteran what but not noob friendly as

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.060 
veteran what but not noob friendly as
many<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> other<00:01:01.140> fully<00:01:01.379> automatics<00:01:01.920> are

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
many of the other fully automatics are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
many of the other fully automatics are
so<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.879> gun<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:03.390> definitely<00:01:04.110> definitely<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so this gun was definitely definitely a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
so this gun was definitely definitely a
challenger<00:01:05.339> most<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.360> other<00:01:06.510> games<00:01:06.689> i

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
challenger most of the other games i

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.820

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
think it took me about two and a half

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
think it took me about two and a half

shots already that gun is super easy

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.710 
shots already that gun is super easy
anyways<00:04:34.699> because<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.060> recoil<00:04:35.449> time<00:04:35.630> was

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
anyways because the recoil time was

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.170 
anyways because the recoil time was
always<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> automatic<00:04:36.740> hit<00:04:36.979> shot<00:04:37.280> but<00:04:37.880> I've<00:04:38.030> got

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
always a automatic hit shot but I've got

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.520 
always a automatic hit shot but I've got
the<00:04:38.270> executioner<00:04:38.720> which<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:38.990> probably<00:04:39.259> be<00:04:39.410> one

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
the executioner which is probably be one

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.870 
the executioner which is probably be one
of<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.680> more<00:04:39.770> difficult<00:04:39.979> guns<00:04:40.430> in<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.699> game

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
to get the head shots with so I decided

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.990 
to get the head shots with so I decided
to<00:04:42.530> put<00:04:42.680> that<00:04:42.830> on<00:04:42.979> so<00:04:43.130> in<00:04:43.250> case<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.520> run<00:04:43.550> into<00:04:43.699> any

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
to put that on so in case I run into any

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.850 
to put that on so in case I run into any
idols<00:04:44.419> or<00:04:44.900> anything<00:04:45.199> along<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.560> lines<00:04:45.590> of

that<00:04:46.009> I<00:04:46.070> do<00:04:46.250> have<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.729> gun<00:04:46.880> equipped<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.330> I

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
that I do have that gun equipped so I

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.420 
that I do have that gun equipped so I
can<00:04:47.570> get<00:04:47.690> those<00:04:47.870> kills<00:04:48.289> built<00:04:48.919> up<00:04:49.160> because

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
can get those kills built up because

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.379 
can get those kills built up because

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389
