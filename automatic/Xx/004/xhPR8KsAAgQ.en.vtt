hey<00:00:00.390> guys<00:00:00.630> I'm<00:00:01.050> Johnny<00:00:01.410> and<00:00:01.680> welcome<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.340> a

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hey guys I'm Johnny and welcome to a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.670 
hey guys I'm Johnny and welcome to a
redstone<00:00:02.760> tutorial<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.689> today<00:00:04.319> we<00:00:04.560> are

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
redstone tutorial and today we are

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.610 
redstone tutorial and today we are
making<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:05.009> 2x2<00:00:05.460> piston<00:00:06.210> door<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.990> works<00:00:07.259> with

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
making a 2x2 piston door that works with

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.830 
making a 2x2 piston door that works with
pressure<00:00:08.010> plates<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.610> opens<00:00:09.240> automatically

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
pressure plates and opens automatically

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.450 
pressure plates and opens automatically
when<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.080> walk<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> pressure<00:00:10.679> plates<00:00:10.950> so

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
when you walk on the pressure plates so

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.070 
when you walk on the pressure plates so
I<00:00:11.490> made<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.849> design<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> while<00:00:12.570> back<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:12.990> an

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
I made this design a while back on an

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.320 
I made this design a while back on an
old<00:00:13.230> channel<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.860> recently<00:00:14.670> I've<00:00:14.849> seen

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
old channel and a recently I've seen

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.720 
old channel and a recently I've seen
that<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:15.630> been<00:00:16.109> getting<00:00:16.289> very<00:00:16.619> popular<00:00:17.190> but

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
that it's been getting very popular but

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.880 
that it's been getting very popular but
the<00:00:18.090> quality<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.750> video<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.289> very<00:00:19.560> bad

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the quality for that video was very bad

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
the quality for that video was very bad
and<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> design<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.119> used<00:00:21.480> was<00:00:21.750> very

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
and the design that I used was very

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.900 
and the design that I used was very
outdated<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.310> today<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.180> making<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.890> updated

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
outdated so today I'm making a updated

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.279 
outdated so today I'm making a updated
tutorial<00:00:26.910> for<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.869> lot<00:00:28.109> more

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
tutorial for that it's a lot more

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.279 
tutorial for that it's a lot more
compact<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.369> easier<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> make<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.480> I'll

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
compact a lot easier to make and I'll

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.690 
compact a lot easier to make and I'll
just<00:00:31.500> quickly<00:00:31.740> show<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.070> how<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.309> works<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
just quickly show you how it works and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.740 
just quickly show you how it works and
then<00:00:32.790> we'll<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:32.969> into<00:00:33.090> building<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
then we'll get into building it so

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
then we'll get into building it so
basically<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.829> walk<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> door

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
basically when you walk up to the door

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.250 
basically when you walk up to the door
here<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.030> step<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.540> pressure<00:00:36.809> plates<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
here and step on the pressure plates the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.709 
here and step on the pressure plates the
door<00:00:37.440> opens<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.059> walk<00:00:39.210> through<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
door opens and as you walk through the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
door opens and as you walk through the
door<00:00:39.899> closes<00:00:40.320> behind<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.860> well<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.670> it's

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
door closes behind you as well so it's

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.520 
door closes behind you as well so it's
very<00:00:41.940> easy<00:00:42.180> how<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.050> works

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
very easy how it works

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.279 
very easy how it works
very<00:00:44.280> basic<00:00:44.730> really<00:00:45.360> good<00:00:45.629> tutorial<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
very basic really good tutorial and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.709 
very basic really good tutorial and
let's<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:47.010> into<00:00:47.219> building<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.610> okay<00:00:48.210> guys<00:00:48.239> so

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
let's get into building it okay guys so

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.119 
let's get into building it okay guys so
the<00:00:48.809> first<00:00:49.050> thing<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> want<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.039> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the first thing you want to do is you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
the first thing you want to do is you
want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.340> grab<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.670> pistons<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.690> want

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
want to grab your pistons and you want

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.799 
want to grab your pistons and you want
to<00:00:51.930> place<00:00:52.170> two<00:00:52.649> high<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:54.270> side<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> where

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
to place two high on one side of where

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.600 
to place two high on one side of where
you<00:00:54.899> want<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> door<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> go

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you want the door to be and then you go

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
you want the door to be and then you go
to<00:00:56.670> grab<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.360> block<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.379> door

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to grab the block you want for your door

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.340 
to grab the block you want for your door
and<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.670> place<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.539> front<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and you want to place it in front of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.889 
and you want to place it in front of
those<00:01:01.469> Pistons<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.449> leave<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
those Pistons like that and then leave a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.920 
those Pistons like that and then leave a
three-block<00:01:04.739> gap<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> place<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.720> more

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
three-block gap and place two more

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690 
three-block gap and place two more
persons<00:01:07.140> stacked<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.920> top<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.220> each<00:01:08.430> other

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
persons stacked on top of each other

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.690 
persons stacked on top of each other
like<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.659> put<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> door<00:01:10.920> locks<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.400> front

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
like so and put the door locks in front

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.940 
like so and put the door locks in front
of<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.030> well<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> next<00:01:13.500> step<00:01:13.740> is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
of them as well so the next step is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
of them as well so the next step is
you've<00:01:14.159> got<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> dig<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.810> two<00:01:16.020> blocks

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you've got to dig a the two blocks

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.810 
you've got to dig a the two blocks
between<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.770> doors<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.670> two

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
between the doors and then the two

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910 
between the doors and then the two
blocks<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.450> either<00:01:18.689> side<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.799> this

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
blocks on either side so you get this

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520 
blocks on either side so you get this
2x3<00:01:20.400> hole<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.049> want<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> dig<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
2x3 hole and then you want to dig it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.940 
2x3 hole and then you want to dig it
down<00:01:23.000> another<00:01:24.000> block<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.560> too<00:01:25.770> deep

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
down another block so it's like too deep

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.460 
down another block so it's like too deep
so<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.460> by<00:01:26.610> three<00:01:27.030> by<00:01:27.210> two<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.750> then

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so it's two by three by two and then

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
so it's two by three by two and then
you'll<00:01:28.680> jump<00:01:28.979> down<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.400> hole<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.700> fill

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you'll jump down in the hole and fill

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.719 
you'll jump down in the hole and fill
the<00:01:30.509> hole<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.689> redstone<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.040> you've<00:01:32.159> got<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the hole with redstone so you've got the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
the hole with redstone so you've got the
two<00:01:32.759> by<00:01:33.090> three<00:01:33.329> pattern<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.720> redstone<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.290> well

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
two by three pattern of redstone as well

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.850 
two by three pattern of redstone as well
and<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.240> middle<00:01:36.689> blocks<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.320> under

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and then the middle blocks here under

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
and then the middle blocks here under
the<00:01:38.040> doors<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.970> need<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.270> dig<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:40.229> each

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
along with this one top block here so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.460 
along with this one top block here so
you<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.270> outside<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.140> piston

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you see out just outside of the piston

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.429 
you see out just outside of the piston
there<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.909> fill<00:01:51.659> these<00:01:51.930> bottom

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
two with the redstone and then the bit

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
two with the redstone and then the bit
where<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> goes<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.790> block<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.119> want<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
where it goes up one block you want to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.959 
where it goes up one block you want to
put<00:01:57.659> redstone<00:01:58.200> torches<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.790> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
put redstone torches like that now that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
put redstone torches like that now that
will<00:02:00.149> when<00:02:00.869> do<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.140> step<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> pressure

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
will when do you step on the pressure

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.219 
will when do you step on the pressure
plates<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.159> will<00:02:02.340> invert<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.229> torches

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
plates that will invert the torches

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
plates that will invert the torches
which<00:02:04.409> will<00:02:04.619> turn<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> doors<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.549> which<00:02:05.759> will

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
which will turn the doors off which will

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.029 
which will turn the doors off which will
retract<00:02:06.240> them<00:02:06.509> back<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.469> now<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
retract them back to how they are now so

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.160 
retract them back to how they are now so
then<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.459> need<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.819> fill<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.239> hole<00:02:09.450> with

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
then you need just fill in the hole with

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.199 
then you need just fill in the hole with
blocks<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.310> choice<00:02:11.580> whatever<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.060> want

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
blocks of your choice whatever you want

blocks of your choice whatever you want
the<00:02:12.330> floor<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.959> Oh

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the floor to be Oh

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.820 
the floor to be Oh
of<00:02:13.950> your<00:02:14.340> walkway<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:16.050> then<00:02:16.260> at<00:02:16.710> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
of your walkway here and then at the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.620 
of your walkway here and then at the
back<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.580> Pistons<00:02:17.970> all<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.330> need<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.540> do

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
back of the Pistons all you need to do

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.020 
back of the Pistons all you need to do
is<00:02:18.750> place<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> block<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.800> top<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.670> redstone

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
is place a block on top of the redstone

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.820 
is place a block on top of the redstone
torch<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:21.900> power<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.290> bottom

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
torch so that will power the bottom

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.490 
torch so that will power the bottom
bottom<00:02:23.480> piston<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.630> then<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.260> place<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
bottom piston and then if you place a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.860 
bottom piston and then if you place a
redstone<00:02:25.770> on<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.700> top<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.390> them<00:02:27.570> blocks

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
redstone on the top of them blocks

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.890 
redstone on the top of them blocks
you'll<00:02:28.560> power<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.340> top<00:02:29.910> piston<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
you'll power the top piston like that

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.190 
you'll power the top piston like that
and<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.860> give<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.400> your<00:02:32.610> door<00:02:32.820> next<00:02:33.660> step<00:02:33.990> is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
and that give you your door next step is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.680 
and that give you your door next step is
all<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.770> place<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.430> push<00:02:36.210> pressure

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
all just to place the push pressure

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.230 
all just to place the push pressure
