00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:40.090
Like the amber colored droplets that fall in such beautiful shapes

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:58.030
Within a bittersweet kind of memory, made in an instant of a perfect vacuum

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:10.410
In the absence of other gravity, if it is only yours I can feel, that’s all I’d ever need.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.070
The paradox of a satellite brings us both together

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.550
Not even the deterioration of air pressure matters;

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.830
As long as you stop it just instants before we’re destroyed

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.630
I’ll swallow any doubt you may have.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:50.620
It’s like we’re chasing after sinking organic matter

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:03.320
In this gravity free abyss, if only you would smile as you left the ground, that’s all I’d ever want.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.930
The disruption of paradigm tears us apart

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.300
Emotions we hold universal don’t matter at all;

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.700
If in that feeling of separation you tell me

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.850
I’ll embrace you, and all of your thoughts.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.720
The paradox of a satellite brings us both together

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.020
Not even the deterioration of air pressure matters;

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.300
As long as you stop it just instants before we’re destroyed

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.240
I’ll swallow any doubt you may have.
