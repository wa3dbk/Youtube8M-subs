the by it by the tip this is the
ultra-fast<00:01:59.779> fly<00:02:01.240> but<00:02:02.240> ultra<00:02:03.170> effective<00:02:04.039> at

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
ultra-fast fly but ultra effective at

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.760 
ultra-fast fly but ultra effective at
the<00:02:04.310> same<00:02:04.579> time<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.389> now<00:02:06.170> I'm<00:02:06.319> just<00:02:06.380> going<00:02:06.679> to

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the same time and now I'm just going to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.130 
the same time and now I'm just going to
build<00:02:06.920> up<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.310> body<00:02:07.509> utilizing<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.660> thread

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
build up the body utilizing the thread

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.430 
build up the body utilizing the thread
I'm<00:02:09.679> gonna<00:02:10.190> taper<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.880> from<00:02:11.569> back<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:11.990> the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
I'm gonna taper it from back to the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.930 
I'm gonna taper it from back to the
front<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:12.920> make<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.250> front<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.700> little

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
front and make the front a little

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.390 
front and make the front a little
thicker<00:02:14.240> so<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.530> going<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.800> take<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:16.069> a

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
thicker so this is going to take just a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:36.600 
thicker so this is going to take just a
few<00:02:16.430> moments<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.620> we'll<00:02:18.890> be<00:02:19.069> back

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.880 

okay<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.850> thickened<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.360> body<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.170> now<00:02:39.740> I'm

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
okay so I thickened the body and now I'm

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.190 
okay so I thickened the body and now I'm
just<00:02:39.950> going<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.370> wrap<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.300> buy<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.540> on<00:02:41.870> and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
just going to wrap the buy it on and

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.520 
just going to wrap the buy it on and
which<00:02:42.350> will<00:02:42.530> notice<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.130> buy<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:45.050> one

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
which will notice on the buy it is one

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.880 
which will notice on the buy it is one
edge<00:02:47.650> has<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:50.000> natural<00:02:50.210> ribbing<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.290> and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
edge has the natural ribbing to it and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.830 
edge has the natural ribbing to it and
you<00:02:52.250> don't<00:02:52.520> want<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> cover<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.360> up<00:02:53.420> when
