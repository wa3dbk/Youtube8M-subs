so no troops left so it may as well in

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:52.470

autozone<00:03:07.000> well<00:03:07.750> move<00:03:08.650> all<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.950> walls<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.430> one

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
autozone well move all the walls to one

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.550 
autozone well move all the walls to one
side<00:03:10.030> first<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.630> all<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.019> can<00:03:11.170> move<00:03:11.380> them

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
side first of all so you can move them

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920 
side first of all so you can move them
in<00:03:11.860> groups<00:03:12.330> after<00:03:13.330> moving<00:03:13.450> out<00:03:13.630> all<00:03:13.780> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
in groups after moving out all the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.620 
in groups after moving out all the
little<00:03:13.989> houses<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.950> things<00:03:15.100> hmm<00:03:15.940> the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
little houses and things hmm the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.340 
little houses and things hmm the
buildings<00:03:18.300> mm-hmm<00:03:20.430> ok<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.510> main<00:03:22.510> purpose<00:03:23.080> at

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
buildings mm-hmm ok so main purpose at

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.500 
buildings mm-hmm ok so main purpose at
moments<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:24.040> break<00:03:24.310> for<00:03:24.580> groups<00:03:24.790> apart<00:03:25.209> and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
moments you break for groups apart and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.380 
moments you break for groups apart and
so<00:03:25.930> they<00:03:26.050> can<00:03:26.230> run<00:03:26.410> individually<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.390> be

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
so they can run individually and be

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.440 
so they can run individually and be
taken<00:03:28.900> out<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.080> smaller<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.739> smaller<00:03:30.010> waves

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
taken out and smaller and smaller waves

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.870 
taken out and smaller and smaller waves
which<00:03:31.450> could<00:03:32.140> be<00:03:32.290> good<00:03:32.320> oh<00:03:32.880> that's

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
which could be good oh that's

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.880 
which could be good oh that's
fascinating<00:03:34.120> main<00:03:34.930> focus<00:03:35.350> here<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.530> get<00:03:35.709> my

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
fascinating main focus here I get my

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.100 
fascinating main focus here I get my
tires<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.489> my<00:03:36.610> euros<00:03:37.030> into<00:03:37.300> one<00:03:37.480> corner<00:03:37.720> and

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
tires and my euros into one corner and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.190 
tires and my euros into one corner and
then<00:03:38.290> all<00:03:38.980> some<00:03:39.280> walls<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.910> break<00:03:40.870> up<00:03:41.050> for

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
then all some walls to break up for

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.030 
then all some walls to break up for
groups<00:03:41.410> ok<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:43.269> let's<00:03:43.510> go<00:03:43.750> we<00:03:44.230> move<00:03:44.440> some<00:03:44.650> walls

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
groups ok so let's go we move some walls

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.210 
groups ok so let's go we move some walls
there<00:03:47.519> yeah<00:03:48.519> why<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.739> besides<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:51.070> that

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
there yeah why is that besides so that

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.610 
there yeah why is that besides so that
when<00:03:51.400> they<00:03:51.489> spawn<00:03:51.850> in<00:03:52.060> me<00:03:52.209> whatever<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.350> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
when they spawn in me whatever is the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.780 
when they spawn in me whatever is the
shortest<00:03:55.530> ears<00:03:56.530> at<00:03:56.620> our<00:03:56.799> more<00:03:57.070> time<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.519> attack

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
shortest ears at our more time to attack

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.620 
shortest ears at our more time to attack
yeah<00:03:58.980> go<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.280> move<00:04:00.489> in<00:04:00.670> dragons<00:04:01.209> come<00:04:01.420> from

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
yeah go and move in dragons come from

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.000 
yeah go and move in dragons come from
the<00:04:01.720> side<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:04.030> heroes<00:04:04.480> do<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.900> take<00:04:05.799> nice

there cleaning up my base so it makes
wave<00:04:43.940> can<00:04:44.210> just<00:04:44.420> run<00:04:44.630> straight<00:04:44.810> for<00:04:45.020> my<00:04:45.410> towers

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
wave can just run straight for my towers

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.820 
wave can just run straight for my towers
in<00:04:45.890> my<00:04:46.010> ears<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:50.330> minds<00:04:50.600> seem<00:04:51.230> to<00:04:51.470> have<00:04:51.620> quite

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
a lot of HP so our minds are good to

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.050 
a lot of HP so our minds are good to
have<00:04:53.930> in<00:04:53.960> one<00:04:54.260> corner<00:04:56.200> we<00:04:57.550> lose<00:04:58.550> our<00:04:58.730> first

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060

and dies where c free completed and ce4

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.850 
and dies where c free completed and ce4
begins<00:05:14.450> from<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:14.750> bottom<00:05:15.169> thank<00:05:15.590> you<00:05:15.740> don't

even<00:05:15.950> have<00:05:16.130> truth<00:05:16.780> exactly<00:05:18.580> no<00:05:19.580> no<00:05:19.820> that's

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
even have truth exactly no no that's

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.030 
even have truth exactly no no that's
that<00:05:20.240> that's<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.840> best<00:05:21.050> way<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.290> think<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.770> do

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
that that's the best way I think to do

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.820 
that that's the best way I think to do
the<00:05:22.280> waves<00:05:23.210> is<00:05:23.419> basically<00:05:23.960> slowly<00:05:24.229> line<00:05:24.590> yet

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
the waves is basically slowly line yet

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.740 
the waves is basically slowly line yet
it's<00:05:25.010> not<00:05:25.190> really<00:05:25.520> only<00:05:25.640> tubes<00:05:28.210> what<00:05:29.210> survival

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
it's not really only tubes what survival

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.310 
it's not really only tubes what survival
you<00:05:29.960> get<00:05:30.080> you<00:05:30.200> can<00:05:30.350> get<00:05:30.500> like<00:05:30.680> six<00:05:30.890> dollars

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
you get you can get like six dollars

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.559
