00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.750 
I don't know I feel like the rigor is
somewhat<00:00:37.620> better<00:00:37.800> even<00:00:38.460> though<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.670> not

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
somewhat better even though it's not

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.340 
somewhat better even though it's not
