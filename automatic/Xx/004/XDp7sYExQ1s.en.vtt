for<00:03:43.620> calculus<00:03:44.220> it's<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.090> tooth<00:03:45.300> structure

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
for calculus it's that tooth structure

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.200 
for calculus it's that tooth structure
that's<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.080> bacterial<00:03:46.620> colony<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.910> almost

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
that's the bacterial colony is almost

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.090 
that's the bacterial colony is almost
like<00:03:48.360> coral<00:03:49.400> plays<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.880> layer<00:03:51.150> after<00:03:51.450> another

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
like coral plays one layer after another

the<00:03:53.100> lower<00:03:53.310> front<00:03:53.550> teeth<00:03:53.670> are<00:03:54.000> most<00:03:54.270> prone

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
the lower front teeth are most prone

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.360 
the lower front teeth are most prone
because<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.550> do<00:03:56.700> saliva<00:03:57.030> throughout<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.690> day

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
because to do saliva throughout the day

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.680 
because to do saliva throughout the day
your<00:03:59.370> chin<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.790> little<00:04:00.030> bit<00:04:00.180> lower<00:04:00.360> than

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
your chin is a little bit lower than

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.270 
your chin is a little bit lower than
your<00:04:00.870> ears<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.810> saliva<00:04:03.810> pool<00:04:04.320> behind<00:04:04.800> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
your ears so that saliva pool behind the

your ears so that saliva pool behind the
lower<00:04:05.430> front<00:04:05.760> teeth<00:04:06.050> and<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:07.230> those<00:04:07.410> bacteria

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
lower front teeth and so those bacteria

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.450 
lower front teeth and so those bacteria
have<00:04:09.830> access<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.190> house
