00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.120
 hi friends, well, today I'm going to 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.460
 teach how to make a pick with a 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.490
 electric toothbrush a pick 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.280
 clear electric for it is not necessary 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.440
 break the brush or adapt it the only 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.670
 what we are going to do is every three or four 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.019
 months you know that you have to change the 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.789
 head as recommended by all 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.279
 dentists because instead of throwing it to the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.250
 trash what we are going to do is with some 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.150
 scissors 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.300
 we are going to cut the middle bristles 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.800
 so as here we see the drawing that 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.160
 we have to stay cells on the side 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.700
 on the sides on both sides of it 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.460
 length that this 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.710
 we would reduce them to the minimum 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.150
 it does not matter if there are a few millimeters of 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.290
 hair or half a millimeter but good the 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.120
 case is that it has to be the minimum 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.330
 then we are going to add a strip like 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 we will file it with the emery 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.860
 way that we are going to be left with a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.650
 diamond tip because of the style to this 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.070
 let's grab the pick 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.830
 and we're going to stick it here with glue 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.490
 crazy of that Latin American in Spain 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.130
 for example with 3D glue it 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.410
 we are going to stick there and when we paste it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.870
 we have to be for a minute 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.940
 turning the head in case the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.980
 glue slides to the head so it does not 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.330
 hold on because as you grip and no longer 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.250
 turn then then it is not worth anything 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.630
 nothing more than to burn the engine of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 brush 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.789
 then once it is stuck what 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.409
 we're going to do is fold the bristles 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.570
 both sides inward and throw more 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.570
 tail 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 grab the pick once this is done 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:45.920
 what we are going to do is put putty to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.920
 for metal this also achieves 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.680
 and the final good result is this 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.030
 so now let's try our 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.470
 pick to see how it goes 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.730
 Well first we grabbed the brush 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.570
 we remove the head with which not 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.570
 we sell our teeth 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.689
 and we put the head of the pick 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.700
 at the end of the channel 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.069
 from 4 pins 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.069
 It is not very complicated 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.290
 we put it 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.610
 let's see growing is trapped 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.610
 and we keep our pick 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.870
 we light it 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.920
 and it is already 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.890
 city 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.230
 let's try it with something a little bit more 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.420
 complicated so that it does not say what 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.280
 just open easy things generate things 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.280
 difficult, let's see 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.260
 this is a lock profiles of 5 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.800
 pins 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.590
 with a forge of 109 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.090
 but good is quite common but 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.580
 it's more complicated we see that deciding 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.420
 is trapped 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.420
 we put the flipped 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.900
 we put the garbage of the earth and that 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.900
 typical 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.680
 back to back 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.680
 or be served 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.900
 Well, I hope you have 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.939
 liked this video that has helped you 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.860
 and if you liked to like it or 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.240
 subscribe and we will make videos of this 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.430
 style 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.290
 and you see as a toothbrush 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.900
 we can practically open almost 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.390
 all the locks to be beta good 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.360
 Well , greet everyone and make good use of 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.560
 of knowledge do not go to finish 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.560
 bad a hug
