00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.590
 well well I think that little by little we're leaving 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.560
 knowing without a doubt 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.920
 there were quite a few new players that 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.270
 We are still getting to know each other, they understand 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.130
 our style of work and above all 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.140
 they are mating to the group that is the most 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.360
 important 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.920
 in the part of the work I think little to 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.480
 little we are assimilating what the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.520
 coach asks us 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.520
 and until now we have not had much 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.210
 I work with balls but I know that in 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.890
 these days we are going to focus on that and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.110
 prepare for the first game 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.960
 friendly we are all focused on 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.330
 stop work and especially to perform at 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.769
 maximum to be well in this tournament not 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.120
 well I think in the best way 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.680
 knowing that it is ours for the first 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.769
 friendly match 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.050
 obviously we are a bit hard on the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.970
 pre-season work but good we 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.699
 it serves to go loosening to go having 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.210
 football minutes and especially for 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:12.280
 know both the ones that arrive and the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.350
 that we were already I think your support 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.650
 gives us a lot of confidence gives us many 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.270
 encouragement to face this new tournament 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.670
 which is undoubtedly very important for 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.250
 we for the percentage issue I think 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.820
 that is necessary right now a bit of 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.479
 activity to start taking that pace 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.390
 football that is required not for 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.990
 to be able to face this then what is 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.810
 the tournament is going to come well the group is going 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.500
 to loosen is going to understand a little 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.320
 more but most of us have not played 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.159
 together there are very few who were the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.770
 last tournament but that with a better reason 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.979
 will allow us to treat or 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.979
 It will require us to know ourselves faster 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.679
 the main thing I think that as in all 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.099
 sides get a good result is not that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.730
 important we know that it is not a rival to 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.810
 first division for which we are 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.560
 forced to do a great job already 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.840
 get a good result and then you have to 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.330
 wait do not wait to continue 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.230
 amalgamating things there within the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.480
 group and him and as to what we have 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.030
 seen football with Pablo 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.860
 I think it's going to be an offensive team 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.340
 I do not see it as one of those 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.330
 coaches who likes to wait 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.580
 maybe most of the games are going to 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.310
 try to propose let's try to 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.970
 make a good game and that they serve us 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.220
 as a result of this Friday it will begin to grow 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.620
 and to create that team that he wants 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.750
 I personally felt very well I 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.870
 I do feel that I'm doing 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.140
 excellently and there has not been any 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.599
 annoyance regarding my physical part in 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.099
 As for my body and that helps me 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.780
 does not help me much with the requirement of 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.390
 day by day as the water strip does not 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.690
 I recommend that they take it because they are going to 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.660
 be able to enjoy every 15 days or in addition 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.280
 of each game and that's what 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.930
 take advantage of us not with your support 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.930
 we are going to go out to the court more 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.390
 motivated with a lot of desire to leave 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.129
 forward we are the whole group and together 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.000
 with you remember that we are 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.000
 many more than eleven
