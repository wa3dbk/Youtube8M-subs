00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.410 
thing after the last part
they<00:06:08.920> said<00:06:09.220> it's<00:06:09.460> a<00:06:09.550> little<00:06:09.700> bit<00:06:09.850> extended

with<00:06:10.900> a<00:06:10.930> little<00:06:11.590> more<00:06:11.710> edit<00:06:12.130> so<00:06:12.280> it's<00:06:12.400> going<00:06:12.490> to

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
with a little more edit so it's going to

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:26.690 
with a little more edit so it's going to
sound<00:06:12.670> like<00:06:12.850> this

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.670 

how<00:06:27.700> you<00:06:27.760> do<00:06:27.940> that<00:06:28.090> is<00:06:28.300> basically<00:06:28.690> exactly<00:06:29.020> how

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
how you do that is basically exactly how

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.500 
how you do that is basically exactly how
I<00:06:29.710> showed<00:06:30.220> you<00:06:30.460> except<00:06:31.180> you're<00:06:31.270> going<00:06:31.300> to

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
I showed you except you're going to

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:52.730 
I showed you except you're going to
strum<00:06:31.780> it<00:06:31.930> once<00:06:32.320> before<00:06:33.280> you<00:06:33.400> transition<00:06:34.150> so

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.410 

it's<00:06:53.740> a<00:06:53.830> really<00:06:54.100> easy<00:06:54.130> song<00:06:54.580> to<00:06:54.640> learn<00:06:54.970> but<00:06:55.330> it

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
it's a really easy song to learn but it

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.370 
it's a really easy song to learn but it
could<00:06:55.570> take<00:06:55.720> a<00:06:55.750> little<00:06:55.990> bit<00:06:56.080> of<00:06:56.170> practice

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
could take a little bit of practice

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.260 
could take a little bit of practice
