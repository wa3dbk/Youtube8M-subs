world I had a weird kind of path that I

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.600 
world I had a weird kind of path that I
took<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.630> was<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.050> natural<00:02:24.560> at<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.709> game<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.580> I

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
took I was a natural at the game so I

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.750 
took I was a natural at the game so I
picked<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:25.970> up<00:02:26.030> real<00:02:26.239> fast<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.680> think<00:02:28.519> I

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
picked it up real fast and I think I

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.160 
picked it up real fast and I think I
maybe<00:02:28.940> played<00:02:29.209> six<00:02:29.480> months<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:29.810> an<00:02:29.900> amateur

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
maybe played six months as an amateur

and<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.410> turned<00:02:30.620> pro<00:02:30.769> right<00:02:31.040> away<00:02:31.220> because<00:02:31.459> I

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
and I turned pro right away because I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.729 
and I turned pro right away because I
always<00:02:31.730> realized<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.230> only<00:02:33.350> way<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.560> get

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
they're not all made the same so you

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.670
