very closely I don't know if you'll be
able<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.869> look<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.950> close<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
able to see it but look really close and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.890 
able to see it but look really close and
you<00:01:09.600> still<00:01:09.990> might<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.439> some<00:01:10.710> orange<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.900> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you still might see some orange of the

you still might see some orange of the
wand<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770 

so<00:01:19.469> that<00:01:19.829> shows<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.609> it's<00:01:20.789> not<00:01:21.000> clumpy<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.630> all

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
so that shows see it's not clumpy at all

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
so that shows see it's not clumpy at all
you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:23.189> how<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.399> can<00:01:23.579> see<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:23.969> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
you the one like this you could tell

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.440 
you the one like this you could tell
there<00:01:32.520> are<00:01:32.549> some<00:01:34.100> longer<00:01:35.100> bristles<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.819> some

shorter bristles see that so what those

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.940 
shorter bristles see that so what those
do<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.679> they<00:01:44.429> go<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.969> and<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.390> catch<00:01:46.259> every

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
do is they go in and they catch every

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
gives a very similar look to this one

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.199 
gives a very similar look to this one
this<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.660> lancome<00:02:09.660> hypnose<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.030> see

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
all the lashes are fanned out so it's

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.130 
all the lashes are fanned out so it's
extremely<00:02:14.640> similar<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:16.160> Lancome<00:02:17.160> Hypnose<00:02:17.730> and

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
this one too don't get me wrong but

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.930

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
think these are two of their best

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.740 
think these are two of their best
mascara<00:05:27.910> so<00:05:29.140> anyway<00:05:30.140> so<00:05:31.360> trying<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.390> think<00:05:32.630> if

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
mascara so anyway so trying to think if

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.990

there's<00:05:32.780> anything<00:05:33.380> else<00:05:33.950> really<00:05:34.310> that<00:05:34.669> I<00:05:34.700> need

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
there's anything else really that I need

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.469 
there's anything else really that I need
to<00:05:35.030> cover<00:05:35.360> about<00:05:35.750> this<00:05:36.020> mascara<00:05:36.729> I<00:05:37.729> love<00:05:38.300> the

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
to cover about this mascara I love the

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.630 
to cover about this mascara I love the
one<00:05:38.660> I<00:05:39.110> thought<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:39.440> one<00:05:39.650> would<00:05:39.950> be<00:05:40.160> real

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
one I thought the one would be real

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.360 
one I thought the one would be real
strange<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.390> use

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
strange to use

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.810 
strange to use
I<00:05:42.430> do<00:05:43.000> like<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.630> wand<00:05:44.310> better<00:05:45.310> than<00:05:45.639> the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
I do like the wand better than the

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.409 
I do like the wand better than the
falsies<00:05:46.300> one<00:05:46.630> here's<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.260> falsies<00:05:47.740> one<00:05:48.419> it's

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
falsies one here's the falsies one it's

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.150 
falsies one here's the falsies one it's
got<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.660> little<00:05:49.840> curve<00:05:50.260> in<00:05:50.500> it<00:05:50.880> so<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:53.050> me<00:05:53.260> this

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
got a little curve in it so to me this

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.820 
got a little curve in it so to me this
one<00:05:54.550> is<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.150> little<00:05:55.570> harder<00:05:55.870> to<00:05:56.050> work<00:05:56.199> with<00:05:56.260> I

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
one is a little harder to work with I

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.219 
one is a little harder to work with I
think<00:05:57.550> this<00:05:57.699> one's<00:05:58.030> a<00:05:58.240> lot<00:05:58.389> easier<00:05:58.720> to<00:05:59.110> work

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
think this one's a lot easier to work

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:06.600 
think this one's a lot easier to work
with<00:05:59.290> so<00:06:00.210> I<00:06:01.210> do<00:06:02.139> like<00:06:02.560> that<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:03.810> I<00:06:05.310> don't<00:06:06.310> know
