00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.109
 hello welcome back to my channel 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.170
 as you will have seen in my video of 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.150
 favorites of the month of July I present to you 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.610
 a new tool for makeup 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.490
 what is the makeup on the airbrush in 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.289
 spray so today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.470
 how to do it is makeup with 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.050
 airbrush a tool that for me is 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.060
 essential to make makeup 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.470
 especially if you're going to work doing 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.210
 makeup to other people to 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.699
 bridal makeup or makeup 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.540
 photo sessions this machine is 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.340
 impressive is very clean and prevents 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.310
 you have to be cleaning brushes all 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.510
 while you have no direct contact with 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.700
 the skin of the person you 're going to 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.120
 make up makeup is very 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.220
 uniform all over the face and has a 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.530
 very natural aspect an aspect that does not 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.079
 you're going to get with brushes or with 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.789
 fingers with sponges 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.640
 for this tutorial I will use the 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:01.149
 ultimate skin secrets starter kit 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.769
 see your studio you can see the video of 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.989
 my favorites here where it was taught 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.000
 all the things that come with the kit 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.680
 besides some discount codes that 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.130
 I will also leave here down 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.830
 if you want to buy them the airbrush is worth 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.900
 so nothing, let's start 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.880
 Well now, let's start 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.780
 use a primer and we're going to take 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.780
 all over the face 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.530
 or I have little left 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.240
 this is the benefit professional 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 and now we are going to start the part 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.500
 of the spray as you see I have here the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.490
 apparatus the airbrush spray as I do not know 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.490
 exactly what is it called 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.200
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.969
 take the airbrush 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.560
 and we are going to take the makeup base 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.460
 remember what 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.460
 you have to shake 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.480
 and I'm going to see I'm going to mix two 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.740
 makeup foundations this is sahara sand 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.570
 de vÃ©lez your study of the sahara salt and 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.570
 sweet honey and we're going to mix here 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.470
 they say you have to take about six drops 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
 so I'm going to take three and three but 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.720
 when I go to the end I always have to 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.340
 throw more because I still do not control it 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.340
 a lot and I'm running out soon 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.990
 Well, we are going to start 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.020
 apply the makeup base with 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.210
 our airbrush and for this we have 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.340
 to leave it at a distance of about 10 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.520
 centimeters with our face more or less 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.440
 from this distance that you see here 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.600
 and always in circular movements 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.540
 following the direction of the needles of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.150
 clock 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.310
 Well we have the makeup 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.000
 little things in here and we're going to light 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.829
 the airbrush once the airbrush is 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.450
 once it is in operation we have 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.150
 that squeeze this trigger that has to 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.269
 you have here that you see it and we have it 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.220
 put in the middle position of what of 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.689
 what you see for the average position that 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.770
 it's for make - up bases so 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.820
 let's start 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.820
 that's how it sounds 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.450
 Y 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.300
 closer 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.620
 I've thrown something good so 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.960
 when it's over it's going to be a little noise 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.960
 I think you achieved now 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.710
 like this 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.389
 this means throw me a few drops 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.389
 favor 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.470
 so nothing, let's take a little 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.470
 over makeup base 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.440
 and we go there 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.520
 in the neck important 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.570
 and it 's out now what to do is let that 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.370
 dry it dries super fast so 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.320
 well now from facebook I do not know if the 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.490
 color is good or not good how 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.080
 will be but within five minutes or 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.550
 chairs will appear the color that you 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.390
 is going to stay in the face this 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.390
 specifically 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.620
 Well, you've already learned 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.600
 a little how makeup is used in 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.550
 airbrush as I learn to 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.620
 do more things like the rouge the 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.720
 outline and so on I'll be doing 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.360
 more videos for now I'm a little 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.009
 new to this so nothing just wanted 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.229
 make an introduction so that you see is 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:05.430
 Well, how did makeup work 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.430
 sun and the result 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.140
 for this I will use 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.060
 wearing the finger needle 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.500
 well then to apply makeup on 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.060
 we have to always do the sun 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.330
 about 10 centimeters from the face plus or 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.330
 less 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.250
 I have left everything because
