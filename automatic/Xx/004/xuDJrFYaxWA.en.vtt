00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.780
 A sudden panic 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.470
 No matter how big I see it again, my eyes are blurred. 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:20.290
 Discard all over the world has turned cloudy 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:26.640
 Oh, I can not see it, so let's go down the road. 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.640
 We got a little bit like this. We keep coming in a little bit . 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.169
 Then the upright, even swaying in front of his chest covered with nothing 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.930
 Abandoned 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:42.940
 You tried to do it again just for the dream of rest. 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.940
 Oh, I could not see the bacon at the meat loaf right away . 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:54.770
 The black curtain is dripping gradually into the darkness 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.770
 That blindness attracts hierarchy unknowingly lead 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:05.050
 If you miss a treatment group of 10 people that you can ever lose sight of vaginal cancer 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.800
 The cause was retinal tenderness. 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.760
 Yoon Young-yi, the first female doctor in the domestic retina field 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.950
 After the money today, I stand at the operating table for the destiny. 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:21.470
 Beta National Skull 3 Ring 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.780
 Deomeo Scarborough's r Xing 22 10: 6 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.270
 I can put it 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.270
 Our Drake hedge is there . 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:40.509
 Enter the number 3r ss 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.509
 The darkened retina is looking back at Yoon Young-yi's breath 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.819
 As a professional football player in John , he has had a limited number of health 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.110
 Recently, thanks to the blind find the Professor out of the crisis, increasing summit yunyoungyi 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.110
 I am recovering my sight. 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.530
 I did a lot of things . 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.150
 And now I'm looking now holding some football 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.470
 Light Cream sister and the resident might have seen House 3 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.850
 I know it's moving fast. 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.330
 But now Davos this moment might try to capture two so close 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.330
 I have. 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.730
 U 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.849
 All we can see things correctly assumed role of complex organizations in the snow 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.849
 It's possible because 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.070
 Corneal blinds gather light 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.010
 Sungai which adjusts the amount of light body 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.550
 And a lens that refracts light 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.550
 It is made up of retinas that form like a camera film . 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:16.670
 When the double retina ultimately delivers the nerve stimulation that the cell harvests to the brain 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.670
 As rain we see that we have seen apples 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:29.660
 The retina, the innermost nerve tissue in the eye said that the nerve cells and the City 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.660
 In the mid-central part, the cells are most dense. 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:41.270
 Here, Sung Imjin is able to pay the most precise object, 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.270
 The vision through is called central vision. 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.390
 Damage to the retina , including sulfur, can lead to loss of vision 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.390
 5 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:04:01.409
 Cataracts or corneal opacity. In such diseases , your eyesight drops. 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:05.010
 While surgery or some treatment can restore your ability, the retina is nervous 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:09.750
 If the damage because the article itself chiryeo 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:14.879
 Because it can not be reversed to normal, it is preservation or prevention in advance 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:19.039
 It is important that our brain function can not be saved once it falls or is similar 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.039
 Now, let's think about the concept. 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.500
 Glaucoma is the most important cause of blindness as the rapidly increasing retinal disease 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.820
 The beginning is diabetes. 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:43.560
 Diabetes mellitus, a chronic systemic disease, is particularly common in the eye. 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:48.600
 Mr. Lee, Yong - Kyu came out 10 years ago diabetes was recently blossomed a problem in the left eye 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.960
 I have been treated, but this time I feel an abnormality in my right eye. 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.960
 found 

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:59.770
 I went out with something. 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.260
 Pony is so yes 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.780
 What blood heulreoyo 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:11.180
 That 's why I came in the field needed for the eyes and gave up the red beans and did not loose 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.999
 I 'm looking at the doors. 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.310
 You'll see a splash. 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.310
 Chemistry seemed to come down to the needy. 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:27.999
 I'll break up the state yiyounggyu when the retina is look at a glance the main column 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:33.639
 Especially, the area where the blood vessels were blown was close to the shin nerve, thus affecting Huang Jiu 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:34.810
 If you're a bleak pharmaceutical falling down was the state do not know may not be able to avoid the blindness 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:40.270
 I will. 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:43.870
 Lee Young-gyu's diagnosis is diabetic retinopathy 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.279
 It looks like it's going to be both good. 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:51.509
 When you came to the words that seemed to emit 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:55.169
 Be careful with the food and the dancing and salsa. 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:06:01.310
 At that time, I actually did not go to much of the lecture . 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:07.080
 A left eye mangbal now three now hang surgery tteuteun alcohol 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:09.470
 Yeah, the dancers are back, and they're tall. 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.640
 He must be his friend . 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:17.930
 He can not walk unless he takes his wife's hand . 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:21.260
 The left eye is a dark state that does not even feel light already 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:24.860
 If you do not rush surgery, 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:31.169
 Standing in a crisis to lose sight. 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:34.650
 I had two surgeries, but now I can not see the light, so I worry more about the patient . 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:37.970
 When you come to your head, think again. 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.970
 You've seen 5 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.000
 Diabetic retinopathy is a dangerous form of diabetes . 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:53.610
 The blood vessels in the retina are dense. 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:59.220
 In the early days, diabetes causes blockage of the circulation of blood vessels and bleeding. 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:02.070
 The problem is that as the disease progresses, new blood vessels grow abnormally 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:07.800
 Because blood vessels are weak and swollen 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:10.580
 The relationship between the hemorrhage of the uterus and the nervous system of the eye leads to serious visual impairment. 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.580
 I brought it.
