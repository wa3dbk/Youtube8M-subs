00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.370
Creatine for muscle mass.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.780
There is probably no supplement that's been
more tried and true, and analyzed, and re-analyzed

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.820
than creatine.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.930
Creatine is a natural compound found in meat,
in fish.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.610
It is basically made up of three amino acids.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.870
It's probably best to take it in powder form
and taken supplementally because your body

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.390
needs to be saturated with creatine in order
to get the results that you're looking for.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.570
By that I mean, this an extremely important
point, creatine is a cumulative supplement

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.820
and not an acute supplement.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.320
That is to say, in other words, an acute supplement
would be something that could be taking possible

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.180
a caffeine capsule, or drinking a cup of coffee.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750
If you are taking caffeine capsules, you are
going to get the results immediately.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.130
You are going to feel energized.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.570
You are going to feel that caffeine capsule
working in your body, wherein then in a short

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.430
while after that it dissipates, you're not
going to feel it anymore.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.670
It's different with creatine.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.910
Your body and your cells, muscle cells in
particular, need to be saturated with creatine;

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.970
and in fact 95 percent of the creatine in
your body resides in your muscle tissue.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.259
So you want to make sure that you saturate
your body with creatine.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.420
You want to probably do a one week loading
phase, then you can drop off to less than

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.790
that.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.799
Creatine also works extremely well when taken,
and it should be taken with juices or a glycemic

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.780
carbohydrate source, because it works extremely
well with insulin to allow it to get into

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.810
the muscle cells quicker and more efficiently.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.189
So what creatine is going to do is it's going
to increase your energy, the body's production

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.840
of ATP, it's going to increase your muscle
cell volume, it's going to actually increase

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.429
your body's ability to get stronger and harder
contractions.

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.829
It's not rare for people who take creatine,
after a loading phase, after a couple weeks

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.370
in of taking creatine, it's not rare for them
to see themselves 10 to 15 percent stronger,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.090
sometimes even greater.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.469
One of the major complaints for those who
take creatine is that they say that the creatine

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.880
causes stomach disturbances; I mean anything
in large doses.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.280
Creatine is considered the safe supplement,
but you shouldn't overdo any one supplement.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.740
Your body's always seeking to find it's homeostatic
place, and rest, and get acclimated.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.700
So it's always good to back off any and all
supplements except maybe your macronutrients,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.850
your protein, your carbs, and so on, and your
healthy fats.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.500
But with regard to creatine, you want to make
sure that you're trying a few different types

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.500
of creatine.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.510
Don't just try creatine monohydrate, which
is the one that is most often cited in statistics

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.110
in studies, because that one tends to cause
some serious, as I said, stomach disturbances.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.130
People who try that, find they're spending
more time in the bathroom, than they are in

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.870
the gym, in which case, you might want to
try a creatine blend, which is creatine ethyl

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.550
ester, creatine malate, creatine monohydrate,
all in one formula.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.671
There is also a form of creatine, Kre-Alkalyn,
which is a pH-buffered creatine, which I have

00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.770
been taking for years, and I recommend it
to all my clients, because you can get creatine

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.830
in pill form, and in capsule form, and in
powder form.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.370
It's always best, and more efficient and cheaper,
to take it, if you can in powder form, especially

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.980
creatine because you can mix it with a high
glycemic juice, like a grape juice or something,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.970
and drink it right down without a problem.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.680
Before you abandon creatine completely, try
some of these other sources of creatine, because

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.070
you're definitely going to want to add it
into your program for the muscle gains in

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.129
size and strength that it's going to bring
to you.
