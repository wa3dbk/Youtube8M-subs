really<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.070> only<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> learn<00:01:50.700> two<00:01:51.030> simple

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
really you only have to learn two simple

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.819 
really you only have to learn two simple
progressions<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.079> order<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.500> learn<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
progressions in order to learn the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.679 
progressions in order to learn the
entire<00:01:53.280> song<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.060> let's<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.750> started<00:01:55.229> first

page and turn off auto sustain this will

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.200 
page and turn off auto sustain this will
help<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.920> staccato<00:02:05.460> sound<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
help you get that staccato sound that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.580 
help you get that staccato sound that
the<00:02:06.329> song<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.899> well<00:02:07.049> known<00:02:07.079> for

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
staccato means the notes stop playing

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.240 
staccato means the notes stop playing
immediately<00:02:10.110> when<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.590> release<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.890> key

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.330 

the<00:02:31.810> bass<00:02:31.990> part<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.530> chorus<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.070> couple

the bass part for the chorus is a couple
more<00:02:33.520> notes<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.060> practice<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.660> couple<00:02:34.900> of

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
more notes but practice it a couple of

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.910 
more notes but practice it a couple of
minutes<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.650> bet<00:02:35.800> you'll<00:02:35.920> get<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.190> perfect

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.110 

now<00:02:44.920> let's<00:02:45.160> learn<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> chords<00:02:45.790> for<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.030> verse

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
now let's learn the chords for the verse

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.330 
now let's learn the chords for the verse
you<00:02:46.690> only<00:02:46.840> move<00:02:47.080> one<00:02:47.290> finger<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.800> time<00:02:48.070> so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
you only move one finger at a time so

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:58.500 
you only move one finger at a time so
it's<00:02:48.490> pretty<00:02:48.670> easy<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.790> chord<00:02:58.030> part<00:02:58.270> for<00:02:58.420> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
it's pretty easy the chord part for the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.880 
it's pretty easy the chord part for the
chorus<00:02:58.810> requires<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.290> little<00:02:59.440> more<00:02:59.680> movement

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
chorus requires a little more movement

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.010 
chorus requires a little more movement
so<00:03:00.370> I've<00:03:00.490> created<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.970> quick<00:03:01.180> exercise<00:03:01.570> that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
so I've created a quick exercise that

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.900 
so I've created a quick exercise that
you<00:03:02.080> can<00:03:02.260> repeat<00:03:02.560> for<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.920> couple<00:03:03.250> minutes<00:03:03.430> to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
you can repeat for a couple minutes to

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:12.949 
you can repeat for a couple minutes to
get<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.180> movement<00:03:04.420> stuck<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.930> your<00:03:05.020> head

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.210 

once<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.110> know<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.350> finger<00:03:14.620> positions<00:03:15.040> you

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
once you know the finger positions you

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:25.830 
once you know the finger positions you
can<00:03:15.340> play<00:03:15.550> it<00:03:15.670> in<00:03:15.790> time<00:03:16.030> like<00:03:16.300> so<00:03:24.600> now<00:03:25.600> let's

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
can play it in time like so now let's

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.070 
can play it in time like so now let's
set<00:03:26.050> up<00:03:26.080> our<00:03:26.290> ocarina<00:03:26.800> for<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.160> harmonies<00:03:27.610> to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
the ocarina parts let's take a quick

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.190 
the ocarina parts let's take a quick
peek<00:03:51.400> at<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.640> tablature<00:03:52.390> for<00:03:52.420> each<00:03:52.720> part<00:03:53.019> as

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
peek at the tablature for each part as

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.229 
peek at the tablature for each part as
you<00:03:53.709> can<00:03:53.860> see<00:03:54.010> there's<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.280> high<00:03:54.580> middle<00:03:55.060> and

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
you can see there's a high middle and

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.000 
you can see there's a high middle and
low<00:03:55.330> harmony<00:03:55.930> part<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.590> we'll<00:03:56.709> start<00:03:56.980> by

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
low harmony part and we'll start by

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.800 
low harmony part and we'll start by
learning<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.400> high<00:03:57.610> part<00:03:57.910> just<00:03:58.390> follow<00:03:58.630> the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
learning the high part just follow the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.420 
learning the high part just follow the
hole<00:03:58.959> positions<00:03:59.410> shown<00:03:59.709> on<00:03:59.860> the<00:03:59.980> tablature

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
hole positions shown on the tablature

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:17.330 
hole positions shown on the tablature
and<00:04:00.459> play<00:04:00.820> like<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:08.579> now<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.640> middle<00:04:09.940> harmony

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:30.059 

and<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:19.209> low<00:04:19.359> harmony<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:29.530> last<00:04:29.740> thing<00:04:29.979> to

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
and the low harmony the last thing to

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.770
