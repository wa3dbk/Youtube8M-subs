00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.720

 Vasilyevsky rest day began with 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 sleepless nights right in the sands attack on 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.650
 due to breakage of the rear gearbox on the car 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.600
 vis-a-vis that the guys had to spend 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.089
 night at about zero temperature 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.470
 troubleshooting however and in the morning 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.360
 the car could not move 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.489
 because of the torn gland behind 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.140
 drive shaft rear gear is not 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.180
 filled a bunch of sand and in a cafe at the end 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.000
 ends the rear axle behind the wedge even 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.220
 towing such a car is impossible 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.650
 six crew members accounted for more than 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.540
 than 20 hours to fix this problem 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.549
 and even when the cars moved to the finish 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.020
 it didn't go quite smoothly along the way 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.030
 had to put on the wheels 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.550
 left over one and a half thousand 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.410
 comments and they all contained words 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.660
 support and confidence that our 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.730
 trucks reach the finish line some 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.510
 very impressionable and soda even started 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.050

 other cars they have less than 20 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.850

 and squee quikeg to kalama dakar caravan 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.360
 leaving the pacific coast highway 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.060
 stages represent the initial 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.130
 sand dunes and then goes to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.400
 stony desert with fields flash flash 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.160
 and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.980
 stage finish donuts climb 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.670
 3500 meters for those who have not yet 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.500
 figured out what's in spr 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.569
 say that this substance is like 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.310
 light dry peat dust 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.959
 Belarusian swamps and characteristic 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.989
 a feature of this stage was the fact that 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.849
 were hindered behind going machines but 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.200
 even when braking the truck completely 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.690
 covered her own dust 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.670
 visibility dropped to 0 alexander 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.860
 Vasilevsky starting from 13th position 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.080
 confidently held in the second ten on 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.390
 finish it came 12 notes becoming from the leader on 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.000
 1 hour 25 minutes 32 seconds 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.530
 the only problem which is business 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.709
 Alexander Vasilevsky during the race 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.319
 This is a missing track. . was in 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.560
 Valley in the fields of flash flash and in this 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.799
 the valley at the same time there were about 30 cars 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 so I had to look for a very long time 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.040
 control target through which it is necessary 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.620
 had to go to take this point 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.239
 despite the fact that sergeevich finisher 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.790
 after the eighth stage last 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.739
 the organizers are objectively quicker 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.980
 racer set after the ten 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.720
 Sergeevich started with 11 positions already on 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.120
 first waypoint he was the eighth 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.370
 however, the dust raised in front 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.290
 jeep did not let Sergei see 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.350
 a pile of stones in which he flew away to 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.720
 The full run result is damaged 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.790
 both wheels on the board are bent disc and 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.100
 torn out two front shock absorbers on 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.430
 troubleshoot all the problems in the crew 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.200
 Sergeevich took about 25 minutes to the second 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.880
 waypoint he arrived showing already 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.560
 twenty first time and lagged behind 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.600
 leader almost thirty one minute 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.060
 further Sergeevich applies a maximum 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.900
 effort to play in 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.359
 lost time 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.510
 the final result is 13th place in stage c 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.180
 1 hour and 26 minutes behind at 16 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.280
 seconds vasilevskiy starting 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.650
 41 positions again 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.650
 in the thick of the race feature 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.180
 today's stage was that all 450 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.880
 kilometers the track was total 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.310
 after passing 150 jeeps hundreds 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.500
 motorcycles 50 quad and half trailer 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.600
 trucks already not very good 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.610
 Dakar road turns into hell 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.620
 along this terrible road to Vladimir 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.090
 Vasilevsky also has to overtake 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.850
 although still on the official website 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.440
 Dakar no finish time Vladimir 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.690
 Vasilyevsky there is evidence that he 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.910
 drove to the finish line and start at the tenth 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.320
 special plot some 41 positions 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.810
 generally if you look at the time 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.250
 being on the track then vasilevsky 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.640
 is on the track for more 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.100
 eighty four hours and in principle 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.320
 this dakar can be counted as 2 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.840
 as for the other participants 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.440
 the ninth stage is the usual two 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.560
 kamaz 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.390

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.040
 mardeev showed on the ninth special 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.510
 plot average speed of eighty 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.610
 four kilometers average speed 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.750

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.300
 amounted to 69 kilometers per hour to the third 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.650
 the place managed to climb the hole after losing 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.169
 leader only 7 minutes 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.720
 Andrei Karginov due to wheel replacement 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.770
 lost 15 minutes and is on 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.860
 fourth place 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.289
 5 modem and only la prise further finishers 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.180
 Han Stacey Martin Colom and Dmitry 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.190
 centurions after several unsuccessful 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.860
 steps again announced himself who took 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.090
 ninth place arthur in do we choose 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.190

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.610
 nagi no fee which lagged behind the leader on 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.740
 58 minutes 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.569
 seconds airat mardeev continues 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.360
 lead the general classification 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.719
 wound up pace edward nikolaev 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.080
 allows him 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.639
 push Karginova to the third position 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.669
 However, the lag of Nikolaev from the leader 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.379
 increases from 12 to 14 minutes and deprived 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.289
 price or from falling into the top three 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:09.020
 the strongest is separated in an hour 18 minutes 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.240
 This position is still occupied by Dmitry 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.699
 the centurions Khan Stacy lags behind him on 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.379
 40 minutes thanks to good performance 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.419
 on stage 9 martin deck 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:20.360
 managed to move up to seventh place 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.340
 slipping our Vladimir Vasilevsky into 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.960
 as a rival, the van was led so 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.300
 backlog of Alexander Vasilevsky 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.759
 nearest rival is over 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.740
 than two hours of the ninth little sensation 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.870
 stage can be called a performance hole 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.939
 in just one stage I was able to advance in 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.469
 general classification from the 14th to 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:38.479
 tenth place with me 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.490
 the slowness of alexander vasilevsky and 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.979
 the character's stubborn character is obvious 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.689
 restrain the hero will not succeed coming 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.460
 several stages you should expect that 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.710
 cane can play 40 minutes 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.050
 separating him from Vasilyevsky what 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.300
 concerns the other two maza crews 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.729
 sergey face hiv is on thirty 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.589
 second place in the general classification 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:00.080
 behind the leader of the thirty-one hour 

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:02.779
 Unfortunately, we must admit that the chances 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.870
 Sergeyevich even hit the top ten 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:07.729
 the best are very elusive this dakar can 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.099
 happen anything but believe 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.349
 knocking calls for fucking 22 crew 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.580
 Very difficult Vladimir Vasilevsky 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.860
 is on the thirty-eighth position 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.210
 general classification of us so 10 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.009
 special plot of alexander 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.860
 Sergey Vasilevsky lucky come out 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:24.319
 respectively 13 and 14 at the start of their 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.389
 separated by only one minute, and despite the 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.159
 the fact that Sergei lucky lost all odds 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.300
 to hit the top ten by 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:31.310
 the results of the whole marathon 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.050
 nothing prevents him from showing good 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.029
