00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.420 
which I think should probably be in
about<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.629> month<00:02:56.629> or<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.530> get<00:02:58.099> my<00:02:58.220> tongue

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
about a month or so so get my tongue

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.710 
about a month or so so get my tongue
split<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:59.629> pretty<00:02:59.900> cool<00:03:01.090> once<00:03:02.090> i<00:03:02.329> get<00:03:02.540> some

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
split be pretty cool once i get some

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.480

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.240 
now fucking you can't smoke after it if
anything<00:03:49.990> call<00:03:50.290> it's<00:03:50.470> going<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.680> do<00:03:50.830> is<00:03:50.980> clean

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
anything call it's going to do is clean

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.640 
anything call it's going to do is clean
out<00:03:51.520> and<00:03:51.730> make<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.030> dryer<00:03:52.300> which<00:03:53.110> it's<00:03:53.470> like<00:03:53.620> a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
out and make it dryer which it's like a

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.110 
out and make it dryer which it's like a
lot<00:03:53.980> better<00:03:55.410> also<00:03:56.410> salt<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.130> water<00:03:57.310> really

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
lot better also salt and water really

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.320 
lot better also salt and water really
does<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.360> shit<00:03:58.930> job<00:03:59.010> like<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.340> did<00:04:00.820> on<00:04:00.910> my<00:04:00.970> bridge

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
does a shit job like I did on my bridge

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.090 
does a shit job like I did on my bridge
and<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:02.110> think<00:04:02.380> that's<00:04:02.530> one<00:04:02.770> of<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.950> main

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
and I think that's one of the main

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.710 
and I think that's one of the main
reasons<00:04:03.520> why<00:04:03.700> it's<00:04:03.910> gone<00:04:04.120> pretty<00:04:04.150> much<00:04:04.510> one

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
reasons why it's gone pretty much one

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.170 
reasons why it's gone pretty much one
key<00:04:04.900> because<00:04:05.590> it's<00:04:05.740> well<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.370> swelled<00:04:06.730> up<00:04:06.970> like

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
key because it's well it swelled up like

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.120 
key because it's well it swelled up like
this<00:04:07.360> side<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.410> side<00:04:08.590> was<00:04:08.770> just<00:04:08.980> like

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
this side and the side was just like

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.980 
this side and the side was just like
loose<00:04:09.520> that's<00:04:10.120> probably<00:04:10.360> why<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.480> can<00:04:10.720> do<00:04:10.840> stuff

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
loose that's probably why I can do stuff

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.440 
loose that's probably why I can do stuff
like<00:04:11.050> that<00:04:11.200> with<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.710> like<00:04:12.370> full-on<00:04:12.640> like<00:04:12.880> push

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
like that with it like full-on like push

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.830 
like that with it like full-on like push
it<00:04:13.630> up<00:04:13.780> there<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:14.290> then<00:04:14.680> like<00:04:14.890> there's<00:04:15.630> not<00:04:16.630> so

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
it up there and then like there's not so

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.060 
it up there and then like there's not so
much<00:04:17.070> but<00:04:18.070> yeah<00:04:18.580> it's<00:04:18.850> really<00:04:19.330> fat<00:04:19.600> that

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.940 

I<00:04:23.130> would<00:04:23.940> just<00:04:24.360> rather<00:04:24.600> use<00:04:24.930> vaseline<00:04:25.530> or

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
I would just rather use vaseline or

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.650 
I would just rather use vaseline or
likes<00:04:26.250> apple<00:04:26.610> on<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.880> cement<00:04:27.180> because<00:04:27.510> it's

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
likes apple on the cement because it's

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.530 
likes apple on the cement because it's
pride<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.110> really<00:04:28.440> good<00:04:28.820> not<00:04:29.820> like<00:04:30.000> sex<00:04:30.330> sleep

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
pride is really good not like sex sleep

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.930 
pride is really good not like sex sleep
I<00:04:30.900> don't<00:04:31.530> really<00:04:31.860> think<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.220> would<00:04:32.400> work<00:04:32.460> I

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
I don't really think that would work I

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.790 
I don't really think that would work I
wouldn't<00:04:33.330> try<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.540> anyway<00:04:35.960> I've<00:04:36.960> like<00:04:37.560> red

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800
