00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
episode we talked about installing this

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.049 
episode we talked about installing this
drip<00:00:10.110> irrigation<00:00:10.530> line<00:00:10.920> now<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
drip irrigation line now one of the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.610 
drip irrigation line now one of the
things<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> was<00:00:12.780> talking<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.440> this

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
things that I was talking about is this

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.900 
things that I was talking about is this
plumbing<00:00:14.099> tape<00:00:14.839> one<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.400> when<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.520> tested

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
plumbing tape one of the when we tested

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.210 
plumbing tape one of the when we tested
this<00:00:18.060> system<00:00:18.480> did<00:00:19.410> notice<00:00:19.710> some<00:00:19.859> leaking

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
this system did notice some leaking

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.859 
this system did notice some leaking
around<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.550> joints<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.480> quite<00:00:21.600> an<00:00:21.720> easy

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
around the joints so it's quite an easy

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.500 
around the joints so it's quite an easy
to<00:00:22.109> install<00:00:22.140> plumbing<00:00:22.619> tape<00:00:23.269> basically<00:00:24.269> just

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to install plumbing tape basically just

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.589 
to install plumbing tape basically just
take<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> tape<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> wrap<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.180> opposite

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
take the tape go to wrap it the opposite

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.620 
take the tape go to wrap it the opposite
way<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> threads<00:00:29.269> you<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.449> wrap<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
way of the threads you just wrap a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.819 
way of the threads you just wrap a
couple<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.080> times<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:34.290> try<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
couple of times to try to get it a

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.799 
couple of times to try to get it a
little<00:00:34.860> snug<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.460> you're<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
little snug as you're going get all the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.900 
little snug as you're going get all the
threads<00:00:37.110> equally<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.700> kind<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
threads equally then you just kind of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
threads equally then you just kind of
pull<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.610> then<00:00:41.610> what<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.030> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
pull to get it off then what you do is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.139 
pull to get it off then what you do is
you<00:00:43.050> screw<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.500> yeah<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.579> listen<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:45.000> don't

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you screw it yeah and listen you don't

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.360 
you screw it yeah and listen you don't
drop<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.559> screwed<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> should<00:00:47.070> provide<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
drop it screwed in it should provide a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.209 
drop it screwed in it should provide a
fitter<00:00:47.670> tighter<00:00:48.420> fit<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> other<00:00:49.920> thing<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
fitter tighter fit the other thing I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
fitter tighter fit the other thing I
noticed<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:52.879> beginning<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.090> line<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
noticed was the beginning the line it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.779 
noticed was the beginning the line it
pressurizes<00:00:55.079> quite<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> bit<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.610> not

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
pressurizes quite a bit now this is not

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
pressurizes quite a bit now this is not
an<00:00:57.000> area<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:58.289> want<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.859> water<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> be

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
an area that we want the water to be

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
an area that we want the water to be
going<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.180> I'm<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> use<00:01:00.570> electrical

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
going so I'm going to use electrical

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.039 
going so I'm going to use electrical
tape<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.469> cover<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> line<00:01:02.870> electrical<00:01:03.870> tape

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
tape to cover the line electrical tape

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.660 
tape to cover the line electrical tape
is<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.619> wonderful<00:01:05.159> tape<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.689> will<00:01:07.170> stay

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
is a wonderful tape because it will stay

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
is a wonderful tape because it will stay
sticky<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> stick<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.420> itself<00:01:09.750> even<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:10.350> wet

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
sticky and stick to itself even when wet

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.510 
sticky and stick to itself even when wet
so<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:12.530> figured<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.770> probably<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.220> good

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so it's a figured it was probably a good

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
so it's a figured it was probably a good
option<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:17.390> reduce<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.659> amount<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.080> bleeding

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
option to reduce the amount of bleeding

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
option to reduce the amount of bleeding
coming<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.159> lines<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
coming out of these lines so that it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.240 
coming out of these lines so that it
gets<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.840> where<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> plants<00:01:22.500> need<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> instead

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
gets to where the plants need it instead

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.920 
gets to where the plants need it instead
of<00:01:23.780> all<00:01:24.780> over<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.229> place<00:01:26.180> where<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.750> don't

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
of all over the place where we don't

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.810 
of all over the place where we don't
need<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:31.020> are<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.320> sweet<00:01:31.590> peppers<00:01:31.979> on

cardboard and see if I can sheet mulch

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.259 
cardboard and see if I can sheet mulch
on<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:15.860> side<00:02:16.129> I'm<00:02:16.489> gonna<00:02:16.670> pull<00:02:16.879> all<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.120> weeds

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
on one side I'm gonna pull all the weeds

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.729 
on one side I'm gonna pull all the weeds
on<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.840> other<00:02:17.959> side<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.470> gonna<00:02:18.560> lay

on the other side I'm just gonna lay

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.920 
on the other side I'm just gonna lay
this<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:19.069> top<00:02:19.340> once<00:02:20.000> these<00:02:20.239> are<00:02:20.390> all<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.689> place

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
this on top once these are all in place

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.149 
this on top once these are all in place
what<00:02:21.140> I'm<00:02:21.230> gonna<00:02:21.319> do<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:21.799> going<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.010> take

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.360 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take
some<00:02:22.340> compost<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:23.689> have<00:02:23.989> put<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.069> top

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
some compost that I have put it on top

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.009 
some compost that I have put it on top
hopefully<00:02:25.610> that'll<00:02:26.060> act<00:02:26.329> like<00:02:26.629> a<00:02:26.659> little<00:02:26.930> bit

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
hopefully that'll act like a little bit

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.589 
hopefully that'll act like a little bit
of<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.170> compost<00:02:27.590> tea<00:02:27.829> while<00:02:28.370> helping<00:02:28.700> over<00:02:29.329> time

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
of a compost tea while helping over time

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.710 
of a compost tea while helping over time
prevent<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.560> weeds<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.950> come<00:02:31.099> up<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.720> figure

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
prevent the weeds to come up I figure

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.330 
prevent the weeds to come up I figure
what<00:02:33.049> will<00:02:33.200> likely<00:02:33.409> happen<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.159> worms

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
what will likely happen is the worms

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.920 
what will likely happen is the worms
will<00:02:34.549> come<00:02:34.760> into<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.180> they'll<00:02:35.540> chew<00:02:35.750> this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
will come into this they'll chew this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.360 
will come into this they'll chew this
all<00:02:36.140> up<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.440> by<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.620> end<00:02:36.799> of<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.950> season<00:02:37.280> this

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
all up and by the end of the season this

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.830 
all up and by the end of the season this
will<00:02:37.519> be<00:02:37.610> gone<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:37.970> hopefully<00:02:38.299> I'll<00:02:38.450> at<00:02:38.780> least

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
will be gone but hopefully I'll at least

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.289 
will be gone but hopefully I'll at least
slow<00:02:39.230> down<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.590> weeds<00:02:39.769> that<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:40.010> have<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.180> what

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
slow down the weeds that I have so what

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.630 
slow down the weeds that I have so what
I'm<00:02:41.390> gonna<00:02:41.510> do<00:02:41.950> I'm<00:02:42.950> gonna<00:02:43.040> try<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.370> line<00:02:43.609> up

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to line up

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.770 
I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to line up
the<00:02:43.790> slits<00:02:44.689> with<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.959> bottom<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.319> plant

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the slits with the bottom of the plant

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.860 
the slits with the bottom of the plant
just<00:02:47.780> fold<00:02:48.409> over<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.980> one<00:02:49.159> side<00:02:49.629> so<00:02:50.629> that<00:02:50.690> we

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
just fold over the one side so that we

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.330 
just fold over the one side so that we
can<00:02:51.049> get<00:02:51.230> our<00:02:52.069> nutrients<00:02:52.639> and<00:02:53.329> our

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
can get our nutrients and our

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.089 
can get our nutrients and our
fertilizers<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:55.700> right<00:02:55.849> spot<00:02:57.099> without

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
fertilizers to the right spot without

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.979 
fertilizers to the right spot without
having<00:02:58.579> it<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.000> know<00:02:59.090> sheet<00:02:59.510> flow<00:02:59.780> over

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
having it you know sheet flow over

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.920 
having it you know sheet flow over
anything<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.879> not<00:03:01.879> do<00:03:02.060> too<00:03:02.299> terribly<00:03:02.870> much

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
anything and not do too terribly much

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.140 
anything and not do too terribly much
work<00:03:03.349> so<00:03:03.560> this<00:03:03.700> happens<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.819> work<00:03:04.909> out<00:03:05.120> just

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
work so this happens to work out just

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.479 
work so this happens to work out just
fine<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:07.090> fold<00:03:08.090> these<00:03:08.299> over<00:03:08.829> I'm<00:03:09.829> gonna<00:03:10.010> do<00:03:10.250> is

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
fine to fold these over I'm gonna do is

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.220 
fine to fold these over I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:03:10.639> gonna<00:03:13.209> flip<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.329> over<00:03:14.569> because<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.959> think

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
I'm gonna flip this over because I think

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.409 
I'm gonna flip this over because I think
a<00:03:16.060> little<00:03:17.060> bit<00:03:17.239> better<00:03:18.099> scooch<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:20.209> right

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
a little bit better scooch it right

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.089 
a little bit better scooch it right
under<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:22.819> this<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.150> good<00:03:23.329> option<00:03:23.480> if<00:03:23.870> you

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
under so this is a good option if you

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.500 
under so this is a good option if you
live<00:03:25.099> in<00:03:25.220> an<00:03:25.310> urban<00:03:25.459> environment<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.449> do

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
live in an urban environment like I do

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.949 
live in an urban environment like I do
and<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.760> don't<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:28.910> access<00:03:29.419> to<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.690> lot<00:03:29.930> of

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
and you don't have access to a lot of

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.140 
and you don't have access to a lot of

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
see if I can't get this to stay down

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.379 
see if I can't get this to stay down
that's<00:04:10.310> not<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.519> problem<00:04:10.760> if<00:04:11.109> if<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:12.470> the
