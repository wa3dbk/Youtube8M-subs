00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.610
 one or two 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 the young woman agreed with the foot 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.309
 do not 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.890
 one 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.850
 and for me it is not a file but they are the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.830
 reason to make a gift and send 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.810
 what is the lover of the creams more 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.130
 that everything of the body and hands well 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.760
 that what better than we remove it for 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.760
 conquer your heart 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.020
 something you can love me as well 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.200
 are the wallets or shoes 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.320
 I do not think it goes with a portfolio if it's 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.320
 is 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.340
 my mom is a hippie loves the explosion 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.659
 of color and the wave down here fixed 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.659
 I find something that you will love 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.320
 my mom does a thousand things in a day always 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.409
 but the worried well groomed 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:08.660
 gifts to pacts or a dress 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:10.940
 I think a better option and against the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.560
 perfect gift for my mom to her that 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.260
 he loves to go to the theater they can be 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.480
 tickets for one of these two works that 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.430
 she seems to be happy, I know she's going 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.800
 to love because he always comes with his 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.170
 friends with my dad is one of the things 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.560
 what else do you like to do so here the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.560
 I have 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.610
 and 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.040
 yes 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.530
 wallets are a weakness the style 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.350
 of my mom is super different from mine but 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.860
 we both love lilita I think this is 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.860
 ideal 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.060
 My mom loves doing sports 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.520
 together and nothing like new sport clothes 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.150
 to give us more they will need these 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.150
 Latin strings 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.850
 just like me, my mom is a fan of the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.920
 alpaca and vicuna by the wild cradles a 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.600
 from your favorite brands this layer 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.490
 It overflows elegance and is a piece 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.490
 classic which you can wear with pride 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.590
 for many years definitely a 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.950
 good investment and I think that with that the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.950
 nail 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.140
 our moms like that they 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.800
 we send but what they like most is 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.800
 eat rich 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.290
 and 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.120
 and 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.600
 Y
