close<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.170> almost<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.619> neon<00:00:20.010> orange

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
close this is almost like a neon orange

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.120 
close this is almost like a neon orange
and<00:00:20.869> as<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.170> will<00:00:22.289> see<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.680> moment<00:00:22.800> here

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and as you will see in a moment here

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.700 
and as you will see in a moment here
this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> two-part<00:00:24.000> case<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.289> get<00:00:25.590> an

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
this is a two-part case so you get an

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.150 
this is a two-part case so you get an
exterior<00:00:26.220> shell<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.970> then<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.240> interior<00:00:28.160> kind

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
exterior shell and then an interior kind

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
exterior shell and then an interior kind
of<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.490> TPU<00:00:29.939> material<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.720> almost<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
of a TPU material this is almost like a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.750 
of a TPU material this is almost like a
neon<00:00:31.880> lime<00:00:33.559> with<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.829> kind<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.399> hint<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
neon lime with the kind of a hint of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.790 
neon lime with the kind of a hint of
green<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.270> yellow<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.710> of

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
green and yellow to it and then of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.610 
green and yellow to it and then of
course<00:00:38.010> we've<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.430> black<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.660> gray<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.200> let

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
course we've got black with gray so let

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
course we've got black with gray so let
me<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.770> ahead<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.950> peel<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.550> apart<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
me go ahead and peel this apart as I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.430 
me go ahead and peel this apart as I
mentioned<00:00:43.020> there<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.440> exterior<00:00:43.980> shell<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
mentioned there is an exterior shell and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.150 
mentioned there is an exterior shell and
basically<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.890> peel<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:48.149> off<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
basically you peel that right off of the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
basically you peel that right off of the
interior<00:00:50.160> TPU<00:00:50.910> material<00:00:51.090> which<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> pretty

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
interior TPU material which is pretty

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
interior TPU material which is pretty
rigid<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.890> say<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> impact<00:00:53.879> or

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
rigid I will say it's going to impact or

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.410 
rigid I will say it's going to impact or
absorb<00:00:54.930> impacts<00:00:55.739> quite<00:00:56.280> well<00:00:56.550> lay<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
absorb impacts quite well lay the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750 
absorb impacts quite well lay the
buttons<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.050> first<00:00:58.410> even<00:00:59.309> though<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.550> isn't

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
buttons in first even though this isn't

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
buttons in first even though this isn't
all<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.000> difficult<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.739> into

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
all that difficult to really put into

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
all that difficult to really put into
place<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> should<00:01:02.820> play<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:03.809> with

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
place and it should play very well with

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
place and it should play very well with
screen<00:01:04.439> protectors<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:06.030> comes<00:01:06.299> up

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
screen protectors because it comes up

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
screen protectors because it comes up
right<00:01:06.630> over<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.990> edge<00:01:07.040> but<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> really

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
right over the edge but it really

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370 
right over the edge but it really
doesn't<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> whole<00:01:09.420> heck<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
doesn't do a whole heck of a lot to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.800 
doesn't do a whole heck of a lot to
bubble<00:01:10.830> them<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.130> anything<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.810> then

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
bubble them or anything like that then

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.630 
bubble them or anything like that then
we<00:01:13.260> are<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.860> take<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.220> she'll<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
we are going to take that she'll and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.050 
we are going to take that she'll and
simply<00:01:15.450> put<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> right<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.470> place<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.790> like

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
simply put it right into place just like

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090 
simply put it right into place just like
you<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.390> me<00:01:18.420> doing<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:19.320> now<00:01:19.740> you're<00:01:20.009> going

to do the reverse to remove this take
the<00:01:21.930> shell<00:01:22.170> off<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.130> take<00:01:23.369> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the shell off and then take that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.800

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
get a great lay on the table design with

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.609 
get a great lay on the table design with
this<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> mean<00:01:31.170> by<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.409> of

screen is not touching the case will now
down<00:01:38.400> below<00:01:38.670> let's<00:01:39.180> flip<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.479> around<00:01:39.689> you're

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
down below let's flip this around you're

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
down below let's flip this around you're
going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:41.040> everything<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.729> exposed<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
going to see everything is exposed and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.410 
going to see everything is exposed and
it<00:01:42.960> looks<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.680> fine<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.850> might<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.329> an

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it looks just fine this might be an

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
it looks just fine this might be an
issue<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:46.229> using<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.799> 30-pin<00:01:47.340> to

although<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.320> takes<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.650> little<00:02:22.980> bit<00:02:23.190> of

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
although it takes a little bit of

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.040

extreme<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.520> not<00:02:26.670> too<00:02:27.000> much<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.210> a

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
extreme so it's not too much of a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.350 
extreme so it's not too much of a
concern<00:02:27.570> for<00:02:27.780> me<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.040> not<00:02:29.100> super<00:02:29.850> clicky

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
concern for me but it's not super clicky
