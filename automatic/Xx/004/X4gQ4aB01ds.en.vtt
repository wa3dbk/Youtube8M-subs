it gets even better the more that I wash
it<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:32.310> y'all<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.240> love<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.720> well

little shinier on camera because i am

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
little shinier on camera because i am
using<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:45.000> ring<00:01:45.270> light<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> natural

effect of the hair maybe just slightly

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.530 
effect of the hair maybe just slightly
shinier<00:01:55.649> than<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.520> she<00:01:56.700> would<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.299> real

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
