from<00:00:48.570> prison<00:00:48.930> life<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.289> course<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.680> always

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
from prison life of course they always

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.490 
from prison life of course they always
had<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.390> their<00:00:51.390> their<00:00:51.719> guns<00:00:52.050> made<00:00:52.350> out

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
had you know their their guns made out

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.590 
had you know their their guns made out
of<00:00:52.590> soap<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.610> prison<00:00:54.090> fights<00:00:54.360> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
of soap and you know prison fights in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.819 
of soap and you know prison fights in
the<00:00:54.660> lunchroom<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.289> never<00:00:55.469> had<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829

the lunchroom but they never had the
prison<00:00:56.190> sex<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:59.129> they
