whether the horse likes them or not I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.230 
whether the horse likes them or not I
think<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.310> end<00:01:15.460> what<00:01:15.909> we<00:01:15.939> need<00:01:16.150> to

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
think that in the end what we need to

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.160 
think that in the end what we need to
find<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.689> balance<00:01:17.259> for<00:01:18.130> both<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.689> is<00:01:19.900> a

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
find is a balance for both and that is a

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.219 
find is a balance for both and that is a
balance<00:01:20.590> between<00:01:20.970> training<00:01:21.970> exercises<00:01:22.659> that

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
balance between training exercises that

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.380 
balance between training exercises that
teach<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.740> horse<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:24.100> physically<00:01:24.729> respect

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
teach the horse to physically respect

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.609 
teach the horse to physically respect
our<00:01:25.540> space<00:01:25.689> and<00:01:26.290> listen<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.250> us<00:01:27.460> but<00:01:28.210> also<00:01:28.619> take

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
our space and listen to us but also take

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.260 
our space and listen to us but also take
into<00:01:29.829> account<00:01:29.950> what<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.729> horse<00:01:31.030> is

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
into account what the horse is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.640 
into account what the horse is
emotionally<00:01:32.140> going<00:01:32.979> through<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
emotionally going through and one of the

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.520 
emotionally going through and one of the
reasons<00:01:36.009> I<00:01:36.159> think<00:01:36.220> that<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:37.540> professional

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
reasons I think that a professional

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.109 
reasons I think that a professional
horse<00:01:38.710> trainer<00:01:39.040> might<00:01:39.340> fall<00:01:39.670> into<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
horse trainer might fall into the

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.080 
horse trainer might fall into the
category<00:01:40.659> of<00:01:40.750> ignoring<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.880> emotional<00:01:42.880> side

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
category of ignoring the emotional side

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.660 
category of ignoring the emotional side
just<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.509> little<00:01:43.540> bit<00:01:43.720> more<00:01:44.049> is<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.610> know

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
just a little bit more is and I know

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.940 
just a little bit more is and I know
this<00:01:45.909> because<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.329> experience<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.740> when

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
this because of experience is that when

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.350 
this because of experience is that when
you<00:01:48.220> get<00:01:48.369> into<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> crunch<00:01:49.000> where<00:01:49.210> you're

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
you get into a crunch where you're

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.450 
you get into a crunch where you're
riding<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.780> lot<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.170> different<00:01:50.439> horses<00:01:50.619> you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
riding a lot of different horses you

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.910 
riding a lot of different horses you
tend<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.850> care<00:01:52.450> more<00:01:52.750> about<00:01:52.869> what<00:01:53.290> physically

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
tend to care more about what physically

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.490 
tend to care more about what physically
ends<00:01:54.159> up<00:01:54.250> happening<00:01:54.460> with<00:01:54.880> them<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:56.290> kind

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
ends up happening with them and it kind

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.280 
ends up happening with them and it kind
of<00:01:56.530> needs<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.829> fit<00:01:56.979> into<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.250> time<00:01:57.579> frame<00:01:57.939> and

that every trailer ride doesn't end in

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.560 
that every trailer ride doesn't end in
hard<00:03:49.660> work<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:51.280> my<00:03:51.490> program<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:51.970> would<00:03:52.270> consider

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
hard work in my program I would consider

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.720 
hard work in my program I would consider
this<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> be<00:03:53.200> part<00:03:53.860> of<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.340> emotional

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
this to be part of the emotional

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.300 
this to be part of the emotional
training<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.660> hauled<00:03:56.470> al<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:56.980> several

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
training I hauled al to several

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.240 
training I hauled al to several
different<00:03:57.400> locations<00:03:57.700> during<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.500> time<00:04:00.070> that

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
different locations during the time that

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.340 
different locations during the time that

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
I had him and I repeated this same type

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.430 
I had him and I repeated this same type
of<00:04:02.380> routine<00:04:03.250> where<00:04:04.000> we<00:04:04.150> would<00:04:04.300> show<00:04:04.510> up<00:04:04.690> unload

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
of routine where we would show up unload
