 battalion commander 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:45.030
 because tap white wool red on 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.460

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.119

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:58.799
 forgotten god country i'm a hero tell me 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.799
 what novel about 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 about 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.170
 alsol 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.080
 asos asos asos 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.460
 half an hour though 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.290
 the whole song is played in Riga 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.070
 you need to take it out verbally faster 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.560
 to speak such a rhythmic pattern 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:51.130
 pa-pa-pa pa-pa-pa-pa-pa pa-pa-pa-pa that is 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:54.460
 If you listen to it, it turns out now 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.970
 motions themselves first pull bass 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.280
 string 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.180
 if we have a chord it means 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.700
 the sixth string the bass string goes next 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.390
 second top down 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.690
 index finger nail is 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.210
 biting 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.570
 after which we immediately move 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.570
 bottom up pillow of the same finger 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.580
 then to follow the rhythmic 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.280
 drawing as there we have a pause 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.930
 that is, we are now three movements 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.560
 made it three hits i mean bass 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.400
 This emphasis goes then two movements 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.709
 quick 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.239
 after which there is a pause we pause 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:47.980
 fill in such as strangling strings 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:54.489
 but not usually so fast just 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:58.150
 put your palm on the strings like this and after 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.129
 what do we do a sharp movement from above 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.360
 down mostly along the lower strings 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.570
 index fingernail 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.420
 if the chord allows it we suppress this 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.320
 the sound of the left hand that is on it 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.120
 the movement of the chord is slightly weakened but if 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.120
 again allows a chord for example in 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.170
 chord and bottom strings all open 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.570
 so you just need to make a move 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.240
 too so sharp and a little 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.000
 tangent to long strings not 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.660
 sounded and if the chord allows you 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.690
 naturally 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.620
 especially here on the bars there is a little bit easier 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.790
 straight literally weakened and immediately the sound 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.620
 deaf it turns out like this and it means 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.360
 was the last movement of the battle 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.890
 after which the fight is repeated from the very beginning 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.890
 now repeat it slowly 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.740
 but 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.060
 speeding up 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.159
 again we follow this rhythmic 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.440
 the picture, that is, no need to get lost 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:29.940
 First here's it imbued in 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:29.940
 rhythm naturally also play 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.389
 but 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.880
 as for this song then they mean in 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.250
 some places adds at the end more 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.940
 one upward movement that is 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.940
 it turns out so 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.110
 let not just this last move 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:00.650
 a sound and long-lasting and more 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.560
 it adds the movement 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.750
 quick and bottom up but it's like 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.440
 such an optional moment but he 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.940
 present in this song that means 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.720
 We lose this fight once 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.720
 every chord we know on em again on m and 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.270
 h7 and so the whole song one at a time all 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.740
 as for bass strings for example on 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:27.620
 the cord was tugging at him 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.130
 sixth played fight and then lunging m 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.240
 already 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.240
 pull the fifth 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:39.679
 so again there on 6 bass and our 7 5 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:49.700
 and so on only remains on 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.300
 train to automatism and add 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.670
 vocal 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.070
 Well, I hope I did not forget to mention anything 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:58.150
 On this all I wish you a good parsing 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.150
 bye bye
