let's<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.079> started<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:02.239> thing<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.390> got<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
let's get started first thing you got to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.070 
let's get started first thing you got to
do<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:05.339> take<00:01:05.610> off<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.850> side<00:01:06.240> panel<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
do is take off the side panel and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
do is take off the side panel and
there's<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.750> latch<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.970> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
there's just a little latch here and it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.390 
there's just a little latch here and it
pulled<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.720> there

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.380 

secondly<00:01:20.020> we<00:01:21.020> have<00:01:21.140> this<00:01:21.290> little<00:01:21.470> air<00:01:21.770> guard

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
secondly we have this little air guard

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.160 
secondly we have this little air guard
let's<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:23.450> grab<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.049> handle<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.880> pull<00:01:26.119> back

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.260 

now<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.229> third<00:01:30.590> part<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.640> front<00:01:31.940> fan

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
now the third part is the front fan

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.550 
now the third part is the front fan
assembly<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:33.530> helps<00:01:33.950> bring<00:01:34.670> cool<00:01:34.940> air<00:01:35.180> in

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
assembly this helps bring cool air in

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.109 
assembly this helps bring cool air in
from<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.590> front<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.040> unit<00:01:37.070> this<00:01:37.880> right

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
from the front of the unit this right

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.469 
from the front of the unit this right
here<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:39.049> just<00:01:39.259> grab<00:01:39.500> with<00:01:39.680> one<00:01:39.890> hand<00:01:40.159> and

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
here you just grab with one hand and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.320 
here you just grab with one hand and
pull<00:01:41.479> out<00:01:41.690> ever<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:42.950> slightly<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:44.030> may<00:01:44.180> have

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
pull out ever so slightly you may have

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.670 
pull out ever so slightly you may have
to<00:01:44.450> wait<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.659> little<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.930> little<00:01:45.049> bit<00:01:47.500> there<00:01:48.500> you

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
to wait a little a little bit there you

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.559 
to wait a little a little bit there you
go<00:01:50.319> now<00:01:51.319> in<00:01:51.800> an<00:01:52.460> early<00:01:53.560> dual-processor<00:01:54.610> g5<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
go now in an early dual-processor g5 the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.059 
go now in an early dual-processor g5 the
max<00:01:56.840> amount<00:01:56.929> of<00:01:57.170> memory<00:01:57.289> you<00:01:57.440> can<00:01:57.590> put<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.920> it

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
max amount of memory you can put in it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.639 
max amount of memory you can put in it
is<00:01:58.250> 4<00:01:58.880> gigabytes<00:01:59.770> you<00:02:00.770> have<00:02:02.050> for<00:02:03.050> RAM<00:02:03.289> slots

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
is 4 gigabytes you have for RAM slots

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.070 
is 4 gigabytes you have for RAM slots
and<00:02:04.130> as<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.520> can<00:02:04.670> see<00:02:04.700> two<00:02:05.119> of<00:02:05.300> them<00:02:05.450> are<00:02:05.750> used

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
and as you can see two of them are used

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.859 
and as you can see two of them are used
at<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.319> moment<00:02:06.800> those<00:02:07.520> are<00:02:07.700> housing<00:02:08.060> my<00:02:08.179> 2<00:02:08.239> 1

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
at the moment those are housing my 2 1

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.330 
at the moment those are housing my 2 1
gigabyte<00:02:09.319> crucial<00:02:09.890> sticks<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:11.319> now<00:02:12.319> time<00:02:13.190> to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
gigabyte crucial sticks and now time to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:28.570 
gigabyte crucial sticks and now time to
install<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.730> new<00:02:14.000> Ram

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.680 

now<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.670> course<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:30.060> got<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.239> make<00:02:30.360> sure<00:02:30.390> you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
now of course you got to make sure you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.350 
now of course you got to make sure you
cut<00:02:30.959> these<00:02:31.110> things<00:02:31.379> open<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:33.060> try<00:02:33.299> to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
cut these things open if you just try to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.449 
cut these things open if you just try to
do<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:33.629> your<00:02:33.720> hands<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.440> will<00:02:34.620> get<00:02:34.860> hurt<00:02:35.160> I

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
do with your hands you will get hurt I

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.190 
do with your hands you will get hurt I
can<00:02:35.819> almost<00:02:35.970> promise<00:02:36.299> for<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:39.019> best<00:02:40.019> thing

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
can almost promise for that best thing

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:52.030 
can almost promise for that best thing
to<00:02:40.319> do<00:02:41.090> cut<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.239> top<00:02:42.510> off<00:02:50.150> take<00:02:51.150> two<00:02:51.360> hands<00:02:51.840> and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
to do cut the top off take two hands and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.569 
to do cut the top off take two hands and
pull<00:02:54.980> sometimes<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.099> have<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.340> get<00:02:56.459> it

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
pull sometimes you have to get it

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.690 
pull sometimes you have to get it
started<00:02:58.489> just<00:02:59.489> like<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.940> one<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:02.340> then<00:03:02.519> two

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
started just like that one and then two

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.220 
started just like that one and then two
then<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.299> take<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.720> stick<00:03:06.959> right<00:03:06.989> out

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
then you can take the stick right out

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.050 
then you can take the stick right out
