to show all the supplies that I picked

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250 
to show all the supplies that I picked

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
up to use for the project because I

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.080 
up to use for the project because I
don't<00:00:25.560> normally<00:00:25.949> go<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.369> buy<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
supplies I need for a project for a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.609 
supplies I need for a project for a
witness<00:00:28.859> those<00:00:29.130> tutorial<00:00:29.699> i<00:00:29.880> usually<00:00:30.119> use

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
witness those tutorial i usually use

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.440 
witness those tutorial i usually use
most<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:31.949> i<00:00:31.980> already<00:00:32.250> own<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.270> this

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
most of what i already own and so this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.049 
most of what i already own and so this
is<00:00:33.510> kind<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.110> odd<00:00:34.680> occasion<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.730> i<00:00:35.790> did

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
is kind of a odd occasion that i did

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180 
is kind of a odd occasion that i did
pick<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.329> all<00:00:36.750> brand<00:00:37.170> new<00:00:37.290> supplies<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.160> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
pick up all brand new supplies and so I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.280 
pick up all brand new supplies and so I
thought<00:00:38.399> it'd<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.550> fun<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> whole<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.690> so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
thought it'd be fun to do a whole and so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.580 
thought it'd be fun to do a whole and so
I'll<00:00:40.530> get<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:40.829> into<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.540> first<00:00:42.960> two

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I'll get right into it the first two

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
I'll get right into it the first two
things<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.100> picked<00:00:44.340> up<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.730> were<00:00:44.850> kind

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
things that I picked up that were kind

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.319 
things that I picked up that were kind
of<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.079> determined<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> whole<00:00:47.129> look<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
of what determined the whole look of the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.770 
of what determined the whole look of the
project<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.350> fabric<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.340> chose<00:00:50.780> these

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
project is the fabric and I chose these

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.170 
project is the fabric and I chose these
two<00:00:52.199> right<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:52.550> here<00:00:53.550> hold<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.120> here

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
two right here here hold it right here

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.619 
two right here here hold it right here
um<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:55.320> chose<00:00:56.309> these<00:00:56.550> two<00:00:56.730> fabrics<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
um I chose these two fabrics this is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.139 
um I chose these two fabrics this is
going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.649> main<00:00:58.980> focus<00:00:59.399> pattern<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
going to be my main focus pattern and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.939 
going to be my main focus pattern and
then<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.809> complementary<00:01:01.530> pattern

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
then this is the complementary pattern

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.320 
then this is the complementary pattern
and<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> tell<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:05.060> matches<00:01:06.060> really

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and as you can tell it matches really

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.890 
and as you can tell it matches really
well<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> just

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
well with this right here and so I just

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.270 
well with this right here and so I just
think<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.920> fun<00:01:11.430> design<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.299> I

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
think this is a really fun design and I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.289 
think this is a really fun design and I
just<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:17.299> so

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
just really like the look of this so

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.999 
just really like the look of this so
that<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> fabric<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> will<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.860> in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that is the fabric that you will see in

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.609 
that is the fabric that you will see in
the<00:01:20.040> project<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.479> course<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.960> picked<00:01:22.350> up

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the project and so of course I picked up

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.469 
the project and so of course I picked up
coordinating<00:01:23.549> thread<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.689> then<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:26.640> needed<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
coordinating thread and then I needed a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
coordinating thread and then I needed a
kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> focus<00:01:28.439> button<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.400> project

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
kind of a focus button for this project

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.390 
kind of a focus button for this project
and<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> chose<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.229> button<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and so I chose this button right here it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.819 
and so I chose this button right here it
is<00:01:32.520> natural<00:01:33.030> wood<00:01:33.270> whoops<00:01:33.630> sorry<00:01:33.900> there's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
is natural wood whoops sorry there's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.700 
is natural wood whoops sorry there's
some<00:01:35.009> focus<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> natural<00:01:36.810> wood<00:01:37.290> button

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
some focus it is a natural wood button

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.390 
some focus it is a natural wood button
and<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.100> kind<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.700> rectangular<00:01:39.390> shape<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
and it's kind of a rectangular shape and

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.969 
and it's kind of a rectangular shape and
so<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.140> not<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> button<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.770> I've

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
so it is not like a button that I've

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
so it is not like a button that I've
ever<00:01:44.189> used<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.909> any<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.509> projects<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.229> it's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
ever used in any of my projects but it's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
ever used in any of my projects but it's
going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.369> awesome<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
going to be really awesome in this one I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.560 
going to be really awesome in this one I
also<00:01:49.350> picked<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.340> some<00:01:50.670> regular<00:01:50.880> black

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
also picked up just some regular black

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.370 
also picked up just some regular black
elastic<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:53.149> then<00:01:54.149> since<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> pelham

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
elastic and then since this is a pelham

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.109 
elastic and then since this is a pelham
project<00:01:55.890> i<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.280> using<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.759> pelin

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
