wherever they are now we're going to be

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.729 
wherever they are now we're going to be
showcasing<00:00:44.170> three<00:00:45.170> different<00:00:45.469> mobile

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
showcasing three different mobile

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.160 
showcasing three different mobile
applications<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:47.149> you<00:00:47.480> can<00:00:47.659> use<00:00:47.839> in<00:00:48.079> your

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
applications that you can use in your

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.009 
applications that you can use in your
enterprise<00:00:48.409> or<00:00:48.949> educational<00:00:49.719> institution<00:00:50.719> to

enterprise or educational institution to

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.319 
enterprise or educational institution to
enhance<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:51.409> productivity<00:00:51.559> or

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
enhance the productivity or

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.119 
enhance the productivity or
collaboration<00:00:53.329> of<00:00:53.449> your<00:00:53.870> employees<00:00:54.199> let's

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
collaboration of your employees let's

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.459 
collaboration of your employees let's
first<00:00:55.339> take<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.550> look<00:00:55.640> at<00:00:55.909> our<00:00:56.089> first<00:00:56.239> one<00:00:56.749> which

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
first take a look at our first one which

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.279 
first take a look at our first one which
is<00:00:57.499> B<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:57.949> C<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.569> use<00:00:59.690> case<00:00:59.929> for<00:00:59.960> this

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
is B and C so the use case for this

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.549 
is B and C so the use case for this
really<00:01:01.010> remotely<00:01:01.879> administrating<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.839> server

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
really remotely administrating a server

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.590 
really remotely administrating a server
or<00:01:03.949> another<00:01:04.550> computer<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.239> you<00:01:05.360> might<00:01:05.570> have

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
or another computer that you might have

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.840 
or another computer that you might have
in<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.200> cloud<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:07.310> first<00:01:07.550> we're<00:01:07.700> going<00:01:07.790> to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
in the cloud so first we're going to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.840 
in the cloud so first we're going to
take<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.060> look<00:01:08.270> at<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.979> network<00:01:09.979> diagram<00:01:10.520> I'm

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
take a look at a network diagram I'm

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.609 
take a look at a network diagram I'm
going<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.090> pull<00:01:11.270> up<00:01:11.360> cisco<00:01:11.750> network<00:01:12.079> assistant

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
going to pull up cisco network assistant

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.830 
going to pull up cisco network assistant
so<00:01:12.979> I<00:01:13.040> can<00:01:13.189> take<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.399> look<00:01:13.610> at<00:01:13.820> how<00:01:14.240> my<00:01:14.479> ports

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
so I can take a look at how my ports

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.959 
so I can take a look at how my ports
doing<00:01:15.110> on<00:01:15.229> my<00:01:15.380> network<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:15.920> every<00:01:16.490> link<00:01:16.759> light

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
doing on my network is every link light

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.149 
doing on my network is every link light
up<00:01:17.180> or<00:01:17.420> all<00:01:17.509> my<00:01:17.659> ports<00:01:18.049> actively<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.040> know

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
up or all my ports actively you know

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.029 
up or all my ports actively you know
communicating<00:01:19.729> with<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.270> end<00:01:20.539> devices<00:01:21.009> now<00:01:22.009> I

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
communicating with the end devices now I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.249 
communicating with the end devices now I
can<00:01:22.189> switch<00:01:22.399> over<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.850> my<00:01:23.180> network<00:01:23.390> diagram<00:01:24.020> I

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
can switch over to my network diagram I

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.990 
can switch over to my network diagram I
can<00:01:24.829> make<00:01:24.950> sure<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.280> each<00:01:25.399> individual

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
can make sure that each individual

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.120 
can make sure that each individual
switch<00:01:26.329> is<00:01:26.600> interconnected<00:01:27.170> back<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:27.860> the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
switch is interconnected back to the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.219 
switch is interconnected back to the
course<00:01:28.399> which<00:01:28.640> ensure<00:01:29.240> all<00:01:29.390> my<00:01:29.539> stack<00:01:29.810> links

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
course which ensure all my stack links

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.380 
course which ensure all my stack links
are<00:01:30.350> up<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.740> working<00:01:31.070> now<00:01:31.939> that<00:01:32.090> I've<00:01:32.180> checked

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
are up and working now that I've checked

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.480 
are up and working now that I've checked
out<00:01:32.539> my<00:01:32.689> network<00:01:33.020> infrastructure<00:01:33.560> let's

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
out my network infrastructure let's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.550 
out my network infrastructure let's
browse<00:01:34.729> over<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.299> my<00:01:35.509> virtual<00:01:35.780> infrastructure

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
browse over to my virtual infrastructure

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.279 
browse over to my virtual infrastructure
so<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:37.549> I'm<00:01:37.700> actually<00:01:37.880> opening<00:01:38.289> VMware

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
so now I'm actually opening VMware

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.139 
so now I'm actually opening VMware
infrastructure<00:01:39.530> client<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.640> I'm<00:01:40.759> taking<00:01:40.909> a

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
infrastructure client and I'm taking a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.630 
infrastructure client and I'm taking a
look<00:01:41.329> at<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.630> memory<00:01:41.899> usage<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.590> my<00:01:43.100> server

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
look at the memory usage of my server

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.639 
look at the memory usage of my server
you<00:01:44.180> can<00:01:44.210> see<00:01:44.509> actually<00:01:44.659> that's<00:01:45.320> starting<00:01:45.619> to

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
you can see actually that's starting to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.560 
you can see actually that's starting to
raise<00:01:45.920> over<00:01:46.250> time<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.030> might<00:01:47.210> want<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.479> take

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
raise over time so I might want to take

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.940 
raise over time so I might want to take
a<00:01:47.630> look<00:01:47.719> at<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.109> when<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.409> get<00:01:48.590> back<00:01:48.679> in<00:01:48.859> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
a look at that when I get back in the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.550 
a look at that when I get back in the
lab<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.490> really<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.479> application<00:01:50.990> here<00:01:51.259> being

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
lab so really the application here being

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.830 
lab so really the application here being
about<00:01:52.159> remote<00:01:52.460> computing<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.210> remote

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
about remote computing and remote

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.959 
about remote computing and remote
administration<00:01:54.280> so<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.369> can<00:01:55.520> access<00:01:55.729> your

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
administration so you can access your

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.039

resources<00:01:56.750> wherever<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.649> are<00:01:58.630> now<00:01:59.630> moving<00:01:59.780> on

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
resources wherever you are now moving on

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.109 
resources wherever you are now moving on
to<00:02:00.079> our<00:02:00.289> next<00:02:00.320> example<00:02:00.920> we<00:02:01.549> have<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.880> mobile

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
to our next example we have a mobile

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.359 
to our next example we have a mobile
video<00:02:02.600> application<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:03.829> here<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.039> am<00:02:04.130> going<00:02:04.249> to

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
video application so here I am going to

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.029 
video application so here I am going to
start<00:02:04.549> streaming<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.210> mobile<00:02:06.140> video<00:02:06.469> on<00:02:06.740> each

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
start streaming a mobile video on each

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.660 
start streaming a mobile video on each
of<00:02:07.249> these<00:02:07.340> iPads<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.920> now<00:02:09.920> it's<00:02:10.160> actively

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
of these iPads and now it's actively

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.509 
of these iPads and now it's actively
streaming<00:02:11.180> using<00:02:11.630> an<00:02:11.780> HTTP<00:02:12.590> protocol<00:02:13.099> so

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
streaming using an HTTP protocol so

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.369 
streaming using an HTTP protocol so
something<00:02:14.209> like<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.959> would<00:02:15.080> be<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
something like you would be the

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.150 
something like you would be the
downloading<00:02:15.980> of

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
downloading of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.520 
downloading of

switch over to a mobile presenter

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.170 
switch over to a mobile presenter
application<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.800> this<00:02:58.160> application<00:02:58.760> called

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
application so this application called

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.510 
application so this application called
mobile<00:02:59.420> presenter<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.220> on<00:03:01.370> my

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
mobile presenter and I have it on my

three<00:03:04.640> different<00:03:05.300> client<00:03:05.960> iPads<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:06.920> these

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
three different client iPads so these

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.820 
three different client iPads so these
would<00:03:07.220> be<00:03:07.370> examples<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:08.060> users<00:03:08.870> in<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.740> know
