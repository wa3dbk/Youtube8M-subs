 I recommend you always start with your feet 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.600
 so while drying your feet 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:50.010

 subsequently put colored enamel 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:11.340
 always two coats of color and finally use 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.600
 a top coat that goes to polish and a 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.810

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.100
 preventive always keep the cuticles well 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.770
 pushed with a special product for the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:44.600
 carefully your cuticles to that 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:47.489

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.380

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.709
 hands and feet at least wait 20 minutes 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.709
