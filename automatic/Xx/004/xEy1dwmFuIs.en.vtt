00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
against let's see I believe it was metal

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.720 
against let's see I believe it was metal
sonic<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.320> go<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.430> battle<00:00:17.670> is

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
sonic so here we go and the battle is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.400 
sonic so here we go and the battle is
going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> take<00:00:18.060> place<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:19.609> stage<00:00:20.609> 13<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.350> I

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
going to take place on stage 13 so I

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.089 
going to take place on stage 13 so I
hope<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.830> all<00:00:22.980> enjoy<00:00:23.310> folks<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.949> what

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
hope you all enjoy folks and for what

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.800 
hope you all enjoy folks and for what
I've<00:00:26.189> seen<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> metal<00:00:26.730> sonic<00:00:27.119> he's<00:00:27.420> impervious

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
I've seen a metal sonic he's impervious

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.750 
I've seen a metal sonic he's impervious
to<00:00:28.019> physical<00:00:28.560> attacks<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:29.310> Metal

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to physical attacks so I think Metal

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.130 
to physical attacks so I think Metal
Sonic<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> probably<00:00:30.449> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> win

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
Sonic is probably going to win

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.630 
Sonic is probably going to win
I<00:00:31.170> guess<00:00:31.560> blossom<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.070> only<00:00:32.219> damage<00:00:32.520> them

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I guess blossom can only damage them

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.959 
I guess blossom can only damage them
with<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> lasers<00:00:34.280> it's<00:00:35.280> pretty<00:00:35.550> much<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
with the lasers it's pretty much all of

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.830 
with the lasers it's pretty much all of
our<00:00:36.149> text<00:00:36.450> says<00:00:36.780> don't<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.260> anything<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:39.690> this

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
our text says don't do anything so this

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.240 
our text says don't do anything so this
isn't<00:00:40.020> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.350> much<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.770> fight<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
isn't going to be much of a fight and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.889 
isn't going to be much of a fight and
Watson<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.700> probably<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> lose<00:00:42.390> which

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
Watson is probably going to lose which

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.850 
Watson is probably going to lose which
is<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> make<00:00:43.440> me<00:00:43.590> sad<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:45.590> hope<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.739> get
