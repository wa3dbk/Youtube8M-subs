00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
in one life is certainly worthy of top

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.960 
in one life is certainly worthy of top
five<00:01:14.790> plays<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> don't<00:01:15.330> care<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.630> math<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.170> on

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
five plays I don't care what math is on

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.359 
five plays I don't care what math is on
number<00:01:17.970> three<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> X<00:01:18.869> Frank's<00:01:19.560> again<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
number three we have X Frank's again I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.830 
number three we have X Frank's again I
think<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> third<00:01:21.119> time<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.780> three

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
think this is the third time in three

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
think this is the third time in three
weeks<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.280> guy's<00:01:23.460> been<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.790> my<00:01:23.850> top

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
weeks that this guy's been in my top

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
weeks that this guy's been in my top
five<00:01:24.060> plays<00:01:24.479> he's<00:01:25.110> all<00:01:25.290> splints<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> modern

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
background he's also playing Brown

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.270 
background he's also playing Brown
working<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> match<00:01:31.200> he's<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.979> think<00:01:32.100> up

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
working that match he's gonna think up

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
working that match he's gonna think up
five<00:01:32.549> guys<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.240> he's<00:01:33.390> been<00:01:33.509> put<00:01:33.689> forward<00:01:33.990> them

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
five guys and he's been put forward them

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.440 
five guys and he's been put forward them
into<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> final<00:01:35.040> killcam<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.670> actually<00:01:36.180> never

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
into the final killcam I actually never

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.480 
into the final killcam I actually never
see<00:01:36.810> I've<00:01:36.990> never<00:01:37.110> seen<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.619> four-man<00:01:38.070> kill<00:01:38.280> cam

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
see I've never seen a four-man kill cam

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.819 
see I've never seen a four-man kill cam
before<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.079> I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.530> even<00:01:40.650> more

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
before and I think is even more

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.469 
before and I think is even more
impressive<00:01:41.040> than<00:01:41.340> ground<00:01:41.820> war<00:01:42.090> because
