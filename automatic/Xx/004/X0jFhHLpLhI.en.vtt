legs then you can actually opt for other
kinds<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.610> cardiovascular<00:02:21.540> exercises<00:02:22.080> like

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
kinds of cardiovascular exercises like

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.270 
kinds of cardiovascular exercises like
swimming<00:02:23.900> all<00:02:24.900> right<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.680> those<00:02:25.950> are<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
swimming all right so those are the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.059 
swimming all right so those are the
exercises<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:27.239> should<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.630> doing<00:02:28.020> but<00:02:28.650> even

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
exercises you should be doing but even

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.220 
exercises you should be doing but even
after<00:02:29.220> performing<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.940> exercises<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.080> will

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
after performing this exercises you will

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.140 
after performing this exercises you will
not<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.709> able<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.920> lose<00:02:32.099> your<00:02:32.340> belly<00:02:32.550> fat<00:02:32.670> if

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
whatever it is that you are taking it is

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.080 
whatever it is that you are taking it is
important<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.750> take<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.959> high-protein<00:02:40.709> diet

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
important to take a high-protein diet

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.000 
important to take a high-protein diet
well<00:02:42.090> there<00:02:42.330> are<00:02:42.390> two<00:02:42.630> main<00:02:43.140> reasons<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:43.620> this

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
well there are two main reasons for this

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.370 
well there are two main reasons for this
first<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:45.120> all<00:02:45.269> since<00:02:45.720> you'll<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.080> increasing

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
first of all since you'll be increasing

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.740 
first of all since you'll be increasing
the<00:02:46.860> intensity<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.489> our<00:02:47.580> exercises<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.510> need

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
the intensity of our exercises you need

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.610 
the intensity of our exercises you need
more<00:02:49.019> protein<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:50.600> supply<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:52.019> your<00:02:52.170> muscles

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
more protein to supply to your muscles

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.920 
more protein to supply to your muscles
so<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.400> they<00:02:53.640> will<00:02:53.790> repair<00:02:54.150> themselves<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
so that they will repair themselves and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.520 
so that they will repair themselves and
you<00:02:55.709> won't<00:02:56.000> fall<00:02:57.000> sick<00:02:57.239> easily<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.349> will

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
you won't fall sick easily and you will

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.300 
you won't fall sick easily and you will
also<00:02:58.680> not<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> few<00:02:59.519> saw<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.120> easily

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
also not a few saw so easily

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.440 
also not a few saw so easily
the<00:03:02.310> second<00:03:02.730> reason<00:03:02.880> for<00:03:03.060> taking<00:03:03.269> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
the second reason for taking a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.210 
the second reason for taking a
high-protein<00:03:03.930> diet<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:04.950> body

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
high-protein diet is that your body

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.809 
high-protein diet is that your body
actually<00:03:05.660> burns<00:03:06.660> more<00:03:07.140> calories<00:03:08.010> burns<00:03:08.580> more

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
actually burns more calories burns more

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.289 
actually burns more calories burns more
energy<00:03:09.650> when<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.769> tries<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.010> digest<00:03:11.610> protein

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
energy when it tries to digest protein

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.699 
energy when it tries to digest protein
versus<00:03:13.140> other<00:03:13.410> macro<00:03:14.330> nutrients<00:03:15.330> such<00:03:15.510> as

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
versus other macro nutrients such as

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.180 
versus other macro nutrients such as
carbohydrates<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.950> fats<00:03:18.440> next<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.560> all<00:03:19.739> you

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
carbohydrates and fats next of all you

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.410 
carbohydrates and fats next of all you
should<00:03:20.370> take<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.579> low<00:03:20.970> carbohydrate<00:03:21.570> diet<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
should take a low carbohydrate diet and

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.660 
should take a low carbohydrate diet and
because<00:03:24.420> when<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.930> take<00:03:25.140> too<00:03:25.410> much

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
because when you take too much

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.699 
because when you take too much
carbohydrate<00:03:26.810> alright<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:28.200> are<00:03:28.230> few

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
carbohydrate alright there are few

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.360 
carbohydrate alright there are few
things<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.220> does<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.670> your<00:03:29.760> body<00:03:30.980> first<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.190> all

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
things it does to your body first of all

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
when you take too much carbohydrates it

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.309 
when you take too much carbohydrates it
actually<00:03:35.280> causes<00:03:36.060> your<00:03:36.180> body<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.569> retain

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319
