with strong energy for thirty two or
three<00:04:21.930> songs<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.470> then<00:04:22.620> there<00:04:23.340> were

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
three songs and then there were

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.490 
three songs and then there were
technical<00:04:23.760> problems<00:04:24.360> on<00:04:24.510> stage<00:04:24.540> we<00:04:25.380> were

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
technical problems on stage we were

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.890 
technical problems on stage we were
struggling<00:04:25.860> with<00:04:26.220> feedback<00:04:26.630> broken<00:04:27.630> speaker

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
struggling with feedback broken speaker

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.140 
struggling with feedback broken speaker
and<00:04:28.230> balanced<00:04:28.590> on<00:04:28.770> stage<00:04:29.130> but<00:04:29.730> we<00:04:29.910> still

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
and balanced on stage but we still

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.820 
and balanced on stage but we still
managed<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.540> hold<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.020> energy<00:04:31.410> i<00:04:31.440> think<00:04:31.740> as

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.750 
managed to hold the energy i think as
best<00:04:32.040> we<00:04:32.130> could
