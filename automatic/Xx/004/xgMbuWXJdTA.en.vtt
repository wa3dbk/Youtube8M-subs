 manicure out by the way and gel polish yourself 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.559
 did hardware prepare nails to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.020

 fresher on already ready manicure then 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.809
 ultra bond

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.150
 ultra bond dried up put the base here our 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.549
 the main task is to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.200
 make the nail plate even for 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.360
 I will not paint this separately 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.939
 brush as usual and immediately this 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.670
 starting with the finger which will be 1 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.540
 I will go to them a thicker layer and on 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.700
 the rest stretching a thin layer 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.250
 base dried erase sticky layer 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.950
 a clinser before thermofilm application 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.170
 i must remove the adhesive layer i 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.060
 I will glue the thermal film not on all nails 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.220
 but I will wipe the sticky layer from all in order 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.900
 to make the color fit as smoothly as possible 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.730
 did not flow when spoke in 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.830
 previous video this procedure is not 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.020
 sure but i prefer to do 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.630
 just so especially when it comes to 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.820
 bright colors to begin to apply gel varnish 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.900
 on the nails do not paint on which 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.850
 there will be a film theme 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.400
 in this video we will not consider 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.180
 application technology I will leave a link to 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.250
 her under the video 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.360
 then you need to make the coating rough 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.460
 using buffy k 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.820
 to a rough surface the film is better 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.560
 stick and worn longer 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.390
 go to work bitch foil that 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.670
 then you say it is quite simple but 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.890
 need a little knack first 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.440
 pick up more or less suitable 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.390
 by size sticker it is very convenient so 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.000
 as the substrate is almost transparent 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.170
 then apply on not refresher cleaning 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.450
 dust and sebum 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.330
 and now I forgot to say a surprise 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.060
 first we will need a hair dryer or a lamp 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.310
 incandescent but ordinary household light 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.590
 which is in every house we heat 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.420
 selected style for 10 seconds bye 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.170
 he will not become soft and pliable 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.019
 I will tell and you watch the film 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 need to glue smoothing movements 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.440
 from cuticle to tip if needed 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.930
 additionally warm up to 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.150
 smooth her soft bubble or 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.340
 the orange stick will ease the tasks but 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.040
 By the way, you can and hands and me general 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.260
 approved 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.329
 like a finger on a napkin or a cotton pad and 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.390
 smoothes thermo foil over the surface 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.370
 we press the nail well if 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.950
 film you too big stick on 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.530
 nail and when you realize that she lay down 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.709
 How do you need to carefully cut off the excess 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.170
 then remove the excess film from the tip 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.780
 This is done file for natural 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.579
 nails need to move from top to bottom 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.549
 trying not to stay long on one 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.159
 place if you are not sure that the film 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.859
 well stuck it can be even one more time 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.629
 heat and push hard from everyone 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.010
 parties 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.590
 put likes like you design 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.480

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.329
 securely glued and free edge 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.760
 processed put top special attention 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.269
 We pay a tip by the way plyonochku 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.120
 overlap top two times it's important 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.549
 removes dispersion layer by cruiser 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.890
