00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.799
 you mean self-esteem yes, I am exactly 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:14.070
 used to saying about the other 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:18.119
 let the handsome mount and it 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.730
 is really just yes that's it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.130
 wanted to make clothes or how should you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.150
 to say that 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 Let's see what weighs in the first 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 I have a scratch-free market for us 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.890
 still do not have 18,000 today times 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.899
 luck, but 500 is not bad either 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:45.000
 we do not want to complain oh that 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:53.160
 by the way our hair salon 6 june 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.410
 sex herb ellis okay lisa lisa lisa a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.820
 read book great job i am then 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.330
 Let's go and let the gentlemen do it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.950
 homie fitting romy the match for 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.189
 Realists go or four hours though 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:18.200
 in the hairstyle it should probably take but 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.200
 now all had the one exclamation point 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.680
 what I wanted to do what we just did 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.080
 now noticed here with the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:32.390
 house that is relative to the house me 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.650
 wanted to turn and then sit down here 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.979
 that you could possibly miss everything 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.979
 can make 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.390
 of course more trash has to be done again 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.890
 to dispose 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.740
 and I know I'm going tomorrow he 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.159
 but I'm missing exactly 300 from myself 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.159
 I just want to build a house there 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.840
 that's not what village we look 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.110
 just that that looks clever too 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.850
 takes so long with the thing not so long 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.430
 and then it should be very neat 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.930
 of course the same is one 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.070
 bit incorporated here but i would 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.680
 say there is still a street here 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.160
 and then land again later 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.150
 buy and build something 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.310
 probably have, too, the dogs 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.050
 inside were so can sometimes look 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.970
 maybe once lucky that the bottom one 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.110
 here on this patch fits that 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.020
 would be cool because the robes in the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.120
 church is kind of a bit 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.470
 Well as optimal as you can say 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.080
 actually this mean shit from the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.800
 nuclear power plant the top money the bonner 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:52.800
 for all my garbage from the nuclear power plant 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:55.520
 to the nuclear power plant where he, so to speak 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.520
 belongs 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.420
 why something else 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:13.050
 the atmosphere at the nuclear power plant again 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.420
 Establish and trust 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.420
 the business of operations 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.970
 To uphold, I ask myself 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.580
 still somehow still something with 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.750
 is all reads start happening 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.510
 but we have completed the task 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.010
 That's why we do not want to 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.560
 complain that's the snake 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.630
 So as I said just under 1000 snakes 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:46.160
 we still make mistakes for the snakes 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.160
 poison syringe knows already access 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:04:10.260
 Do not want to get hid yet 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.630
 here is the secretary and there is one more 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.070
 Snake 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.510
 So as I said you can still see me 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.709
 For the ninth time I think there are those 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.930
 all the shit that could give me then 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.459
 a few 1 placed in the village and here 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.080
 Maybe then comes to the next 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.230
 stage could look 98 dollars that 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.530
 stadium, of course not enough being 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.460
 that would have been pretty cool too 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.630
 but so many donath not summer 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.560
 We are also so unlikely 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.560
 many snakes do not get more 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.510
 have to look what they are doing there 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.290
 Maybe that will happen 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.640
 not and that will show then if 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.710
 it is as far as we can still a 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.130
 I would complete a few bets now 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.400
 let's say all people are still sending 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:04.290
 a twelve-hour task that neither 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:08.700
 start again tomorrow morning 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.060
 can and then tomorrow evening again 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.970
 recording 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.590
 where we are with the rest of us 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:23.139
 and then hopefully the 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:31.330
 dogs racing track are still building us 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:34.419
 missing out of the game 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:39.460
 star was right around the area 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.830
 if then and dull goes to the church 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:49.260
 as always twelve hours long 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:51.430
 what the mayor klaus franz 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.560
 What is this jersey is I have 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.870
 not understood 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:01.470
 well be no matter a few lamps kraski 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.470
 perform things 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:13.090
 yes then we still have these two 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.950
 dominions of the core homer first one 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.100
 Church will definitely do that 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:22.600
 already like and skinner can its 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:26.919
 Halls monitor well in school 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:30.880
 at this point we must also 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:33.780
 two snakes would be at this point 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.150
 I say goodbye for a moment 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.100
 and we see again to the construction of the dogs 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.600
 race track a public and the hour 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.850
 until then had enough money together 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.919
 but here given that we have the 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.300
 and then we'll meet in the 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.300
 Follow job until then
