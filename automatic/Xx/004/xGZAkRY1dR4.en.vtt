00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.679 
actually no it's pretty much the same as
well<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.900> tiny<00:00:25.170> bit<00:00:25.609> larger<00:00:26.609> larger<00:00:27.269> space

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
well just a tiny bit larger larger space

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.929 
well just a tiny bit larger larger space
on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.380> samsung<00:00:28.680> galaxy<00:00:28.710> note<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.730> course

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
on the samsung galaxy note and of course

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.580 
on the samsung galaxy note and of course
this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> four<00:00:30.480> point<00:00:30.689> eight<00:00:30.810> inch<00:00:31.140> screen

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
this is a four point eight inch screen

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.240 
this is a four point eight inch screen
this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:33.110> 5.58<00:00:34.790> 5.5<00:00:35.790> inch<00:00:36.000> screen<00:00:36.329> story<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
this is a 5.58 5.5 inch screen story and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.639 
this is a 5.58 5.5 inch screen story and
there's<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> big<00:00:38.520> difference<00:00:38.700> between<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> two

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
there's a big difference between the two

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.119 
there's a big difference between the two
okay<00:00:40.790> putting<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.180> over<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.530> other<00:00:43.680> well

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
okay putting one over the other well

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.740 
okay putting one over the other well
this<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.489> basically<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.510> should<00:00:45.660> expect

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
this is basically what you should expect

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.250 
this is basically what you should expect
so<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.969> half<00:00:47.969> an<00:00:48.090> inch<00:00:48.239> extra<00:00:49.079> for

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so you have a half an inch extra for

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.340 
so you have a half an inch extra for
this<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.980> maybe<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.329> bit<00:00:51.780> more<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
this one and maybe a little bit more on

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.459 
this one and maybe a little bit more on
the<00:00:52.800> bottom<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.879> galaxy<00:00:54.329> note<00:00:54.510> which

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
makes it quite quite big sort of weight

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
makes it quite quite big sort of weight
i<00:01:00.090> attain<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> pretty<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> same<00:01:01.260> maybe<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
i attain it pretty much the same maybe a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.500 
i attain it pretty much the same maybe a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.520 
connector for both of them constantly
series<00:02:04.970> because<00:02:05.150> there's<00:02:05.510> not<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.080> much

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
series because there's not that much

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.430 
series because there's not that much
light<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.420> there's<00:02:08.420> our<00:02:08.660> micro<00:02:09.649> USB<00:02:10.070> port<00:02:10.520> and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
light and there's our micro USB port and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.410 
light and there's our micro USB port and
on<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:12.650> other<00:02:12.770> side<00:02:12.890> well<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.670> side<00:02:13.850> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
on this other side well this side the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.090 
on this other side well this side the
volume<00:02:14.720> rocker<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.170> they<00:02:15.380> basically<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.920> same

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
volume rocker so they basically the same

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.700 
volume rocker so they basically the same
both<00:02:16.640> have<00:02:16.990> metallic<00:02:17.990> edges<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.590> is

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
both have metallic edges so this is

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.560 
both have metallic edges so this is
methyl<00:02:19.100> it's<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.490> chrome<00:02:19.790> metal<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.360> is

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
methyl it's this chrome metal this is

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.020 
methyl it's this chrome metal this is
naturally<00:02:21.140> chrome<00:02:21.410> that's<00:02:22.010> for<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> back<00:02:22.460> you

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
naturally chrome that's for the back you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.550 
naturally chrome that's for the back you
can<00:02:23.060> see<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.450> boat<00:02:23.690> identical<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
can see that the boat identical have the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.620 
can see that the boat identical have the
dark<00:02:24.890> grey<00:02:25.160> versions<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.330> they<00:02:26.450> will

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
dark grey versions here and they will

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.450 
dark grey versions here and they will
catch<00:02:26.810> fingerprints<00:02:27.680> there<00:02:27.860> will<00:02:28.040> be<00:02:28.190> very

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
catch fingerprints there will be very

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.190 
catch fingerprints there will be very
visible<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.300> not<00:02:29.510> really<00:02:29.570> something

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
visible so it's not really something

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.290 
visible so it's not really something
that<00:02:30.470> good<00:02:30.860> well<00:02:31.459> in<00:02:31.670> terms<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.970> operating

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
that good well in terms of operating

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.580 
that good well in terms of operating
system<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.020> one<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.680> running<00:02:35.050> okay<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.410> this

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
system this one is running okay so this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.230 
system this one is running okay so this
one<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:36.980> running<00:02:37.340> your<00:02:37.550> ice<00:02:37.640> cream<00:02:37.850> sandwich

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
one is running your ice cream sandwich

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.480 
one is running your ice cream sandwich
well<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.020> one<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.410> running<00:02:39.800> jelly<00:02:40.070> bean<00:02:40.280> and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
well this one is running jelly bean and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.010 
well this one is running jelly bean and
let's<00:02:40.610> see<00:02:40.790> how<00:02:41.180> fast<00:02:41.360> how<00:02:41.690> was<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
let's see how fast how was the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.660 
let's see how fast how was the
difference<00:02:42.380> well

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
difference well

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.410 
difference well
maybe<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.410> see<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:47.420> basically

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
maybe we just see like this basically

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.390 
maybe we just see like this basically
pretty<00:02:48.810> much<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.110> same<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.739> jelly<00:02:49.980> bean<00:02:50.160> ice

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
pretty much the same so jelly bean ice

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.220 
pretty much the same so jelly bean ice
cream<00:02:50.430> sandwich<00:02:51.060> there<00:02:51.599> should<00:02:51.780> be<00:02:51.810> quite

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230

quite something quite cool probably
going<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.500> use<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.549> buy<00:03:35.730> one<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:36.060> this

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
going to use it if you buy one of this
