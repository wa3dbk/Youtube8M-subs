such that I can move these levers have

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.109 
such that I can move these levers have
basically<00:01:13.409> took<00:01:13.590> metal<00:01:13.979> handles<00:01:14.460> show<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
basically took metal handles show the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.429 
basically took metal handles show the
outside<00:01:15.450> here

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
outside here

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.810 
outside here
this<00:01:16.950> metal<00:01:17.159> handles<00:01:17.670> move<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.090> forth<00:01:19.820> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
this metal handles move that forth and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
this metal handles move that forth and
click<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> inside<00:01:21.719> I<00:01:22.110> move<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
click on the inside I move it to the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.240 
click on the inside I move it to the
left<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.549> opens<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> hole<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:25.020> air<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.470> move

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
left it opens up the hole for air I move

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
left it opens up the hole for air I move
it<00:01:26.399> back<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.149> closes<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> hole<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.649> I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
it back here and closes the hole so I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.319 
it back here and closes the hole so I
can<00:01:28.890> control<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> airflow<00:01:29.429> from<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> bottom

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
can control the airflow from the bottom

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.809 
can control the airflow from the bottom
that<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:34.009> it's<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.220> basically<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> pot

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
that way and it's just basically a pot

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.090
