00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello how about friends of the world my name 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.450
 it's juan francisco gigabit I'm an analyst 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.189
 of the Mazda brand and in this 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.160
 opportunity we are in the optician cancÃºn 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.630
 or in the route test of rules to 3 and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 in this opportunity I want to explain is 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.260
 something very important of the system of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.379
 connectivity that presents this new 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.379
 vehicle 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.890
 when he most thought about it 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.779
 in this connectivity system for not 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.090
 beyond offering all the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.760
 customer functionality 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.140
 the fundamental basic principle was 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.430
 develop the under a mind of 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.350
 security 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.380
 and in that sense develop a system 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.270
 which is very easy to use and apart very 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.030
 intuitive the user does not have to be 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.160
 spending hours reading a manual for 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.100
 understand it but simply with passing 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.910
 five minutes inside the car and using it 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.540
 to learn 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.660
 to take advantage of it and use it from 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.460
 best way to provide comfort and 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.830
 the time a driving environment a lot 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.870
 plus 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.660
 good the connectivity system of 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.980
 Mazda is based on two main 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.260
 equipment that is the 7 inch screen 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.290
 where all the information is displayed and 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.410
 apart we have the komander the control of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.810
 command of the screen by which the 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.330
 user can make or execute all the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.300
 functions provided by this system 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.490
 of connect and we start the car 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.610
 a main menu will appear with five 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.030
 modules of 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.110
 multimedia communication navigation 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.900
 applications and system settings 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.840
 when the car is stopped we can use 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.130
 this system through the screen that 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.110
 is here 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.509
 this che green then we can use the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.119
 screen the most comfortable way a lot 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.380
 faster entering each module and 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.539
 executing any function that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.259
 we want on the other hand we can also 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.450
 use it using the komander which is that 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.579
 is designed to be able to execute all 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.460
 the functions of the mazda connect when 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.930
 the car is moving 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.039
 then through the command we can 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.619
 nothing 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.469
 and move between all the modules and 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.180
 pressing the button we can execute the 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.420
 function that we want there will be a data 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.030
 funny thing is that has to be commander 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.640
 time 5 main buttons next to the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.280
 knob and each button is positioned 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.859
 a natural and smart way to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.650
 that when the user is driving and 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.329
 pass the helm hand to the commander to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.790
 execute some function of the screen 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.380
 is positioned a natural way and 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.810
 each button located on a finger 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.700
 from the hand of the pilot then in these 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.680
 buttons we have the main 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.050
 what is the home to return to the menu 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.900
 initial we have a button intended 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.450
 directly to multimedia one intended 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.379
 directly from navigation and through the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.280
 thumb 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.450
 we have the button to return 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.200
 through the cni that has 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.300
 the favorites button 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 we tighten what we have access to 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.239
 the entire list of station favorites 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.610
 radio contact phone that 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.230
 are favorite markets or destinations of 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.910
 navigation that also marked us 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.910
 we have marked as favorites 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.310
 how can you see right now 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.650
 if you were simulating an institution 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.220
 of driving and I want to move on to using the 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.950
 komander naturally the person what 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.080
 does it is recostar the arm in the part of 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.450
 here on the armrest 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.850
 and the hand falls naturally and 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.950
 intuitive directly on the komander 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.880
 to execute it in an easier way 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.670
 and sure another interesting point is that 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.900
 all this technology has been developed 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.600
 it will be useless to have all the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.370
 controls in the part of here and that the 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.990
 volume for example be positioned in 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.410
 the top part because it would be 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.370
 demanding an additional movement 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.590
 so what mazda has done is 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.050
 place the volume loss next 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.510
 of the command to go up and down the 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.910
 volume or otherwise power 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.280
 press it to silence the whole system 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.770
 audio with all this technology 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.840
 mazda connect mazda has not only been 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.090
 worried about being at the forefront and 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.220
 show the client that they are capable of 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.660
 develop technologies that 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.310
 allow greater connectivity with 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.310
 user but also what you searched 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.780
 combine this with a system that is 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.300
 totally safe but they usually use it and 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.610
 that ensures that driving a 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.130
 mazda in this case the new mazda3 be 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.620
 thought mainly so that the 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.310
 client or the pilot has finally a 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.310
 safe trip
