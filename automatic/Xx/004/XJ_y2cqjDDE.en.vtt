this<00:02:37.859> mascara<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.489> was<00:02:38.609> that<00:02:38.730> bad<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:39.239> though

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140

I'm<00:02:40.290> dumb<00:02:40.530> enough<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.920> go<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.189> try<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.430> again

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
I'm dumb enough to go and try it again

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.670 
I'm dumb enough to go and try it again
