things<00:03:53.310> from<00:03:53.580> whatever<00:03:53.760> they<00:03:54.090> had<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.540> know

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
things from whatever they had you know

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.090 
things from whatever they had you know
painting<00:03:55.080> on<00:03:55.200> roof<00:03:55.620> tins<00:03:56.010> or<00:03:57.950> using<00:03:58.950> whatever

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
painting on roof tins or using whatever

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.040 
painting on roof tins or using whatever
paint<00:03:59.520> they<00:03:59.700> had<00:03:59.910> whatever<00:04:00.150> materials<00:04:00.900> they

paint they had whatever materials they

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.580 
paint they had whatever materials they
had<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.520> was<00:04:03.360> very<00:04:03.450> inspired<00:04:03.900> by<00:04:04.050> that<00:04:04.410> and

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
had that I was very inspired by that and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.830 
had that I was very inspired by that and
that<00:04:04.709> freed<00:04:05.010> me<00:04:05.160> up<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.340> paint<00:04:05.700> on<00:04:05.880> surfaces

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
that freed me up to paint on surfaces

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.430 
that freed me up to paint on surfaces
like<00:04:06.870> reclaimed<00:04:07.470> wood<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:09.170> there's<00:04:10.170> not<00:04:10.410> a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
like reclaimed wood and there's not a

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.530 
like reclaimed wood and there's not a
lot<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.740> financial<00:04:11.010> investment<00:04:11.880> obviously<00:04:12.330> in

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
lot of financial investment obviously in

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.449 
lot of financial investment obviously in
in<00:04:12.810> painting<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.380> reclaimed<00:04:13.830> wood<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.430> that

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
in painting on reclaimed wood so that

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.199 
in painting on reclaimed wood so that
freed<00:04:14.970> me<00:04:15.150> up<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.350> experiment<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.500> lot<00:04:16.680> and

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
freed me up to experiment a lot and

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.090 
freed me up to experiment a lot and
that's<00:04:18.209> when<00:04:18.480> my<00:04:18.600> art<00:04:18.810> really<00:04:19.109> turned<00:04:19.560> fun

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
that's when my art really turned fun

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.120 
that's when my art really turned fun
bright<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.120> colorful<00:04:21.660> was<00:04:21.870> when<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.410> just<00:04:22.890> felt

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
bright and colorful was when I just felt

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.510 
bright and colorful was when I just felt
that<00:04:23.310> freedom<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.470> from<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.590> materials<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.400> go

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
that freedom in from the materials to go

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.310 
that freedom in from the materials to go
ahead<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:26.970> try<00:04:27.120> something<00:04:27.479> new<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.140> have

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
ahead and try something new and have

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.670 
ahead and try something new and have
some<00:04:28.560> fun<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.120> I<00:04:30.120> began<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.630> take<00:04:30.810> art<00:04:31.260> less

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
some fun and I began to take art less

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.330 
some fun and I began to take art less
seriously<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:33.300> took<00:04:34.290> it<00:04:34.530> seriously<00:04:35.100> but

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
seriously and I took it seriously but

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.640 
seriously and I took it seriously but
