we're<00:00:01.110> back<00:00:01.260> here<00:00:01.410> on<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.620> rail<00:00:01.770> board<00:00:01.979> loft

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
we're back here on the rail board loft

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.630 
we're back here on the rail board loft
and<00:00:02.580> this<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.360> lost<00:00:03.629> stealth<00:00:04.640> constructed

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
and this is the lost stealth constructed

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.099 
and this is the lost stealth constructed
in<00:00:05.759> two<00:00:05.910> different<00:00:06.210> types<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.569> fire<00:00:06.870> wire

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
in two different types of fire wire

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.100 
in two different types of fire wire
construction<00:00:07.890> right<00:00:08.550> here<00:00:08.820> we've<00:00:09.090> got<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.599> lot

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
construction right here we've got a lot

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.589 
construction right here we've got a lot
of<00:00:10.139> stealth<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.769> fire<00:00:11.550> wire<00:00:11.820> rapid<00:00:12.389> fire

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
of stealth in fire wire rapid fire

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.110 
of stealth in fire wire rapid fire
construction<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.759> law

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
construction and here we have the law

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.080 
construction and here we have the law
stealth<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.839> fire<00:00:16.109> wire<00:00:16.320> FST<00:00:17.090> construction

stealth and fire wire FST construction
talking<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.449> little<00:00:18.539> bit<00:00:18.690> about<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.080> shape<00:00:19.350> The

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
talking a little bit about the shape The

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.840 
talking a little bit about the shape The
Lost<00:00:20.220> stealth<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.480> mix<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.980> lost

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
Lost stealth is a mix up of a lost

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.060 
Lost stealth is a mix up of a lost
rocket<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.050> take<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> back<00:00:25.529> half<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
rocket if you take the back half of a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.730 
rocket if you take the back half of a
lost<00:00:26.310> rocket<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.480> then<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.470> front

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
lost rocket and then you on the front

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740 
lost rocket and then you on the front
half<00:00:28.949> match<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.090> high-performance

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
half match it up with a high-performance

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.120 
half match it up with a high-performance
short<00:00:30.990> board<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> come<00:00:31.769> up<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
short board then you come up with the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.670 
short board then you come up with the
law<00:00:32.279> stealth<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:34.260> wanted<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
law stealth and so what they wanted to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.860 
law stealth and so what they wanted to
do<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.010> wanted<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.730> same<00:00:36.059> flat

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
do is they wanted to have that same flat

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.810 
do is they wanted to have that same flat
entry<00:00:37.350> curve<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> front<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> board<00:00:38.730> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
entry curve in the front of the board to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
entry curve in the front of the board to
make<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> easy<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.540> catch<00:00:39.719> waves<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.350> easy<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
make it easy to catch waves and easy to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
make it easy to catch waves and easy to
glide<00:00:41.160> across<00:00:41.340> flat<00:00:42.180> sections<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.320> then

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
glide across flat sections but then

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.279 
glide across flat sections but then
match<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.430> rocket<00:00:44.969> tail<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.840> wide

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
match it with a rocket tail that's wide

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.380 
match it with a rocket tail that's wide
in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> back<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> has<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> lot<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.789> rocker<00:00:48.030> in

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
in the back and has a lot of rocker in

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
in the back and has a lot of rocker in
the<00:00:48.510> back<00:00:48.660> third<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> board<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.710> that's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the back third of the board and that's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.830 
the back third of the board and that's
how<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.789> came<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> stealth<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
how they came up with the stealth and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.130 
how they came up with the stealth and
the<00:00:52.260> stealth<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:53.059> just<00:00:54.059> gives<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> high

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the stealth is just gives you a high

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560 
the stealth is just gives you a high
performance<00:00:55.680> short<00:00:55.890> board<00:00:56.190> feel<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:57.360> more

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
performance short board feel just more

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.229 
performance short board feel just more
glide<00:00:57.899> across<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.469> flat<00:00:58.890> sections<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
glide across the flat sections and the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
glide across the flat sections and the
ability<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.020> rockered<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.649> wide<00:01:01.920> tail

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
ability with that rockered out wide tail

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.369 
ability with that rockered out wide tail

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to ride your back foot really far back

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
to ride your back foot really far back
on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> board<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.400> snap<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:06.600> hard

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
on the board and just snap really hard

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.230

bamboo<00:01:49.110> reinforces<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> deck<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.579> just

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
bamboo reinforces the deck and just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.690 
bamboo reinforces the deck and just
gives<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.270> bit<00:01:51.570> more<00:01:51.869> strength

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
gives it a little bit more strength

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.910 
gives it a little bit more strength
preventing<00:01:53.700> dents<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.360> dings<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> deck

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
preventing dents and dings on the deck

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.620 
preventing dents and dings on the deck
so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> rapid-fire<00:01:56.820> construction

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so that's the rapid-fire construction

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.410 
so that's the rapid-fire construction
the<00:01:58.140> FST<00:01:58.619> construction<00:01:59.549> goes<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.210> notch

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the FST construction goes one notch

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
the FST construction goes one notch
further<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> durability<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.219> starts

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
further with the durability it starts

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.469 
further with the durability it starts
out<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.390> lighter<00:02:04.200> foam<00:02:04.890> core<00:02:05.329> in<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
out with a lighter foam core in the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.850 
out with a lighter foam core in the
center<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> board<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
center of the board but then on the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740 
center of the board but then on the
outside<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:09.000> has<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> high<00:02:09.479> density

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
outside of that it has a high density

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.630 
outside of that it has a high density
foam<00:02:10.200> bottom

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
foam bottom

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.110 
foam bottom
then<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.790> high<00:02:11.970> density<00:02:12.180> foam<00:02:12.630> deck<00:02:13.080> with

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
then a high density foam deck with

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.350 
then a high density foam deck with
bamboo<00:02:15.120> rails<00:02:15.870> parabolic<00:02:16.709> rails<00:02:17.360> matching

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
bamboo rails parabolic rails matching

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.390 
bamboo rails parabolic rails matching
those<00:02:18.480> two<00:02:18.720> together<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.500> board<00:02:19.800> gives

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
those two together so this board gives

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.770 
those two together so this board gives
you<00:02:20.550> even<00:02:20.760> more<00:02:20.940> strength<00:02:21.680> both<00:02:23.630> breaking<00:02:24.630> or

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
you even more strength both breaking or

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.809 
you even more strength both breaking or
buckling<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.170> board<00:02:25.440> as<00:02:25.650> well<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.280> heel

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
buckling the board as well as heel

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.840 
buckling the board as well as heel
denting<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.500> more<00:02:28.980> durable<00:02:29.220> product

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
denting it just a more durable product

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.449 
denting it just a more durable product
and<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> FST<00:02:31.260> construction<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.280> got

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
and it's the FST construction so we got

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.760 
and it's the FST construction so we got
the<00:02:32.580> rapid<00:02:32.970> fire<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.200> FST

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
the rapid fire and the FST

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.800 
the rapid fire and the FST
both<00:02:35.400> being<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.700> fire<00:02:35.910> wire<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> shapes<00:02:36.630> of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
both being a fire wire in the shapes of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.410 
both being a fire wire in the shapes of
the<00:02:36.930> law<00:02:37.080> stealth
