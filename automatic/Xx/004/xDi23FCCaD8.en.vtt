what you're looking at here is a very

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.840 
what you're looking at here is a very
small<00:00:05.779> aquaponic<00:00:06.560> setup<00:00:06.799> that<00:00:07.100> I<00:00:07.160> put

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
small aquaponic setup that I put

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.660 
small aquaponic setup that I put
together<00:00:08.000> and<00:00:08.890> you<00:00:09.890> might<00:00:10.040> be<00:00:10.160> able<00:00:10.250> to<00:00:10.460> see

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
together and you might be able to see

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.220 
together and you might be able to see
the<00:00:10.880> little<00:00:11.750> baby

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
the little baby

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.060 
the little baby
guppy<00:00:12.620> fish<00:00:12.860> in<00:00:13.040> there<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:14.530> growing<00:00:15.530> fish<00:00:15.890> is

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
guppy fish in there and growing fish is

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.200 
guppy fish in there and growing fish is
called<00:00:16.449> aquaculture<00:00:17.449> and<00:00:18.910> when<00:00:19.910> you<00:00:20.000> grow

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
called aquaculture and when you grow

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.080 
called aquaculture and when you grow
plants<00:00:20.870> with<00:00:21.350> water<00:00:21.730> that's<00:00:22.730> called

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
plants with water that's called

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.400 
plants with water that's called
hydroponics

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
hydroponics

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.620 
hydroponics
we<00:00:24.650> put<00:00:24.890> it<00:00:24.980> together<00:00:25.100> you<00:00:25.640> got<00:00:25.700> aquaponics<00:00:26.450> I

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
we put it together you got aquaponics I

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.590 
we put it together you got aquaponics I
think<00:00:27.200> this<00:00:27.400> this<00:00:28.400> is<00:00:28.610> pretty<00:00:28.880> small<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:29.420> maybe

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
think this this is pretty small so maybe

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.870 
think this this is pretty small so maybe
we'll<00:00:29.690> call<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:29.960> micro<00:00:30.410> conic<00:00:30.830> but<00:00:31.640> here's

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
we'll call this micro conic but here's

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.700 
we'll call this micro conic but here's
how<00:00:32.090> I<00:00:32.119> built<00:00:32.899> it<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:33.999> took<00:00:34.999> some<00:00:35.149> tubing

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
how I built it I took some tubing

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.799 
how I built it I took some tubing
through<00:00:36.710> this<00:00:36.890> type<00:00:37.129> of<00:00:37.159> tubing<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.789> a<00:00:38.510> pump

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
through this type of tubing and a pump

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.569 
through this type of tubing and a pump
from<00:00:39.050> one<00:00:39.199> of<00:00:39.289> those<00:00:39.409> silly<00:00:39.920> desktops

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
from one of those silly desktops

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.229 
from one of those silly desktops
fountains<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.010> then<00:00:43.010> only<00:00:43.579> small<00:00:43.969> little

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
fountains and then only small little

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.360 
fountains and then only small little
tube<00:00:44.899> connectors<00:00:45.729> and<00:00:46.729> I<00:00:46.819> put<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:48.370> I

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
tube connectors and I put that in and I

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.369 
tube connectors and I put that in and I
had<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.210> stretch<00:00:50.479> this<00:00:50.690> him<00:00:50.929> a<00:00:50.989> little<00:00:51.199> bit<00:00:51.260> to

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
had to stretch this him a little bit to

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.439 
had to stretch this him a little bit to
get<00:00:51.469> it<00:00:51.620> on<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.829> pump<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.729> then<00:00:52.909> I<00:00:53.030> ran<00:00:53.239> my<00:00:53.389> to

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
get it on the pump but then I ran my to

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.959 
get it on the pump but then I ran my to
move<00:00:53.719> him<00:00:53.839> around<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.559> I<00:00:55.219> cut<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.429> hole<00:00:55.699> in<00:00:55.879> the

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
move him around and I cut a hole in the

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.389 
move him around and I cut a hole in the
pot<00:00:56.179> with<00:00:56.329> an<00:00:56.449> exacto<00:00:56.960> knife<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.409> then<00:00:58.190> on<00:00:58.309> the

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
pot with an exacto knife and then on the

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.479 
pot with an exacto knife and then on the
inside<00:00:58.519> I<00:00:59.239> put<00:01:00.079> a<00:01:00.109> little<00:01:00.440> ring<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.039> tubing

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
inside I put a little ring of the tubing

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.910 
inside I put a little ring of the tubing
over<00:01:01.729> top<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.839> that<00:01:02.899> connector<00:01:03.440> piece<00:01:03.909> so<00:01:04.909> that

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
over top of that connector piece so that

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.029 
over top of that connector piece so that
it<00:01:06.920> held<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:07.430> on<00:01:07.579> there<00:01:08.590> kind<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.680> like<00:01:09.829> some

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
it held it on there kind of like some

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.429 
it held it on there kind of like some
sort<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.369> washer<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.119> then<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.659> siliconed<00:01:12.229> it

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
sort of a washer and then I siliconed it

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.679 
sort of a washer and then I siliconed it
as<00:01:12.590> well<00:01:13.039> and<00:01:13.340> had<00:01:13.789> a<00:01:13.820> dinner<00:01:14.030> at<00:01:14.240> sort<00:01:14.509> of<00:01:14.570> an

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
as well and had a dinner at sort of an

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.359 
as well and had a dinner at sort of an
angle<00:01:14.810> my<00:01:15.409> thought<00:01:15.619> being<00:01:15.799> that<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.159> water

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
angle my thought being that the water

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.950 
angle my thought being that the water
might<00:01:16.610> somewhat<00:01:17.270> swirl<00:01:17.509> around<00:01:18.280> but<00:01:19.960> I've

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
might somewhat swirl around but I've

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.920 
might somewhat swirl around but I've
done<00:01:21.170> setups<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:21.680> this<00:01:21.950> on<00:01:22.159> a<00:01:22.539> tropical<00:01:23.539> fish

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
done setups like this on a tropical fish

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.679 
done setups like this on a tropical fish
tank<00:01:23.960> for<00:01:24.380> an<00:01:24.439> Oscar<00:01:24.799> fish<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:26.030> found<00:01:26.329> that

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
tank for an Oscar fish and I found that

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.789 
tank for an Oscar fish and I found that
this<00:01:27.649> is<00:01:27.859> some<00:01:28.100> red<00:01:28.729> chard<00:01:29.090> here<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:30.500> found

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
this is some red chard here and I found

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.709 
this is some red chard here and I found
that<00:01:32.320> if<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.469> water<00:01:33.679> is<00:01:33.829> over<00:01:34.070> 75<00:01:34.640> degrees<00:01:35.090> all

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
that if the water is over 75 degrees all

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.810 
that if the water is over 75 degrees all
your<00:01:36.109> cold<00:01:36.380> crops<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:37.009> leafy<00:01:37.369> greens<00:01:37.609> like

your cold crops the leafy greens like

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.060 
your cold crops the leafy greens like
that<00:01:38.090> will<00:01:38.359> die<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:39.469> other<00:01:39.590> thing<00:01:39.829> if<00:01:39.920> you're

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
that will die the other thing if you're

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.830 
that will die the other thing if you're
going<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.250> eat<00:01:40.280> them<00:01:40.579> you<00:01:41.090> can't<00:01:41.329> be<00:01:41.420> adding

like just diffuser feeder fish in the
bottom<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:01.969> don't<00:02:02.149> really<00:02:02.240> care<00:02:02.359> about<00:02:02.539> and
