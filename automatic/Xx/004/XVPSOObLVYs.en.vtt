I could just slide them all on and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380 
I could just slide them all on and
there'd<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.890> hanging<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> bucket<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
there and behind the gill plate over

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.209 
there and behind the gill plate over
here<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:57.229> pull<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.350> down<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.799> you'll<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.100> able

here and pull it down and you'll be able

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.260 
here and pull it down and you'll be able
to<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.899> that<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.829> crimp<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.399> basically<00:02:02.850> right

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to see that my crimp is basically right

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.219 
to see that my crimp is basically right
underneath<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:05.219> lower<00:02:05.399> jaw<00:02:05.779> all<00:02:06.779> right<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
underneath the lower jaw all right and

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.830 
underneath the lower jaw all right and
my<00:02:07.350> wires<00:02:07.590> sticking<00:02:07.950> out<00:02:08.130> down<00:02:08.569> what<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.600> like

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
my wires sticking out down what I like

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.040 
my wires sticking out down what I like
to<00:02:09.990> do<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.679> take<00:02:10.979> my<00:02:11.190> sewing<00:02:11.430> needle<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.020> put<00:02:13.020> a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
to do is take my sewing needle and put a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.960 
to do is take my sewing needle and put a
hole<00:02:13.290> through<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.950> upper<00:02:14.250> lip<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> lower

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
hole through the upper lip and the lower

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.080 
hole through the upper lip and the lower
lip<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:15.689> makes<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.080> lot<00:02:16.200> easier<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
lip and it just makes it a lot easier to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.330 
lip and it just makes it a lot easier to
pass<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.299> wire<00:02:18.510> through

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
pass the wire through

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.980 
pass the wire through
with<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.580> good<00:02:19.790> stiff<00:02:20.030> wire<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.480> can<00:02:20.600> pass<00:02:20.810> it

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
with a good stiff wire you can pass it

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.570 
with a good stiff wire you can pass it
through<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.410> makes<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.830> lot<00:02:21.980> easier<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.370> do

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
through this makes it a lot easier to do

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.880 
through this makes it a lot easier to do
it<00:02:22.610> I'm<00:02:23.600> going<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.810> try<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.050> do<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.380> facing<00:02:24.620> you

move this out of the way for now

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.840 
move this out of the way for now
and<00:03:03.440> we're<00:03:03.590> gonna<00:03:03.680> put<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.190> popper<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:04.730> I'm

end needle I'm gonna put it down inside
the<00:03:10.790> popper<00:03:11.209> like<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.600> I'm<00:03:11.810> going<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.050> pass

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the popper like that I'm going to pass

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.180 
the popper like that I'm going to pass
it<00:03:12.800> through<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:13.550> little<00:03:13.790> loop<00:03:14.030> right<00:03:14.300> here

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
it through this little loop right here

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.949 
it through this little loop right here
no<00:03:16.190> big<00:03:16.430> deal<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.970> then<00:03:17.450> I'm<00:03:17.569> going<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.750> pull

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
no big deal and then I'm going to pull

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.690 
no big deal and then I'm going to pull
it<00:03:19.900> through<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:24.019> covers<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.440> bait<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.489> the

it through so it covers the bait and the
loops<00:03:25.910> out<00:03:26.120> on<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.570> end<00:03:26.780> I'm<00:03:27.560> going<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.829> take

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
loops out on the end I'm going to take

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.229 
loops out on the end I'm going to take
my<00:03:28.190> hook<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.170> leader<00:03:30.790> pass<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:32.090> through

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
my hook on the leader pass it through

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.789 
my hook on the leader pass it through
the<00:03:32.420> loop<00:03:33.760> all<00:03:34.760> right<00:03:34.940> now<00:03:35.709> depending<00:03:36.709> upon

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
the loop all right now depending upon

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.110 
the loop all right now depending upon

can't get the grommets all you have to
do<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.120> make<00:03:56.329> your<00:03:56.510> loop<00:03:56.660> just<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:57.049> little

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
do is make your loop just a little

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.500 
do is make your loop just a little
smaller<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.760> will<00:03:58.910> hold<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.209> hook<00:03:59.359> on

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
smaller and that will hold the hook on

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.000 
smaller and that will hold the hook on
because<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.930> won't<00:04:00.109> be<00:04:00.230> able<00:04:00.350> to<00:04:00.470> get<00:04:00.590> past<00:04:00.799> the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
because it won't be able to get past the
