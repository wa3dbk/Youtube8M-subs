for<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.379> John<00:00:07.649> Deere<00:00:07.919> 825<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:09.269> was<00:00:09.929> glad<00:00:10.170> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
for the John Deere 825 I was glad to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.900 
for the John Deere 825 I was glad to
find<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.590> direct<00:00:10.889> replacement<00:00:11.250> since<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
find a direct replacement since it

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.820 
find a direct replacement since it
requires<00:00:12.269> no<00:00:12.599> alteration<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> factory

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
requires no alteration to the factory

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.220 
requires no alteration to the factory
air<00:00:14.070> box<00:00:14.099> which<00:00:14.880> means<00:00:15.179> less<00:00:15.480> mess<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.080> you

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
air box which means less mess for you

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.290 
air box which means less mess for you
will<00:00:17.190> also<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.640> walking<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.029> through<00:00:18.090> the

will also be walking you through the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.599 
will also be walking you through the
installation<00:00:18.690> process<00:00:19.230> later<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.369> stay

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
installation process later on so stay

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.029 
installation process later on so stay
tuned<00:00:20.880> let's<00:00:21.810> go<00:00:21.990> over<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> bench<00:00:22.560> take<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
tuned let's go over to the bench take a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.259 
tuned let's go over to the bench take a
look<00:00:23.960> here<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.590> factory<00:00:26.099> air<00:00:26.430> filter<00:00:26.910> unit

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
look here is the factory air filter unit

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.609 
look here is the factory air filter unit
that<00:00:27.539> comes<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> 825<00:00:29.039> eye<00:00:30.050> as<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.380> see

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that comes in the 825 eye as you can see

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.549 
that comes in the 825 eye as you can see
it's<00:00:32.160> pretty<00:00:32.640> dusty<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.540> we've<00:00:34.110> been<00:00:34.380> out

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it's pretty dusty and we've been out

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.420 
it's pretty dusty and we've been out
twice<00:00:34.829> with<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.430> unit<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:37.020> junk<00:00:37.440> but

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
twice with this unit it's not junk but

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.660 
twice with this unit it's not junk but
it's<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.300> reusable<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:41.280> say<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.610> not

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
it's not reusable and I say it's not

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's not reusable and I say it's not
junk<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.230> sort<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.800> in

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
junk because you can sort of see in

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.340 
junk because you can sort of see in
there<00:00:44.219> there's<00:00:44.610> no<00:00:44.879> visible<00:00:45.600> dust<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
there there's no visible dust on the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.010 
there there's no visible dust on the
rubber<00:00:46.559> inside<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.239> means<00:00:48.809> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
rubber inside so that means it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.260 
rubber inside so that means it's
filtering<00:00:49.410> pretty<00:00:49.800> well<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> quite

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
filtering pretty well but it is quite

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.220 
filtering pretty well but it is quite
restrictive<00:00:53.180> we're<00:00:54.180> swapping<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.899> for

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
restrictive we're swapping it out for

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.650 
restrictive we're swapping it out for
this<00:00:55.440> unit<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.730> K&amp;N<00:00:57.360> direct

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this unit this is the K&amp;N direct

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.920 
this unit this is the K&amp;N direct
replacement<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> 825<00:00:59.280> eye<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.940> it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
replacement for the 825 eye and it's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.219 
replacement for the 825 eye and it's
much<00:01:01.289> less<00:01:01.500> restrictive<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.809> reusable<00:01:03.809> which

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
much less restrictive and reusable which

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.429 
much less restrictive and reusable which
is<00:01:04.500> main<00:01:05.129> benefit<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:07.229> feel<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
is main benefit of it I can feel a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.039 
is main benefit of it I can feel a
little<00:01:07.770> more<00:01:08.040> hump<00:01:08.510> using<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.630> air<00:01:09.869> filter

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
little more hump using this air filter

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.190 
little more hump using this air filter
but<00:01:10.939> mmm<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.119> probably<00:01:12.659> wouldn't<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:12.960> worth

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
but mmm it probably wouldn't be worth

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.620 
but mmm it probably wouldn't be worth
buying<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> power<00:01:14.850> increase<00:01:16.520> it's

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
buying just for the power increase it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.450 
buying just for the power increase it's
very<00:01:18.630> similar<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.439> stock<00:01:19.680> unit<00:01:20.130> same

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
very similar to the stock unit same

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.210 
very similar to the stock unit same
design<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.659> use<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:22.110> stock<00:01:22.439> air<00:01:22.680> box<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
design you use your stock air box and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.140 
design you use your stock air box and
nothing<00:01:23.790> changes<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.090> said

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
nothing changes there but like I said

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.260 
nothing changes there but like I said
before<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.659> reusable<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:29.060> that's<00:01:30.060> what

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
before it's reusable so that's what

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.230 
before it's reusable so that's what
we're<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:32.280> switch<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> unit<00:01:32.790> out

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
we're going with to switch the unit out

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
we're going with to switch the unit out
couldn't<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.780> easier<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.700> simply<00:01:35.700> flip<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
couldn't be easier you simply flip the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.870 
couldn't be easier you simply flip the
seat<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.619> are<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:37.979> latches<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
seat up and there are two latches on the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.440 
seat up and there are two latches on the
breather<00:01:39.360> lid<00:01:40.369> undo<00:01:41.369> those<00:01:41.610> pull<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> off
