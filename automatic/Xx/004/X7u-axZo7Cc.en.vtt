00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.760
 the pure paper thinks I'm going to forgive 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.300
 I will not leave any worm with 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.300
 life 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.599
 How dare they will not forgive you? 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.190
 I think you'd better calm down the killer. 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.770
 releasing you probably killed people 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.559
 innocent one after another 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.559
 I'd rather kill the wildcard. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.200
 is talking about me and defeating 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.040
 I'm finished 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.720
 Ai I already understood everything I said 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:23.340
 It was true that my father 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:28.960
 transformed into the legendary supersena dinho 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.009
 Who do you think money is better to kiss? 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.869
 I told you then you will never win. 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.030
 I see that you can destroy the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.030
 whole planet but not a certain person 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:50.440
 but who are you think you already know 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:53.020
 it is time to end this fight I 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.539
 I will show you that you can not win if 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:02.140
 to use the 100 percent of all my 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:03.850
 doorman, please let me know that I am 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.319
 waiting all this time because 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:13.329
 I want to beat it when you're using it. 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:15.400
 its maximum power'm ready 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:19.720
 I finally got my power over 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.739
 Sure we do not have any more time. Let's go. 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.910
 Get it over with. You're done. 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.690
 impatient is super saiyajin is 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.810
 right 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.130
 So I told you and I give you if I did 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.130
 that earthling 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:45.550
 those who miss future speaking capital 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.550
 kurin goal is talking about affection 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.840
 stop talking nonsense and get ready 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.840
 to die 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.740
 Hey 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.860
 You will die 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.010
 i 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.990
 I said 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:42.599
 but what did you mean by this? 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.829
 by the fact that he used 100% of his power 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.829
 be what is fading 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:53.129
 then there is no more reason for me 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:55.859
 keep fighting you I'm already 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.599
 satisfied and of his pride only 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.540
 ashes 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.609
 and all this happened because it appeared 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.780
 someone stronger than you expected 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:11.760
 and worst of all, it's about 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:16.979
 a website does not make sense to end you 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:24.830
 I'm afraid I'd rather let it live. 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:24.830
 With this disgust forever I said that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.699
 I do not want to leave because I 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.699
 I do not intend 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.590
 You're a real jerk. 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.330
 I tried one last chance and you did not 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.280
 took advantage 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.830
 I will come back to earth think 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.750
 I'll get back here and now you will. 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.100
 have the same fate of this plan 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.100
 those of my brothers 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:05.210
 in this planet country because it gives where it thinks 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:07.400
 What will happen, what happened to you? 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.650
 never survive from space 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.650
 the only thing that can wait and death 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:22.090
 The winner of this fight is going to die and I 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.090
 I will survive 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:29.740
 I'm stronger the universe 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:31.689
 so if there is miserable 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.889
 You have to die in my hands. 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.889
 whatever the cost 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:51.740
 I'll kill you anyway. 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.740
 oh so disgusting 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:18.879
 ah ah ah you only think of yourself hurry
