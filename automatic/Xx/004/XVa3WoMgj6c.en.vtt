just<00:00:42.590> like<00:00:42.890> anniversa<00:00:43.489> camera<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:44.390> actually

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
just like anniversa camera you actually

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.600 
just like anniversa camera you actually
get<00:00:44.809> tally<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.379> talkback<00:00:46.010> built<00:00:46.280> into<00:00:46.519> this

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
get tally and talkback built into this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.070 
get tally and talkback built into this
camera<00:00:46.820> if<00:00:47.000> I<00:00:47.059> swing<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:47.390> around<00:00:47.479> here<00:00:47.839> you<00:00:47.930> can

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
camera if I swing it around here you can

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.560 
camera if I swing it around here you can
see<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.830> options<00:00:49.220> for<00:00:49.280> XLR<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.330> have<00:00:50.420> your

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
see the options for XLR you have your

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.810 
see the options for XLR you have your
mic<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.110> put<00:00:51.500> headphones<00:00:52.040> so<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:52.489> can<00:00:52.640> do<00:00:52.729> the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
mic and put headphones so you can do the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.880 
mic and put headphones so you can do the
robust<00:00:53.210> aviation<00:00:53.930> sell<00:00:54.199> headsets<00:00:54.650> for<00:00:54.800> the

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
robust aviation sell headsets for the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.560 
robust aviation sell headsets for the
talkback<00:00:55.309> on<00:00:55.550> there<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.239> have<00:00:56.330> link

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
talkback on there and you have link

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.329 
talkback on there and you have link
control<00:00:56.900> so<00:00:57.199> if<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.409> have<00:00:57.559> electronic<00:00:57.949> lens

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
control so if you have electronic lens

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.490 
control so if you have electronic lens
you<00:00:58.519> can<00:00:58.699> go<00:00:58.940> in<00:00:59.089> and<00:00:59.210> control<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.930> focus<00:01:00.140> and

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
you can go in and control the focus and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.649 
you can go in and control the focus and
iris<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:00.979> things<00:01:01.159> like<00:01:01.309> that<00:01:01.659> swinging

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
iris and things like that swinging

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:03.820 
iris and things like that swinging
around<00:01:02.809> here<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:03.140> other<00:01:03.199> side<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:03.769> you

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
around here on the other side and you

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.490 
around here on the other side and you
can<00:01:03.979> see<00:01:04.129> we<00:01:04.280> have<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.449> power<00:01:05.630> 12<00:01:06.140> volt<00:01:06.350> power

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
can see we have the power 12 volt power

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.890 
can see we have the power 12 volt power
coming<00:01:06.950> on<00:01:07.070> optical<00:01:07.640> fiber<00:01:07.940> so<00:01:08.270> there's<00:01:08.720> no

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
coming on optical fiber so there's no

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.539 
coming on optical fiber so there's no
recording<00:01:09.440> mechanism<00:01:09.590> in<00:01:10.100> here<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.400> is

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
recording mechanism in here this is

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.969 
recording mechanism in here this is
really<00:01:10.850> made<00:01:11.390> as<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.570> live<00:01:11.930> camera<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.830> go<00:01:12.920> to

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
really made as a live camera to go to

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.490 
really made as a live camera to go to
our<00:01:13.130> ATM<00:01:13.400> switchers<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:14.659> can<00:01:14.780> go<00:01:14.869> out<00:01:14.900> SDI

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
our ATM switchers and you can go out SDI

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.910 
our ATM switchers and you can go out SDI
as<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.360> CIN<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.720> can<00:01:17.810> go<00:01:17.930> multiple<00:01:18.530> cameras

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
as a CIN so you can go multiple cameras

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.170 
as a CIN so you can go multiple cameras
on<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.460> then<00:01:19.550> of<00:01:19.640> course<00:01:19.670> your<00:01:19.940> gym

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
on this and then of course your gym

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.000 
on this and then of course your gym
locker<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.990> great<00:01:21.200> thing<00:01:21.410> about<00:01:21.440> this<00:01:21.800> is

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
locker the great thing about this is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.610 
locker the great thing about this is
there's<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.340> camera<00:01:22.820> control<00:01:23.180> software<00:01:23.660> the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
there's a camera control software the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.860 
there's a camera control software the
ATM<00:01:24.950> switchers<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.090> get<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.360> color<00:01:26.540> wheel

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
ATM switchers so you get the color wheel

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.300 
ATM switchers so you get the color wheel
and<00:01:27.080> you<00:01:27.200> can<00:01:27.350> actually<00:01:27.650> do<00:01:27.770> live<00:01:28.010> color

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and you can actually do live color

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.340 
and you can actually do live color
grading<00:01:28.760> on<00:01:28.910> this<00:01:29.180> camera<00:01:29.570> as<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:29.960> go<00:01:30.140> through

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
grading on this camera as you go through

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.260 
grading on this camera as you go through
and<00:01:30.500> shoot<00:01:30.710> does<00:01:31.490> have<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.700> time<00:01:31.880> built-in

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
and shoot does have a time built-in

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.420 
and shoot does have a time built-in
power<00:01:32.660> supply<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.140> that<00:01:33.410> only<00:01:33.530> external

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
power supply is that only external

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.920 
power supply is that only external
panels<00:01:34.670> have<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.060> does<00:01:35.300> have<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.450> four<00:01:35.750> hour

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
panels have it does have a four hour

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.870 
panels have it does have a four hour
