00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.960
 save company galley is easy 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.540
 today at this opportunity here is had a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.210
 friend on the channel who asked me a question 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.920
 respect of the ECU showed electron 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.720
 cars 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 I 'm not having this opportunity here. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 do not make the video and enjoy show 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:36.000
 It 's for everyone and this guy is too. 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.530
 a 2011 siena 2011 model then is was 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 tempted about the centralina 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.829
 central station location 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 as I told him that if I have to 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.039
 opportunity to make the video is the case 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 from fitch 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.440
 usually depends a lot on the year and model 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.500
 the fuse box where the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.489
 in some models that it does not 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.789
 strip inside the house including models 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.420
 that it was a larger yellow relay 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.590
 it's up to older models and fitch 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.530
 that it is under the seat of the engine 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.890
 this is here it was below the column here 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.979
 O 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 there you have to pull up to the carpet but 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.020
 yes older cars 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.420
 this car but we usually are her or her 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.470
 built into the house including 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 model of me fuse younger model 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.020
 or it is a yellow relay 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.100
 now in this particular case is a 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.380
 Also, she is but she is like this. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 It's not that you do not get as exposed as 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.869
 here in the empty bin is 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.780
 You're dropping here. 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.270
 this compartment below finish 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.780
 here below the steering column here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.490
 are three screws that you will return to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.460
 have access to it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.329
 so it is located here 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.880
 is together with it is a timer relay 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:11.220
 also the windshield wiper 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.349
 she has identification and she is also 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.220
 remedy and it is the central 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.380
 trauma as it is home to problem 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.330
 only in electrical locks to identify 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.670
 that the central locking device you 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.310
 can replace it but you will use 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.230
 only the wiring is not 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.360
 You'll turn off the wiring coming in 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.480
 inside the module of the original ECU 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.260
 and use the wiring out because it does not 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.370
 can be turned off that she has here in 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.980
 al taken xvii the relay action of no 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.299
 wiper timer wiper 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:56.890
 so her children can not identify 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:58.599
 here in white ac river but points 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.860
 negative signals from the micro 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:06.540
 key in the lock the blue with stripe 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.660
 white but also unlock pulse 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:17.049
 the micro key is this black wire here 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:21.760
 negative on a white river with a 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:25.200
 black stripe z 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.200
 plus a black list in it 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.989
 this white with black stripe is the 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.690
 positive 12 volts 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:39.489
 there we have a gray with the white list 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:43.030
 Thicker motor wire in the latch 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.150
 and the yellow wire that is also 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.950
 other motor in reversing current 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.120
 so if your surrogate is her 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.269
 is defective 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.230
 she gets stuck here then I advise that 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.970
 No, do not take a whistle, you will not get her. 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.069
 replacement will only be 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.049
 the wiring here 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.840
 the other children you will not even 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.920
 another socket connected to the relay 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.290
 timer 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.579
 we just the action which can be 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.720
 placing a central one on the outside and up to 110 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:19.690
 of the pose tron ​​other models from gc 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.419
 then it accepts any central n 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.510
 to lock the letter will seize the 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.720
 spinning engine case is down 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.910
 proofs and lessa has been perfect beauty and 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.720
 Galletti just on the opportunity here to 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.720
 show because it is an ECU that right 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.210
 sometimes the person does not even know what it is 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.570
 difficult to identify the tax authorities as 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.570
 I said do not comment it on by a friend at 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.120
 People do not have a photo like that but they do not 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.430
 managed to tell me correctly 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.680
 but as he said he could not find 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.080
 fuse box was not built into the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.380
 box even then most likely 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.800
 it would be that same thing in getting 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.870
 had a problem with the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.130
 make the video is to show and 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.419
 to share with the people there is the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.900
 central locking is model siena 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.490
 2011 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:22.450
 some parents also comes out then here is 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.800
 today's tip people to pass on to 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.160
 guys and beauty 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.169
 so I'll stick around and thank you more 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.060
 once everyone is not into our 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.700
 videos will all share our 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.889
 videos 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.200
 I continued to subscribe to our channel. 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.590
 This is where the company is easily hurt. 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.960
 moral and pay it strong installers 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.960
 hug and until the next video was worth
