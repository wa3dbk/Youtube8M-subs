a<00:04:18.739> change<00:04:19.040> just<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.580> little<00:04:20.060> bit<00:04:20.180> of

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
a change just a little bit of

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.770 
a change just a little bit of
customization<00:04:20.690> right<00:04:21.200> now<00:04:21.380> not<00:04:21.769> not<00:04:22.400> much<00:04:22.780> not

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
customization right now not not much not

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.110 
customization right now not not much not
much<00:04:23.890> but<00:04:24.890> this<00:04:25.099> thing<00:04:25.310> has<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.610> lot<00:04:26.090> of

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
much but this thing has a lot of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.830 
much but this thing has a lot of
potential

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
potential

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.129 
potential
and<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.800> think<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.400> will<00:04:28.639> make<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.300> very<00:04:29.900> nice

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
and I think it will make a very nice

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.710 
and I think it will make a very nice
launcher<00:04:30.620> replacement<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:32.060> think<00:04:32.570> there's
