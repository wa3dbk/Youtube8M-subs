00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello welcome to disabled 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.259
 barrier-free We are in Karlsruhe 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.080
 the reha 2015 and the company sunrise 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.019
 For the first time, medical presents the first 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.269
 Snow and recumbent wheelchair in front but 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.139
 something very special where I myself still 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.170
 never seen 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.930
 first hello hello christ i if 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.529
 first question how seitz on the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.519
 idea got the couch wheelchair 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.349
 to bring the market 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.420
 we came up with the idea stand 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.820
 lying wheelchair to make out of the ground 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 many will ask for ours 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.730
 existing portfolio lies function 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.010
 or negative seat payment function and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.170
 At the time, the company was considering functioning 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.320
 chair where I stand by from the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.660
 lie down sit transfer positions 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.329
 can adjust individually and that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.129
 Whole even without software I have now 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.500
 of course, in advance a lot 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.539
 learn what the chancellor was rushing to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 huge because that's what the world has to offer 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.469
 really use of the tax 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.210
 unit of programming we 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 start from scratch because here there is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.140
 really many highlights 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.119
 why does he have six wheels as six wheels 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.790
 For the reason that he has on everyone 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.890
 uneven also at the sidewalk or too 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.140
 in order to increase bye bye inclinations 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.409
 so that he always has six wheelbases and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.780
 This also ensures stable stability 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.610
 due to the wheel drive with the stop 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 incredibly agile is optimal for him 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.939
 and also very easy for outdoor use 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.970
 and also intuitively controllable twice 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.470
 that also means that the chair 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.810
 can arise once over keystroke 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 or as a memory function looks like us 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 it's easy to know from the cars 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.440
 press a button and click on the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.330
 drive end position 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.670
 the hammer really a joystick 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.730
 a power wheelchair a job 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.040
 But he has a wheelchair recliner 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.450
 The driver has three 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.910
 control unit with which you really because 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.880
 can move and programmer I can 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.190
 yes keys due to the tour driver 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.850
 function which is patented on our part 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.560
 I can chair any function infrared 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.899
 six functions radio commands 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.940
 automatically arrange on keys ever 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.190
 After where a customer's mobility it 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.080
 is in progressive disease it is 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.420
 unfortunately, so at the beginning even more normal 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.820
 hand gesture there is also the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.830
 operating buttons are normally printable 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.140
 and then it comes after the run of the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.850
 time always through mobility issues he 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.370
 can always interpret so far he always has 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.560
 the power to Japanese chair of 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.390
 adjust the console to one 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.790
 switch box has the lighter button 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.380
 then i can verdi these cups at it 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.140
 This position can always be pressed because 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.030
 it is as far as I can give him even 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.160
 the so-called body buttons to the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.470
 make head restraints as above left 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.660
 and right or also on elbows 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.600
 or knee or wherever it 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.110
 I can do all these types of seating 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.860
 lie down or something in it 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.020
 assuan ware keys function so if 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.459
 that's really great 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.459
