00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
this is a definite thrust down from the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.840 
this is a definite thrust down from the

the weight over to the front left foot
directly<00:02:00.450> applying<00:02:01.850> okay

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.250 

all<00:02:06.460> right<00:02:06.870> in<00:02:07.870> this<00:02:08.020> way<00:02:08.229> we're<00:02:08.530> using<00:02:08.830> our

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
all right in this way we're using our

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.990 
all right in this way we're using our
bodyweight<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.760> assist<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.260> process

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
bodyweight to assist in in the process

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840 
bodyweight to assist in in the process
so<00:02:16.000> it's<00:02:16.150> not<00:02:16.270> all<00:02:16.420> just<00:02:17.490> I'm<00:02:18.490> not<00:02:18.670> actually

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
so it's not all just I'm not actually

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.960 
so it's not all just I'm not actually
exerting<00:02:19.330> very<00:02:19.690> much<00:02:19.870> pressure<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.970> now

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
exerting very much pressure to do it now

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.940 
exerting very much pressure to do it now
you<00:02:22.000> can<00:02:22.240> see<00:02:23.250> what<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.430> doing<00:02:25.950> is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
you can see what this is doing is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.790 
you can see what this is doing is
creating<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.790> spiral<00:02:28.420> effect<00:02:28.540> because<00:02:29.140> this

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
creating this spiral effect because this

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.940 
creating this spiral effect because this
here<00:02:30.280> where<00:02:30.670> my<00:02:30.910> hands<00:02:31.390> are<00:02:31.440> clamped<00:02:32.440> onto<00:02:32.650> it

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
here where my hands are clamped onto it

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.110 
here where my hands are clamped onto it
like<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:35.290> round<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.120> this

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
like that is going round like this this

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.160 
like that is going round like this this
is<00:02:37.300> like<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.480> sort<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:39.390> where<00:02:40.390> Spanish<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:40.989> call

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
is like a sort of where Spanish we call

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.380 
is like a sort of where Spanish we call
it<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.350> Molina<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.850> twisting

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390

here so the plays feeding in from
underneath<00:02:46.870> here<00:02:47.380> into<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.489> this<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.120> like

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
underneath here into this this is like

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.540 
underneath here into this this is like
the<00:02:49.420> machine<00:02:49.810> here<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.410> section<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.370> it's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
the machine here this section and it's

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.800 
the machine here this section and it's
being<00:02:51.790> compressed<00:02:52.600> here<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.440> see<00:02:54.750> each<00:02:55.750> time

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
being compressed here you see each time

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.800 
being compressed here you see each time
you<00:02:56.170> do<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.560> another<00:02:57.130> fold<00:02:57.550> comes<00:02:58.300> over<00:02:58.660> like

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
you do it another fold comes over like

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:10.970 
you do it another fold comes over like
this<00:02:59.220> okay<00:03:06.120> okay<00:03:08.430> now<00:03:09.430> on<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.580> underside<00:03:10.209> of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
this okay okay now on the underside of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.259 
this okay okay now on the underside of
that<00:03:12.150> it's<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:15.010> pivoting<00:03:15.670> here<00:03:15.940> on<00:03:16.090> this

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
that it's it's pivoting here on this

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.870 
that it's it's pivoting here on this
corner<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.799> being<00:03:18.040> pushed<00:03:18.340> down<00:03:18.489> and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
corner so it's being pushed down and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.820 
corner so it's being pushed down and
they've<00:03:19.060> been<00:03:19.269> brought<00:03:19.510> back<00:03:19.930> up<00:03:20.170> onto<00:03:20.620> that

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
they've been brought back up onto that

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.759 
they've been brought back up onto that
on<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.580> its<00:03:21.700> base<00:03:21.910> there<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.900> then<00:03:23.290> push<00:03:23.739> down

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
on to its base there and then push down

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.850 
on to its base there and then push down
again<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:25.420> then<00:03:25.540> back<00:03:25.720> up<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.959> push<00:03:26.560> down

again and then back up and push down

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:37.670 
again and then back up and push down
again<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:32.470> not<00:03:32.620> easy<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.870> start<00:03:35.140> with<00:03:36.090> and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
again it's not easy to start with and

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.960 
again it's not easy to start with and
one<00:03:38.680> thing<00:03:38.890> we<00:03:39.010> notice<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.430> start<00:03:39.700> with<00:03:39.820> is

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
one thing we notice to start with is

tendency for the clay to stick to it
which<00:04:31.060> sometimes<00:04:31.480> is<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.630> bit<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.930> nuisance
