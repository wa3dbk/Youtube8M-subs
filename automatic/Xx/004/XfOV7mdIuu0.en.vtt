00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
speed three and I'm just gonna go up

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.259 
speed three and I'm just gonna go up
underneath<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.260> car<00:00:10.469> here<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.250> we're<00:00:12.179> gonna

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
underneath the car here and we're gonna

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.990 
underneath the car here and we're gonna
take<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.509> look<00:00:12.750> at<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.929> exhaust<00:00:13.230> system<00:00:14.000> we've

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
take a look at the exhaust system we've

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.510 
take a look at the exhaust system we've
got<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> factory<00:00:15.630> exhaust<00:00:15.750> system<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.650> that

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
got the factory exhaust system here that

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.880 
got the factory exhaust system here that
goes<00:00:18.210> forward<00:00:18.690> from<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> back<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> car

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
goes forward from the back of the car

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.810 
goes forward from the back of the car
there's<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.850> nice<00:00:21.570> chassis<00:00:21.869> gusset<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
there's a nice chassis gusset on the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
there's a nice chassis gusset on the
speed<00:00:23.820> 3s<00:00:24.240> that's<00:00:24.539> not<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> regular<00:00:25.350> three

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
speed 3s that's not on the regular three

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.939 
speed 3s that's not on the regular three
and<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:27.330> main<00:00:27.720> resonators<00:00:28.230> underneath<00:00:28.680> that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
and the main resonators underneath that

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.240 
and the main resonators underneath that
and<00:00:29.189> then<00:00:29.789> forward<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.570> where<00:00:30.810> our

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
and then forward of that is where our

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.069 
and then forward of that is where our
installation<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.719> Cork's<00:00:33.719> port<00:00:33.930> power

series<00:00:34.500> race<00:00:34.710> pipe<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.480> replaces<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
series race pipe is so this replaces the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.170 
series race pipe is so this replaces the
factory<00:00:37.320> catalyst<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.190> off-road<00:00:38.579> track<00:00:38.910> use

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
factory catalyst for off-road track use

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.229 
factory catalyst for off-road track use
and<00:00:39.500> it<00:00:40.500> actually<00:00:41.070> picks<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.460> quite<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> bit<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and it actually picks up quite a bit of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
and it actually picks up quite a bit of
low<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.540> torque<00:00:42.870> over<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.950> speed<00:00:44.190> three

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
low in torque over just a speed three

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.549 
low in torque over just a speed three
that<00:00:44.640> has<00:00:44.789> our<00:00:45.000> power<00:00:45.270> series<00:00:45.629> intake<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that has our power series intake on it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.479 
that has our power series intake on it
it's<00:00:47.430> about<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.670> 10<00:00:48.360> horse<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.020> 10<00:00:50.010> pound<00:00:50.280> feet

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it's about a 10 horse and 10 pound feet

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.770 
it's about a 10 horse and 10 pound feet
of<00:00:50.520> torque<00:00:50.640> increase<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:51.629> at<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
of torque increase and then at the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
of torque increase and then at the
bottom<00:00:51.960> end<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.440> even<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.860> than<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
bottom end it's even more than that it's

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.939 
bottom end it's even more than that it's
a<00:00:53.489> substantial<00:00:54.149> gain<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.510> torque<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.559> what

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
a substantial gain in torque so what

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
a substantial gain in torque so what
we've<00:00:56.100> got<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.449> at<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> front<00:00:57.960> we've<00:00:58.199> got

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
we've got here at the front we've got

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
we've got here at the front we've got
the<00:00:58.559> two<00:00:58.710> connections<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> down<00:00:59.579> pipe<00:00:59.820> you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.670 
the two connections to the down pipe you
can<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.300> those<00:01:00.449> two<00:01:00.629> fasteners<00:01:01.199> there<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
can see those two fasteners there that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
can see those two fasteners there that
go<00:01:02.160> forward<00:01:02.430> into<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> down<00:01:03.090> pipe<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.629> then

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
go forward into the down pipe and then

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.370 
go forward into the down pipe and then
the<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.409> exhaust<00:01:04.799> hangers<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.900> covered
