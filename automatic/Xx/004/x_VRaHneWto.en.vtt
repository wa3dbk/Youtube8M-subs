really fun to type on most of you
probably<00:00:23.130> know<00:00:23.310> them<00:00:23.519> from<00:00:23.670> their<00:00:23.820> clickety

clack<00:00:24.449> noise<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:27.650> which<00:00:28.650> actually<00:00:29.160> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
clack noise like this which actually is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.250 
clack noise like this which actually is
quite<00:00:29.369> satisfying<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.390> press<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.840> type<00:00:31.050> on

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260

paragraphs<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:34.620> mimicking<00:00:35.100> some

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
paragraphs and then mimicking some

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.040 
paragraphs and then mimicking some
gaming<00:00:35.579> situations<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.600> give<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> good

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
feel of what it will sound like but

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
feel of what it will sound like but
before<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.270> into<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.750> examples<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.469> do

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
before we get into the examples I do

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.139 
before we get into the examples I do
want<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:40.980> talk<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.879> switch

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
want to talk a bit about the switch

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
want to talk a bit about the switch
itself<00:00:42.540> Cherry<00:00:43.290> MX<00:00:43.379> blue<00:00:43.770> switches<00:00:43.829> are

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
itself Cherry MX blue switches are

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.830 
itself Cherry MX blue switches are
actually<00:00:44.820> blue<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
actually blue as you can see in the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
actually blue as you can see in the
middle<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> keyboard<00:00:46.559> right<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:46.969> cherry

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
middle of the keyboard right here cherry

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
middle of the keyboard right here cherry
color<00:00:48.329> codes<00:00:48.600> they're<00:00:48.780> switches<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> name

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
color codes they're switches so the name

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.110 
color codes they're switches so the name
matches<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> color<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.700> red<00:00:50.879> switches

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
matches with the color so red switches

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.090 
matches with the color so red switches
big<00:00:51.360> red<00:00:51.539> Brown<00:00:51.840> would<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.079> brown<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.920> on

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
big red Brown would be brown and so on

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
big red Brown would be brown and so on
Cherry<00:00:53.879> MX<00:00:54.000> blue<00:00:54.300> switches<00:00:54.390> work<00:00:55.020> using<00:00:55.410> a

Cherry MX blue switches work using a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.110 
Cherry MX blue switches work using a
loaded<00:00:55.920> spring<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.030> the

loaded spring as you can see in the

animation on-screen now once it is

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
animation on-screen now once it is

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
actuated which means when the letter

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.479 
actuated which means when the letter
would<00:01:01.050> show<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.469> your<00:01:01.620> screen<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.160> gives

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
clack sound comes from bottoming a key

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
clack sound comes from bottoming a key
out<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> base<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.310> keyboard<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
out to the base of the keyboard this is

out to the base of the keyboard this is
a<00:01:09.570> click<00:01:10.400> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.700> clack<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:13.010> really<00:01:14.010> just

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
a click this is a clack it really just

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.410 
a click this is a clack it really just
comes<00:01:14.310> down<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.729> difference<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.210> pressure

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
comes down to a difference in pressure

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
comes down to a difference in pressure
put<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> keys<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.409> you're<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> light<00:01:16.830> type

put on the keys if you're a light type

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.070 
put on the keys if you're a light type
ER<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.549> only<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> lot<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.540> clicks<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:18.990> if

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
ER you only get a lot of clicks but if

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.510 
ER you only get a lot of clicks but if
you're<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> heavy<00:01:19.380> diaper<00:01:19.680> you'll<00:01:20.159> definitely

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you're a heavy diaper you'll definitely

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.240 
you're a heavy diaper you'll definitely
get<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> lot<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.030> class<00:01:21.799> now<00:01:22.799> let's<00:01:22.979> get<00:01:23.070> into

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
get a lot of class now let's get into

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.130 
get a lot of class now let's get into
the<00:01:23.400> typing<00:01:23.909> all<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> text<00:01:25.049> I'm

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the typing all right so the text I'm

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
the typing all right so the text I'm
about<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.439> type<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:25.950> on-screen<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.670> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
about to type will be on-screen as I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.370 
about to type will be on-screen as I
type<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.570> mic<00:01:27.720> will<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.990> facing<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
type it the mic will be facing the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.569 
type it the mic will be facing the
keyboard<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.130> get<00:01:29.310> an<00:01:29.460> idea

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
keyboard so you can really get an idea

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
keyboard so you can really get an idea
of<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.450> loud<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.409> these<00:01:31.560> switches

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
of how loud or what these switches

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.830 
of how loud or what these switches
actually<00:01:32.250> sound<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> side<00:01:33.450> note<00:01:33.479> try

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
actually sound like on a side note try

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.330 
actually sound like on a side note try
to<00:01:33.900> figure<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.229> where<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.590> source<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.100> from

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to figure out where this source is from

00:01:35.340 --> 00:02:37.960 
to figure out where this source is from
ready<00:01:36.000> set<00:01:36.570> go

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.340 

so<00:02:38.970> now<00:02:39.090> I'm<00:02:39.300> going<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> game<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> little<00:02:39.930> bit<00:02:40.140> on

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
so now I'm going to game a little bit on

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.140 
so now I'm going to game a little bit on
it<00:02:40.530> keep<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.280> mind<00:02:41.520> though<00:02:41.610> I'm<00:02:41.760> gonna<00:02:41.850> face

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.270 
it keep in mind though I'm gonna face
the<00:02:42.330> mic<00:02:42.540> towards<00:02:42.930> me<00:02:43.200> when<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.560> play<00:02:43.680> because

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the mic towards me when I play because
