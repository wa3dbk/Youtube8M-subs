all<00:05:09.650> right<00:05:09.890> where<00:05:10.040> was<00:05:10.220> I

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
all right where was I

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.030 
all right where was I
all<00:05:10.910> right<00:05:11.060> finishers<00:05:11.510> so<00:05:11.750> I<00:05:12.200> use<00:05:12.410> executioner

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
all right finishers so I use executioner

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.560 
all right finishers so I use executioner
as<00:05:13.130> my<00:05:13.250> finisher<00:05:13.670> naturally<00:05:14.090> because<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.390> use<00:05:14.540> a

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
as my finisher naturally because I use a

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.280 
as my finisher naturally because I use a
two-hander

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
two-hander

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.770 
two-hander
I<00:05:15.320> might<00:05:16.100> start<00:05:16.310> messing<00:05:16.880> around<00:05:16.970> with<00:05:17.420> molten

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
I might start messing around with molten

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.660 
I might start messing around with molten
weapons<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.620> one-point-six<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.550> was

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
weapons and one-point-six that was

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.190 
weapons and one-point-six that was
updated<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.120> increase<00:05:20.420> your<00:05:20.540> heavy<00:05:20.900> attack

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
updated to increase your heavy attack

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.770 
updated to increase your heavy attack
damage<00:05:21.470> by<00:05:21.740> 40%<00:05:22.220> for<00:05:22.670> seven<00:05:23.060> seconds<00:05:23.480> so<00:05:23.630> that

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
damage by 40% for seven seconds so that

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.870 
damage by 40% for seven seconds so that
might<00:05:23.900> be<00:05:24.050> pretty<00:05:24.650> nice<00:05:24.950> I<00:05:25.220> would<00:05:25.280> if<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:25.700> were

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
might be pretty nice I would if I were

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.640 
might be pretty nice I would if I were
to<00:05:26.030> do<00:05:26.150> that<00:05:26.270> I<00:05:26.330> would<00:05:26.540> replace<00:05:26.840> spiky<00:05:27.320> armor

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
to do that I would replace spiky armor

molten weapons as far as healing goes I

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.190 
molten weapons as far as healing goes I
use<00:05:34.430> entropy<00:05:34.910> for<00:05:35.090> a<00:05:35.120> small<00:05:35.360> hill<00:05:35.540> over<00:05:35.750> time<00:05:35.960> I

small quick heal and then I use green

small quick heal and then I use green

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
dragon blood for a nice big heal

based off of missing HP I put a lot of

stay<00:06:15.080> alive<00:06:15.200> as<00:06:15.530> I<00:06:15.650> hold<00:06:15.890> off<00:06:16.040> into<00:06:16.280> the<00:06:16.370> last

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.490 
stay alive as I hold off into the last
second<00:06:17.150> until<00:06:17.390> I<00:06:17.480> use<00:06:17.660> green<00:06:17.930> dragon<00:06:18.320> blood

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
second until I use green dragon blood

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.860 
second until I use green dragon blood
the<00:06:19.490> longer<00:06:19.820> you<00:06:19.910> wait<00:06:20.060> to<00:06:20.120> use<00:06:20.360> green<00:06:20.570> dragon

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
the longer you wait to use green dragon

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.750 
the longer you wait to use green dragon
blood<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.290> better<00:06:21.500> it<00:06:21.710> will<00:06:21.800> be<00:06:22.010> the<00:06:22.340> more<00:06:22.610> HP

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
blood the better it will be the more HP

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.880 
blood the better it will be the more HP
you'll<00:06:23.060> give<00:06:23.240> back<00:06:23.450> it's<00:06:24.290> a<00:06:24.440> risk<00:06:24.650> reward

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
you'll give back it's a risk reward

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:31.720 
you'll give back it's a risk reward
scenario

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.610 

so<00:06:32.300> this<00:06:32.420> builds<00:06:32.750> actually<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.110> same<00:06:33.350> build

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
so this builds actually the same build

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.080 
so this builds actually the same build
that<00:06:33.710> I've<00:06:33.830> been<00:06:33.950> using<00:06:34.160> since<00:06:34.430> beta<00:06:34.730> with

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
that I've been using since beta with

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.520 
that I've been using since beta with
only<00:06:35.390> some<00:06:35.630> small<00:06:35.900> tweaks<00:06:36.080> here<00:06:36.350> and<00:06:36.410> there

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
only some small tweaks here and there

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.620 
only some small tweaks here and there
it's<00:06:37.220> always<00:06:37.520> served<00:06:37.700> me<00:06:37.910> well<00:06:38.060> but<00:06:38.330> what<00:06:38.600> I

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
it's always served me well but what I

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.360 
it's always served me well but what I
like<00:06:38.840> most<00:06:39.050> about<00:06:39.140> it<00:06:39.380> is<00:06:39.500> that<00:06:39.560> I<00:06:39.920> don't<00:06:40.220> see

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
like most about it is that I don't see

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.920 
like most about it is that I don't see
anyone<00:06:40.640> else<00:06:40.730> doing<00:06:41.060> anything<00:06:41.330> like<00:06:41.480> this

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
anyone else doing anything like this

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.600 
anyone else doing anything like this
dragon<00:06:42.710> Knights<00:06:42.830> have<00:06:42.950> pretty<00:06:43.070> much<00:06:43.160> all<00:06:43.430> had

dragon Knights have pretty much all had

dragon Knights have pretty much all had

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
the exact same build for as long as I

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.510 
the exact same build for as long as I

much<00:07:33.830> more<00:07:33.980> important<00:07:34.490> than<00:07:35.090> the<00:07:35.270> build<00:07:35.500> so

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.500 
much more important than the build so

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.720 
much more important than the build so
get<00:07:36.650> out<00:07:36.740> there<00:07:36.770> and<00:07:36.950> try<00:07:37.100> something<00:07:37.400> new<00:07:37.520> and

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730
