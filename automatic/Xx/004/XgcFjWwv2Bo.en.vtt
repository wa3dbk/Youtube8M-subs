00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:06.220
 Today I would like to introduce my favorite book series and that 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.159
 The novels of Charlaine Harris are around 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:13.109
 the teacher telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse ran 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.550
 if you can imagine it on a racetrack 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.179
 blonde 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.199
 I know what this is about others is a new time has dawned 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.589
 Bank hid her no more 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.649
 they come out of their graves and strengthen the climbs both in Japan 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.929
 probably invented German sheet that is a synthetic blood 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.880
 All of the nutrients for the bank are in there so now 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 nobody has to tap anymore 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.290
 Of course they still do that but that's usually Vanguardia "that starts 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.310
 meet in May by a vampire 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.120
 to be bitten 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.870
 Umezu QIA ETR works in March time as go and talk it is not 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.300
 especially popular with the opposite sex because they are so kind 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.610
 Well, weird is 7 people know what it's different with them 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.020
 Now really a label lot is probably the least believable 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.470
 most people think of Hartz IV 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.510
 funny or stupid 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.360
 and she would never have had a boyfriend 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.080
 It is also a bit of a hindrance if you know exactly what the other one 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.390
 thinks you do not always have to be positive thoughts it changes 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
 when she turns up in March, a vampire 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.990
 And this way she earns herself and the two are also a whole time 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.250
 long together 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.630
 Percent that is basically so and Cueva's frame plot is whole 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.220
 find exciting at the series stop 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.100
 he is not wanted to bite around the bank their the Turks 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.930
 Umflut 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.070
 but it is also very important 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.520
 What is religious fanaticism actually can do 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.930
 yes there is the police gathered as just think it's just one 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.900
 to rise from the dead that is Jesus Christ and give says to do 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.170
 on everything that is percent over sunlight 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.049
 zu zu zu zu zu Zucchini not only there are vampires but the 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.860
 Chef "is also a shapeshifter 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.920
 and that comes in the course of books with elves with werewolves citing the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.919
 most peculiar 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.119
 Entity in contact 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.829
 after all, a meditative one is about to happen 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.259
 the equally chaotic mess 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.540
 the same telepathic percent 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.660
 Has talent 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.969
 "She has a brother 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.179
 James 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:30.779
 her brother Jason 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.709
 Dr um 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.909
 There is nothing in the head but women 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.919
 Jackson is in the top position and 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.589
 He does not care much more 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.609
 Her boss himself is a very dear and faithful and the alto 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.799
 Shapeshifter prefers to transform himself into a colleague 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.319
 he has to stop per cent e 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.339
 He always has a book lying on his table, high up a picture of Angkor 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.399
 this could turn into a fast one 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:01.189
 then there will be hot too 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.089
 personally, I find the bank pretty much pale 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.089
 meaningless it will not be a vampire for me 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.139
 it is reality 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.569
 pale and find it a bit too slack 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.159
 Eric likes to lure out that he is the fifth district sheriff 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.549
 He more or less on the boss of BP 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.449
 This band is now quite different from a stick-year old Viking 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.650
 that he looks very good very erotic, he has for me at least 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.459
 just the right kind of humor and 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.929
 Per cent yes that would be my daddy on which I would 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:40.059
 the deputy of Eric is Pam Pam is a mix of 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.609
 Mosers Torg and Percent 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.039
 Allison Wunderland in the movie is very different and then the same 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.830
 still too 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.670
 these are actually the main characters around the whole 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.399
 Stories always ran 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.399
 then there are also werewolves elves 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.180
 especially a banker that is APA 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.589
 Aabar is Elvis Presley 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:08.009
 Of course he knows no one is allowed to know and Prien of his transformation is that 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.800
 went wrong 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.619
 and you can not address him with something but 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.649
 He walks around like the king of rock'n'roll 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:16.620
 the whole thing has been filmed 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.620
 as CEO smooth is now also getting into German Free Tibet 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.930
 I would not like to miss the books as well as the topics though 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.550
 here are the characters 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.029
 partly and legend 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:32.020
 Well different 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.439
 Well it for example no colored in the books 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.919
 Fiedler and she does not work with the decree 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.659
 who her brother Jason would Ninja is degrading never percent 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.909
 Overly alcohol take let alone flown it is also in the 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:48.979
 Books differently 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.979
 Cham they really have percent in my opinion 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.070
 "The league is suddenly not so much as Maser Stewart and Pattinson 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.559
 Wonderland moderate 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:01.569
 on the one hand just a normal vampires that is very crucial 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.550
 largely open to Bush as a "dog" out 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.240
 but as I said I love these books I am also waiting for the next warning 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.779
 could out for the first of April who against him directly and immediately due 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.259
 airberlin does not yet know books and who does not know the series or 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.419
 si one now of course says bank their vampires everywhere are vampires 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.870
 they really did it to me 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.170
 Bella and Edward the story that's four percent in March in Brussels 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.530
 These bands differ over assisting them all 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.270
 Vampires are dangerous 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.550
 And not all are also striving to be good with people 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.349
 make or not stand out 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.220
 the Munich so also continue 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.289
 the little big monsters stay 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.289
 yes I can only recommend it to anyone Dr 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.989
 this intense Marko and as I said I find this in the background 

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:53.350
 on 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.780
 good managed but just the Hanseatic city
