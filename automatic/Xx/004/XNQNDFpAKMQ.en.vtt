think<00:00:43.140> deserves<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.590> win<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.789> only<00:00:45.149> based<00:00:45.390> on

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.250 
think deserves to win not only based on
my<00:00:46.469> preference<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.489> also<00:00:47.969> based<00:00:48.260> factually

because I didn't know a lot about the
Punisher<00:00:52.469> honestly<00:00:53.430> cuz<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.730> haven't<00:00:53.940> had<00:00:54.120> a

to take it out even becoming a crime
lord<00:01:53.100> himself<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.329> he<00:01:54.990> will<00:01:55.200> go<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> extremes

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.160 
under the Red Hood now in the new 52 I'm
honestly<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:09.030> sure<00:02:09.090> what<00:02:09.660> they're<00:02:09.810> doing

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
honestly not sure what they're doing

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.410 
honestly not sure what they're doing
with<00:02:10.319> his<00:02:10.500> character<00:02:10.979> I'm<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.790> sure<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.239> he's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
with his character I'm not sure if he's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.699 
with his character I'm not sure if he's
still<00:02:12.599> killing<00:02:12.959> people<00:02:13.110> on

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
still killing people on

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.860 
still killing people on
I<00:02:13.739> think<00:02:14.280> he's<00:02:14.489> going<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.209> more<00:02:15.480> soft

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
I think he's going a little more soft

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.580 
I think he's going a little more soft
now<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.620> becoming<00:02:17.310> more<00:02:17.719> along<00:02:18.719> the<00:02:19.049> good<00:02:19.319> guy

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
now and becoming more along the good guy

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.890 
now and becoming more along the good guy
lines<00:02:19.950> as<00:02:20.280> opposed<00:02:20.609> to<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.819> antihero<00:02:21.569> lines

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
lines as opposed to the antihero lines

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.420 
lines as opposed to the antihero lines
but<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:23.159> no<00:02:23.489> idea<00:02:23.969> so<00:02:24.500> now<00:02:25.500> new<00:02:25.739> 52<00:02:26.069> can<00:02:26.370> do

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.190 
but I have no idea so now new 52 can do
whatever<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:26.790> wants<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.329> the<00:02:27.689> Jason<00:02:28.019> Todd

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
they're using is probably more of the

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.099

extreme<00:04:33.419> tolerance<00:04:34.319> to<00:04:34.500> pain<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:37.039> yeah<00:04:38.039> he's

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
extreme tolerance to pain and yeah he's

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.180 
extreme tolerance to pain and yeah he's
just<00:04:38.340> he's<00:04:38.849> really<00:04:39.210> strong<00:04:39.509> he's<00:04:40.110> signed<00:04:40.740> on

just he's really strong he's signed on

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
just he's really strong he's signed on
as<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:41.599> mercenary<00:04:43.310> so<00:04:44.310> he<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.580> guy<00:04:44.789> for<00:04:45.090> high

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
as a mercenary so he is a guy for high

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.969 
as a mercenary so he is a guy for high
in<00:04:45.270> order<00:04:45.629> to<00:04:45.690> kill<00:04:45.870> people<00:04:46.050> but<00:04:46.409> I'd<00:04:46.650> say<00:04:46.860> he

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
in order to kill people but I'd say he

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.129 
in order to kill people but I'd say he
probably<00:04:47.310> stays<00:04:47.789> more<00:04:48.090> along<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.539> lines<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:49.020> a

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
probably stays more along the lines of a

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.520 
probably stays more along the lines of a
good<00:04:49.409> guy<00:04:49.650> he's<00:04:50.039> just<00:04:50.129> more<00:04:50.550> into<00:04:50.759> killing<00:04:51.150> so

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
Punisher guy I just don't know a lot

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.330 
Punisher guy I just don't know a lot
about<00:04:58.020> him<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:58.889> anyway<00:05:00.199> now<00:05:01.199> as<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:02.159> who<00:05:02.280> I

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
about him so anyway now as to who I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.969 
about him so anyway now as to who I
think<00:05:02.699> will<00:05:03.090> win<00:05:03.360> who<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.139> who<00:05:04.319> should<00:05:04.590> win<00:05:04.770> or

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
think will win who and who should win or

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.209 
think will win who and who should win or
whatever<00:05:05.719> honestly<00:05:06.719> it's<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.199> toss-up<00:05:07.740> and

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
whatever honestly it's a toss-up and

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:09.499 
whatever honestly it's a toss-up and
whenever<00:05:08.520> they<00:05:08.639> put<00:05:08.849> these<00:05:09.060> super-happy

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
whenever they put these super-happy

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.540 
whenever they put these super-happy
downs<00:05:09.990> together<00:05:10.409> they<00:05:10.680> do<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.830> pretty<00:05:11.250> good<00:05:11.400> job

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
downs together they do a pretty good job

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.510 
downs together they do a pretty good job
because<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.449> characters<00:05:12.900> are<00:05:12.930> pretty<00:05:13.520> iffy

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
because the characters are pretty iffy

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.450 
because the characters are pretty iffy
as<00:05:14.699> to<00:05:14.879> who<00:05:15.030> will<00:05:15.210> win<00:05:15.419> which<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.840> like<00:05:16.190> this<00:05:17.190> one

as to who will win which I like this one

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.369 
as to who will win which I like this one
is<00:05:17.699> probably<00:05:18.060> one<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.449> most<00:05:18.719> difficult

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:19.379 
is probably one of the most difficult

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:20.899 
is probably one of the most difficult
ones<00:05:19.620> I've<00:05:19.949> ever<00:05:20.159> had<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.610> think<00:05:20.759> about

I'd be satisfied because I can totally
see<00:05:37.650> it<00:05:37.860> happen<00:05:38.419> if<00:05:39.419> it<00:05:39.990> comes<00:05:40.259> to<00:05:40.650> a

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
see it happen if it comes to a

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.740 
see it happen if it comes to a
face-to-face<00:05:41.909> like<00:05:42.569> fist<00:05:43.380> fighting<00:05:43.740> a

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
face-to-face like fist fighting a

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.170 
face-to-face like fist fighting a
scenario<00:05:45.750> Red<00:05:46.289> Hood<00:05:46.500> would<00:05:46.680> win<00:05:46.919> but<00:05:47.370> I<00:05:47.699> think

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
scenario Red Hood would win but I think

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.659 
scenario Red Hood would win but I think
the<00:05:48.270> Punisher<00:05:48.719> has<00:05:48.900> more<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:50.400> know<00:05:50.490> with

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
the Punisher has more you know with

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.050 
the Punisher has more you know with
weapons<00:05:51.180> more<00:05:51.419> training<00:05:51.840> in<00:05:51.960> that<00:05:51.990> area<00:05:52.139> so

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
weapons more training in that area so

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.320 
weapons more training in that area so
again<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.419> could<00:05:54.599> see<00:05:54.810> it<00:05:54.930> going<00:05:55.139> either<00:05:55.440> way<00:05:55.620> I

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
again I could see it going either way I

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.540 
again I could see it going either way I
voted<00:05:57.330> for<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.599> Red<00:05:57.779> Hood<00:05:58.069> but<00:05:59.069> that's<00:05:59.370> just

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
voted for the Red Hood but that's just

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.080 
voted for the Red Hood but that's just
me

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.629 
me
either<00:06:00.509> one<00:06:00.840> even<00:06:01.770> will<00:06:01.949> either<00:06:02.190> one<00:06:02.460> could
