00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
really good card as well both of them

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.139 
really good card as well both of them
you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.270> around<00:00:46.370> 149<00:00:47.370> dollar<00:00:47.760> price

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you can get around 149 dollar price

the 7790 cheaper at this point in time

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.420 
the 7790 cheaper at this point in time
simply<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.000> GTX<00:00:54.719> 650<00:00:55.079> Ti<00:00:55.440> boost<00:00:55.590> was

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

just<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.780> card<00:01:16.080> does<00:01:16.350> I've<00:01:17.310> seen

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
just how well this card does I've seen

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.690 
just how well this card does I've seen
overclockers<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.600> able<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.869> put<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.700> excess

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
of the 660s performance so really

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
of the 660s performance so really
something<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.210> guys<00:01:24.420> ought<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> take<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> look

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
something you guys ought to take a look

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
something you guys ought to take a look
at<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.830> we're<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.460> an<00:01:26.549> Intel

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
like to to have so coolermaster cases
make<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.399> extremely<00:01:59.820> easy<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.270> take<00:02:00.509> stuff

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
make it extremely easy to take stuff

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.410 
make it extremely easy to take stuff
pull<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.619> out<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.950> things<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
pull it in and out and things like that

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.670 
pull it in and out and things like that
we're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> same<00:02:03.990> optical<00:02:04.380> drive

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
we're going with the same optical drive

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.130 
we're going with the same optical drive
and<00:02:04.710> hard<00:02:05.040> drive<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.969> did<00:02:06.180> before<00:02:06.210> some<00:02:07.079> of

and hard drive as we did before some of

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.600 
and hard drive as we did before some of
you<00:02:07.229> might<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.409> asking<00:02:07.829> why<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.009> went<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you might be asking why we went with the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.320 
you might be asking why we went with the
i3<00:02:09.679> 3220<00:02:10.679> instead<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> processor<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
i3 3220 instead of a processor like the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
i3 3220 instead of a processor like the
FX<00:02:12.660> 6300

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
FX 6300

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.580 
FX 6300
and<00:02:13.950> simply<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.900> reason<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.530> is

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
and simply the reason for this is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.890 
and simply the reason for this is
because<00:02:16.770> we're<00:02:17.070> looking<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.640> max<00:02:18.300> gaming

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
because we're looking for max gaming

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.540 
because we're looking for max gaming
performance<00:02:19.080> out<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.680> these<00:02:19.950> bills<00:02:20.190> and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
performance out of these bills and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
performance out of these bills and
you're<00:02:20.820> going<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.360> with<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.140> i3

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
you're going to get that with the i3

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.970 
you're going to get that with the i3
3220<00:02:22.950> versus<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.760> FX<00:02:24.120> 6300<00:02:24.600> now<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.890> don't

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
3220 versus the FX 6300 now if you don't

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.200 
3220 versus the FX 6300 now if you don't
have<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.460> have<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.880> max<00:02:27.180> FPS<00:02:27.900> okay<00:02:28.740> then<00:02:29.460> going

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
have to have the max FPS okay then going

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.970 
have to have the max FPS okay then going
with<00:02:30.360> something<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> 6300<00:02:31.470> might<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
with something like the 6300 might be a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.320 
with something like the 6300 might be a
good<00:02:32.070> idea<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.610> need<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> workstation

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
good idea if you need like a workstation

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.590 
good idea if you need like a workstation
or<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.050> have<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> lot<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:35.820> leave<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> lot<00:02:36.510> of

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
or you have a lot of you leave a lot of

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.200

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
apps open where you have software that's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.090 
apps open where you have software that's

very very thread intensive pay you can

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.240 
very very thread intensive pay you can
stick<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.430> 6300<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.480> case<00:02:46.250> so

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
stick with a 6300 in that case so

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.010 
stick with a 6300 in that case so
overall<00:02:47.520> if<00:02:47.730> you've<00:02:47.850> got<00:02:48.000> about<00:02:48.180> five<00:02:48.840> hundred
