there<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.199> six<00:00:25.439> points<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.310> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
there are six points that we use to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.250 
there are six points that we use to
release<00:00:26.789> tension<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> hind<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
huge muscles around it and we use these

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
huge muscles around it and we use these
points<00:00:36.870> similar<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> bladder<00:00:37.800> meridian

you when he's released tension or she

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.950 
you when he's released tension or she
when<00:01:29.549> she<00:01:29.729> gives<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> larger<00:01:30.540> response

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
when she gives you a larger response

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.690

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so the first set of points are under the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.249 
so the first set of points are under the
base<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> tail<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> left<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.990> one

base of the tail one on the left and one

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.810 
base of the tail one on the left and one
on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> right<00:01:37.650> you'll<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:38.159> separately

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
on the right you'll do them separately

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.480 
on the right you'll do them separately

are<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> two<00:03:42.330> points<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.810> would<00:03:42.870> say<00:03:43.140> she

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
are the two points that I would say she

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.340 
are the two points that I would say she
she<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:43.950> use<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.250> most<00:03:44.459> work<00:03:44.640> on<00:03:45.140> so<00:03:46.140> those

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
she can use the most work on so those

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.340 
she can use the most work on so those
are<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.650> six<00:03:46.830> points<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.720> idea<00:03:49.050> being<00:03:49.290> that

are the six points the idea being that

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.690 
are the six points the idea being that
we<00:03:49.500> want<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.830> get<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.100> horse<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.400> release

movement with the leg release which

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.839 
movement with the leg release which
we'll<00:03:58.709> do<00:03:58.860> next
