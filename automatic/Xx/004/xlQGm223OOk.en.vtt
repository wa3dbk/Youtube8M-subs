enough<00:01:42.890> there's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.979> bigger<00:01:44.310> gap<00:01:44.429> down<00:01:44.940> here

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
enough there's a bigger gap down here

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.160 
enough there's a bigger gap down here
there's<00:01:45.690> probably<00:01:45.929> three<00:01:46.560> seen

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
there's probably three seen

door you saw that it was tight because
this<00:01:52.990> door<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.530> tilted<00:01:54.040> like<00:01:54.220> this<00:01:54.250> if<00:01:55.240> you

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
this door is tilted like this if you

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.350 
this door is tilted like this if you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
take a box or a rectangle and you tilt

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.889 
take a box or a rectangle and you tilt
it<00:01:58.659> you<00:01:59.350> can<00:01:59.530> see<00:01:59.830> what<00:02:00.009> happens<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:01.270> edge<00:02:01.600> is

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
it you can see what happens this edge is

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.399 
it you can see what happens this edge is
tight<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:03.130> bottom<00:02:03.640> edge<00:02:03.820> is<00:02:04.180> loose<00:02:04.810> and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
tight the bottom edge is loose and

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.200 
tight the bottom edge is loose and
that's<00:02:05.590> what<00:02:05.799> we<00:02:05.950> have<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.190> classic<00:02:07.060> example

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
that's what we have a classic example

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.350 
that's what we have a classic example
right<00:02:07.990> here<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:09.399> saggy<00:02:09.850> door<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.269> is

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
a quick look over here on these hinges

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.460 
a quick look over here on these hinges
and<00:02:18.310> see<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.489> look<00:02:21.760> at<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.030> hinge<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.870> want

pushing back in or it's loose this is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.870 
pushing back in or it's loose this is
loose<00:02:31.330> could<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.260> see<00:02:32.470> how<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.860> could<00:02:33.549> push

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
loose could you see how this could push

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.910 
loose could you see how this could push

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
right back in there and could make the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.050 
right back in there and could make the
door<00:02:36.160> actually<00:02:36.670> sag<00:02:37.650> by<00:02:38.650> having<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.430> bottom

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060

section<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.720> door<00:02:40.959> jamb<00:02:41.230> loose<00:02:42.090> I've<00:02:43.090> seen

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
section of the door jamb loose I've seen

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.330 
section of the door jamb loose I've seen
that<00:02:43.630> happen<00:02:44.110> before<00:02:44.140> usually<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.310> doesn't

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
that happen before usually that doesn't

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.240 
that happen before usually that doesn't
happen<00:02:45.790> right<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.260> I've<00:02:47.410> looked<00:02:47.620> over<00:02:47.890> here

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
happen right and I've looked over here

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.729 
happen right and I've looked over here
and<00:02:48.459> everything<00:02:48.819> looks<00:02:49.030> tight<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.709> don't

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
and everything looks tight and I don't

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.599 
and everything looks tight and I don't
think<00:02:51.220> that's<00:02:51.430> happening<00:02:52.000> at<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.750> section

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
think that's happening at this section

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.330 
think that's happening at this section
you<00:02:54.609> know<00:02:55.290> that's<00:02:56.290> one<00:02:56.590> thing<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:57.040> want<00:02:57.220> to

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
you know that's one thing you want to

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.030 
you know that's one thing you want to
check<00:02:57.579> because<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.269> because<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.799> door

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
check because just because the door

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.210 
check because just because the door
looks<00:03:00.730> like<00:03:00.940> it's<00:03:01.150> sagging<00:03:01.600> here<00:03:02.220> doesn't

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
looks like it's sagging here doesn't

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.410 
looks like it's sagging here doesn't
necessarily<00:03:03.940> mean<00:03:04.209> it's<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.870> top<00:03:05.230> hinge

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
necessarily mean it's that top hinge

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.080 
necessarily mean it's that top hinge
okay

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
okay

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.740 
okay
let's<00:03:10.090> pin<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.989> if<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.440> pan<00:03:11.799> that<00:03:12.070> in<00:03:15.750> you

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
let's pin this in if I pan that in you

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.199 
let's pin this in if I pan that in you
see<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.170> gap<00:03:17.500> right<00:03:17.530> there<00:03:17.890> I'm<00:03:18.820> gonna<00:03:19.000> lift

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
see that gap right there I'm gonna lift

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.770 
see that gap right there I'm gonna lift
up<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.840> door<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.760> left-hand<00:03:22.269> edge<00:03:22.480> and

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
up on the door the left-hand edge and

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.940 
up on the door the left-hand edge and
you<00:03:22.840> see<00:03:23.140> if<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.290> pushes<00:03:23.980> tighter<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.900> if<00:03:26.769> it

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
you see if that pushes tighter and if it

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.069 
you see if that pushes tighter and if it
does<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:30.120> means<00:03:31.120> we've<00:03:31.569> got<00:03:31.750> something

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
does and that means we've got something

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.000 
does and that means we've got something
loose<00:03:32.470> at<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.859> top<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:34.090> see<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:36.120> like

loose at the top you see that like

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.009 
loose at the top you see that like
it<00:03:38.760> flexes<00:03:39.239> up<00:03:39.390> like<00:03:39.629> that<00:03:41.420> let<00:03:42.420> go<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:42.900> it

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
it flexes up like that let go and it

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.440 
it flexes up like that let go and it
comes<00:03:43.200> back<00:03:43.319> down<00:03:43.849> that<00:03:44.849> tells<00:03:45.239> me<00:03:45.890> something

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
comes back down that tells me something
