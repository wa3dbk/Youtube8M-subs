00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.750
 today's topic is the inclusion of quotes 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.750
 textual in an essay 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.530
 in a stamp that we are working on is 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.810
 on intercultural education as a 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.810
 diagnosis of the Celtic region 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.070
 the goal of this videotutorial is 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.390
 learn the encryption form of agreement 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.390
 to the rules of the app 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.830
 first we show you the title of 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.400
 our essay the author and the beginning of the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.400
 work 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.110
 It is important to recommend that all 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.210
 tables that include our essay 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.390
 tables geographical boxes should have 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.250
 titles and the reference of where they were 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 taken the data 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.750
 in this section , section 2 of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.680
 our essay can be seen in the first 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.560
 paragraph as it is a paraphrase here 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.440
 we are paraphrasing wayne swan 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.950
 in its 2002 text 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.650
 when the large appointment that we 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.680
 we are referring is less than 45 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.850
 words this is integrated in the way 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.750
 as we are showing in the paragraph 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.450
 correspondent 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.180
 On the contrary, when the appointment is greater 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 of 45 words as shown in this 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:50.710
 paragraph is necessary to separate 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.710
 here we have already the separate textual quotation 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.390
 we remove the quotes 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.390
 as shown below 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.370
 later we mark our appointment 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.370
 textual 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:24.510
 to this textual quote we will place it 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.510
 with letter number 11 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.400
 so that the difference between the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.400
 normal text and the textual quote 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.960
 since we have the font size 11 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.560
 we have to make him 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:51.550
 margin to side ie from both sides 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.550
 it is reduced our martÃ­nez is reduced 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:02.090
 this is the way how the quote from 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 one of a text in our essay 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.050
 remember that in the end the 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.560
 the author's last name the year and the number of 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.560
 page 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.659
 that's all for today we are waiting for you in the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.659
