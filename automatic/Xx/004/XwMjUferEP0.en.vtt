00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
want to map this little thing here the

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.679 
want to map this little thing here the
orange<00:02:46.620> thing<00:02:47.040> here<00:02:47.459> it's<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.879> sample<00:02:48.299> select

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
orange thing here it's the sample select

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.229 
orange thing here it's the sample select
ruler<00:02:49.109> click<00:02:49.859> on<00:02:50.129> when<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.669> have<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.060> map

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
ruler click on when you have the map

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.770 
ruler click on when you have the map
mode<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.689> click<00:02:52.139> on<00:02:52.319> this<00:02:52.530> one<00:02:52.769> here<00:02:53.129> then<00:02:53.970> map

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
mode on click on this one here then map

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.330 
mode on click on this one here then map
it<00:02:55.049> here<00:02:55.819> now<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:58.260> simple<00:02:59.010> select

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it here now this this simple select

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.909 
it here now this this simple select
ruler<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.969> mapped<00:03:00.329> on<00:03:00.659> one<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.230> knobs<00:03:01.469> here

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
ruler is mapped on one of the knobs here

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.869 
ruler is mapped on one of the knobs here
and<00:03:02.299> let's<00:03:03.299> see<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.980> able<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.010> play<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.669> kick

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
and let's see I'm able to play the kick

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.119 
and let's see I'm able to play the kick
drums<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:06.329> check<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.590> check<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:07.919> out

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
drums now check this and check this out

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:18.469 
drums now check this and check this out
so<00:03:14.599> what<00:03:15.599> it<00:03:15.690> does<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.879> can<00:03:17.879> change<00:03:18.180> the

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:18.479 
so what it does is I can change the

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.140 
so what it does is I can change the
value<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.139> knob<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.709> change<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.729> sound<00:03:20.970> of

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
value of the knob to change the sound of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.629 
value of the knob to change the sound of
the<00:03:21.239> kick<00:03:22.129> let's<00:03:24.530> change<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.739> value<00:03:26.159> so<00:03:26.459> this

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
the kick let's change the value so this

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.670 
the kick let's change the value so this
knob<00:03:26.939> becomes<00:03:27.359> more<00:03:27.599> useful<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.319> don't

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
knob becomes more useful so you don't

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.080 
knob becomes more useful so you don't
just<00:03:28.979> have<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.370> be<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.669> don't<00:03:29.760> have<00:03:29.909> to<00:03:30.000> be

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
just have to be you don't have to be

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.229 
just have to be you don't have to be
moving<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.139> very<00:03:31.349> small<00:03:31.620> area<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.370> I've

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
moving it in a very small area so I've

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.140 
moving it in a very small area so I've
got<00:03:33.449> four<00:03:33.870> samples<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:35.430> numbering<00:03:35.909> goes

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
got four samples and the numbering goes

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.110 
got four samples and the numbering goes
from<00:03:36.449> 0<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.109> 3<00:03:37.979> so<00:03:38.489> 0<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.930> 3<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:41.370> let's<00:03:41.669> turn

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
from 0 to 3 so 0 to 3 now let's turn

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.640 
from 0 to 3 so 0 to 3 now let's turn
this<00:03:42.359> down<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.169> bit<00:03:43.199> cuz<00:03:43.439> it's<00:03:43.590> pretty

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
this down just a bit cuz it's pretty

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.979 
this down just a bit cuz it's pretty
loud<00:03:44.009> so<00:03:44.819> now<00:03:45.060> check<00:03:45.449> this<00:03:46.139> out<00:03:50.419> I'm<00:03:51.419> able<00:03:51.870> to

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
loud so now check this out I'm able to

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.520 
loud so now check this out I'm able to
change<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.439> sound<00:03:52.709> as<00:03:52.829> I<00:03:52.949> go<00:03:54.049> you<00:03:55.049> know<00:03:55.109> just

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
change the sound as I go you know just

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.759 
change the sound as I go you know just
to<00:03:56.400> repeat<00:03:56.759> the<00:03:56.970> process<00:03:57.269> let's<00:03:58.229> do<00:03:58.409> the<00:03:58.560> same

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
to repeat the process let's do the same

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.030 
to repeat the process let's do the same

here also change the value here to

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.559 
here also change the value here to
reflect<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.340> number<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.729> samples<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.539> have

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
numbering goes from zero to three so

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.379 
numbering goes from zero to three so
three<00:05:12.530> it<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:12.919> now<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.729> can<00:05:13.969> play<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.330> snare

drum and change it let's add a hi-hat
just<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.990> be<00:05:24.139> able<00:05:24.229> to<00:05:24.349> make<00:05:24.620> very<00:05:25.310> simple

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
just to be able to make very simple

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.550 
just to be able to make very simple
