that<00:01:38.700> goal<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.240> usually<00:01:39.930> very<00:01:40.100> unusual<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
that goal is usually very unusual and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
that goal is usually very unusual and
violent<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> best<00:01:43.560> example<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
violent I think that the best example of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.859 
violent I think that the best example of
he<00:01:44.939> sokka's<00:01:45.360> style<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.799> shown<00:01:47.700> when<00:01:48.149> he<00:01:48.450> joined

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
he sokka's style is shown when he joined

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.480 
he sokka's style is shown when he joined
the<00:01:49.020> phantom<00:01:49.380> troupe<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.860> committed

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the phantom troupe and committed

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.050 
the phantom troupe and committed
horrifico<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.990> violence<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> terror<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.909> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
horrifico of violence and terror just so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
horrifico of violence and terror just so
that<00:01:54.210> he<00:01:54.329> might<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:55.020> opportunity<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
that he might get an opportunity to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.260 
that he might get an opportunity to
fight<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.860> main<00:01:56.100> guy<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.909> think<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.240> just

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
fight the main guy and I think that just

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.359 
fight the main guy and I think that just
about<00:01:57.509> perfectly<00:01:57.990> encapsulate<00:01:58.649> everything

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
about perfectly encapsulate everything

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.969 
about perfectly encapsulate everything
we<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.210> about<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.899> need<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.860> about

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
we know about and need to know about

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
see this series rewritten except the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.490 
see this series rewritten except the
perspective<00:02:33.520> would<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:34.390> be<00:02:34.600> shifted<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.230> tiny

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
perspective would just be shifted a tiny

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.990 
perspective would just be shifted a tiny
bit<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:35.980> we<00:02:36.130> were<00:02:36.220> behind

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
bit so we were behind

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.720 
bit so we were behind
Hisoka<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.960> entire<00:02:38.290> time<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.800> seeing<00:02:39.130> his

journey and all the tribulations he goes
through<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:43.060> would<00:02:43.180> be<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> really

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
through that would be a really

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.850 
through that would be a really
interesting<00:02:43.540> watch<00:02:44.020> not<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.350> mention<00:02:44.560> I'm

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
interesting watch not to mention I'm

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.980 
interesting watch not to mention I'm

it<00:02:52.959> really<00:02:53.200> doesn't<00:02:53.530> surprise<00:02:53.650> me<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.190> this

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
it really doesn't surprise me that this

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.660 
it really doesn't surprise me that this

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
always very difficult because it's hard

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.050 
always very difficult because it's hard
