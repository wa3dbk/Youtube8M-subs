some this the story's going to evolve

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.939 
some this the story's going to evolve
and<00:04:53.169> there's<00:04:53.379> an<00:04:53.830> in<00:04:54.340> purpose<00:04:55.030> in<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:55.659> then

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
and there's an in purpose in it and then

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
I'm also going to share with you a story

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.460 
I'm also going to share with you a story
that<00:04:59.080> touches<00:04:59.349> on<00:04:59.620> for<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.949> science-minded

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
that touches on for the science-minded

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.760 
that touches on for the science-minded
which<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.590> think<00:05:02.770> most<00:05:02.949> of<00:05:03.069> us<00:05:03.159> are<00:05:03.340> here

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
which I think most of us are here

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.249 
which I think most of us are here
there<00:05:05.770> was<00:05:05.919> an<00:05:06.099> experience<00:05:06.759> that<00:05:07.030> I<00:05:07.180> had<00:05:07.659> been

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
there was an experience that I had been

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.969 
there was an experience that I had been
pull<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.650> was<00:05:08.830> pulled<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:10.169> I<00:05:11.169> was<00:05:11.440> brought<00:05:11.680> back

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
pull I was pulled and I was brought back

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.279 
pull I was pulled and I was brought back
I<00:05:12.009> was<00:05:12.400> gone<00:05:12.610> for<00:05:12.940> two<00:05:12.970> hours<00:05:13.509> easily<00:05:13.810> two

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
I was gone for two hours easily two

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.129 
I was gone for two hours easily two
hours<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.919> then<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.639> was<00:05:15.849> brought<00:05:16.120> back<00:05:16.419> two<00:05:16.990> to

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
hours and then I was brought back two to

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.059 
hours and then I was brought back two to
three<00:05:17.349> minutes<00:05:17.759> before<00:05:18.759> I<00:05:18.970> left<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:20.069> then

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
three minutes before I left and then

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.200 
three minutes before I left and then
what<00:05:21.490> I<00:05:21.520> saw<00:05:22.030> as<00:05:22.389> time<00:05:23.199> caught<00:05:23.590> up<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.219> I'm

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
what I saw as time caught up and I'm

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.649 
what I saw as time caught up and I'm
just<00:05:25.240> going<00:05:25.539> to<00:05:25.569> share<00:05:25.900> with<00:05:26.229> you<00:05:27.599> at<00:05:28.599> that

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
just going to share with you at that

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.430 
just going to share with you at that
point<00:05:30.300> things<00:05:31.300> that<00:05:31.599> I<00:05:31.629> think<00:05:31.780> with<00:05:32.080> the

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
point things that I think with the

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.890 
point things that I think with the
quagmire<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:33.370> time<00:05:33.729> travel<00:05:34.210> which<00:05:34.389> is<00:05:34.569> if<00:05:34.780> I

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
quagmire and time travel which is if I

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.649 
quagmire and time travel which is if I
were<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.139> go<00:05:35.349> back<00:05:35.530> in<00:05:35.979> time<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:36.729> see<00:05:37.479> my

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
were to go back in time and see my

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.830 
were to go back in time and see my
father<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.139> shoot<00:05:38.440> my<00:05:38.620> father<00:05:39.539> would<00:05:40.539> I<00:05:40.569> not

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
father and shoot my father would I not

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.170 
father and shoot my father would I not
be<00:05:41.110> here<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:41.830> I've<00:05:42.430> learned<00:05:42.699> things<00:05:43.030> about

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
be here and I've learned things about

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.450 
be here and I've learned things about
time<00:05:43.659> I've<00:05:44.080> learned<00:05:44.409> how<00:05:44.590> resilient<00:05:44.979> it<00:05:45.279> is

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
time I've learned how resilient it is

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.969 
time I've learned how resilient it is
I've<00:05:46.300> learned<00:05:46.690> how<00:05:46.900> it's<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:47.289> opposite<00:05:47.860> of

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
I've learned how it's the opposite of

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.330 
I've learned how it's the opposite of
the<00:05:48.130> butterfly<00:05:48.880> effect<00:05:49.229> meaning<00:05:50.229> that<00:05:50.560> little

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
the butterfly effect meaning that little

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.100 
the butterfly effect meaning that little
things<00:05:51.580> in<00:05:51.969> the<00:05:52.060> butterfly<00:05:52.330> effect<00:05:52.630> in<00:05:53.020> a

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
things in the butterfly effect in a

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.209 
things in the butterfly effect in a
sense<00:05:53.380> changes<00:05:54.250> big<00:05:55.120> things<00:05:55.419> it<00:05:56.380> takes<00:05:56.620> just

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
sense changes big things it takes just

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.879 
sense changes big things it takes just
the<00:05:57.370> opposite<00:05:57.940> a<00:05:58.319> horrendous<00:05:59.319> amount<00:05:59.560> of

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
the opposite a horrendous amount of

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.760 
the opposite a horrendous amount of
energy<00:06:00.250> in<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.389> past<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:02.080> change<00:06:02.409> the

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
energy in the past the change the

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.040 
energy in the past the change the
smallest<00:06:03.219> thing<00:06:03.669> that<00:06:04.300> happens<00:06:04.750> in<00:06:04.960> the

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
smallest thing that happens in the

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.050 
smallest thing that happens in the
future<00:06:05.229> timers<00:06:05.919> is<00:06:06.279> resilient<00:06:06.880> it's

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
future timers is resilient it's

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.420 
future timers is resilient it's
resistant<00:06:07.690> it<00:06:08.229> doesn't<00:06:08.650> want<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.889> change<00:06:08.949> and

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
resistant it doesn't want to change and

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.249 
resistant it doesn't want to change and
then<00:06:10.029> I'll<00:06:10.150> just<00:06:10.330> share<00:06:10.569> a<00:06:10.630> little<00:06:10.750> bit<00:06:10.990> of<00:06:11.139> the

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
then I'll just share a little bit of the

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.800 
then I'll just share a little bit of the
