00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
computer let it retry to charge so after

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
computer let it retry to charge so after
a<00:00:49.379> few<00:00:49.590> hours<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.980> charging<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.850> fully

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
a few hours of charging it was fully

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.630 
a few hours of charging it was fully
charged<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> asks<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.829> discharge<00:00:53.190> it

three<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.120> times<00:00:54.359> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:54.930> recharge<00:00:55.500> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
three more times and then recharge it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.950 
three more times and then recharge it
you<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.609> we<00:00:57.390> did<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> what<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you know so we did the what the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
you know so we did the what the
instructions<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.010> put<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.340> there<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.789> each

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
instructions are I put in there and each

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.330 
instructions are I put in there and each
time<00:01:00.300> seems<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.559> gets<00:01:01.710> around<00:01:01.890> two<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
time seems like it gets around two and a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.579 
time seems like it gets around two and a
half<00:01:02.429> hours<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.019> battery<00:01:04.019> time<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.440> there

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
half hours of battery time in there

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
half hours of battery time in there
let's<00:01:04.800> see<00:01:04.920> how<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.070> fit<00:01:05.399> goes<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.940> this<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
let's see how the fit goes on this and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.580 
let's see how the fit goes on this and
the<00:01:07.560> fit<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.479> look<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.720> snaps<00:01:10.140> right<00:01:10.380> into

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the fit is look at that snaps right into

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.210 
the fit is look at that snaps right into
place<00:01:10.710> had<00:01:11.670> no<00:01:11.940> problems<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:13.039> charging<00:01:14.039> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
place had no problems with charging I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.359 
place had no problems with charging I
didn't<00:01:14.399> get<00:01:14.520> any<00:01:14.640> weird<00:01:14.910> charging<00:01:16.069> errors<00:01:17.069> or

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
didn't get any weird charging errors or

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.309 
didn't get any weird charging errors or
anything<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.849> that<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> computer<00:01:18.899> you

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319 
anything like that so the computer you

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.870 
anything like that so the computer you
know<00:01:19.349> the<00:01:19.830> BIOS<00:01:20.160> picked<00:01:20.399> it<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.610> just

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
know the BIOS picked it up just

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.029 
know the BIOS picked it up just
perfectly<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.319> one<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.709> the<00:01:22.800> things

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
perfectly and that's one of the things

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.010 
perfectly and that's one of the things
you<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.490> check<00:01:23.700> because<00:01:23.940> if<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.360> buy<00:01:24.780> one

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
you want to check because if you buy one

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.449 
you want to check because if you buy one
of<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.229> batteries<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.770> bias<00:01:26.069> might<00:01:26.310> not

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459 
of the batteries your bias might not

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.580 
of the batteries your bias might not
pick<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.209> reject<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.410> one

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
pick it up in and reject it this one

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
pick it up in and reject it this one
went<00:01:28.890> perfect<00:01:29.399> so<00:01:29.940> what<00:01:30.179> I'll<00:01:30.330> do<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.599> the
