00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.990
 hi friends youtube today in kitchen with 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.160
 davis let's prepare cheese 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.950
 crunchy 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.660
 ingredients 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.260
 successes in portions breadcrumbs egg and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.260
 sunflower oil 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.810
 we started separating the cheeses that 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.740
 they must be cold in the fridge 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.710
 first we passed them through bread crumbs 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.990
 then I'll whip the egg and again 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.700
 for breadcrumbs so there is a 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.370
 crunchy breaded 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.649
 we have to do this step with each one 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.810
 of them and reserve them 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.780
 once they are all fried in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.630
 oil in my case of sunflower but 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.119
 it can also be olive we will fry them 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.780
 in hot oil until they catch a 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:25.000
 golden color and crisp 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.000
 We give them back slowly 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.359
 when they are ready we take them out to a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.409
 dish with absorbent paper to remove 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.950
 the excess of fat 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.020
 and we have our successes ready 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.689
 they are very good they can be accompanied 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.090
 with the sauce that you like the most I have 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.939
 chosen this time I've done but I 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.690
 it comes well a mayonnaise an alioli a 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.620
 barbecue or the one you like the most 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.620
 until next time
