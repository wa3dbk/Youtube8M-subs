motorcycles is I would have to say it is
tire<00:00:11.010> pressure<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.580> would<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.570> amazed<00:00:12.840> how

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
tire pressure you would be amazed how

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.839 
tire pressure you would be amazed how
many<00:00:13.139> people<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.860> see<00:00:14.040> up<00:00:14.130> there<00:00:14.309> who<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.580> low

have to punch around because it's not

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.880 
have to punch around because it's not
always<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.100> obvious<00:01:00.410> this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> number

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
always that obvious this is the number

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.779 
always that obvious this is the number
we<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.370> here

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
we want right here

the psi number two pounds per square

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700 
the psi number two pounds per square
inch<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.360> says<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.840> maximum<00:01:07.650> of

inch and this one says a maximum of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.820 
inch and this one says a maximum of
maximum<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.670> 42<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.380> means<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.710> we're

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
maximum of 42 so that means that we're

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.500 
maximum of 42 so that means that we're
looking<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.159> around<00:01:11.250> 42<00:01:11.880> pounds<00:01:12.180> per<00:01:12.479> square

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
looking at around 42 pounds per square

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
looking at around 42 pounds per square
inch<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> tire<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.189> need<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
inch in the tire so you need to get a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.190 
inch in the tire so you need to get a
tire<00:01:15.000> gauge<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.540> that's<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:15.990> need<00:01:16.110> to

lightning and these low-profile tires on

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.389 
lightning and these low-profile tires on
some<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> these<00:01:55.470> sport<00:01:55.770> bikes<00:01:56.009> make<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
some of these sport bikes make it a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.789 
some of these sport bikes make it a
little<00:01:56.820> harder<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.420> find<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.680> information

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
little harder to find the information

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.319 
little harder to find the information
that<00:01:59.100> we're<00:01:59.280> looking<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.700> but<00:01:59.880> tire<00:02:00.060> pressure

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
that we're looking for but tire pressure

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.600 
that we're looking for but tire pressure
but<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.320> look<00:02:01.500> real<00:02:01.680> hard<00:02:01.710> you'll<00:02:02.159> find<00:02:02.430> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
but if you look real hard you'll find it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.530 
but if you look real hard you'll find it
I<00:02:03.170> can<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> right<00:02:04.710> here<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.070> front<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.369> us

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
I can see it right here in front of us

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.000 
I can see it right here in front of us
42<00:02:06.540> psi<00:02:07.079> cold

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.960 

so<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.100> want<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.280> be<00:02:12.400> really<00:02:12.580> particular

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
so you want to be really particular

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.520 
so you want to be really particular
about<00:02:13.000> your<00:02:13.270> tire<00:02:13.510> pressure<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.170> want<00:02:14.410> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
about your tire pressure you want to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.900 
about your tire pressure you want to
make<00:02:14.620> sure<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> good<00:02:15.370> gauge<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.790> you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
make sure you have a good gauge that you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.180 
make sure you have a good gauge that you
can<00:02:16.060> use<00:02:16.210> don't<00:02:17.170> trust<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> ones<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.070> you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
can use don't trust the ones that you

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.520 
can use don't trust the ones that you
get<00:02:18.340> at<00:02:18.400> your<00:02:18.610> local<00:02:18.670> gas<00:02:19.060> station<00:02:19.570> those<00:02:20.200> tire

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
get at your local gas station those tire

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.800 
get at your local gas station those tire
gauges<00:02:21.190> have<00:02:21.340> been<00:02:21.490> beat<00:02:21.730> around<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.420> used<00:02:22.630> so

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
gauges have been beat around and used so

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.390 
gauges have been beat around and used so
much<00:02:22.960> that<00:02:23.200> they're<00:02:23.920> probably<00:02:24.100> not<00:02:24.340> even

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
much that they're probably not even

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.070 
much that they're probably not even
accurate<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.330> don't<00:02:25.570> pick<00:02:25.690> yourself<00:02:25.990> up

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
accurate so don't pick yourself up

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.660 
accurate so don't pick yourself up
something<00:02:26.380> decent<00:02:26.530> here<00:02:27.220> are<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> couple<00:02:27.370> of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
something decent here are a couple of

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.120 
something decent here are a couple of
different<00:02:28.000> types<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:29.560> one<00:02:29.740> here<00:02:29.950> which<00:02:30.100> is

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
different types this one here which is

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.910 
different types this one here which is
an<00:02:30.340> analogue<00:02:30.700> one<00:02:31.030> pressure<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.440> could<00:02:32.680> put

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
an analogue one pressure you could put

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.050 
an analogue one pressure you could put
it<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.160> valve<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.520> can<00:02:33.610> check<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:33.970> it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
it on the valve you can check it and it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.430 
it on the valve you can check it and it
the<00:02:34.300> dial<00:02:34.540> tells<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:34.960> your<00:02:35.080> pressure<00:02:35.260> is

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
the dial tells you what your pressure is

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.430 
the dial tells you what your pressure is
and<00:02:35.710> this<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.850> digital<00:02:37.090> type<00:02:37.450> now<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.230> type

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
and this is a digital type now this type

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.130 
and this is a digital type now this type
is<00:02:38.590> kind<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:38.890> nice<00:02:39.040> because<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:40.270> lot<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:41.050> these

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
is kind of nice because a lot of these

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.930 
is kind of nice because a lot of these
motorcycles<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.190> tough<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.580> get<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.820> around

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
motorcycles it's tough to get in around

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.720 
motorcycles it's tough to get in around
the<00:02:43.330> spokes<00:02:43.630> or<00:02:43.960> you<00:02:44.350> know<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.590> rims<00:02:44.800> to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the spokes or you know the rims to

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.960 
the spokes or you know the rims to
actually<00:02:46.330> get<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.600> tire<00:02:47.110> pressure<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:48.100> we

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
actually get the tire pressure so we

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.270 
actually get the tire pressure so we
using<00:02:49.180> something<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.830> may<00:02:50.980> get<00:02:51.160> it

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
using something like this you may get it

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.770 
using something like this you may get it
into<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.580> spokes<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.000> push<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.300> down<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.630> get

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
into the spokes and push it down and get

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.360 
into the spokes and push it down and get
it<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.200> get<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.380> reading<00:02:53.590> but<00:02:53.830> then<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.160> can't

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
it and get a reading but then you can't

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.310 
it and get a reading but then you can't
see<00:02:54.550> if<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.790> can't<00:02:55.690> get<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:55.960> before<00:02:56.260> you

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
see if you can't get it out before you

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.560 
see if you can't get it out before you
can<00:02:56.350> see<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.620> wear<00:02:57.130> something<00:02:57.430> like<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:57.760> it

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
can see it wear something like this it

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.630 
can see it wear something like this it
will<00:02:58.780> take<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.290> reading<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.710> save<00:03:00.400> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
will take the reading and save the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.100 
will take the reading and save the
reading<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.150> screen<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.780> ten

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
reading on the screen so that ten

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.360 
reading on the screen so that ten
seconds<00:03:02.440> later<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.710> can<00:03:02.830> take<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.100> out<00:03:03.190> and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
seconds later you can take it out and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.130 
seconds later you can take it out and
you<00:03:03.820> can<00:03:03.910> still<00:03:04.180> see<00:03:04.390> what<00:03:04.570> was<00:03:04.690> on<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.930> gauge

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
you can still see what was on the gauge

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.110 
you can still see what was on the gauge
so<00:03:05.470> I'd<00:03:05.590> recommend<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:06.040> digital<00:03:06.370> one<00:03:06.460> and<00:03:06.760> I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
so I'd recommend a digital one and I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.630 
so I'd recommend a digital one and I
would<00:03:07.330> imagine<00:03:08.010> technology<00:03:09.010> it's<00:03:09.370> probably

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
would imagine technology it's probably

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.250 
would imagine technology it's probably
more<00:03:09.730> accurate<00:03:10.150> than<00:03:10.270> an<00:03:10.780> analogue<00:03:11.110> one

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
more accurate than an analogue one

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.350 
more accurate than an analogue one
anyway<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.740> don't<00:03:11.950> maybe<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:12.910> I

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
anyway I don't maybe it is it but I

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.020 
anyway I don't maybe it is it but I
think<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.990> is<00:03:14.110> anyway<00:03:14.920> take<00:03:15.490> your<00:03:15.640> check<00:03:15.940> your

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
think it is anyway take your check your

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.880 
think it is anyway take your check your
tire<00:03:16.180> pressure<00:03:16.240> every<00:03:16.660> day<00:03:16.690> every<00:03:17.650> time<00:03:17.680> you

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
tire pressure every day every time you

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.990 
tire pressure every day every time you
ride<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.250> never<00:03:18.430> know<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.700> might<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:18.940> a

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
ride you never know you might have a

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.880 
ride you never know you might have a
small<00:03:19.240> leak<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.660> before<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
small leak and before you know it the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.340 
small leak and before you know it the
rear<00:03:21.100> end<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> bikes<00:03:21.490> gonna<00:03:21.670> for<00:03:21.880> money

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
rear end of the bikes gonna for money
