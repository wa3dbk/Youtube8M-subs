00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
something easy and something I'm

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.839 
something easy and something I'm
actually<00:00:12.780> kind<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.170> cool<00:00:13.349> today<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:14.730> this

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
actually kind of cool today so what this

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.550 
actually kind of cool today so what this
is<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> TT<00:00:15.750> eSports<00:00:17.840> Hyperion<00:00:18.840> headphone

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
is is the TT eSports Hyperion headphone

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.070 
is is the TT eSports Hyperion headphone
cradle<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.570> basically<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
cradle so basically it's just a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.109 
cradle so basically it's just a
headphone<00:00:22.380> stand<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.340> simple<00:00:23.820> product

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
headphone stand so very simple product

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.189 
headphone stand so very simple product
but<00:00:24.769> you<00:00:25.769> know<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.160> most<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.490> us<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:26.970> have

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
but you know for most of us we all have

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.300 
but you know for most of us we all have
gaming<00:00:28.199> headphones<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.130> kind<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
gaming headphones that we just kind of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.980 
gaming headphones that we just kind of
like<00:00:29.490> throw<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.060> desk<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.660> doesn't

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
like throw on the desk and it doesn't

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.910 
like throw on the desk and it doesn't
look<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:32.149> nice<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
look that nice when we do that so you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
look that nice when we do that so you
know<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.219> much<00:00:35.430> cooler<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
know it's much cooler when you have it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.819 
know it's much cooler when you have it
on<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.360> stand<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> actually

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
on a stand and this is actually

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.310 
on a stand and this is actually
something<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.219> saw<00:00:38.399> over<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:38.879> CES<00:00:39.780> earlier<00:00:40.170> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
something I saw over at CES earlier this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
something I saw over at CES earlier this
year<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.860> guess<00:00:41.790> they're<00:00:41.969> coming<00:00:42.270> out<00:00:42.690> with

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
year and guess they're coming out with

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.319 
year and guess they're coming out with
it<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.579> coming<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.270> now

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
it now I think it's coming out right now

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.869 
it now I think it's coming out right now
about<00:00:46.079> nineteen<00:00:46.530> twenty<00:00:46.920> dollars<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.610> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
about nineteen twenty dollars or so so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.209 
about nineteen twenty dollars or so so
it's<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.149> too<00:00:48.329> bad<00:00:48.680> over<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.039> take<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it's not too bad over here we can take a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.069 
it's not too bad over here we can take a
look<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> looks<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.600> here's<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
look at the looks like here's the

look at the looks like here's the
install<00:00:52.500> process<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.219> mean<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.000> fairly<00:00:54.539> easy

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
install process I mean it's fairly easy

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.500

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
into the base and you can see

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.959 
into the base and you can see

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.770 
from spills wear and tear dirt and other
damage<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:11.090> bunch<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> different<00:01:12.450> languages

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
damage so a bunch of different languages

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.929 
damage so a bunch of different languages
let's<00:01:12.960> open<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.590> let's<00:01:14.100> take<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> look<00:01:14.549> at

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
let's open it up let's take a look at

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.370 
let's open it up let's take a look at
what's<00:01:15.150> inside<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.780> should<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.140> pretty

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
what's inside this should be pretty

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.969 
what's inside this should be pretty
quick<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.240> just<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.740> should

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
quick and just go from there I should

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.560 
quick and just go from there I should
probably<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.700> pair<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> headphones<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
probably get a pair of headphones to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.830 
probably get a pair of headphones to
actually<00:01:22.189> test<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.310> thing<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.670> because<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
actually test this thing out because it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.039 
actually test this thing out because it
seems<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.950> should<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:27.049> seems

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
seems like it should have that seems

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.590 
seems like it should have that seems
like<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.320> should<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.619> testing<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> pair

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
like I should be testing it with a pair

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.440 
like I should be testing it with a pair
of<00:01:30.630> headphones<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.090> looks<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.329> get

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
of headphones here so looks like we get

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.130 
of headphones here so looks like we get
the<00:01:33.600> base<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.350> couple<00:01:34.710> clips<00:01:35.810> these<00:01:36.810> two

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the base here a couple clips these two

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.130 
the base here a couple clips these two
arms<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:39.000> some<00:01:39.509> documentation

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
arms here and also some documentation

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.030 
arms here and also some documentation
which<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.310> warranty<00:01:41.670> policy<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
which is just a warranty policy and the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.910 
which is just a warranty policy and the
installation<00:01:44.700> should<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.000> pretty<00:01:45.409> obvious<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
installation should be pretty obvious so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.130 
installation should be pretty obvious so
I'm<00:01:47.310> gonna<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.759> could<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.450> video

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
I'm gonna see if I could do it on video

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.260 
I'm gonna see if I could do it on video
right<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:51.950> we<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.220> pause<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
right here if not we will pause the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.890 
right here if not we will pause the
video<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:56.869> do<00:01:57.869> it

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
video and do it

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:09.040
