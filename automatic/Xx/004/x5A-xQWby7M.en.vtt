explained<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.259> plane<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.219> transit

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
explained that this plane was in transit

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.560 
explained that this plane was in transit
on<00:02:02.850> route<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.420> London<00:02:04.189> Gatwick<00:02:05.299> what<00:02:06.299> are<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
on route to London Gatwick what are the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.510 
on route to London Gatwick what are the
theories<00:02:07.020> though<00:02:07.500> at<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> moment<00:02:07.829> about<00:02:08.220> why

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
theories though at the moment about why

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.400 
theories though at the moment about why
this<00:02:08.580> might<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.209> come<00:02:09.629> down<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.020> these

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this might have come down because these

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.350 
this might have come down because these
planes<00:02:10.709> will<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.400> been<00:02:11.580> flying<00:02:11.849> heavily<00:02:12.209> for

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
planes will have been flying heavily for

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.180 
planes will have been flying heavily for
a<00:02:12.420> few<00:02:12.629> weeks

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
a few weeks

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.920 
a few weeks
after<00:02:13.640> being<00:02:13.790> disrupted<00:02:14.420> because<00:02:14.570> of<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
after being disrupted because of the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.110 
after being disrupted because of the
volcanic<00:02:15.260> ash<00:02:15.590> cloud<00:02:15.830> for<00:02:16.190> example<00:02:17.410> well<00:02:19.120> some

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
volcanic ash cloud for example well some

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.930 
volcanic ash cloud for example well some
effort<00:02:20.480> here<00:02:20.660> like<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.610> should<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.760> probably

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
effort here like I should just probably

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.030 
effort here like I should just probably
put<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.390> into<00:02:23.600> context<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.410> Libyan<00:02:24.740> airline

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
put it into context the Libyan airline

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.310 
put it into context the Libyan airline
offered<00:02:25.370> here<00:02:25.870> often<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:27.290> flies<00:02:28.300> I'll<00:02:29.300> try<00:02:30.260> to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
offered here often of flies I'll try to

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.530 
offered here often of flies I'll try to
add<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> consonants<00:02:31.220> obviously<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.390> also

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
add the consonants obviously but it also

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.430 
add the consonants obviously but it also
takes<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.960> lot<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.140> passengers<00:02:33.740> from<00:02:34.700> Tripoli

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
takes a lot of passengers from Tripoli

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.080 
takes a lot of passengers from Tripoli
often<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.590> Europe<00:02:36.920> either<00:02:37.130> London<00:02:37.910> or

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
often to Europe either London or

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.210 
often to Europe either London or
Brussels<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.860> there<00:02:40.010> are<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.100> lot<00:02:40.130> of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
Brussels and so there are a lot of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.870 
Brussels and so there are a lot of
transit<00:02:40.760> flights<00:02:41.620> one<00:02:42.620> thing<00:02:42.920> was<00:02:43.190> disrupted

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
transit flights one thing was disrupted

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.020 
transit flights one thing was disrupted
as<00:02:44.120> two<00:02:44.360> weeks<00:02:44.570> ago<00:02:44.900> when<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:46.130> entire<00:02:46.430> UK

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
as two weeks ago when the entire UK

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.020 
as two weeks ago when the entire UK
airspace<00:02:47.210> was<00:02:47.780> shut<00:02:48.050> down<00:02:48.080> for<00:02:48.830> about<00:02:49.730> six

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
airspace was shut down for about six

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.930 
airspace was shut down for about six
days<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.890> their<00:02:51.890> flights<00:02:52.160> word<00:02:52.370> started<00:02:52.850> at

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
days so their flights word started at

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.820 
days so their flights word started at
the<00:02:53.030> time<00:02:53.270> but<00:02:54.020> since<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:54.500> they've<00:02:54.680> been

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the time but since then they've been

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.520 
the time but since then they've been
operating<00:02:54.980> normally<00:02:55.550> since<00:02:56.030> airspace<00:02:56.540> opened

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
operating normally since airspace opened

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.460 
operating normally since airspace opened
again<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.970> flight<00:02:59.450> as<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.750> said<00:02:59.990> was<00:03:00.170> coming

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
again this flight as I said was coming

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.590 
again this flight as I said was coming
from<00:03:00.560> Johannesburg<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.060> then<00:03:02.210> going<00:03:02.480> up

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
from Johannesburg and then going up

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.000 
from Johannesburg and then going up
north<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:03.020> Tripoli

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
north to Tripoli

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.580 
north to Tripoli
so<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:05.210> volcanic<00:03:05.720> ash<00:03:05.840> cloud<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.440> I'm

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
so the volcanic ash cloud is I'm

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.070 
so the volcanic ash cloud is I'm
unlikely<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.490> have<00:03:07.610> played<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.150> role<00:03:08.690> in<00:03:08.720> this

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
unlikely to have played a role in this

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.840 
unlikely to have played a role in this
however<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.710> course<00:03:09.950> we<00:03:10.130> don't<00:03:10.250> know<00:03:10.460> because

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
however of course we don't know because

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.310 
however of course we don't know because
we<00:03:11.540> do<00:03:11.750> know<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.280> us<00:03:13.280> from<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.240> cloud<00:03:14.540> did

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
we do know that us from that cloud did

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.949 
we do know that us from that cloud did
affect<00:03:15.680> Moroccan<00:03:16.250> airspace<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.480> region

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
affect Moroccan airspace in this region

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.650 
affect Moroccan airspace in this region
yesterday<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.459> some<00:03:19.970> Moroccan<00:03:20.330> earth<00:03:20.450> was

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
yesterday and some Moroccan earth was

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.810 
yesterday and some Moroccan earth was
shot<00:03:21.110> down<00:03:21.320> yesterday<00:03:21.620> briefly<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.640> few

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
shot down yesterday briefly for a few

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.090 
shot down yesterday briefly for a few
hours<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.360> we<00:03:23.780> don't<00:03:23.959> know<00:03:24.140> if<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.800> affected

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
hours so we don't know if it affected

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.860 
hours so we don't know if it affected
Libyan<00:03:25.610> airspace<00:03:25.760> as<00:03:26.180> well<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.660> played

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
Libyan airspace as well and that played

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.190 
Libyan airspace as well and that played
a<00:03:26.900> factor<00:03:27.170> however<00:03:27.770> it<00:03:28.070> that's<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.239> it's<00:03:29.959> too

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
a factor however it that's just it's too

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.260 
a factor however it that's just it's too
