00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that you know it's just sedimentary

realize it but this algae or this film
that<00:01:55.290> coats<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.280> tank<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
that coats the the tank is actually a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.289 
that coats the the tank is actually a
good<00:01:57.240> thing<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.560> coats<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.040> flapper<00:01:59.490> which

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
good thing it it coats the flapper which

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.990 
good thing it it coats the flapper which
keeps<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.770> nice<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.520> watertight

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
keeps it you know a nice a watertight

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.980 
keeps it you know a nice a watertight
seal

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
seal

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.840 
seal
it<00:02:04.350> also<00:02:04.469> lubricates<00:02:05.009> some<00:02:05.159> parts<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it also lubricates some parts like the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.540 
it also lubricates some parts like the
refill<00:02:06.210> float<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.409> also<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.160> really<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
refill float and also it really is a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.979 
refill float and also it really is a
good<00:02:08.700> thing<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.209> natural<00:02:09.420> occurring

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
good thing and it's a natural occurring

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.110 
good thing and it's a natural occurring
thing<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.190> side<00:02:11.430> effect<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
thing but the one side effect is that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.700 
thing but the one side effect is that
you<00:02:12.420> know<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.599> get<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> smell<00:02:13.050> from<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.500> we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
you know you get a smell from it so we

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.620 
you know you get a smell from it so we
remove<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.520> stagnant<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.360> there<00:02:15.510> are

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
remove it if it's stagnant so there are

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.540 
remove it if it's stagnant so there are
several<00:02:15.870> solutions<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.620> use<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:17.430> this

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
several solutions you can use for this

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.550 
several solutions you can use for this
application<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.360> they're<00:02:18.480> usually<00:02:18.630> caustic

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
application and they're usually caustic

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.880

or<00:02:19.650> acidic<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.880> natural<00:02:21.330> ones<00:02:21.630> are<00:02:21.990> vinegar

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
or acidic the natural ones are vinegar

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.600 
or acidic the natural ones are vinegar
and<00:02:23.210> lemon<00:02:24.210> juice<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:25.710> obviously<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.340> lemon

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
really scrub it out but it's very

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.360 
really scrub it out but it's very
caustic<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.210> know<00:03:21.270> this<00:03:21.660> particular<00:03:22.370> mineral

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
caustic you know this particular mineral

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.940 
caustic you know this particular mineral
here<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.850> seems<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.390> high<00:03:24.600> iron<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
here it seems to be a high iron so the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.380 
here it seems to be a high iron so the
purpose<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.460> is<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.760> basically<00:03:26.940> clean

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390
