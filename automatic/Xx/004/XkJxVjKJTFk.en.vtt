00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
welcome to Jose RC pit today we had a

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.940 
welcome to Jose RC pit today we had a
request<00:00:02.939> from<00:00:03.090> Team<00:00:03.389> Blackhawk<00:00:03.899> fpv<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.799> do<00:00:04.920> a

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
request from Team Blackhawk fpv to do a

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.240 
request from Team Blackhawk fpv to do a
quick<00:00:05.549> review<00:00:05.730> on<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.589> setup<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.859> decided

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
quick review on the setup that I decided

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.089 
quick review on the setup that I decided
to<00:00:08.429> build<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.540> dx9<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.500> mount<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.920> ez

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
to build for the dx9 to mount to the ez

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.419 
to build for the dx9 to mount to the ez
UHF<00:00:11.730> TX<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.870> my<00:00:13.740> design<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.400> I

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
UHF TX and this is my design here what I

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.880 
UHF TX and this is my design here what I
actually<00:00:14.580> came<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.410> basically

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
actually came up with this is basically

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.150 
actually came up with this is basically
a<00:00:17.520> bracket<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.080> mount<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> back<00:00:19.830> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
a bracket that we mount to the back of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.609 
a bracket that we mount to the back of
the<00:00:20.430> dx9<00:00:20.880> here<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.240> some<00:00:21.420> padding<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.900> four

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the dx9 here with some padding and four

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
the dx9 here with some padding and four
little<00:00:22.740> bolts<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.850> nuts<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.330> hold<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.750> in

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
little bolts with nuts that hold this in

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.259 
little bolts with nuts that hold this in
place<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.160> also<00:00:26.340> built<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.820> nice

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
place and then we also built a nice

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.419 
place and then we also built a nice
kickstand<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.769> set<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.130> unit

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
kickstand here so when we set this unit

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.950 
kickstand here so when we set this unit
down<00:00:29.550> which<00:00:29.820> eventually<00:00:30.599> you're<00:00:30.689> gonna<00:00:30.750> have

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
down which eventually you're gonna have

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.150 
down which eventually you're gonna have
to<00:00:31.050> set<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> radio<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> bench<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to set the radio on a bench or the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680 
to set the radio on a bench or the
ground<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.520> something<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.510> don't

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
ground or something like that you don't

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
ground or something like that you don't
actually<00:00:33.840> damage<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:35.070> connector<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:35.940> which

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
actually damage the connector here which

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.860 
actually damage the connector here which
would<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.300> plugged<00:00:36.660> into<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.920> ez<00:00:38.070> UHF<00:00:38.690> like<00:00:39.690> as

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
would be plugged into the ez UHF like as

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900 
would be plugged into the ez UHF like as
you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:40.950> hitting<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you can see here that's not hitting the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.740 
you can see here that's not hitting the
ground<00:00:43.219> we<00:00:44.219> also<00:00:44.370> added<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.000> three<00:00:45.390> cell<00:00:45.570> lipo

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
ground we also added a three cell lipo

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.930 
ground we also added a three cell lipo
venom<00:00:46.379> pack<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.370> velcro<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
venom pack here with some velcro to the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.340 
venom pack here with some velcro to the
back<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:48.480> makes<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.930> nice<00:00:49.079> slim

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
back of this which makes it a nice slim

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.350 
back of this which makes it a nice slim
design<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.980> now<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:50.910> well<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.090> course<00:00:51.120> we

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
design and now then well of course we

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
design and now then well of course we
have<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> venom<00:00:51.840> monitor<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.920> monitor<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
have the venom monitor to monitor the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.700 
have the venom monitor to monitor the
battery<00:00:53.579> pack<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.390> sure<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.590> we

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
battery pack to make sure that you we

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
battery pack to make sure that you we
don't<00:00:55.800> under<00:00:56.039> fault<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> lipo<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> has

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
don't under fault the lipo and this has

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.660 
don't under fault the lipo and this has
an<00:00:57.329> alarm<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.010> loud<00:00:59.190> but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
an alarm on it and it's very loud but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.819 
an alarm on it and it's very loud but
will<00:01:00.120> warn<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.350> battery<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
will warn you when your battery is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.820 
will warn you when your battery is
getting<00:01:02.010> low<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.359> nice<00:01:03.899> thing<00:01:04.110> we

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
getting low which is a nice thing we

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590 
getting low which is a nice thing we
have<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> custom<00:01:05.790> cable<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> built

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
have here a custom cable that I built

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
have here a custom cable that I built
that<00:01:07.049> actually<00:01:07.380> plugs<00:01:07.619> into<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> trainer

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that actually plugs into the trainer

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.609 
that actually plugs into the trainer
port<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> balance<00:01:09.810> plug<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> go

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
port we have the balance plug here to go

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.670 
port we have the balance plug here to go
into<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.890> battery<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.939> put<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.680> instamorph

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
into the battery we put some instamorph

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
into the battery we put some instamorph
on<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.280> connector<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.909> give<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.060> some

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
on this connector here to give it some

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.880 
on this connector here to give it some
strength<00:01:15.570> since<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.200> pulling

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
strength since we're going to be pulling

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.710 
strength since we're going to be pulling
it<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.400> quite<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.450> don't<00:01:18.540> we

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it on and off quite a bit we don't we

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.910 
it on and off quite a bit we don't we
wanted<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.170> strain<00:01:19.439> relief<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
wanted some strain relief on that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730 
wanted some strain relief on that
because<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.850> basically<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.869> balance<00:01:22.350> plug

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
because this is basically a balance plug

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.340 
because this is basically a balance plug
extender<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.970> leads<00:01:24.210> were<00:01:24.420> just

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
extender and the leads were just

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
extender and the leads were just
basically<00:01:25.500> soldered<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> typical<00:01:26.790> heat

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
basically soldered on the typical heat

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.490 
basically soldered on the typical heat
with<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.540> heat<00:01:27.840> shrink<00:01:28.049> tubing<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.409> we

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
with a little heat shrink tubing so we

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.660 
with a little heat shrink tubing so we
want<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> make<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.340> tougher

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
want to make that a little bit tougher

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.910 
want to make that a little bit tougher
and<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.600> course<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.170> cable<00:01:31.560> comes<00:01:31.740> up

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and then of course the cable comes up

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.450 
and then of course the cable comes up
back<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.900> ez<00:01:34.409> UHF<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.189> inside

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
back here to the ez UHF and then inside

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
back here to the ez UHF and then inside
here<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.909> both<00:01:36.180> power<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.630> data<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
here we have both power and data for the

the the other design about the bracket

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.940 
the the other design about the bracket
is<00:02:24.629> as<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.140> see<00:02:25.290> when<00:02:25.650> you're<00:02:25.769> naturally

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
is as you can see when you're naturally

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
is pointing straight up I've seen a lot

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.860 
is pointing straight up I've seen a lot
of<00:02:30.720> people<00:02:31.019> actually<00:02:31.799> take<00:02:32.250> their<00:02:33.030> easy<00:02:33.239> UHF

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870

and mount it like this on the radio now
this<00:02:36.540> does<00:02:36.750> work<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.170> problems<00:02:37.470> when

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
this does work for the problems when

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.710 
this does work for the problems when
you're<00:02:37.680> flying<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.360> more<00:02:39.360> than<00:02:39.540> likely

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
you're flying like this more than likely

the blind spot of the antenna and you

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.050 
the blind spot of the antenna and you
really<00:02:52.769> really<00:02:52.799> want<00:02:53.280> your<00:02:53.459> antenna<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.910> be

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
really really want your antenna to be

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.039 
really really want your antenna to be

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
vertical towards your ear craft so we

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.649 
vertical towards your ear craft so we
pop<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.409> back<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.790> plug<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.450> back

between this and the radio so when

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.899 
between this and the radio so when
you're<00:03:09.840> flying<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:11.040> don't<00:03:11.220> get<00:03:11.310> any<00:03:11.730> near

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909

gps<00:04:23.700> we<00:04:23.880> would<00:04:24.000> just<00:04:24.150> pull<00:04:24.390> these<00:04:24.510> in<00:04:24.570> like

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
gps we would just pull these in like

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.159 
gps we would just pull these in like
this<00:04:25.080> or<00:04:25.440> like

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
this or like

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
or however you have it set up and and it

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.170 
or however you have it set up and and it
will<00:04:28.300> run<00:04:28.509> we<00:04:29.439> actually<00:04:29.889> have<00:04:30.099> all<00:04:30.939> of<00:04:31.120> our

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
will run we actually have all of our

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.119 
will run we actually have all of our
switches<00:04:31.569> programmed<00:04:32.039> to<00:04:35.039> four<00:04:36.039> different

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
switches programmed to four different

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.489 
switches programmed to four different
things<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.580> am<00:04:37.090> using<00:04:37.360> all<00:04:37.659> the<00:04:37.810> channels<00:04:38.229> for

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:38.499 
things I am using all the channels for

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.230 
things I am using all the channels for
the<00:04:38.650> gimbal<00:04:38.949> so<00:04:39.279> you<00:04:39.340> have<00:04:39.580> these<00:04:39.729> switches

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
the gimbal so you have these switches

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.269 
the gimbal so you have these switches
back<00:04:40.389> here<00:04:40.449> which<00:04:41.259> adjust<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.740> gimbal<00:04:42.099> and

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 
back here which adjust the gimbal and

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.399 
back here which adjust the gimbal and
the<00:04:42.460> one<00:04:42.610> on<00:04:42.759> this<00:04:42.879> side<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.330> don't<00:04:43.900> have<00:04:44.259> the

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
the one on this side I don't have the

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.790 
the one on this side I don't have the
extra<00:04:44.680> channel<00:04:45.129> for<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.870> one<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.740> the

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
extra channel for the the one of the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.189 
extra channel for the the one of the
flight<00:04:48.039> modes<00:04:48.249> so<00:04:48.460> we<00:04:48.580> just<00:04:48.759> basically<00:04:48.939> have

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.360 

we<00:04:53.199> just<00:04:53.409> have<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.680> three<00:04:53.889> flight<00:04:54.159> modes

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
we just have the three flight modes

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.179 
we just have the three flight modes
there<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:54.849> then<00:04:54.939> of<00:04:55.029> course<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.919> down<00:04:56.919> here

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:57.189 
there and then of course the down here

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.200 
there and then of course the down here
this<00:04:57.969> is<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.210> emergency<00:04:58.900> switch<00:04:59.370> and<00:05:00.370> then<00:05:01.180> we

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
this is the emergency switch and then we

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.649 
this is the emergency switch and then we
have<00:05:01.360> throttle<00:05:01.689> cuts<00:05:01.900> here<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:04.330> we<00:05:04.509> have

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
have throttle cuts here so we have

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.990 
have throttle cuts here so we have
everything<00:05:05.050> programmed<00:05:05.529> up<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:06.009> pretty<00:05:06.849> much

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
everything programmed up and pretty much

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.969 
everything programmed up and pretty much
ready<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.360> go<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:08.740> that's<00:05:09.490> pretty<00:05:09.879> much<00:05:10.000> it

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
ready to go and that's pretty much it

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.339 
ready to go and that's pretty much it
one<00:05:11.979> thing<00:05:12.159> I<00:05:12.219> forgot<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.490> mention<00:05:12.580> is<00:05:13.029> that

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
one thing I forgot to mention is that

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.950 
one thing I forgot to mention is that
when<00:05:14.349> you<00:05:14.620> are<00:05:15.060> going<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.180> put<00:05:16.360> this<00:05:16.509> in<00:05:16.750> the

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
when you are going to put this in the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.689 
when you are going to put this in the
spectrum<00:05:17.889> box<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.969> can<00:05:19.210> remove<00:05:20.189> this<00:05:21.189> unit

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
spectrum box you can remove this unit

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.480 
spectrum box you can remove this unit
here<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.180> this<00:05:22.930> as<00:05:23.259> you<00:05:23.500> can<00:05:23.680> see<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.099> antenna

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
here and this as you can see the antenna

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.980 
here and this as you can see the antenna
is<00:05:24.789> approximately<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.419> same<00:05:25.569> height<00:05:25.810> as<00:05:25.960> the

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
is approximately the same height as the

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.739 
is approximately the same height as the
bracket<00:05:26.409> so<00:05:26.830> this<00:05:27.009> will<00:05:27.219> fit<00:05:27.490> in<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:27.789> in<00:05:28.270> the

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:28.749 
bracket so this will fit in the in the

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.350 
bracket so this will fit in the in the
spectrum<00:05:29.199> om<00:05:29.770> box<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.789> cover<00:05:30.969> will<00:05:31.180> close

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
spectrum om box and the cover will close

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.110 
spectrum om box and the cover will close
and<00:05:31.629> everything<00:05:32.020> will<00:05:32.139> fit<00:05:32.259> nicely<00:05:32.469> and<00:05:33.120> you

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
and everything will fit nicely and you

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.290 
and everything will fit nicely and you
can<00:05:34.270> actually<00:05:34.419> put<00:05:34.779> this<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.379> the<00:05:35.819> radio<00:05:36.819> you

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
can actually put this and the radio you

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.399 
can actually put this and the radio you
have<00:05:37.449> to<00:05:37.569> take<00:05:37.689> the<00:05:37.810> antenna<00:05:38.050> off<00:05:38.139> here<00:05:38.319> of

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
have to take the antenna off here of

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.589 
have to take the antenna off here of
course<00:05:38.589> will<00:05:39.279> all<00:05:39.460> fit<00:05:39.669> in<00:05:39.849> the<00:05:40.029> spectrum

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
course will all fit in the spectrum

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.619 
course will all fit in the spectrum
radio<00:05:41.169> box<00:05:41.550> so<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:42.580> was<00:05:42.819> another<00:05:43.060> great

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
radio box so that was another great

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:53.700 
radio box so that was another great
thing<00:05:43.870> about<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.229> design<00:05:52.199> so<00:05:53.199> here<00:05:53.439> is<00:05:53.529> the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
thing about the design so here is the

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.010 
thing about the design so here is the
spectrum<00:05:54.279> box<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.789> then<00:05:55.149> as<00:05:55.389> you<00:05:55.539> can<00:05:55.659> see<00:05:55.870> we

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
spectrum box and then as you can see we

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.619 
spectrum box and then as you can see we
have<00:05:56.259> the<00:05:56.529> cables<00:05:57.099> disconnected<00:05:57.759> here<00:05:58.000> we<00:05:58.449> can

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
have the cables disconnected here we can

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.450 
have the cables disconnected here we can
leave<00:05:58.779> the<00:05:58.899> battery<00:05:59.139> pack<00:05:59.379> on<00:05:59.589> there<00:05:59.800> or<00:06:00.009> we

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
leave the battery pack on there or we

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.950 
leave the battery pack on there or we
can<00:06:00.490> actually<00:06:00.879> take<00:06:01.089> it<00:06:01.120> off<00:06:01.349> and<00:06:03.659> as<00:06:04.659> you<00:06:04.750> can

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
can actually take it off and as you can

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.059 
can actually take it off and as you can
see<00:06:05.020> that<00:06:05.289> fits<00:06:05.469> in<00:06:05.560> there<00:06:05.649> like<00:06:05.800> that

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
see that fits in there like that

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.899 
see that fits in there like that
we<00:06:06.669> take<00:06:06.879> our<00:06:07.800> diamond<00:06:08.800> antenna<00:06:09.189> off<00:06:09.460> of<00:06:09.729> the

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
we take our diamond antenna off of the

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.839 
we take our diamond antenna off of the
EZ<00:06:10.449> UHF<00:06:11.050> we<00:06:11.169> can<00:06:11.319> set<00:06:11.529> that<00:06:11.680> in<00:06:11.830> there<00:06:12.009> and<00:06:12.250> then

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
EZ UHF we can set that in there and then

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.480 
EZ UHF we can set that in there and then
we<00:06:13.000> set<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.240> antenna<00:06:13.599> in<00:06:13.839> here

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
we set the antenna in here

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.670 
we set the antenna in here
like<00:06:15.490> this<00:06:15.729> and<00:06:16.110> as<00:06:17.110> you<00:06:17.169> can<00:06:17.349> see<00:06:17.409> there's

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
like this and as you can see there's

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.899 
like this and as you can see there's
enough<00:06:17.919> clearance<00:06:18.069> there<00:06:18.399> for<00:06:18.520> that<00:06:18.639> antenna

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
enough clearance there for that antenna

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.300 
enough clearance there for that antenna
and<00:06:19.560> everything<00:06:20.560> fits<00:06:20.800> nicely<00:06:21.039> in<00:06:21.279> your

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
and everything fits nicely in your

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.809 
and everything fits nicely in your
spectrum<00:06:21.610> box<00:06:22.979> if<00:06:23.979> you<00:06:24.219> have<00:06:24.310> any<00:06:24.460> questions
