the government can print money why
doesn't<00:00:06.609> it<00:00:06.670> just<00:00:06.729> print<00:00:07.330> some<00:00:07.540> and<00:00:07.720> hand<00:00:07.870> it

sometimes<00:00:16.180> we<00:00:16.420> forget<00:00:16.660> what<00:00:17.380> money<00:00:17.560> is<00:00:17.970> let's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
sometimes we forget what money is let's

sometimes we forget what money is let's
go<00:00:19.150> back<00:00:19.359> and<00:00:19.630> look<00:00:20.019> at<00:00:20.170> why<00:00:20.470> money<00:00:20.769> was

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
go back and look at why money was

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.650 
go back and look at why money was
invented<00:00:22.679> before<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:24.009> invention<00:00:24.250> of<00:00:24.490> money
