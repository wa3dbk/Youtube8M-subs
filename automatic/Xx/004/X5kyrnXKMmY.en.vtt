00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.470
 in this scheme 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.760
 Apart from being in Spain 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 I hope it is 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.559
 this law is expected 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.179
 ssp

 they are better at the most relevant oriental comic fact right now in 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.409
 Asturias 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:52.289
 comes to such a point is what influence those who are engaged concentrations of 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.349
 manga and anime fans in 10 million inhabitants 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.189
 with an assistance dress increasingly higher as the years pass 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.999
 even in events intended to start in international haldeman with 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.089
 missiles by madrid comic the role that manga plays has become 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.329
 protagonist in the last three years 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.120
 we talk about a phenomenon that act and my granddaughter who lives with more and more 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:19.079
 strength in different artistic representations has a vast practice 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.119
 of the cosplay as it is commonly called here is that if that desire for characters 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.709
 of comics especially manga and anime a colleague is going to break 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.029
 shakespeare but in this matter of water through varied 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.299
 so that everyone can see well 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.379
 but what is this that you like the prophet for Moscow I do not know 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.249
 for I just like nobody but have them at the hand of people always 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.389
 he has disguised himself as eta characters 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.459
 from God in the faith generations for example several works that moved 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.769
 of the thunder captain and they played to be thunder captain and there was nothing wrong with 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.019
 in fact there are people who think that this is bad but I do not think 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.539
 gimeno distribute Japanese material that is to say we have exported almost a culture 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.949
 a kind of dependence as he once stressed that it has been exported 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.169
 because everyone in general wants to feel like a biblical character 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.859
 if everyone in fact the only thing that they have exported would originate the 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.629
 actually the courage to do it 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.549
 an exam that has been kind of cool wind to the picture but let's say 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.759
 that the people 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.289
 Although I did not see the exit to Japan, people would disguise themselves. 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.139
 a single character with whom to feel identified 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.400
 it was people disguise themselves and when trying to imitate 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.650
 it is shameful because the truth is when you are encouraged by shameful permanyer varas 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.440
 underpants as agreed na so shame six lines what 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.400
 comfortable and what you have to see 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.870
 shame really none because he does not have to have it 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.559
 we live in an increasingly globalized world 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.630
 is what many may think this globalization 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.389
 goes hand in hand with the United States 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.809
 a growing space is being created for the eastern world 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:54.669
 we have a world style house 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.129
 to the current technologies 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.580
 also accompany those who estimate the crime of video games is influenza in 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.020
 the world of cinema 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.059
 Japan is exporting part of its culture to the rest of the world 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.110
 and it has been very well received 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.199
 who knows tomorrow 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.189
 this great economic power 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:12.450
 take the reins 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.439
