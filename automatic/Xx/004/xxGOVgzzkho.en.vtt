00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 because gets to go back and indeed 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.960
 I have a new skin on the pps today 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.250
 has a bit of share a few days ago 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.019
 took her to imagine 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 because of gamescom but here is final 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.830
 boss continues to go the next ultimate 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.210
 the two are never completely operated 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.139
 and I have to say he likes me 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.390
 really good I have nothing 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.590
 and watch it timely and you'll be 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.090
 Of course, I show it now, too, and we 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.090
 catch as always offers 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.880
 yes that was once the mods really 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.200
 very cool and i started directly 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.110
 with the first play namely that of the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.020
 strike comes so small you can say 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.309
 as luchs has definitely repeated 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.920
 ikea continues on second world data 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.509
 men really looks very cool 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.509
 nationally and why is from the matrix 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.970
 son dates strictly brother comes and 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.259
 opponent then but of course still done 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.800
 the third game that is possibly 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.100
 tear 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.729
 that is the stand really cool too 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.810
 Again, this matter skin funnier 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.440
 is when you are with someone pure 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.310
 overloaded 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.390
 then you get ap and that 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.580
 is there again in this 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.410
 magic wand plus symbol how to do that 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.180
 recognize earlier from old arcade games 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.369
 or knows how to play from old roles 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.679
 made a pretty cool I find on 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.880
 every case very cool 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.330
 and if the looks did not run away who 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.170
 now feels that too 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.270
 multimedia cow the same I'll show you 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.910
 also in this in this skin previews 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.590
 and the detonation had become 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.150
 some people already last time 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.990
 desired that the times but please 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.780
 should show 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.360
 and now we'll do it uli zack 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.220
 a huge cube are really very 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.649
 Nice must say and then comes to 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.189
 good last of course still the death 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.189
 animation 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.680
 he really burst into small cubes 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.120
 they did not do themselves bad 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.240
 I really like a lot of effort 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 really good and I'm curious how 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.720
 Many people then call with the refusal 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.890
 will always be honest 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.960
 not so much if he often 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.580
 of course I have the 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.020
 do not forget to recall animation 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.080
 Of course, I'll take care of you now 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.780
 show that too, of course 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.040
 always extremely important and I would 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.650
 also very cool guy on his 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.300
 controller becomes a small portal and 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.950
 because the little one was really through now 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.900
 bouncing made really cool so well 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.760
 I really like deschamps 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.650
 a beautiful ultimate skin for weiger 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.850
 maybe a bit difficult 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.860
 because he is not played that often, but 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.230
 otherwise I find nice thing and 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.760
 have lie in any case writes 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.440
 me the comments what you from the skin 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.980
 stop and I would say that to you 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.780
 next 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.760
 the child preview or was now the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.450
 other videos on a channel until then 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.450
 purely
