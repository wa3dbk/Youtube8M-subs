00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
and a lot of the techniques that we're

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
and a lot of the techniques that we're
going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> show<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.380> today<00:02:19.710> have<00:02:20.520> come<00:02:20.760> out<00:02:20.940> of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
going to show you today have come out of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.680 
going to show you today have come out of
out<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.390> his<00:02:22.190> his<00:02:23.190> work<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.450> his

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
knowledge and we've kind of refined his

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.710 
knowledge and we've kind of refined his
work<00:02:27.840> over<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.320> years<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:30.210> took

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
work over the years and and took

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.390 
work over the years and and took
different<00:02:31.170> techniques<00:02:31.560> from<00:02:31.710> basic<00:02:32.160> from

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
different techniques from basic from

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.180 
different techniques from basic from
from<00:02:32.730> different<00:02:33.300> people<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.190> reading

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
from different people and reading

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
from different people and reading
different<00:02:35.370> books<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.940> stuff<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> idea

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
different books and stuff but the idea

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.590 
different books and stuff but the idea
is<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.500> try<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.010> come<00:02:38.310> out<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.940> give<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
is we try to come out here and give you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.090 
is we try to come out here and give you
the<00:02:39.750> confidence<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.530> kind<00:02:40.710> of<00:02:40.830> break<00:02:41.070> down

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
the confidence and kind of break down

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.970 
the confidence and kind of break down
the<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:42.570> different<00:02:42.990> steps<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.590> riding<00:02:43.830> a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the the different steps in riding a

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.380 
the the different steps in riding a
mountain<00:02:44.130> bike<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> lowest<00:02:45.180> common

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
mountain bike in the lowest common

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.750 
mountain bike in the lowest common
denominator<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:46.320> then<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.040> becomes<00:02:47.400> fun

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
denominator and then it just becomes fun

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.990 
denominator and then it just becomes fun
okay<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.510> with<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.840> we'll<00:02:49.050> get<00:02:49.170> started<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
okay and with that we'll get started to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.790 
okay and with that we'll get started to
