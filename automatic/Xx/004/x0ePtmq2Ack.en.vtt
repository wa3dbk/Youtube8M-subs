00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
hacking you definitely should just learn

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.650 
hacking you definitely should just learn
how<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.640> report<00:02:11.970> them<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.600> by

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
how to report them and you do that by

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.380 
how to report them and you do that by
pressing<00:02:12.810> tab<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.860> moving<00:02:14.400> down<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
pressing tab and moving down like this I

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.550 
pressing tab and moving down like this I
don't<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:15.989> it'll<00:02:16.110> let<00:02:16.230> me<00:02:16.320> do<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.500> here

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
don't know if it'll let me do it here

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.310 
don't know if it'll let me do it here
but<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.920> hit<00:02:17.070> enter<00:02:17.400> after<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.320> I'm

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
but you hit enter after you do that I'm

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.880 
but you hit enter after you do that I'm
sure<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.830> then<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.519> report<00:02:21.769> enter<00:02:22.769> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
sure and then you go to report enter and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.530 
sure and then you go to report enter and
then<00:02:22.920> I'll<00:02:23.130> say<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.640> report<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.090> person

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
then I'll say you can report this person

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.000 
then I'll say you can report this person
and<00:02:24.750> then<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.260> choose<00:02:25.440> what<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.739> want<00:02:25.950> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and then you choose what you want to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.789 
and then you choose what you want to
report<00:02:26.280> them<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.790> try<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.660> be<00:02:27.900> hella<00:02:28.260> accurate

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
report them for try to be hella accurate

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.500 
report them for try to be hella accurate
what<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> think<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> actually<00:02:29.549> is<00:02:30.060> because<00:02:30.390> it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
what you think it actually is because it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.840 
what you think it actually is because it
really<00:02:30.690> does<00:02:30.780> help<00:02:31.200> them<00:02:31.709> though<00:02:32.519> I<00:02:32.549> don't

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
really does help them though I don't

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.130 
really does help them though I don't
really<00:02:33.030> know<00:02:33.299> what<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.570> does<00:02:33.780> because<00:02:34.019> it

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
really know what it does because it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.539 
really know what it does because it
doesn't<00:02:34.410> tell<00:02:34.590> me<00:02:34.620> what<00:02:34.860> they<00:02:34.980> got<00:02:35.130> reported

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
doesn't tell me what they got reported

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.840 
doesn't tell me what they got reported
for<00:02:35.790> what<00:02:35.910> I'm<00:02:36.030> doing<00:02:36.329> my<00:02:36.480> over<00:02:36.780> watches<00:02:37.200> but

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
for what I'm doing my over watches but

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.069 
for what I'm doing my over watches but
but<00:02:38.850> still<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> mean<00:02:39.450> I'm<00:02:39.570> sure<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:39.900> it

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
but still I mean I'm sure they have it

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.590 
but still I mean I'm sure they have it
in<00:02:40.320> there<00:02:40.470> for<00:02:40.500> some<00:02:40.890> fucking<00:02:41.100> reason<00:02:41.600> maybe

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
in there for some fucking reason maybe

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.840 
in there for some fucking reason maybe
the<00:02:42.840> kind<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.110> check<00:02:43.350> balances<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.370> what

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
the kind of check balances on what

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.789 
the kind of check balances on what
people<00:02:45.180> were<00:02:45.299> at<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.690> /<00:02:45.930> watchers<00:02:46.320> are<00:02:46.470> doing

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
people were at the / watchers are doing

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.550 
people were at the / watchers are doing
but<00:02:47.040> yeah<00:02:47.730> that's<00:02:48.180> how<00:02:48.329> you<00:02:48.390> do<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.690> please

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
least pretty reasonably shirt because it

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.420 
least pretty reasonably shirt because it
could<00:02:59.160> be<00:02:59.190> someone<00:02:59.519> just<00:03:00.180> smurfing<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:02.280> make

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
could be someone just smurfing just make

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.620 
could be someone just smurfing just make
sure<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.970> actually<00:03:03.180> think<00:03:03.480> that

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
sure that you actually think that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.270 
sure that you actually think that
they're<00:03:03.840> hacking<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:05.160> would<00:03:05.250> probably

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
they're hacking and that would probably

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.729 
they're hacking and that would probably
be<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.670> best<00:03:05.940> best<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.840> don't<00:03:07.440> know<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.650> don't

where<00:06:58.280> he<00:06:58.430> was<00:06:58.580> hacking<00:06:58.820> and<00:06:59.210> it's<00:06:59.330> not<00:06:59.480> like

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
where he was hacking and it's not like

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.810 
where he was hacking and it's not like
that's<00:07:00.020> what<00:07:00.320> made<00:07:00.560> me<00:07:00.590> choose<00:07:00.950> I<00:07:01.280> don't<00:07:01.790> think

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820

I<00:07:01.970> got<00:07:02.120> to<00:07:02.240> do<00:07:02.360> it<00:07:02.450> for<00:07:02.540> this<00:07:02.660> one<00:07:02.840> because<00:07:02.960> he's

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
I got to do it for this one because he's

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.510 
I got to do it for this one because he's
pretty<00:07:03.650> much<00:07:03.770> acting<00:07:04.040> the<00:07:04.100> whole<00:07:04.220> fucking

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520
