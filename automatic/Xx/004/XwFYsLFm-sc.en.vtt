on<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> left<00:02:05.340> side<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> court<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.689> have

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
on the left side of the court and I have

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
on the left side of the court and I have
a<00:02:06.960> cold<00:02:07.380> spot<00:02:07.890> right<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> middle<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
a cold spot right in the middle of the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.219 
a cold spot right in the middle of the
paint<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.750> that's<00:02:09.899> acts

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
paint and that's acts

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.350 
paint and that's acts
should<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.379> bad<00:02:10.619> because<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.730> can't<00:02:12.209> do

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
should be bad because now I can't do

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.610 
should be bad because now I can't do
floaters<00:02:12.780> because<00:02:13.019> that's<00:02:13.200> where<00:02:13.409> you<00:02:13.500> would

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
floaters because that's where you would

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.250 
floaters because that's where you would
do<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.890> floaters<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:15.060> I'm<00:02:15.420> not<00:02:15.629> exactly<00:02:16.049> sure

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
do the floaters so I'm not exactly sure

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.250 
do the floaters so I'm not exactly sure
how<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.250> get<00:02:17.760> these<00:02:17.909> hot<00:02:18.150> spots<00:02:18.299> I<00:02:18.540> guess<00:02:18.780> just

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
how you get these hot spots I guess just

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.809 
how you get these hot spots I guess just
based<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.680> your<00:02:19.830> performance<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.400> your<00:02:20.549> games

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
based on your performance in your games

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.880 
based on your performance in your games
so<00:02:21.810> I'm<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.110> see<00:02:22.349> if<00:02:22.409> there's<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.680> way<00:02:22.860> I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
so I'm going to see if there's a way I

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.830 
so I'm going to see if there's a way I
can<00:02:23.010> get<00:02:23.280> rid<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.730> cold<00:02:23.970> spot<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:24.659> I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
can get rid of that cold spot so that I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.199 
can get rid of that cold spot so that I
can<00:02:25.140> start<00:02:25.349> doing<00:02:25.560> floaters<00:02:26.250> when<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:26.910> Drive

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
can start doing floaters when I Drive

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.110 
can start doing floaters when I Drive
