00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
from the food try this exercise with

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.830 
from the food try this exercise with

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
different types of food on the plate now

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.000 
different types of food on the plate now
that<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:39.960> having<00:00:40.079> success<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> I'm

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that we're having success with that I'm

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.610 
that we're having success with that I'm
going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> add<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> table<00:00:41.850> onto<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> picture

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
going to add the table onto the picture

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
going to add the table onto the picture
because<00:00:43.620> my<00:00:43.739> puppy<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.100> still<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.430> leash<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.969> can

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
because my puppy is still on leash I can

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.389 
because my puppy is still on leash I can
prevent<00:00:45.539> him<00:00:45.809> from<00:00:45.870> lunging<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.860> grabbing<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
prevent him from lunging and grabbing a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.790 
prevent him from lunging and grabbing a
treat<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:48.300> wants<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> now<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
treat if he wants to get it now the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.670 
treat if he wants to get it now the
concept<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.030> never<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:52.020> food<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
concept is to never get food on the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.790 
concept is to never get food on the
table<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.280> adding<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> cue<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.629> leave<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
table so adding a cue like leave it is a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.799 
table so adding a cue like leave it is a
really<00:00:56.219> bad<00:00:56.340> idea<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.390> dog<00:00:57.539> might

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
really bad idea because the dog might

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.270 
really bad idea because the dog might
think<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.440> you're<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> room<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
think that if you're not in the room and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.740 
think that if you're not in the room and
you're<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.430> saying<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> word<00:01:00.059> leave<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> when

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you're not saying the word leave it when

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
you're not saying the word leave it when
they<00:01:00.870> look<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> food<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:02.070> they<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.489> eat

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
they look at the food then they can eat

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460 
they look at the food then they can eat
the<00:01:02.789> feed<00:01:03.030> however<00:01:03.629> down<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> line<00:01:04.229> after

the feed however down the line after

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
the feed however down the line after
you've<00:01:04.710> already<00:01:04.830> done<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.519> training<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you've already done this training and

your dog starts staring at something on
the<00:01:09.150> table<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.290> remind<00:01:10.650> them<00:01:10.860> by<00:01:11.010> using

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the table you can remind them by using

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.179 
the table you can remind them by using
the<00:01:11.460> cue<00:01:11.700> leave<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:13.290> tug<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> doing<00:01:14.010> so

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the cue leave it because tug is doing so

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:14.600 
the cue leave it because tug is doing so
well

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
well

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460 
well
I'm<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> make<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> criteria<00:01:15.600> harder

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I'm going to make the criteria harder

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.499 
I'm going to make the criteria harder
it's<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.250> an<00:01:17.430> apple<00:01:17.790> corer<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.060> some

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it's not just an apple corer and some

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539 
it's not just an apple corer and some
chicken<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> table<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.040> hot<00:01:20.280> dogs

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
chicken on the table now it's hot dogs

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.749 
chicken on the table now it's hot dogs
which<00:01:20.880> he<00:01:21.060> loves<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:22.100> like<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> food

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
which he loves I like to have the food

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.310 
which he loves I like to have the food
to<00:01:23.850> hang<00:01:24.060> off<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.570> edge<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> table

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to hang off the edge of the table

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800 
to hang off the edge of the table
especially<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.490> short<00:01:26.520> dogs<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.360> tall

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
especially for short dogs and tall

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.050 
especially for short dogs and tall
counters<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.159> actually<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
counters so they can actually see the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.580 
counters so they can actually see the
concept<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> table

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
concept that because it's on the table

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.420 
concept that because it's on the table
you<00:01:32.340> can't<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.470> here<00:01:34.470> tag<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.950> literally

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
you can't have it here tag is literally

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.580 
you can't have it here tag is literally
inches<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.810> hot<00:01:36.960> dogs

this exercise is all about proofing so

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.359 
this exercise is all about proofing so
you<00:02:05.929> need<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.320> proof<00:02:06.530> with<00:02:06.740> different<00:02:07.100> kinds

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
you need to proof with different kinds

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.910 
you need to proof with different kinds
of<00:02:07.429> foods<00:02:07.729> on<00:02:08.090> different<00:02:08.750> surfaces<00:02:09.019> different
