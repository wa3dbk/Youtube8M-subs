all right what we're showing here today
we<00:00:02.250> have<00:00:02.280> two<00:00:02.610> detectors<00:00:03.149> that<00:00:03.360> were<00:00:03.480> showing

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:03.859 
we have two detectors that were showing

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.650 
we have two detectors that were showing
the<00:00:04.859> tectonics<00:00:05.609> Delta<00:00:05.879> four<00:00:06.060> thousand<00:00:06.540> and

the Tesoro Cibola the differences are

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.839 
the Tesoro Cibola the differences are
one<00:00:11.219> has<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> screen<00:00:11.880> what<00:00:12.480> VDI<00:00:12.980> one<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.730> a

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
one has a screen what VDI one is just a

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.320 
one has a screen what VDI one is just a
real<00:00:15.030> basic<00:00:15.230> buttons<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.470> that's<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:17.330> what

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
real basic buttons and that's it what

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.679

if I come across this is this something

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.170 
if I come across this is this something
is<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.070> target<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.610> you're<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.820> dig

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is this a target that you're gonna dig

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.380 
is this a target that you're gonna dig
with<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.840> detector<00:00:56.030> let's<00:00:57.030> look<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
with this detector let's look at the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:08.770 
with this detector let's look at the
numbers<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.809> readings<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.649> get<00:01:06.020> okay<00:01:07.020> 59<00:01:07.650> 59

42 foil 77 maybe once I'm getting

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
42 foil 77 maybe once I'm getting
nothing<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.369> getting<00:01:17.759> discriminated

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
nothing it's just getting discriminated

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:28.969 
nothing it's just getting discriminated
out<00:01:24.500> 7255<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:26.400> point<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:28.350> target<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
out 7255 my point is is the target is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.490 
out 7255 my point is is the target is
very<00:01:29.490> difficult<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> determine<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:31.290> that's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
very difficult to determine if if that's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.039 
very difficult to determine if if that's
something<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.890> you're<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.220> want<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.579> dig

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
something that you're gonna want to dig

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.690 
something that you're gonna want to dig
I'm<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.259> set<00:01:34.680> our<00:01:34.770> threshold<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.490> our

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
I'm gonna set our threshold on our

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.330 
I'm gonna set our threshold on our
Cibola<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:37.320> somewhere<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> middle

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
Cibola here just somewhere in the middle

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.469 
Cibola here just somewhere in the middle
I'm<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:40.549> turn<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> we're<00:01:42.090> gonna<00:01:42.210> set

I'm gonna turn it on and we're gonna set

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.170 
I'm gonna turn it on and we're gonna set
our<00:01:42.570> sensitivity<00:01:43.110> around<00:01:43.170> 6<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.579> something

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
our sensitivity around 6 just something

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.800 
our sensitivity around 6 just something
minor<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.860> high<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:48.299> I'm<00:01:48.450> gonna<00:01:48.570> go

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
minor not not not high and I'm gonna go

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.940 
minor not not not high and I'm gonna go
just<00:01:49.290> above<00:01:49.500> iron<00:01:51.020> because<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.470> knocking

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
just above iron because I was knocking

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.190 
just above iron because I was knocking
out<00:01:53.280> foil<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> other<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:54.689> as

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
out foil on the other one so there as

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
out foil on the other one so there as
far<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.409> equal<00:01:55.920> about<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.520> equals<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.060> get

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
far as equal about is equals you can get

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.389 
far as equal about is equals you can get
now<00:01:57.860> if<00:01:58.860> you're<00:01:59.040> searching<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:05.100> sure<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
now if you're searching and I'm sure you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.690 
now if you're searching and I'm sure you
guys<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.850> hear<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:07.849> solid<00:02:08.849> coin<00:02:09.090> sound

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.520 

it<00:02:13.700> means<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:14.030> little<00:02:14.239> breaking<00:02:14.659> up<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.170> man

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
it means a little breaking up but man

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.979 
it means a little breaking up but man
I'll<00:02:15.769> tell<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:17.859> if<00:02:18.859> I<00:02:19.099> get<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.579> sound

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
I'll tell you what if I get that sound

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.020 
I'll tell you what if I get that sound
I'm<00:02:20.989> diggin<00:02:21.469> it<00:02:21.560> every<00:02:22.040> single<00:02:22.310> time<00:02:22.700> every

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
I'm diggin it every single time every

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.929 
I'm diggin it every single time every
time<00:02:23.599> without<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.349> question<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.459> think<00:02:25.519> the

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
time without a question and I think the

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.179 
time without a question and I think the
biggest<00:02:26.150> problem<00:02:26.420> with<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.079> is<00:02:27.349> when<00:02:28.069> we

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
biggest problem with it is is when we

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.990 
biggest problem with it is is when we
rely<00:02:28.489> too<00:02:28.549> much<00:02:28.819> on<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.389> VI<00:02:29.719> DS<00:02:30.489> we<00:02:31.489> we<00:02:31.819> just

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
rely too much on the VI DS we we just

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.640 
rely too much on the VI DS we we just
aren't<00:02:32.150> digging<00:02:32.389> enough<00:02:32.750> treasure<00:02:33.079> well

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
aren't digging enough treasure well

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.170 
aren't digging enough treasure well
we're<00:02:33.889> just<00:02:33.920> not<00:02:34.159> digging<00:02:34.549> up<00:02:34.670> anything<00:02:35.319> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
we're just not digging up anything and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.379 
we're just not digging up anything and
by<00:02:38.180> switching<00:02:38.659> back<00:02:38.840> from<00:02:39.760> VDI<00:02:40.760> machine<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.359> a

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
by switching back from VDI machine to a

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.009 
by switching back from VDI machine to a
machine<00:02:41.719> like<00:02:42.139> this<00:02:42.379> one<00:02:42.760> with<00:02:43.780> absolutely<00:02:44.780> no

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019
