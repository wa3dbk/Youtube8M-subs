the tablet so inside this cover is the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
the tablet so inside this cover is the
tablet<00:01:37.590> itself<00:01:37.680> whoa<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> very<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:40.740> thin<00:01:41.610> and

something<00:03:22.110> was<00:03:22.230> always<00:03:23.750> not<00:03:24.750> good<00:03:25.230> and

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
something was always not good and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.530 
something was always not good and
perhaps<00:03:25.830> bad<00:03:26.310> with<00:03:26.610> their<00:03:26.820> colorings<00:03:27.360> and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
perhaps bad with their colorings and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.630 
perhaps bad with their colorings and
then<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.050> one<00:03:28.260> right<00:03:28.440> here<00:03:28.740> isn't<00:03:29.280> too<00:03:29.430> bad

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
then this one right here isn't too bad

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.720 
then this one right here isn't too bad
which<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.660> surprising<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.650> there's<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.340> user
