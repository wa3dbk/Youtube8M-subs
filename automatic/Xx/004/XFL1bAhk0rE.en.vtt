we're not gonna bunt it if the ball is
down<00:01:05.369> below<00:01:05.760> us<00:01:05.939> rather<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:06.540> dropping<00:01:06.780> our

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
down below us rather than dropping our

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.570 
down below us rather than dropping our
hands<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.380> way<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:07.950> cause<00:01:08.100> us<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.430> pop

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
hands this way that will cause us to pop

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.219 
hands this way that will cause us to pop
the<00:01:08.729> ball<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.150> want<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.420> sink<00:01:09.659> our<00:01:09.780> knees<00:01:09.990> as

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.429 
need to know what positions the players
are<00:01:27.180> playing<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.110> which

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
are playing in so we know which

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.789 
are playing in so we know which
direction<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.159> bunt<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:30.200> another<00:01:31.200> good<00:01:31.530> bunt

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
direction to bunt it another good bunt

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.300 
direction to bunt it another good bunt
which<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:33.030> they<00:01:33.150> call<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> pull<00:01:33.689> bunt

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
which is is what they call a pull bunt

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.910 
which is is what they call a pull bunt
it's<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:36.000> more<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> drag<00:01:37.170> bunt<00:01:37.439> technique

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it's it's more of a drag bunt technique

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
it's it's more of a drag bunt technique
as<00:01:38.549> we're<00:01:38.790> getting<00:01:39.000> ready<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> pitch<00:01:39.600> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
as we're getting ready and the pitch is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.510 
as we're getting ready and the pitch is
coming<00:01:39.810> we're<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> run<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.100> our<00:01:41.340> bat

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
coming we're going to run with our bat

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 
coming we're going to run with our bat
and<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.090> pull<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.329> almost<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> almost

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and kind of pull it almost as it almost

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.530 
and kind of pull it almost as it almost
as<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> softball<00:01:43.829> player<00:01:43.890> does<00:01:44.420> but<00:01:45.420> we're

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
as a softball player does but we're

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.569 
as a softball player does but we're
going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.840> pull<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> ball<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.409> us<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.369> way

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
going to pull the ball with us this way

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.700 
going to pull the ball with us this way
towards<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> second<00:01:48.420> baseman<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.530> way

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
towards the second baseman that way

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.109 
towards the second baseman that way
allowing<00:01:50.009> us<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.250> run<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> line

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
allowing us to run down the line

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.700 
allowing us to run down the line
hopefully<00:01:51.659> pulling<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> first<00:01:52.140> baseman<00:01:52.590> off

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
hopefully pulling the first baseman off

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
hopefully pulling the first baseman off
the<00:01:52.829> bag<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.610> need<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> hard

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the bag but we need to get it hard

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.560 
the bag but we need to get it hard
enough<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.720> gets<00:01:54.869> by<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> pitcher<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.570> soft

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
enough it gets by the pitcher but soft

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
enough it gets by the pitcher but soft
enough<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> second<00:01:58.500> baseman<00:01:58.770> has<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
enough that the second baseman has to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.130 
enough that the second baseman has to
come<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.549> filled<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> those<00:02:00.869> are<00:02:01.020> two

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
come up to filled it those are two

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.929 
come up to filled it those are two
techniques<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.740> bunting<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.460> will<00:02:02.610> help<00:02:02.759> you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
ability bunting is a great way to move

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.380 
ability bunting is a great way to move
the<00:02:08.129> base<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:08.429> honor<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.759> well<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.239> on

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the base your honor as well as to get on

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.690 
the base your honor as well as to get on
base<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.050> speed<00:02:10.319> I'm<00:02:10.920> Jory<00:02:11.310> Jensen

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
base if you have speed I'm Jory Jensen

and<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.090> some<00:02:12.360> instruction<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:12.900> bunting

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and that is some instruction on bunting
