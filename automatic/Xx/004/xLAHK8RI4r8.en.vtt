and<00:00:00.359> to<00:00:00.719> be<00:00:00.840> fair<00:00:01.020> when<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.319> galaxy<00:00:01.650> note

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
and to be fair when the galaxy note

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.110 
and to be fair when the galaxy note
first<00:00:01.979> came<00:00:02.190> out<00:00:02.310> it<00:00:02.520> was<00:00:02.610> another<00:00:02.850> crazy

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
first came out it was another crazy

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.940 
first came out it was another crazy
experiment<00:00:03.810> but<00:00:03.929> now<00:00:04.049> they're<00:00:04.259> everywhere<00:00:04.380> so

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
experiment but now they're everywhere so

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.829 
experiment but now they're everywhere so
maybe<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.759> one<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.000> those<00:00:06.089> things<00:00:06.720> that

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
maybe this is one of those things that

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.140 
maybe this is one of those things that
looks<00:00:07.080> crazy<00:00:07.379> now<00:00:07.649> but<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:08.490> know<00:00:08.610> might<00:00:08.970> look

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
looks crazy now but you know might look

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.850 
looks crazy now but you know might look
totally<00:00:09.660> normal<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.260> future<00:00:10.530> who<00:00:10.679> knows

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
totally normal in the future who knows

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.620 
totally normal in the future who knows
so<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.639> Note<00:00:11.790> edge<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.210> clearly

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
so this is the Note edge it's clearly

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.749 
so this is the Note edge it's clearly
nearly<00:00:13.200> identical<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.009> Galaxy<00:00:14.340> Note<00:00:14.460> for

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
nearly identical to the Galaxy Note for

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.430 
nearly identical to the Galaxy Note for
its<00:00:14.969> brother<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.480> has<00:00:15.509> all<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> same<00:00:16.020> internal

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
its brother it has all the same internal

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.769 
its brother it has all the same internal
specs<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.369> same<00:00:17.550> software<00:00:17.970> same<00:00:18.359> camera

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
specs all the same software same camera

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.109 
specs all the same software same camera
same<00:00:19.020> everything<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.400> has<00:00:20.640> some<00:00:20.970> extra

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
same everything but it has some extra

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.509 
same everything but it has some extra
display<00:00:21.840> hanging<00:00:22.199> off<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.439> edge<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.010> that's

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
display hanging off the edge and that's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.160 
display hanging off the edge and that's
what<00:00:23.699> they<00:00:23.789> call<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> edge<00:00:24.449> display<00:00:24.840> or

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
what they call it the edge display or

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.900 
what they call it the edge display or
the<00:00:25.199> edge<00:00:25.380> screen<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.340> here's<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.670> works

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the edge screen so here's how it works

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.720 
the edge screen so here's how it works
up<00:00:27.150> front<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.140> front<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.590> 5.6<00:00:29.250> inch<00:00:29.429> quad

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
up front on the front is a 5.6 inch quad

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.299 
up front on the front is a 5.6 inch quad
HD<00:00:29.760> Super<00:00:30.480> AMOLED<00:00:30.869> display<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.529> fantastic

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
HD Super AMOLED display it's fantastic

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.220 
HD Super AMOLED display it's fantastic
so<00:00:32.669> again<00:00:32.880> super<00:00:33.210> high<00:00:33.300> pixel<00:00:33.660> density<00:00:33.690> here

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so again super high pixel density here

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.500 
so again super high pixel density here
and<00:00:34.410> then<00:00:34.770> curved<00:00:35.130> over<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.300> hand

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and then curved over on the right hand

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.799 
and then curved over on the right hand
side<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.739> additional<00:00:38.280> 160<00:00:39.149> pixel<00:00:39.629> wide

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
side is an additional 160 pixel wide

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.770 
side is an additional 160 pixel wide
strip<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> display<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.239> that's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
strip of display and that's it that's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.180 
strip of display and that's it that's
what<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.739> figured<00:00:44.100> I'd

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
what this one is all about I figured I'd

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.529 
what this one is all about I figured I'd
show<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.640> guys<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.420> probably

is<00:01:29.340> when<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.299> want<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> take

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
is when you really want to take

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.300 
is when you really want to take
advantage<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.170> entire<00:01:31.710> front<00:01:32.159> display

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
advantage of that entire front display

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
advantage of that entire front display
that<00:01:33.119> strip<00:01:33.509> needs<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.409> way<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
that strip needs to get out the way and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
that strip needs to get out the way and
when<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> spend<00:01:35.490> time<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.509> looks<00:01:36.750> like

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
when I spend time with it it looks like

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.780 
when I spend time with it it looks like
it<00:01:37.200> does<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> pretty<00:01:37.560> decent<00:01:37.710> job<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.340> doing<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
it does a pretty decent job of doing so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.010 
it does a pretty decent job of doing so
so<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.150> when<00:01:39.270> I'm<00:01:39.360> watching<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.750> youtube

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
so like when I'm watching a youtube

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.469 
so like when I'm watching a youtube
video<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.130> fullscreen<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.970> bar

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
video and I go fullscreen the bar

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.630 
video and I go fullscreen the bar
disappears<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.770> fine<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.250> leaves<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
disappears so it's fine it leaves this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.510 
disappears so it's fine it leaves this
faint<00:01:44.970> text<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.659> says<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.649> Galaxy<00:01:47.220> Note<00:01:47.369> edge

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
faint text that says my Galaxy Note edge

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.889 
faint text that says my Galaxy Note edge
but<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> think<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.270> should<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.600> just

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
but I think it should really be just

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.480 
but I think it should really be just
pitch<00:01:49.049> black<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.159> want<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> bring

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
pitch black and the one I want to bring

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.850 
pitch black and the one I want to bring
it<00:01:50.579> back<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.149> swipe<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.750> any<00:01:51.869> time<00:01:51.960> move

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
it back I can swipe in at any time move

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.560 
it back I can swipe in at any time move
around<00:01:53.040> between<00:01:53.460> them<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.180> when<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> want<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
around between them and when I want to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.120 
around between them and when I want to
go<00:01:54.630> fullscreen<00:01:54.840> again<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.680> tap<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
go fullscreen again I can just tap the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.560 
go fullscreen again I can just tap the
video<00:01:56.369> again<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.939> goes<00:01:57.060> back<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> full

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
video again and it goes back to full

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
video again and it goes back to full
screen<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.350> long<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.979> seamless

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
screen so as long as it's this seamless

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.030 
screen so as long as it's this seamless
it<00:01:59.729> seems<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:01.829> way

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it seems like it will be out of my way

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.160 
it seems like it will be out of my way
when<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.280> don't<00:02:02.399> want<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:03.930> actually

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
when I don't want it and it's actually

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.260 
when I don't want it and it's actually
kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> hard<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> tell<00:02:04.860> where<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> flat<00:02:05.969> part

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
kind of hard to tell where the flat part

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.910 
kind of hard to tell where the flat part
of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> screen<00:02:06.719> ends<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> curved<00:02:07.680> part

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
of the screen ends and the curved part

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800 
of the screen ends and the curved part
begins<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> graphics<00:02:09.119> overlap<00:02:09.569> so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
begins because the graphics overlap so

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
begins because the graphics overlap so
often<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> could<00:02:10.890> see<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.250> kind<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.459> stuff

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
often but I could see this kind of stuff

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.949 
often but I could see this kind of stuff
being<00:02:11.879> useful<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.270> someone<00:02:12.569> once<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:12.870> get

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
being useful to someone once they get

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.880 
being useful to someone once they get
used<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> swiping<00:02:13.650> Jeff

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
used to the swiping Jeff

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.130 
used to the swiping Jeff
years<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.700> bring<00:02:14.910> these<00:02:15.120> tools<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:15.990> of

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
years to bring these tools in and out of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.020 
years to bring these tools in and out of
you<00:02:16.410> there<00:02:17.040> will<00:02:17.160> always<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.430> people<00:02:17.670> saying

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
you there will always be people saying

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.699 
you there will always be people saying
that's<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:18.959> dumb<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:19.319> never<00:02:19.500> gonna<00:02:19.620> use

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
that's really dumb I'm never gonna use

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.040 
that's really dumb I'm never gonna use
that<00:02:20.069> but<00:02:20.400> again<00:02:20.520> some<00:02:21.090> people<00:02:21.120> will<00:02:21.930> probably

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
that but again some people will probably

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.870 
that but again some people will probably
be<00:02:22.350> willing<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.740> try<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.280> think<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.730> one

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
be willing to try it I think the one

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.520 
be willing to try it I think the one
thing<00:02:24.060> they've<00:02:24.390> drew<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.810> pretty<00:02:25.020> well<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
thing they've drew up pretty well is

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.220 
thing they've drew up pretty well is
these<00:02:26.040> quick<00:02:26.370> tools<00:02:26.640> which<00:02:27.030> are<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.330> swipe<00:02:27.840> down

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
these quick tools which are a swipe down

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.230 
these quick tools which are a swipe down
from<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.650> side<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:29.730> provide<00:02:30.060> this

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
from the side and they provide this

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.180 
from the side and they provide this
quick<00:02:30.480> access<00:02:30.660> anywhere<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.650> tools<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.070> a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
quick access anywhere to tools like a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.670 
quick access anywhere to tools like a
stopwatch<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:33.030> voice<00:02:33.180> recorder<00:02:33.780> or<00:02:34.260> even<00:02:34.590> a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
stopwatch a voice recorder or even a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.770 
stopwatch a voice recorder or even a
ruler<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.250> what<00:02:35.910> makes<00:02:36.060> them<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.330> great<00:02:36.480> is

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
ruler and what makes them so great is

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.140 
ruler and what makes them so great is
they<00:02:37.080> operate<00:02:37.500> entirely<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.670> side<00:02:38.880> panel

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
they operate entirely in the side panel

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.390 
they operate entirely in the side panel
so<00:02:39.570> they're<00:02:39.750> not<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> window<00:02:40.950> hovering

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
so they're not like a window hovering

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.309 
so they're not like a window hovering
over<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.700> top<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.090> your<00:02:42.209> main<00:02:42.390> activity<00:02:42.570> this

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
over the top of your main activity this

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.930 
over the top of your main activity this
is<00:02:43.560> true<00:02:43.739> multitasking<00:02:44.069> because<00:02:44.550> they're

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
is true multitasking because they're

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.760 
is true multitasking because they're
just<00:02:45.120> over<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.420> side<00:02:45.630> next<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.530> what<00:02:46.650> you're

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
just over the side next to what you're

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.680 
just over the side next to what you're
doing<00:02:47.070> they're<00:02:47.340> not<00:02:47.520> interrupting<00:02:48.150> that's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
doing they're not interrupting that's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.110 
doing they're not interrupting that's
pretty<00:02:48.930> legit<00:02:49.290> also<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.310> left<00:02:50.520> me<00:02:50.640> wondering<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
pretty legit also it left me wondering a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.850 
pretty legit also it left me wondering a
couple<00:02:51.420> things<00:02:51.570> like<00:02:51.900> which<00:02:52.380> hand<00:02:52.680> am<00:02:52.800> I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
couple things like which hand am I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.710 
couple things like which hand am I
supposed<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.220> use<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.730> our<00:02:53.970> lefties<00:02:54.540> not

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
supposed to use this in our lefties not

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
kind of takes away some space but

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.289 
kind of takes away some space but
honestly<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.430> one<00:03:20.579> that's<00:03:20.760> gonna<00:03:20.880> decide

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299

whether or not this succeeds or fails is
you<00:03:24.060> cuz<00:03:24.329> it's<00:03:24.480> again<00:03:24.750> it's<00:03:24.780> another<00:03:25.079> one<00:03:25.260> of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
you cuz it's again it's another one of

you cuz it's again it's another one of
those<00:03:25.380> Samsung<00:03:26.040> throw<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.459> at<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.670> wall<00:03:26.820> see

if<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.239> sticks<00:03:27.510> experiments<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.739> what<00:03:28.890> do<00:03:28.950> you

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
if it sticks experiments so what do you

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
still don't know how I feel obviously it

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.360 
still don't know how I feel obviously it
has<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.140> lot<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.500> same<00:03:37.680> advantages<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.310> the

it<00:03:43.140> still<00:03:43.380> seems<00:03:43.620> really<00:03:43.890> awkward<00:03:44.280> and

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
it still seems really awkward and

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.250 
it still seems really awkward and
unnecessary<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:45.120> cumbersome<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.110> was

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
unnecessary and cumbersome but that was

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.140 
unnecessary and cumbersome but that was
only<00:03:46.380> after<00:03:46.560> an<00:03:46.799> hour<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.010> use<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.579> let<00:03:48.000> me<00:03:48.060> know
