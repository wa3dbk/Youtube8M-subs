00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
like my Astro Morpher the Astro Megazord

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.740 
like my Astro Morpher the Astro Megazord
does<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.430> work<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.510> huge<00:00:54.690> of

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
does not work but it's not that huge of

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.299 
does not work but it's not that huge of
a<00:00:54.870> deal<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.829> about<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.190> off

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
a deal it's not like it's about it off

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.010 
a deal it's not like it's about it off
alphabet<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.850> something<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.930> anyway

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
alphabet or something but so anyway

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.810 
alphabet or something but so anyway
let's<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.469> move<00:00:58.620> past<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.730> take

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
let's just move past that and just take

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
let's just move past that and just take
a<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.780> obviously<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
a look at it so this is obviously a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.170 
a look at it so this is obviously a
national<00:01:01.469> mega<00:01:01.829> ship<00:01:02.070> mode<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> looks

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
national mega ship mode I think it looks

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.549 
national mega ship mode I think it looks
really<00:01:03.239> cool<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> always<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.229> liked<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
really cool I always really liked the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.830 
really cool I always really liked the
Astro<00:01:04.830> mega<00:01:04.979> ship<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.270> well

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.450 
Astro mega ship and as you can see well
at<00:01:06.960> least<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:07.619> perspective<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.430> think

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
at least from my perspective and I think

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.219

the transformation I say I really like
the<00:01:49.409> transformation<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.430> really

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the transformation because it's really

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
shield that by making two here since I'm

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.309

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
then you have the feet just to

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.360 
then you have the feet just to
straighten<00:02:43.480> them<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.080> bits<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.650> take<00:02:45.220> these

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
straighten them out of bits I take these

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.449 
straighten them out of bits I take these
little<00:02:45.519> flaps<00:02:45.850> here<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.510> fold<00:02:47.110> them<00:02:47.290> back<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
little flaps here and fold them back and

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.910 
little flaps here and fold them back and
we'll<00:02:48.640> stand<00:02:48.850> up<00:02:49.090> straight<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.870> we<00:02:49.989> can<00:02:50.019> pan<00:02:50.680> up

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920

a little bit I don't know why frets take

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.940 
a little bit I don't know why frets take
the<00:02:54.519> shield<00:02:54.700> off<00:02:54.959> anyway<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.200> then<00:02:56.470> just<00:02:56.680> fold

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
the shield off anyway and then just fold

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.190 
the shield off anyway and then just fold
these<00:02:57.130> thrusters<00:02:57.819> around<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.450> then<00:02:58.660> BOOM

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200

these thrusters around and then BOOM
make<00:02:59.560> them<00:02:59.739> hands<00:03:00.160> kind<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.790> came<00:03:00.940> out<00:03:01.000> a

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
make them hands kind of came out a

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.680 
make them hands kind of came out a
little<00:03:01.239> bit<00:03:01.450> already<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.019> then<00:03:02.709> let<00:03:03.340> me<00:03:03.519> just

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
little bit already and then let me just

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.410 
little bit already and then let me just
readjust<00:03:04.690> here<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.380> can<00:03:05.590> do<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.980> head<00:03:06.910> there

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
readjust here so I can do the head there

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.479 
readjust here so I can do the head there
we<00:03:07.510> go<00:03:07.720> seems<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.140> little<00:03:08.230> weird<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.220> for<00:03:09.430> the

we go seems a little weird so for the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.800 
we go seems a little weird so for the
head<00:03:09.700> you're<00:03:10.120> actually<00:03:10.390> going<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.540> want<00:03:10.720> to

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
head you're actually going to want to

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.990 
head you're actually going to want to
sort<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.170> break<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.530> apart<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.069> pull<00:03:12.880> this

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
sort of break that apart and pull this

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.699 
sort of break that apart and pull this
up<00:03:13.060> like<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:15.480> whoops<00:03:16.480> snap<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.590> on

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
here and this piece will sort of go on

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.470 
here and this piece will sort of go on
here<00:03:20.739> like<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.920> little<00:03:21.269> world's<00:03:22.269> tiniest

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480

backpack and there you have the core a
strong<00:03:25.720> Megazord

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
strong Megazord

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.620 
strong Megazord
obviously<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.459> here<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.030> shield<00:03:28.239> as<00:03:28.480> I

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
obviously this here is the shield as I

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.449 
obviously this here is the shield as I
showed<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:29.140> take<00:03:29.590> this<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.010> spin<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.400> around

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
showed just take this and spin it around

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.880 
showed just take this and spin it around
like<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.150> pull<00:03:32.110> this<00:03:32.260> little<00:03:32.530> piece<00:03:32.739> out

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
like that and pull this little piece out

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.400 
like that and pull this little piece out
here<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.549> that's<00:03:33.730> going<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.090> be<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:35.170> handle

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
here and that's going to be the handle

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.270 
here and that's going to be the handle
for<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:37.600> it's<00:03:37.750> like<00:03:37.810> upside<00:03:38.290> down<00:03:38.530> um

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
for it and it's like upside down um

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.460 
for it and it's like upside down um
that's<00:03:39.700> fine<00:03:39.989> because<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.170> can<00:03:41.260> see<00:03:41.350> the

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
that's fine because you can see the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.199 
that's fine because you can see the
symbols<00:03:41.769> upside<00:03:42.040> down<00:03:42.220> um<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:42.820> guess<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.030> can

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
symbols upside down um I guess you can

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.110 
symbols upside down um I guess you can
just<00:03:43.239> put<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.570> in<00:03:43.660> like<00:03:43.810> this<00:03:43.840> let's<00:03:44.709> do<00:03:44.859> that

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
just put it in like this let's do that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.569 
just put it in like this let's do that
sure<00:03:46.120> good<00:03:47.019> enough<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.530> then<00:03:48.040> here<00:03:48.430> we<00:03:48.549> have

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
sure good enough and then here we have

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.240 
sure good enough and then here we have
his<00:03:49.030> sword<00:03:49.600> which<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.440> will<00:03:50.590> put<00:03:50.739> in<00:03:50.799> his<00:03:50.980> hand

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
Megazord I really really dig it like I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.430 
Megazord I really really dig it like I
said<00:03:58.239> this<00:03:58.390> is<00:03:58.570> probably<00:03:58.720> one<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.019> my<00:03:59.109> favorite

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
said this is probably one of my favorite

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.289 
said this is probably one of my favorite
Megazords<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.130> just<00:04:00.700> really<00:04:00.940> like<00:04:01.120> its

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
Megazords I just really like its

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.599 
Megazords I just really like its
simplistic<00:04:01.660> design<00:04:01.989> a<00:04:02.200> lot<00:04:02.530> as<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:03.430> see

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
simplistic design a lot as you can see

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.830 
simplistic design a lot as you can see
there's<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.910> head<00:04:04.060> sculpture<00:04:04.480> thing<00:04:04.630> looks

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
there's the head sculpture thing looks

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.870 
there's the head sculpture thing looks
good<00:04:05.140> overall<00:04:05.829> just<00:04:06.160> most<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.430> details<00:04:06.760> look

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
good overall just most the details look

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.940 
good overall just most the details look
good<00:04:07.090> he's<00:04:07.269> a<00:04:07.299> fairly<00:04:07.600> like<00:04:08.019> most<00:04:08.320> Megazords

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
good he's a fairly like most Megazords

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.000 
good he's a fairly like most Megazords
and<00:04:09.100> mech<00:04:09.250> he's<00:04:09.820> fairly<00:04:10.090> blocky<00:04:10.480> um<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.829> he

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
and mech he's fairly blocky um and he

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.710 
and mech he's fairly blocky um and he
doesn't<00:04:12.220> really<00:04:12.430> articulate<00:04:13.329> much<00:04:13.510> other

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
doesn't really articulate much other

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.599 
doesn't really articulate much other
than<00:04:13.810> his<00:04:14.079> hands<00:04:14.320> moving<00:04:14.709> around<00:04:14.920> or<00:04:15.489> his

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
than his hands moving around or his

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.659 
than his hands moving around or his
hands<00:04:15.850> his<00:04:15.970> arms<00:04:16.030> um<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.250> think<00:04:18.310> he<00:04:18.519> looks

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
hands his arms um but I think he looks

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.630 
hands his arms um but I think he looks
pretty<00:04:18.820> good<00:04:18.970> he's<00:04:19.359> fairly<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:21.280> lack<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.430> a

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
pretty good he's fairly for lack of a

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.490 
pretty good he's fairly for lack of a
better<00:04:21.760> word<00:04:22.000> sleeker<00:04:22.599> compared<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.229> someone

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
better word sleeker compared to someone

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.930 
better word sleeker compared to someone
the<00:04:23.530> other<00:04:23.650> Megazords<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.430> know<00:04:24.520> he's<00:04:24.730> kind

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
the other Megazords you know he's kind

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.270 
the other Megazords you know he's kind
of<00:04:24.970> got<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.180> more<00:04:25.480> small<00:04:25.810> design<00:04:26.290> which<00:04:27.010> I

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
of got a more small design which I

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.240 
of got a more small design which I
really<00:04:27.820> appreciate<00:04:28.270> um<00:04:28.840> I'm<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.950> said<00:04:30.010> all

I'm<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.550> gonna<00:04:33.640> put<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:33.970> upside<00:04:34.330> down<00:04:34.360> it'll

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
I'm just gonna put it upside down it'll

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.140 
I'm just gonna put it upside down it'll
be<00:04:34.840> easier<00:04:35.140> um<00:04:35.920> but<00:04:36.550> yeah<00:04:36.670> I<00:04:36.700> just<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.120> really

be easier um but yeah I just I really

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.120 
be easier um but yeah I just I really
think<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.720> holds<00:04:37.840> up<00:04:38.080> well<00:04:38.290> I<00:04:38.530> think<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.920> looks

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
think it holds up well I think it looks

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.220 
think it holds up well I think it looks
really<00:04:39.310> nice<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.910> chrome<00:04:40.540> paint<00:04:40.720> looks<00:04:40.990> nice

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
really nice the chrome paint looks nice

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.810 
really nice the chrome paint looks nice
the<00:04:41.530> little<00:04:41.770> red<00:04:41.890> details<00:04:42.280> here<00:04:42.460> look<00:04:42.610> nice

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
the little red details here look nice

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.640 
the little red details here look nice
it's<00:04:43.480> not<00:04:43.690> like<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.990> most<00:04:44.170> amazing<00:04:44.620> show

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
it's not like the most amazing show

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.230 
it's not like the most amazing show
representation<00:04:45.400> ever<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:45.850> sitting<00:04:46.120> on<00:04:46.180> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
representation ever but sitting on the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.730 
representation ever but sitting on the
shelf<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.660> think<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:46.990> looks<00:04:47.170> like<00:04:47.290> a<00:04:47.320> really

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
shelf I think it looks like a really

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.670 
shelf I think it looks like a really
good<00:04:48.070> representation<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.660> Megazord<00:04:49.960> it's

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
good representation of the Megazord it's

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.860 
good representation of the Megazord it's
just<00:04:50.980> really<00:04:51.790> well<00:04:52.000> done<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.450> think<00:04:52.630> it's

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
just really well done I think it's

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.560 
just really well done I think it's
really<00:04:53.650> cool<00:04:53.920> I<00:04:54.160> think<00:04:54.190> I'll<00:04:55.120> just<00:04:55.210> keep<00:04:55.300> seems

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
really cool I think I'll just keep seems

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.970 
really cool I think I'll just keep seems

Megazord<00:05:11.200> fan<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.710> think<00:05:11.860> that<00:05:12.340> this<00:05:12.490> Megazord

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
Megazord fan I think that this Megazord

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.659 
Megazord fan I think that this Megazord
holds<00:05:13.990> up<00:05:14.080> really<00:05:14.260> well<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.890> think<00:05:14.980> both<00:05:15.430> in

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
holds up really well I think both in

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.490 
holds up really well I think both in
Megazord<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.360> spaceship<00:05:16.810> mode<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.440> looks

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
Megazord and spaceship mode it looks

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.550 
Megazord and spaceship mode it looks
really<00:05:17.980> nice<00:05:18.190> and<00:05:18.900> also<00:05:19.900> like<00:05:20.200> I<00:05:20.290> said<00:05:20.470> the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090
