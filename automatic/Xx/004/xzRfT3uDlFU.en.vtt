example on Mars are here but eventually

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.779 
example on Mars are here but eventually
it<00:00:57.989> could<00:00:58.140> also<00:00:58.320> work<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.859> simple<00:00:59.280> heat<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it could also work on simple heat and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090 
it could also work on simple heat and
that<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.420> indeed<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:01.050> much<00:01:01.289> better<00:01:01.500> or

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that would indeed be much much better or

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
that would indeed be much much better or
reject<00:01:02.640> heat<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:03.750> automobile

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

radiator theory or anyway wasting the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.179 
radiator theory or anyway wasting the
heat<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.540> could<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.140> too<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.950> that's

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
heat you could use that too so that's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.880 
heat you could use that too so that's
how<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.670> part<00:01:08.970> will<00:01:09.090> happen<00:01:09.390> relations<00:01:09.890> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
how that part will happen relations and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
how that part will happen relations and
then<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.880> dr.<00:01:12.270> Rama<00:01:12.479> Holly<00:01:12.780> envisioned

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
then with dr. Rama Holly envisioned

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.149 
then with dr. Rama Holly envisioned

someday by rods exploring outer space he

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
someday by rods exploring outer space he
says<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.880> used<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.450> kinds<00:01:18.479> of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.590 
completely on the principle of muscle
wires<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:13.130> way<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.730> load<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> lot<00:02:14.450> of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
wires and that way we can load a lot of

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.210 
wires and that way we can load a lot of
scientific<00:02:14.989> instruments<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.010> empty

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
scientific instruments in the empty

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.330 
scientific instruments in the empty
space<00:02:16.580> here<00:02:16.940> that's<00:02:17.510> what<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:17.900> all<00:02:18.050> about

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
space here that's what it's all about

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.040 
space here that's what it's all about
and<00:02:19.340> because<00:02:19.880> there<00:02:20.120> are<00:02:20.239> fewer<00:02:20.270> parts

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
and because there are fewer parts

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.640 
and because there are fewer parts
there's<00:02:21.470> less<00:02:21.800> chance<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.489> breaking<00:02:22.640> down

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
there's less chance of it breaking down

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.440 
there's less chance of it breaking down
even<00:02:24.650> if<00:02:24.769> one<00:02:25.010> leg<00:02:25.310> should<00:02:25.580> not<00:02:25.790> work<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
even if one leg should not work the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.090 
even if one leg should not work the
other<00:02:26.600> three<00:02:26.900> legs<00:02:27.230> would<00:02:27.440> still<00:02:27.680> work<00:02:27.860> much

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
other three legs would still work much

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.220 
other three legs would still work much
like<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.640> human<00:02:28.970> being<00:02:29.300> at<00:02:29.540> an<00:02:29.660> animal<00:02:30.050> and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
like in a human being at an animal and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.290 
like in a human being at an animal and
you<00:02:30.530> would<00:02:30.650> get<00:02:30.800> back<00:02:31.040> data<00:02:31.280> that's<00:02:31.970> how<00:02:32.150> they

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
you would get back data that's how they

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.120 
you would get back data that's how they
are<00:02:32.360> better<00:02:32.570> they're<00:02:33.050> more<00:02:33.260> reliable<00:02:33.290> they're

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
are better they're more reliable they're

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.580 
are better they're more reliable they're
lighter<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.700> they<00:02:35.540> can<00:02:35.720> also<00:02:35.870> last<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.440> lot

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
lighter and they can also last a lot

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.199 
lighter and they can also last a lot
longer<00:02:38.320> but<00:02:39.320> what<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.800> sets<00:02:39.980> by<00:02:40.489> rod<00:02:40.790> apart

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
longer but what really sets by rod apart

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.390 
longer but what really sets by rod apart
from<00:02:41.420> its<00:02:41.570> predecessors<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.860> power<00:02:43.100> it

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
from its predecessors if the power it

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.530 
from its predecessors if the power it
has<00:02:43.780> my<00:02:44.780> favorite<00:02:45.290> line<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:45.950> what<00:02:46.220> r2d2<00:02:46.880> used

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
has my favorite line is what r2d2 used

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.190 
has my favorite line is what r2d2 used
to<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:49.790> not<00:02:50.269> have<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.660> ability<00:02:51.170> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
to do and if not have the ability to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.110 
to do and if not have the ability to

generate the power surges when you need

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.840 
generate the power surges when you need
it<00:02:53.300> which<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.959> fine<00:02:54.230> but<00:02:54.860> there<00:02:55.489> are<00:02:55.640> some

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
it which is fine but there are some

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.699 
it which is fine but there are some
operations<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.690> simply<00:02:57.079> cannot<00:02:57.440> perform

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
without the power surges like for

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.860 
workshop in this area was held in 1998
August<00:03:45.530> it's<00:03:46.280> called<00:03:46.579> biology<00:03:47.180> inspired

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
August it's called biology inspired

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.530 
August it's called biology inspired
robots<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.680> that's<00:03:49.519> going<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.150> be<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.359> wave

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
robots and that's going to be the wave

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.690 
robots and that's going to be the wave
of<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.690> future<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.260> they<00:03:52.040> have<00:03:52.160> recognized

of the future and they have recognized

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.880 
of the future and they have recognized
it<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.090> lots<00:03:54.019> of<00:03:54.230> people<00:03:54.470> are<00:03:54.560> trying<00:03:54.709> to

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
it and lots of people are trying to

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.350 
it and lots of people are trying to
imitate<00:03:55.070> insects<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.910> birds

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
imitate insects and birds

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.700 
imitate insects and birds
animals<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:56.990> how<00:03:57.710> we<00:03:57.770> can<00:03:57.950> learn<00:03:58.250> from<00:03:58.430> them
