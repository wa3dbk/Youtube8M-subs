00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.080
 good afternoon dear friends today i am 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.620
 I would like to share with you my experience 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.940
 growing roses when planting them in the fall 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 under the mulch greenhouse or in a trench who does not 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.529
 saw the first video, be sure to click 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.289
 on the link at the top and see it in 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.720
 the beginning and so may we see in the spring that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.760
 left after completely covered up 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 foliage boy i.e. foliage sagged 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.340
 the film certainly slipped but nothing 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.320
 scary here you see 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 when we were rowing to our husband it was 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 foliage what we have beautiful times. and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.129
 already on the cuttings that is here you see 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.800
 green such well they are more white yet 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.670
 that but they will turn green when they are 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 getting more light that's all 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.129
 from the petioles that we heard all 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.489
 started all develop normally 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.829
 let no one leaves behind no ringing 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.050
 how not to write in the comments they are aware 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.510
 there 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.309
 freeze and so on nothing terrible with 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.830
 they did not happen and so need 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.430
 make spring spring we just ogreba 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.950
 foliage 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.930
 a little to the side but do not remove in order 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.090
 so that she continues to produce heat 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.150
 for our roots and mulch 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.530
 pre polya mature our them 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.300
 roots sawdust or other dry 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.540
 dry another torment that is has not 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.610
 shaft values so that it is dry and 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.729
 sufficient thickness and approximately 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.729
 somewhere 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.340
 5-6 centimeters and of course at the end 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.760
 need to shed it that is to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.770
 dry mean she was not 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.890
 who directed that she has a half two months 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.830
 could normally keep love spill 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.380
 it's all so now we will open 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.370
 foil our tip and there will be many 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.680
 evaporate moisture 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.120
 and our spines need enough barking 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.600
 to stay in the ground 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.080
 for this well we plentifully put water 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 crossbar and shelter light film she 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.240
 will be 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.920
 keep the temperature high which 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.160
 important for the development of our rose roots and 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.150
 accordingly will prevent from 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.560
 frost 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.300
 our perski also see a little Lena 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.380
 hid everything well the second stage that's not 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.100
 just need to put 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.710
 science is still covered with the land of Kazan 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.630
 sprinkle earth around to 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:44.460
 maximally seal our roots 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.350
 that's all on the third video I'll show 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.300
 when we will land in the ground or 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.010
 roots are formed be sure to put 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.170
 Like if you liked the video 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.520
