00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.590
 typical medium greed in this case metal 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 gear rising like vengeance i believe 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.430
 since 2003 the first metal gear what now 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.269
 also comes out for the pc 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.750
 Implementation of the playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.570
 originals and I'll tell you right away 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 cool is steam about 19 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.250
 euro aktuell and who plays on action 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 the wt is right to have fun with it 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.000
 so me if he is the game on 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 The pc has finally made it again 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.200
 they line up, it's not me 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.320
 in this sense, yes, it's metal gear solid 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.370
 a litter very action-heavy this time 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.530
 but that does not have to be bad 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.989
 No, not at all, I send 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
 but right ahead so without controller 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.440
 I would not recommend it with mouse 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.049
 and keyboard, of course, so what is not 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.619
 playable it was already about it 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:10.200
 lightning fast fights combos block so 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.119
 such stories as possible 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.770
 connect a gamepad then but now 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.360
 really cool especially through this 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 sound mode here you can see it 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.560
 Special feature of the game in the end 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.360
 With that one can really target the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.570
 Divide cyborgs apart or too 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.860
 disassemble and divide the parts into parts 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.479
 that is then used here as well 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.630
 that you also act tactically 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.560
 has to cut and here just like that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 was this opponent 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 these say rather trivial quasi the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 Battery Thank you draws in the battery 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.430
 from the spine and with it you lead 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.049
 his own energy is back on it 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.640
 but not only carved so pulse 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 on the one hand , of course, is still the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.820
 dialogues with the characters that you too 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.140
 The information for your now 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.229
 the mission for example like this one 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.610
 boss and you can also do a bit 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.350
 Proceed tactical can in you too 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.299
 to sneak those past that is possible 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.860
 relatively difficult in my opinion 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.909
 So think of sentence yet clearly 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.500
 lighter than the other 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:07.310
 but you can go unnoticed 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.720
 say disassemble I say so completely club 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.550
 So it's the same 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.190
 levels are a bit more sprawling than 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.560
 you know it so much from action play 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.239
 this, of course, is not normal 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.209
 level here you can see first in 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.800
 ninja rain that's a kind 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.470
 automatic dodge and race and 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.420
 the environment these are the so-called vr 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.010
 Missions are also available in metal 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.760
 gear row actually already traditional 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.410
 and they were one on the console in dlc 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.420
 Chargeable I think three euros 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.670
 he has tasted but are in the pc 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.590
 version completely already included as it 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.870
 I think a total of 50 pieces or 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.489
 so and they vary and are actually 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.890
 pretty funny so everything looks here 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.940
 this cyber style somehow and 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.470
 Here, for example, you have to go through one 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.280
 Labyrinth come as fast as you can 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.900
 I'll see that again 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.430
 sense of direction has vienna 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:58.940
 well how should you say yes would not 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.560
 the best for that I can really great with 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.690
 such a funny little robot 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 walk around as you can see here too 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.720
 So cool was the vision 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.760
 really varied here you have to 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.040
 a dance as moderate as possible 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.690
 with this fabric gag or what is his name 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.600
 so hopping through the area as real 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.160
 Everything was very nice and clearer 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.010
 value compared to the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.530
 original console version namely 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.540
 the dlc the other is also with 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.940
 in it and here plate wulff comes 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.190
 also in the main story before and that is 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.079
 the game that was synonymous on console 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.069
 in dlc paid, I believe even 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.220
 seven euros expensive 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.530
 also completely in it in the sense are always 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.549
 two missions including a tool box 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.639
 fight as you can see here 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.880
 and also the jetstream dlc where you have the 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.260
 Sam also takes care of it 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.060
 So pretty good package especially if 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.400
 one considers 20 euro he is actually 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.950
 budget plan is you can not complain 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.540
 yes in any case and the whole 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.340
 amazing is actually still 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.829
 which is technically completely in order 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.359
 So of course it's a console port 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.799
 You can not be illusioned now 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.370
 make it suddenly look like one 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.889
 crysis 3 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.480
 but it is very sour ported there was 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.519
 yes little bug that you just start 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.780
 really could play online 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.549
 So you have to be online with us 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.290
 they have fixed right now 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.470
 everything is going great there are those 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.150
 normal graphics settings you can at 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.019
 pc also adjust what i am very funny 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.299
 think like 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.379
 exactly one physically decomposes objects 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.780
 can and therefore again 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.180
 saving computing power is really 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.289
 Really good and you can even 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.789
 not away, especially from Japanese 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.259
 Developer, it is very amazing 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.879
 because they usually have the pc 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:37.280
 Not so much on the hat and so I would 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.930
 say who is into action game and that 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.370
 devil may cry has been through was the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.400
 actually only thing in the machart 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.190
 on the pc currently there should be 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.259
 to lay that down if he is strange 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.970
 completely exaggerated cut-scenes 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.409
 can live 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.409
 but the whole metal gear is easy 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.810
 because he continues
