00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.360
 hello how about youtube people so good 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.710
 this section of tutorial how 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.379
 solve that annoying error 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.059
 that when installation they usually use 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.730
 moment to boot the system tells you and 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.440
 robben encryption ok 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.829
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.260
 it is then 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.050
 mobile reflection good, they'll know that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.679
 we have to be that correct 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.489
 and they have to be doing the archives 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:04.049
 in this 1 and the step all ok and well what 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.110
 first thing to do is between love 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.010
 over pressing home key 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.510
 of clay increases the volume and off of 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.510
 three at the same time 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.509
 and saying 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.740
 but you have in the club work for in 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.380
 but before urging steps we have 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.410
 that hold the three blows the first 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.970
 hit datafactory reset and mania 10 of 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.860
 law this is treated in this case I do not 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.050
 I'm going to do but before I forgot 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.590
 express with the keys of about volume 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.000
 and lower volume and with the key 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.550
 off ok 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.860
 and then we're going to go do the third 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.560
 second blow that is wii pk that wicket 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.900
 the fourth option and that in this case already 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.600
 I 'm not going to do it or we 're not going to go 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.860
 set 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:11.180
 and do whatever the cache staff 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.970
 and well then in this case it will not be and what 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.680
 they will do three times or click and then 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.409
 let's do them with this key here 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.170
 and good and then we are going to do 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.540
 install the steps let's go to forgiveness 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.959
 we must tell you not to install 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.959
 sedeco 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:37.670
 86 and from to look for one then they are 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.220
 started 3 at xacobeo and they will go back to 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.830
 install in the east dose is going to 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.540
 restart again and once they have 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.549
 done this 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.000
 It fills more good than what came from 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.810
 bending of the bag this assumption 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.950
 I light more 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.950
 and already and then there are no longer 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.020
 and since then they will no longer wait for 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.400
 you can ask what lesson is the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.400
 device ok 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.860
 in this case I'm doing a round 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.740
 that approximately forces them to climb 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.990
 at the beginning of the channel ok 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.200
 but I want more subscribers please 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.730
 because sometimes, if I'm going up 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.140
 videos and then nobody signs and good 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.460
 I'm going to save what by saying a clue 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.560
 of this fon is very good 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.170
 you were 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.080
 and good but it is not that detached then it 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.210
