00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
okay so we got our pump rinsed off we've

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.120 
okay so we got our pump rinsed off we've
got<00:00:13.330> our<00:00:13.540> magnet<00:00:14.170> rinsed<00:00:14.440> off<00:00:14.559> I<00:00:14.710> just<00:00:14.740> want<00:00:15.070> to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
got our magnet rinsed off I just want to

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.980 
got our magnet rinsed off I just want to
show<00:00:15.280> you<00:00:15.340> how<00:00:15.520> easy<00:00:15.760> this<00:00:16.000> is<00:00:16.059> if<00:00:16.360> this<00:00:16.510> magnet

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
show you how easy this is if this magnet

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.260 
show you how easy this is if this magnet
just<00:00:17.200> slides<00:00:18.160> right<00:00:18.460> onto<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:18.820> back<00:00:19.000> of<00:00:19.180> this

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
just slides right onto the back of this

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.870 
just slides right onto the back of this
bracket<00:00:19.540> right<00:00:19.840> here<00:00:21.599> like<00:00:22.599> so<00:00:23.700> you<00:00:24.700> can

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
bracket right here like so you can

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.720 
bracket right here like so you can
swivel<00:00:25.150> our<00:00:25.390> pump<00:00:25.660> wherever<00:00:26.020> we<00:00:26.170> want<00:00:26.949> to<00:00:27.160> aim

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
swivel our pump wherever we want to aim

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.200 
swivel our pump wherever we want to aim
the<00:00:27.970> water<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:29.199> then<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.859> other<00:00:30.609> magnet<00:00:31.090> will

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
the water and then the other magnet will

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.479 
the water and then the other magnet will
go<00:00:31.330> on<00:00:31.420> the<00:00:31.570> outside<00:00:31.930> of<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.169> tank<00:00:32.349> there's<00:00:33.250> a

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
go on the outside of the tank there's a

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.189 
go on the outside of the tank there's a
little<00:00:33.940> rubber<00:00:34.120> feet<00:00:34.210> on<00:00:34.600> both<00:00:34.809> sides<00:00:35.050> of

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
little rubber feet on both sides of

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.880 
little rubber feet on both sides of
these<00:00:35.320> magnets<00:00:35.800> here<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.750> kind<00:00:38.170> of<00:00:38.260> isolates

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
these magnets here it kind of isolates

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.420 
these magnets here it kind of isolates
the<00:00:39.190> pump<00:00:39.550> from<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.910> glass<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.890> let's<00:00:42.219> install

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
the pump from the glass so let's install

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.900 
the pump from the glass so let's install
in<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.760> tank<00:00:43.770> okay<00:00:44.770> let's<00:00:45.040> position<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.670> pump

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
in the tank okay let's position the pump

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.880 
in the tank okay let's position the pump
where<00:00:46.329> we<00:00:46.630> think<00:00:46.840> that<00:00:47.079> we<00:00:47.200> want<00:00:47.380> it<00:00:47.620> now<00:00:47.800> you

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
where we think that we want it now you

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.770 
where we think that we want it now you
could<00:00:48.100> scrape<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.520> coralline<00:00:48.969> if<00:00:49.239> you<00:00:49.480> wanted

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
could scrape the coralline if you wanted

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.150 
could scrape the coralline if you wanted
to<00:00:49.930> but<00:00:50.140> I'm<00:00:50.230> not<00:00:50.260> going<00:00:50.590> so<00:00:50.739> you<00:00:50.829> don't<00:00:51.010> have

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
to but I'm not going so you don't have

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.970 
to but I'm not going so you don't have
to<00:00:51.430> one<00:00:52.420> thing<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:52.719> forgot<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:53.050> mention<00:00:53.379> is<00:00:53.920> that

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
to one thing I forgot to mention is that

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.840 
to one thing I forgot to mention is that
when<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:54.879> install<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.719> shroud<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:57.129> is<00:00:57.430> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
when you install the shroud there is a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.880 
when you install the shroud there is a
area<00:00:58.210> on<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.690> shroud<00:00:58.960> that<00:00:58.989> doesn't<00:00:59.410> have<00:00:59.590> any

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
area on the shroud that doesn't have any

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.100 
area on the shroud that doesn't have any
slots<00:01:00.280> cut<00:01:00.610> into<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.539> you<00:01:01.660> want<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.989> make

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
slots cut into it and you want to make

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.380 
slots cut into it and you want to make
sure<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.710> that<00:01:02.920> area<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:03.579> solid<00:01:04.210> is

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
sure that that area that solid is

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.620 
sure that that area that solid is
pointing<00:01:05.110> up<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:05.740> that<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.399> doesn't<00:01:06.430> pull<00:01:07.420> any

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
pointing up so that it doesn't pull any

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.370 
pointing up so that it doesn't pull any
air<00:01:08.050> from<00:01:09.039> the<00:01:09.220> surface<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.149> your<00:01:10.270> tank<00:01:10.539> down

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
air from the surface of your tank down

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.850 
air from the surface of your tank down
into<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.570> pump<00:01:13.570> assembly<00:01:13.869> or<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.560> shroud

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
into the pump assembly or the the shroud

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.010 
into the pump assembly or the the shroud
itself<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.409> just<00:01:18.299> push<00:01:19.299> a<00:01:19.330> bunch<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.720> micro

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
itself now we just push a bunch of micro

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.440 
itself now we just push a bunch of micro
bubbles<00:01:20.200> in<00:01:20.500> your<00:01:20.530> tank<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.270> you've<00:01:22.270> got<00:01:22.420> a

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
bubbles in your tank so you've got a

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.840 
bubbles in your tank so you've got a
position<00:01:22.990> where<00:01:23.229> we<00:01:23.380> want<00:01:23.650> it<00:01:23.799> really<00:01:24.700> pretty

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
position where we want it really pretty

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.179 
position where we want it really pretty
simple<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:26.350> gonna<00:01:26.530> be<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.710> little<00:01:26.890> bit<00:01:27.100> of

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
simple I'm gonna be a little bit of

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.399 
simple I'm gonna be a little bit of
trial<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.640> error<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:28.060> get<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.630> position<00:01:28.900> where

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
trial and error to get a position where

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.590 
trial and error to get a position where
where<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.340> feel<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.670> it's<00:01:31.180> not<00:01:31.390> blowing

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
where you feel that it's not blowing

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.899 
where you feel that it's not blowing
directly<00:01:32.350> on<00:01:32.470> your<00:01:32.619> corals<00:01:33.009> but<00:01:33.460> it's<00:01:33.670> still

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
directly on your corals but it's still

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.600 
directly on your corals but it's still
giving<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.570> some<00:01:34.780> good<00:01:34.960> flow<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.490> may

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
giving you some good flow and you may

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.980 
giving you some good flow and you may
also<00:01:36.880> have<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.270> do<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.509> little<00:01:37.780> bit<00:01:37.960> of

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
also have to do a little bit of

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.370 
also have to do a little bit of
adjustments<00:01:38.829> with<00:01:39.159> its<00:01:40.030> location<00:01:40.479> as<00:01:40.840> far<00:01:40.869> as

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
adjustments with its location as far as

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.830 
adjustments with its location as far as
if<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:41.770> going<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.130> be<00:01:42.360> stirring<00:01:43.360> up<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.570> lot<00:01:43.600> of

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
if it's going to be stirring up a lot of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.200 
if it's going to be stirring up a lot of
your<00:01:43.960> sand<00:01:44.320> but<00:01:45.159> I<00:01:45.189> don't<00:01:45.430> have<00:01:45.579> a<00:01:45.640> real<00:01:45.909> fine

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
your sand but I don't have a real fine

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.020 
your sand but I don't have a real fine
sand<00:01:46.600> bed<00:01:46.810> on<00:01:46.960> my<00:01:46.990> tank<00:01:47.380> if<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.460> have<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
sand bed on my tank if you have the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.690 
sand bed on my tank if you have the
really<00:01:49.509> really<00:01:49.720> fine<00:01:50.170> stuff<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:51.189> may<00:01:51.369> find

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
really really fine stuff you may find

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.440 
really really fine stuff you may find
that<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.150> 2100<00:01:53.250> gallon<00:01:54.250> per<00:01:54.430> hour<00:01:54.460> prop<00:01:55.180> is

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
that the 2100 gallon per hour prop is

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.230 
that the 2100 gallon per hour prop is
too<00:01:55.930> much<00:01:56.140> for<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.470> tank<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.759> let's<00:01:57.880> plug<00:01:58.090> it

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
too much for the tank so let's plug it

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.710 
too much for the tank so let's plug it
in<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.570> see<00:01:58.780> what<00:01:58.869> it's<00:01:58.990> like

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.630 

now<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:06.290> can<00:02:06.500> see<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.800> there's<00:02:06.980> a<00:02:07.040> tremendous

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
now you can see it there's a tremendous

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.230 
now you can see it there's a tremendous
difference<00:02:07.910> by<00:02:08.900> using<00:02:08.960> this<00:02:09.560> mod<00:02:09.860> over<00:02:10.700> say

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
difference by using this mod over say

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.010 
difference by using this mod over say
the<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.980> cut<00:02:13.250> jet<00:02:13.490> mod<00:02:13.730> now<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.510> can<00:02:14.720> see<00:02:14.900> it's

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the the cut jet mod now you can see it's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.050 
the the cut jet mod now you can see it's
also<00:02:15.260> pulling<00:02:15.680> some<00:02:16.100> air<00:02:16.310> from<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.670> surface

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
also pulling some air from the surface

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.840 
also pulling some air from the surface
of<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.270> tank<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.500> need<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.980> lower<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.550> pump

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
of the tank so I need to lower that pump

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.510 
of the tank so I need to lower that pump
down<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.120> little<00:02:20.420> bit<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.070> doesn't<00:02:22.370> do

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
down a little bit so that it doesn't do

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:34.630 
down a little bit so that it doesn't do
that

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.850 

position<00:02:35.450> where<00:02:35.690> we<00:02:35.840> need<00:02:36.110> it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.160 

and<00:02:40.340> see<00:02:40.580> how<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.880> does<00:02:40.910> right<00:02:41.360> there<00:02:44.110> okay<00:02:45.110> you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
with this sure flow mod I think is going

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.190 
with this sure flow mod I think is going
to<00:03:00.860> give<00:03:01.040> me<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.390> lot<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.510> flow<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> tank

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
to give me a lot of flow in the tank

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.310 
to give me a lot of flow in the tank
I'll<00:03:04.190> pull<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.530> cord<00:03:06.530> out<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.310> water

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
I'll pull that cord out of the water

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.430 
I'll pull that cord out of the water
tidy<00:03:09.320> it<00:03:09.440> up<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.680> little<00:03:09.800> bit<00:03:10.010> better<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:12.170> you

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
tidy it up a little bit better and you

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.550 
tidy it up a little bit better and you
can<00:03:12.500> see<00:03:12.890> there's<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.670> little<00:03:14.420> bit<00:03:14.570> of<00:03:14.930> sand

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560

can see there's a little bit of sand
stirring<00:03:15.980> around<00:03:16.340> not<00:03:16.610> too<00:03:16.820> much<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:19.370> just

stirring around not too much you just

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.100 
stirring around not too much you just
have<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.850> kind<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.120> keep<00:03:20.270> an<00:03:20.420> eye<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.960> when

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
have to kind of keep an eye on it when

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.740 
have to kind of keep an eye on it when
you<00:03:21.200> get<00:03:21.320> your<00:03:22.150> anytime<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.360> put<00:03:23.570> any

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
you get your anytime that you put any

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.320 
you get your anytime that you put any
additional<00:03:24.740> flow<00:03:25.040> onto<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.520> tank<00:03:25.820> kind<00:03:26.240> of

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
additional flow onto a tank kind of

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.180 
additional flow onto a tank kind of
watch<00:03:26.450> your<00:03:26.480> sand<00:03:26.960> beds<00:03:27.230> if<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:27.830> do<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.130> a

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
watch your sand beds if you do have a

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.520 
watch your sand beds if you do have a
sand<00:03:28.430> bed<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:29.050> see<00:03:30.050> what's<00:03:30.290> gonna<00:03:30.440> happen

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
sand bed and see what's gonna happen

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.830 
sand bed and see what's gonna happen
with<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.250> perhaps<00:03:32.030> you'll<00:03:32.360> have<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.660> make<00:03:32.780> some

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
with it perhaps you'll have to make some

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.740 
with it perhaps you'll have to make some
adjustments<00:03:33.050> but<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.540> think<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:35.660> this

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
adjustments but I think in this

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.500 
adjustments but I think in this
situation<00:03:36.410> I'm<00:03:36.500> gonna<00:03:36.680> be<00:03:36.800> pretty<00:03:37.040> good<00:03:37.510> it'll

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
situation I'm gonna be pretty good it'll

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.630 
situation I'm gonna be pretty good it'll
take<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> little<00:03:38.900> bit<00:03:39.050> of<00:03:39.170> time<00:03:39.470> for<00:03:39.500> things<00:03:40.370> to

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
take a little bit of time for things to

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.530 
take a little bit of time for things to
kind<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.150> settle<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.020> whatnot<00:03:42.260> but<00:03:43.390> if<00:03:44.390> my

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
kind of settle in and whatnot but if my

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.890 
kind of settle in and whatnot but if my
corals<00:03:44.930> will<00:03:45.230> enjoy<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.250> extra<00:03:46.790> flow<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.840> I

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
corals will enjoy the extra flow so I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.520 
corals will enjoy the extra flow so I
guess<00:03:51.020> that<00:03:51.230> wraps<00:03:51.440> up<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.940> video<00:03:53.530> hopefully

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
guess that wraps up this video hopefully

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.250 
guess that wraps up this video hopefully
it<00:03:54.920> won't<00:03:55.070> be<00:03:55.330> such<00:03:56.330> a<00:03:56.360> long<00:03:56.630> time<00:03:56.870> before<00:03:57.080> I

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
it won't be such a long time before I
