00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.940
 and everyone today I come 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.950
 you do a little make-up in the 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.320
 purple tones actually I was lucky 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.270
 to be able to test two headlights free 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.840
 so I have some samples 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.839
 request like that from the mark or pts and 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.390
 company then it's me I love them 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.669
 visual that they have this is the the 1 of the 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.300
 flyers that I received in the stuff 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.859
 and above all I pour eyes there with a step 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.140
 too hot the little cardboard box 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.749
 it gives me a really organic side h - 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.030
 jamila necklace so here and so that 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:37.480
 it's done flyer with tips 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.580
 for your new year's makeup and 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.560
 I received the card and I found it 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.290
 super pretty is a little piece written 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
 by hand so it's nice 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.870
 so that's why I had two faria 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.610
 worry me a bit more in the spades 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.440
 the other who is a little bit more who pulls a 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.390
 little more about the purple and I decided to 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.180
 to make you a word that suddenly 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.980
 between dg purple necessarily so I have 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.160
 started by putting a purple base 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.680
 it is the fluid line the gel liner macro 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.050
 purple from mac you put that 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.400
 you obviously do not have to 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.409
 take the same things as me and I 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.360
 the tad on the entire eyelid and I 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.820
 goes back above the trough for the top 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.990
 like bats I took the caller 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.560
 tattoo that's the one I put in 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.090
 base everywhere just now and moans 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.650
 up to the eyebrows then you will see 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.960
 it's a little weird on the spot the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.560
 iridescent bronze up to the eyebrows but 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.040
 after we cover with a format of the blow that 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.490
 calm me a lot so this one is the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.860
 pink gold after with a flat brush 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.049
 this one this one is the one of rove 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.180
 indicated I took this lighthouse so the Belgian 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.979
 who's called then I do not know if we 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.720
 says at or quail ch 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.310
 Ouch pure halima and so it's like 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.020
 it's a loose powder 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.310
 I take the little cover on 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.170
 which is a little bird I can if 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.450
 you see so I take it in the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.110
 cover and I just drop the brush 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.640
 like that hop and once he has it 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.959
 full in my brush I come 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.980
 apply it on the eyes then you 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.840
 go see he has a beautiful 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.650
 sciences attention one clings more he 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.650
 shine it's a crazy thing 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.290
 you're here I think for a make up 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.940
 nude no but that on the eyelid and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:35.010
 must be motivated canon and so for 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.780
 the other half of the eyelid 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.730
 I take the background so it's purple 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.030
 which is called pure halima amethyst 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.879
 I put it in the lid 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.720
 yellow after new well of brush and I 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.720
 will do the outside of the eye 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.329
 oh yes I forgot to say and you fart 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:17.560

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:18.969
 hop good kind and that's all the content 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.239
 on my desk so I picked up 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.239
 after 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.970
 so it's great bio and you can 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.990
 see their site is I would put you 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.790
 well in the info bar but that's 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.380
 you're gonna company points like he's 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.780
 also is quite nice suits them all 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.880
 I reassure you have not paid for 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:44.000
 to say all that it's true I think it hop 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.050
 there then I'm disgusted I you 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.130
 take any game and after oil 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.160
 so I'm going to learn 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.690
 marc juston close everything to the end then 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.190
 just to reinforce the rape is in the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.350
 corner 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.140
 I took the violet from the matt palette 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.310
 v2 of slick and I took down the rape 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.860
 and supervise who is there and who I am 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.260
 maybe only in the corner in 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.260
 outer corner become tapped 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.470
 then I took the black of the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.280
 also palette that is well as up 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.450
 that a matte black I was already saying but 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.630
 blacks in sli that is when 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.070
 even 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.780
 so I started from below 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.240
 the eye so that all the colors 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:38.930
 drop there and that it is softer in 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.180
 to the big lines and then to the heart 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.370
 purple that I added I come 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.090
 to pat the black but the same 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.980
 to suggest more than anything else and 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.260
 I take a little bit but at 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.720
 I have just tried to draw 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.780
 a kind of wave wave linda winner 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.630
 but superfluous does not want that 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.120
 it's well delimited then I 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.690
 taken this brush no real technics and 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.830
 I am dumb this temple and all in 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.830
 up and down all that 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.450
 once everything is faded I took 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.360
 the off-white of the palette an john 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.770
 smit in the second loon and I make him the 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:26.510
 under the eyebrow to mitigate a little 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.940
 the iridescent side of the color tattoo pis for 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.130
 the night I took a pencil that 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.920
 swallow rockstar this is one of the tools 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.790
 force 22 at urban decay and it's a 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.360
 shade a little plums 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.040
 I wanted to change a little black otherwise 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.420
 with north it's fine and if not 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.130
 also with a clear color it is 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.220
 maybe very nice to enlarge a little 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.990
 the eye precisely you go then 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.760
 passionate mascara is not it so 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.000
 I take the fantastic volume of home 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.830
 bourjois he has a very special brush 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.750
 but frankly who's pretty cool to 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.310
 apply against 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.500
 there he starts to make pies I like 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:06.100
 not too much so little zigzags and finally 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.100
 no more gently 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.540
 small exact makes it possible to put all 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.000
 the styles in the brush and actually 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.620
 close the street slowly done 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.070
 includes lashes until the end I want 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.140
 to do it also afterwards like blush 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.020
 is a long time that I had not put 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.360
 this color is the 218 of chico 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.520
 it's a water eye shadow and I like 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.690
 many take in lodge finds very 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:48.390
 nice because I put my brush 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:49.560
 blush and as it is for New Year's Eve 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.450
 we have fun 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:58.169
 hair and with this I'm going to do very 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.400
 Soft ie a gloss while in 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.110
 this one live and glitter 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:08.210
