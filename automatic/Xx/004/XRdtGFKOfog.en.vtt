00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
so in this tutorial I'm gonna show you

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.869 
so in this tutorial I'm gonna show you
guys<00:00:03.149> another<00:00:03.480> neat<00:00:03.929> little<00:00:03.959> trick<00:00:04.520> and<00:00:05.520> this

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
guys another neat little trick and this

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.080 
guys another neat little trick and this
is<00:00:06.120> how<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:07.010> reflect<00:00:08.010> an<00:00:08.280> animation<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:09.030> a

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
is how to reflect an animation in a

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.520 
is how to reflect an animation in a
mirror<00:00:09.360> or<00:00:09.599> make<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.900> seem<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.290> if<00:00:10.320> you're

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
mirror or make it seem as if you're

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.640 
mirror or make it seem as if you're
reflecting<00:00:10.950> an<00:00:11.040> animation<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> mirror<00:00:12.650> so

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
reflecting an animation in the mirror so

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.570 
reflecting an animation in the mirror so
you're<00:00:13.740> creating<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.070> reflection<00:00:14.490> of

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
you're creating a reflection of

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.029 
you're creating a reflection of
something<00:00:14.790> moving<00:00:15.210> right<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.599> pretty<00:00:15.780> cool

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
something moving right it's pretty cool

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.279 
something moving right it's pretty cool
so<00:00:17.039> let's<00:00:17.720> start<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:20.689> Zumba<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:21.930> now<00:00:22.080> this

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
so let's start with Zumba here now this

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.200 
so let's start with Zumba here now this
is<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> symbol<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.130> created<00:00:23.699> I'll<00:00:23.970> show<00:00:24.150> you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
is a symbol that I created I'll show you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.089 
is a symbol that I created I'll show you
just<00:00:24.480> clicked<00:00:25.199> into<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> symbol<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> can

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
just clicked into the symbol so you can

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.679 
just clicked into the symbol so you can
see<00:00:26.250> inside<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.789> pretty<00:00:26.849> much<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.449> face

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
see inside it's pretty much just a face

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.620 
see inside it's pretty much just a face
and<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:28.849> created<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> motion<00:00:30.240> tween<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and I just created a motion tween and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.089 
and I just created a motion tween and
just<00:00:30.779> moved<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.199> alright<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.769> pretty<00:00:32.009> much

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
just moved it alright it's pretty much

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
just moved it alright it's pretty much
it's<00:00:32.309> pretty<00:00:32.340> simple<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.690> play<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.140> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's pretty simple so if you play it it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.370 
it's pretty simple so if you play it it
looks<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:35.059> like<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.300> alright<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> it's

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
looks like like so alright and it's

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.190 
looks like like so alright and it's
continuing<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.399> looping<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
continuing because it's looping so that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200 
continuing because it's looping so that
means<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.950> animation<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:41.879> repeat

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
means there the animation will repeat

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.130 
means there the animation will repeat
over<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.600> over<00:00:42.750> again

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
over and over again

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.080 
over and over again
I'll<00:00:43.829> show<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.340> click<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
I'll show you see click on it go to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.990 
I'll show you see click on it go to
properties<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:49.129> if<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> looping<00:00:50.820> then

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
properties and if you go to looping then

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.939 
properties and if you go to looping then
you<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.840> actually<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.530> loop<00:00:52.739> if

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you see it here it's actually on loop if

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
you see it here it's actually on loop if
I<00:00:53.340> had<00:00:53.520> played<00:00:53.820> play<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.719> play

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
I had played play one so we just play

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.270 
I had played play one so we just play
once<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> would<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.860> repeat<00:00:56.160> itself

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
once and then it would not repeat itself

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.979 
once and then it would not repeat itself
right<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> wanted<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> continue<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.309> know

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
right but I wanted to continue you know

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
right but I wanted to continue you know
so<00:01:00.989> basically<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.469> want<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.010> animation<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so basically I want this animation to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810 
so basically I want this animation to
appear<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.290> being<00:01:05.040> reflected<00:01:05.369> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
appear as if it's being reflected in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.000 
appear as if it's being reflected in
some<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.020> mirror<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:07.619> something<00:01:07.920> like

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
some kind of a mirror or something like

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.510 
some kind of a mirror or something like
that<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> first<00:01:10.409> let's<00:01:10.710> create<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
that right so first let's create the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.149 
that right so first let's create the
I'll<00:01:12.360> name<00:01:12.750> these<00:01:12.960> layers<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:15.860> then<00:01:16.860> I'm

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
I'll name these layers and then I'm

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.530 
I'll name these layers and then I'm
going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> create<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:19.040> Ameri<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.540> so

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
going to create the Ameri here right so

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.760 
going to create the Ameri here right so
I'm<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> use<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> rectangular<00:01:22.590> tool

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
I'm going to use the rectangular tool

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:32.800 
I'm going to use the rectangular tool
and<00:01:25.040> make<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> something<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:30.680> alright<00:01:31.680> so

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and make it something like so alright so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.780 
and make it something like so alright so
that's<00:01:33.810> how<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.110> mirror<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.530> got<00:01:34.710> there

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.569 

good<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.290> tricking<00:01:40.740> doing<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.189> has

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
good now the the tricking doing this has

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.830 
good now the the tricking doing this has
to<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.950> creating<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.369> mask<00:01:44.850> so

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
to do with creating a mask so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
to do with creating a mask so
essentially<00:01:46.409> even<00:01:46.530> gonna<00:01:46.710> use<00:01:46.799> I'm<00:01:47.100> gonna

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
essentially even gonna use I'm gonna

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.179 
essentially even gonna use I'm gonna
have<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> mask<00:01:49.189> through

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
have this is going to be a mask through

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.359 
have this is going to be a mask through
which<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.890> reflected

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
which the this is going to be reflected

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.209 
which the this is going to be reflected
I'm<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> copy<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.600> symbol<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.649> going

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I'm going to copy this symbol I'm going

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.420 
I'm going to copy this symbol I'm going
to<00:01:56.340> put<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.479> side<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.710> whatever

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
to put it on this side and then whatever

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.139 
to put it on this side and then whatever
motion<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> occurs<00:02:01.189> behind<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
motion that occurs behind this think it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.319 
motion that occurs behind this think it
will<00:02:03.240> only<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.750> exposed<00:02:04.729> within<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.090> shape

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
will only be exposed within this shape

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.479 
will only be exposed within this shape
so<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:07.259> almost<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.619> you're<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so it's almost like you're this is a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.949 
so it's almost like you're this is a
whole<00:02:08.789> when<00:02:09.000> you're<00:02:09.119> looking<00:02:09.360> into<00:02:09.599> it

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
whole when you're looking into it

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.660 
whole when you're looking into it
alright<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.770> your<00:02:10.950> vision<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.459> limited

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
alright so your vision is limited

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.030 
alright so your vision is limited
whatever<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.569> isn't

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
whatever is going on isn't

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.979 
whatever is going on isn't
by<00:02:13.400> what<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:13.969> through<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.269> no

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
by what you can see through this no

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.869 
by what you can see through this no
that's<00:02:15.079> a<00:02:15.230> pretty<00:02:15.530> maybe<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.400> little<00:02:16.519> confusing

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
that's a pretty maybe a little confusing

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.190 
that's a pretty maybe a little confusing
but<00:02:17.030> you'll<00:02:17.180> understand<00:02:17.510> as<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.719> go<00:02:17.840> through<00:02:17.870> it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
but you'll understand as I go through it

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.130 
but you'll understand as I go through it
alright<00:02:18.859> so<00:02:19.209> first<00:02:20.209> things<00:02:20.480> first<00:02:20.569> I'm<00:02:20.959> gonna

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
alright so first things first I'm gonna

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.140 
alright so first things first I'm gonna
make<00:02:21.349> this<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:22.930> mask<00:02:23.930> later<00:02:24.230> okay<00:02:25.090> see<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
make this a a mask later okay see the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300 
make this a a mask later okay see the
little<00:02:26.359> icon<00:02:26.480> changes<00:02:27.260> here<00:02:27.469> now<00:02:28.040> what<00:02:28.219> I'm

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
little icon changes here now what I'm

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.349 
little icon changes here now what I'm
going<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.549> do<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:29.000> I'm<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.420> copy<00:02:29.810> this

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
going to do is I'm going to copy this

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.849 
going to do is I'm going to copy this
copy<00:02:32.359> and<00:02:33.760> I'm<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.060> copy<00:02:36.019> paste<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
copy and I'm going to copy paste so the

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.649 
copy and I'm going to copy paste so the
exact<00:02:37.189> same<00:02:37.400> thing<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.790> going<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.120> be<00:02:38.239> copied

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
exact same thing is going to be copied

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:50.440 
exact same thing is going to be copied
in<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:44.680> okay<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.010> like<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:50.420> I

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
in the okay so like that so I

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.110 
in the okay so like that so I
essentially<00:02:51.019> copied<00:02:51.500> what's<00:02:52.189> on<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.579> mask

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
essentially copied what's on the mask

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.089 
essentially copied what's on the mask
layer<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.569> copied<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.049> same<00:02:54.230> thing<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.709> I

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
layer I copied the same thing and I

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.520 
layer I copied the same thing and I
pasted<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:55.639> on<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.790> layer<00:02:56.030> below<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:56.840> this

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
pasted it on the layer below it so this

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.580 
pasted it on the layer below it so this
is<00:02:57.709> gonna<00:02:57.859> be<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.340> mirror<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.900> will<00:03:00.109> be<00:03:00.260> mask

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
is gonna be the mirror this will be mask

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.069 
is gonna be the mirror this will be mask
and<00:03:01.269> now<00:03:02.269> I'm<00:03:02.419> going<00:03:02.629> to<00:03:02.750> create<00:03:02.989> another

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
and now I'm going to create another

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.179 
and now I'm going to create another
layer<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:05.239> will<00:03:05.450> be<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.139> actual<00:03:06.349> object

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
layer and this will be the actual object

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.770 
layer and this will be the actual object
that<00:03:08.120> I'm<00:03:08.269> going<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:10.060> put<00:03:11.060> behind<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.569> mirror

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
that I'm going to put behind the mirror

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.960 
that I'm going to put behind the mirror
okay<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.579> animation<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.900> going<00:03:15.139> to<00:03:15.379> be

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
okay so this animation is going to be

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.809 
okay so this animation is going to be
copied<00:03:16.970> on<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.180> other<00:03:17.329> side<00:03:17.569> so<00:03:17.810> I'm<00:03:17.900> going<00:03:18.079> to

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
copied on the other side so I'm going to

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.399 
copied on the other side so I'm going to
copy<00:03:21.099> then<00:03:22.099> I'm<00:03:22.190> going<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.400> go<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.639> this<00:03:22.760> layer

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
copy then I'm going to go to this layer

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.879 
copy then I'm going to go to this layer
paste<00:03:24.409> in<00:03:24.590> place<00:03:24.879> I'm<00:03:25.879> going<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.299> slide<00:03:26.629> it

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
paste in place I'm going to slide it

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:33.729 
paste in place I'm going to slide it
across<00:03:29.049> alright<00:03:30.280> now<00:03:31.280> I'm<00:03:31.669> going<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.409> see<00:03:33.409> if<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
across alright now I'm going to see if I

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.110 
across alright now I'm going to see if I
should<00:03:33.769> have<00:03:34.129> it<00:03:34.310> animate<00:03:34.669> notice<00:03:35.000> they're

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
should have it animate notice they're

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.240 
should have it animate notice they're
going<00:03:35.299> in<00:03:35.389> the<00:03:35.419> same<00:03:35.569> direction<00:03:35.629> I<00:03:36.199> want<00:03:36.979> this

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
going in the same direction I want this

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.770 
going in the same direction I want this
to<00:03:37.489> go<00:03:37.519> in<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.970> opposite<00:03:38.359> direction<00:03:38.479> because

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
to go in the opposite direction because

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.780 
to go in the opposite direction because
that's<00:03:38.989> what<00:03:39.169> happens<00:03:39.440> in<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.620> reflection<00:03:39.949> so

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
that's what happens in the reflection so

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.059 
that's what happens in the reflection so
I'm<00:03:40.909> going<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.209> flip<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.229> so<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.560> go<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.829> modify

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
I'm going to flip it so I go to modify

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.530 
I'm going to flip it so I go to modify
transform<00:03:43.970> flip<00:03:44.900> horizontally<00:03:45.620> okay<00:03:46.540> so

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
transform flip horizontally okay so

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.080 
transform flip horizontally okay so
essentially<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.489> animation<00:03:49.489> is<00:03:49.609> going<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.940> be

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
essentially the animation is going to be

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.699 
essentially the animation is going to be
going<00:03:50.269> in<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.690> opposite<00:03:51.019> direction<00:03:51.079> so<00:03:51.530> this

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
going in the opposite direction so this

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.369 
going in the opposite direction so this
is<00:03:51.859> how<00:03:51.949> it<00:03:52.069> looks<00:03:52.690> alright<00:03:56.139> there<00:03:57.139> are<00:03:57.199> mirror

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
is how it looks alright there are mirror

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.170 
is how it looks alright there are mirror
reflections<00:03:57.889> of<00:03:57.949> each<00:03:58.040> other<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.489> want<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:59.030> make

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
reflections of each other I want to make

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.229 
reflections of each other I want to make
it<00:03:59.329> a<00:03:59.479> little<00:03:59.689> bit<00:03:59.900> closer<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:04.430> pretty<00:04:05.000> it'll

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
it a little bit closer so pretty it'll

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.319 
it a little bit closer so pretty it'll
go<00:04:05.359> pretty<00:04:05.659> close<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:06.260> mirror<00:04:06.500> right<00:04:06.769> and

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
go pretty close to the mirror right and

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.509 
go pretty close to the mirror right and
the<00:04:08.329> same<00:04:08.540> for<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:08.810> one<00:04:09.069> look<00:04:10.069> close<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.430> the

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
the same for this one look close to the

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.220 
the same for this one look close to the
mirror<00:04:10.699> as<00:04:10.819> well<00:04:13.329> alright

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
mirror as well alright

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.490 
mirror as well alright
now<00:04:15.770> it's<00:04:15.920> time<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.100> do<00:04:16.389> create<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:17.480> magic<00:04:17.660> so

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
now it's time to do create the magic so

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.590 
now it's time to do create the magic so
essentially<00:04:19.160> I'm<00:04:19.250> going<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.609> make<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:20.359> is

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
essentially I'm going to make this is

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.480 
essentially I'm going to make this is
going<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.930> go<00:04:21.049> in<00:04:21.169> here<00:04:21.470> it's<00:04:21.950> gonna<00:04:22.190> go<00:04:22.370> into

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
going to go in here it's gonna go into

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.990 
going to go in here it's gonna go into
here

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
here

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.260 
here
so<00:04:23.330> notice<00:04:23.720> what<00:04:24.169> I<00:04:24.200> pretty<00:04:24.440> much<00:04:24.530> did<00:04:24.800> was

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
so notice what I pretty much did was

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.060 
so notice what I pretty much did was
undo<00:04:26.270> that<00:04:26.389> so<00:04:26.510> you<00:04:26.600> see<00:04:26.630> what<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.900> did<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.320> pretty

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
undo that so you see what I did I pretty

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.280 
undo that so you see what I did I pretty
much<00:04:28.160> just<00:04:28.280> grabbed<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:29.210> lair<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.600> pulled<00:04:30.139> it

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
much just grabbed the lair and pulled it

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.960 
much just grabbed the lair and pulled it
up<00:04:30.380> towards<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.919> mask<00:04:31.130> layer<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.639> it

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
up towards the mask layer and it

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.150 
up towards the mask layer and it
automatically<00:04:32.540> becomes<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.200> sub<00:04:33.710> layer<00:04:33.950> to

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
automatically becomes a sub layer to

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.520 
automatically becomes a sub layer to
that<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.700> mask<00:04:34.880> layer<00:04:35.150> see<00:04:35.600> you<00:04:36.110> just<00:04:36.290> move

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
that to the mask layer see you just move

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.409 
that to the mask layer see you just move
it<00:04:36.680> up<00:04:36.770> until<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.250> see<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:37.430> little<00:04:37.730> icon<00:04:37.880> and

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
it up until you see that little icon and

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.230 
it up until you see that little icon and
then<00:04:39.260> that<00:04:40.070> means<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:40.580> snapped<00:04:40.910> into<00:04:41.120> place

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
then that means it snapped into place

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.350 
then that means it snapped into place
all<00:04:41.900> right<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.260> once<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:43.070> once<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.520> lock<00:04:43.940> the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
all right and once you once you lock the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.330 
all right and once you once you lock the
mirror<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:45.080> mask<00:04:45.290> layer<00:04:45.530> then<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.980> mask<00:04:46.160> is

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
mirror the mask layer then the mask is

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.550 
mirror the mask layer then the mask is
activated<00:04:46.910> if<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.419> unlock<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.110> mask

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
activated if you unlock it the mask

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.670 
activated if you unlock it the mask
doesn't<00:04:48.889> work<00:04:49.010> so<00:04:49.370> see<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.479> disappears<00:04:50.990> now

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
doesn't work so see it disappears now

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.960 
doesn't work so see it disappears now
the<00:04:51.740> reason<00:04:52.190> why<00:04:52.280> you're<00:04:52.460> not<00:04:52.490> seeing<00:04:52.880> the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
the reason why you're not seeing the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.180 
the reason why you're not seeing the
reflection<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.510> because<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.169> have<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:55.010> make

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
reflection is because I have to make

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.680 
reflection is because I have to make
this<00:04:56.260> mirror<00:04:57.260> object<00:04:57.770> be<00:04:58.040> transparent<00:04:58.790> so<00:04:59.510> now

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
this mirror object be transparent so now

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.440 
this mirror object be transparent so now
I'm<00:05:00.260> going<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:01.030> select<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:04.180> by<00:05:05.180> selecting

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
I'm going to select it and by selecting

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.860 
I'm going to select it and by selecting
it<00:05:05.870> I'm<00:05:06.050> going<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.350> now<00:05:06.830> go<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:07.610> color<00:05:08.000> go<00:05:08.840> to

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
it I'm going to now go to color go to

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.950 
it I'm going to now go to color go to
alpha<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.650> little<00:05:09.889> a<00:05:10.300> 100%<00:05:11.300> means<00:05:11.510> that<00:05:11.810> the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
alpha the little a 100% means that the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.780 
alpha the little a 100% means that the
color<00:05:12.169> is<00:05:12.500> opaque<00:05:12.950> you<00:05:13.250> can't<00:05:13.460> see<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.669> through

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
color is opaque you can't see it through

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.960 
color is opaque you can't see it through
it<00:05:13.910> by<00:05:14.570> moving<00:05:14.990> sliding<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:15.830> down<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.310> say<00:05:16.550> 50

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
it by moving sliding it down to say 50

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.040 
it by moving sliding it down to say 50
now<00:05:17.510> it<00:05:17.690> becomes<00:05:18.020> transparent<00:05:18.910> see<00:05:19.910> that<00:05:20.120> so

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
now it becomes transparent see that so

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.710 
now it becomes transparent see that so
now<00:05:21.229> we<00:05:21.289> can<00:05:21.560> see<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.890> reflection<00:05:22.510> but<00:05:23.510> you

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
now we can see the reflection but you

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.960 
now we can see the reflection but you
can<00:05:23.870> see<00:05:24.080> this<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:24.979> being<00:05:25.190> shown<00:05:25.490> outside<00:05:25.910> I

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
can see this is being shown outside I

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.380 
can see this is being shown outside I
don't<00:05:26.090> want<00:05:26.390> that<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:26.780> by<00:05:27.289> locking<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.860> now<00:05:28.390> you

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
don't want that so by locking it now you

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.250 
don't want that so by locking it now you
won't<00:05:29.510> see<00:05:29.630> any<00:05:30.020> more<00:05:30.169> and<00:05:30.830> there<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.760> is<00:05:32.260> so

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
won't see any more and there it is so

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.630 
won't see any more and there it is so
essentially<00:05:33.770> we<00:05:33.890> can<00:05:33.919> just<00:05:34.220> move<00:05:34.400> this<00:05:34.580> a

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
essentially we can just move this a

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.170 
essentially we can just move this a
little<00:05:34.850> bit<00:05:35.060> closer<00:05:37.870> all<00:05:38.870> right<00:05:39.910> there<00:05:40.910> it<00:05:41.060> is

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
little bit closer all right there it is

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.469 
little bit closer all right there it is
and<00:05:41.720> if<00:05:42.710> you<00:05:42.830> notice<00:05:43.190> it's<00:05:43.460> passing<00:05:43.970> behind<00:05:44.120> it

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
and if you notice it's passing behind it

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.610 
and if you notice it's passing behind it
so<00:05:44.600> I'll<00:05:44.660> have<00:05:44.810> to<00:05:44.900> do<00:05:45.050> is<00:05:45.200> a<00:05:45.229> spring<00:05:45.530> this

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
so I'll have to do is a spring this

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.610 
so I'll have to do is a spring this
layer<00:05:45.860> up<00:05:46.100> above<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.210> mask<00:05:47.419> and<00:05:47.720> then<00:05:47.930> there

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
layer up above the mask and then there

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.830 
layer up above the mask and then there
it<00:05:48.710> is
