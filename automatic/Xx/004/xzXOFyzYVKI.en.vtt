00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
pretty good for a TV show and I'm

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
pretty good for a TV show and I'm
actually<00:01:12.390> liking<00:01:12.840> how<00:01:13.080> they're<00:01:13.229> handling

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
actually liking how they're handling

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.109 
actually liking how they're handling
Flash's<00:01:14.010> speed<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.880> worried

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
Flash's speed which I was really worried

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.310 
Flash's speed which I was really worried
about<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> heard<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.869> were<00:01:15.960> giving<00:01:16.290> him

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
about when I heard they were giving him

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
about when I heard they were giving him
his<00:01:16.860> own<00:01:17.009> series<00:01:17.340> again<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.880> super<00:01:18.119> speed

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
his own series again because super speed

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
his own series again because super speed
of<00:01:18.450> handled<00:01:18.840> wrong<00:01:18.930> could<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.530> super<00:01:20.159> cheesy

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
of handled wrong could be super cheesy

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.890 
of handled wrong could be super cheesy
and<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.909> would<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.420> good<00:01:21.450> since<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
and that would not be good since the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.510 
and that would not be good since the
show<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.500> centered<00:01:22.860> around<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.100> guy<00:01:23.220> who<00:01:23.280> runs

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
show is centered around a guy who runs

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760 
show is centered around a guy who runs
fast<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> said<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> first<00:01:25.080> episode<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
fast with that said the first episode is

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.649 
fast with that said the first episode is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
little too skinny obviously the flash is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
little too skinny obviously the flash is
supposed<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> slender<00:01:50.880> body<00:01:51.030> having<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
runners body since well he's a super

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
runners body since well he's a super
fast<00:01:53.970> runner<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> same<00:01:54.810> time<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
fast runner but at the same time in the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.350 
fast runner but at the same time in the
comics<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:56.310> give<00:01:56.490> him<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.700> good<00:01:56.939> amount<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
comics they give him a good amount of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.300 
comics they give him a good amount of
muscle<00:01:57.780> while<00:01:57.930> still<00:01:58.259> keeping<00:01:58.560> him<00:01:58.920> slender

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
muscle while still keeping him slender

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
muscle while still keeping him slender
given<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.060> may<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.630> personal

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
given this may just be a personal

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.450 
given this may just be a personal
complaint<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.100> complaint

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
complaint but it's a complaint

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
complaint but it's a complaint
nonetheless<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.540> figured<00:02:03.930> I'd<00:02:04.020> mention<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
nonetheless so I figured I'd mention it

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.800 
nonetheless so I figured I'd mention it
I'm<00:02:04.590> also<00:02:04.829> still<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:06.090> his<00:02:06.270> costume<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
I'm also still a little on his costume I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.150 
I'm also still a little on his costume I
think<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.380> could<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.590> definitely<00:02:07.770> been

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
think it could have definitely been

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.309 
think it could have definitely been
cooler<00:02:08.489> than<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.420> by<00:02:09.509> making<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
cooler than it is just by making the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.490 
cooler than it is just by making the
costume<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.950> brighter

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
costume a brighter

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.020 
costume a brighter
in<00:02:11.680> some<00:02:11.890> tweaking<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:12.490> in<00:02:12.610> there<00:02:12.760> but

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
in some tweaking here in there but

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.270 
in some tweaking here in there but
whatever<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:14.080> works<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.530> all<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.770> said<00:02:15.070> and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
whatever it works with all that said and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.710 
whatever it works with all that said and
purely<00:02:15.490> basing<00:02:15.880> my<00:02:15.970> opinion<00:02:16.300> on<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> first

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
purely basing my opinion on the first

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.480 
purely basing my opinion on the first
episode<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.260> think<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.650> series<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.100> gonna<00:02:18.310> be

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
episode I think the series is gonna be

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.490 
episode I think the series is gonna be
really<00:02:18.820> fun<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.390> must<00:02:19.600> watch<00:02:19.780> for<00:02:20.110> any<00:02:20.230> fan

the<00:02:37.720> show<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.140> far<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:38.530> really

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
the show that's far and I'm really

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.930 
the show that's far and I'm really
excited<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.160> see<00:02:39.340> where<00:02:39.460> they<00:02:39.580> go<00:02:39.700> from<00:02:39.850> here

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
excited to see where they go from here

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940 
excited to see where they go from here
but<00:02:40.510> judging<00:02:40.810> by<00:02:40.960> all<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.140> Easter<00:02:41.620> eggs<00:02:41.770> they

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
but judging by all the Easter eggs they

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.740 
but judging by all the Easter eggs they
had<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> pilot<00:02:42.670> episode<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.240> think<00:02:43.630> they

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
had in the pilot episode I think they

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.210 
had in the pilot episode I think they
have<00:02:43.840> some<00:02:44.020> pretty<00:02:44.290> big<00:02:44.530> plans<00:02:44.709> for<00:02:45.010> the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
have some pretty big plans for the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.860 
have some pretty big plans for the
future<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.670> I'm<00:02:45.790> really<00:02:46.209> excited<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.720> watch

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
future so I'm really excited to watch
