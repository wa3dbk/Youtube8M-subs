it's blue it motor I guess we can make
it<00:06:09.010> left<00:06:09.670> surface<00:06:10.120> you<00:06:11.020> see<00:06:11.830> we<00:06:12.340> change<00:06:12.580> all

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
it left surface you see we change all

it left surface you see we change all
this<00:06:12.850> stuff<00:06:14.880> okay<00:06:15.880> so<00:06:15.940> that's<00:06:16.330> pretty<00:06:16.570> much
