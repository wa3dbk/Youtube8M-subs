00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.570
 from three eggs that is what is going to 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:11.400
 unite all this bread that 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:14.710
 we already have the preheated oven 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.540
 180 degrees Celsius 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.810
 you always have to preheat the oven 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.869
 about 15 minutes or so before 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.779
 start the recipe so that that time 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.060
 those 15 minutes already reach a 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.820
 ideal temperature that I can bake at 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.960
 the right temperature then here 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.160
 are the ears are the three eggs 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.510
 I need condensed milk here 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.200
 which is also quite sugary with 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.400
 297 grams 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.400
 of condensed milk 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.430
 all desserts that have milk 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.359
 condensed the truth are of my 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 favorites then let's add powder 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.059
 to bake I need a little bit of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.880
 powder to bake a teaspoon for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.880
 bring these little pancakes here 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.789
 I need butter in this case I 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.820
 I need melted butter in the 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.110
 We can melt the microwave 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.409
 perfectly so I also 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.960
 add and finally a spoonful of 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.659
 flour these barbarians because with a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.630
 spoonful of flour I'm already full its 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.659
 It helps me perfectly to unify all 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.229
 the dough for this bread that happened next 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.500
 we mix we grind or liquefy everything and if 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.190
 we do not leave it like that and we're going to add 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.100
 these pistachios 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:49.180
 they have that very soft capita very 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.880
 delicate with flour let's integrate 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.760
 and here with a cup of pistachios is more 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.280
 that everything is perfect for integrated and 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.290
 I have the prepared mold is oiled 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.650
 is floured as we always do the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.950
 process when we make sweet breads the 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.180
 oven is also already preheated to a 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.849
 temperature of 180 degrees centigrade 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.050
 and this is the texture of the dough is a 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.280
 dough 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.290
 quite firm is not liquid 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.439
 we can appreciate it 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.590
 and in this way we are going to pour 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:32.920
 all our lives today or we did two types 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.379
 of bread that is a bread that of lots 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.099
 delicious delicious accompanied with 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:41.620
 whipped caramelized whipped cream and 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.180
 now I'm going to conclude with this 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 very rich and for you 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.859
 I hope you liked it I'm going to 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.000
 dismiss as I always do 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.340
 reminding them that the best recipe for 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.989
 to be happy is to add a pinch of 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.989
 sweetness in your life until next time
