00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
cameras like suction cup mount and I

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.629 
cameras like suction cup mount and I
love<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.139> suction<00:02:21.590> cup<00:02:21.769> mount<00:02:21.799> from<00:02:22.370> drift

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:22.639 
love this suction cup mount from drift

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.449 
love this suction cup mount from drift
because<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.180> has<00:02:23.650> 360<00:02:24.650> degrees<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.040> rotation

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
because it has 360 degrees of rotation

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.839 
because it has 360 degrees of rotation
so<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.780> combination<00:02:27.019> of<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:28.069> rotatable<00:02:28.549> lens

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
so the combination of the rotatable lens

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.660 
so the combination of the rotatable lens
and<00:02:29.180> being<00:02:29.780> able<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.049> rotate<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:30.650> around<00:02:30.709> can

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
and being able to rotate this around can

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.490 
and being able to rotate this around can
give<00:02:31.879> you<00:02:32.000> any<00:02:32.239> angle<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:32.989> you're<00:02:33.139> looking

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
give you any angle that you're looking

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.780 
give you any angle that you're looking

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
for when you're mounting it on the side

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.099 
for when you're mounting it on the side
of<00:02:34.819> a<00:02:34.939> car<00:02:35.180> or<00:02:35.389> windows<00:02:35.750> whatever<00:02:37.840> roll<00:02:38.840> bar

of a car or windows whatever roll bar

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.640 
of a car or windows whatever roll bar
mounts<00:02:40.209> one<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.299> our<00:02:41.389> personal<00:02:41.900> favorites<00:02:42.409> is

the monopod the monopod allows you and
we're<00:02:46.010> actually<00:02:46.129> using<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:46.879> filming<00:02:47.269> this

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
we're actually using it in filming this

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.839 
we're actually using it in filming this
video<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:48.260> now<00:02:48.319> allows<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.549> mount<00:02:49.669> the

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
video right now allows you to mount the

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.399 
video right now allows you to mount the
camera<00:02:50.030> because<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.659> bottom<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:51.109> the<00:02:51.199> camera

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
camera because the bottom of the camera

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:56.679 
camera because the bottom of the camera
uses<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.129> standard<00:02:52.430> tripod<00:02:53.359> screw<00:02:55.389> right<00:02:56.389> under

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
uses a standard tripod screw right under

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.099 
uses a standard tripod screw right under
here<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.769> that<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:58.579> use<00:02:58.609> feed<00:02:59.209> accessories

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
here so that we can use feed accessories

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.740 
here so that we can use feed accessories
like<00:03:00.439> the<00:03:00.680> monopod<00:03:01.159> which<00:03:02.000> has<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.329> tripod

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
like the monopod which has the tripod

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.819 
like the monopod which has the tripod
mount<00:03:02.989> but<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.919> also<00:03:04.900> when<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:05.989> unlock<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:06.650> you

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
mount but it also when you unlock it you

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.979 
mount but it also when you unlock it you
can<00:03:07.010> extend<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.519> out<00:03:07.669> lock<00:03:08.419> it<00:03:08.629> into<00:03:08.780> position

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
can extend it out lock it into position

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.659 
can extend it out lock it into position
now<00:03:09.439> you've<00:03:09.650> got<00:03:09.859> something<00:03:10.129> that's<00:03:10.370> nice<00:03:10.609> and

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
now you've got something that's nice and

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.020 
now you've got something that's nice and
stable<00:03:10.939> for<00:03:11.629> doing<00:03:12.069> smooth<00:03:13.069> transitions<00:03:13.879> if

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
stable for doing smooth transitions if

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.610 
stable for doing smooth transitions if
you're<00:03:14.180> filming<00:03:14.419> somebody<00:03:14.689> on<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.959> halfpipe<00:03:15.319> or

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
you're filming somebody on a halfpipe or

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.089 
you're filming somebody on a halfpipe or
things<00:03:15.859> along<00:03:16.040> those<00:03:16.250> nature<00:03:16.720> release<00:03:17.720> it

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
things along those nature release it

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.559 
things along those nature release it
collapse<00:03:19.099> it<00:03:19.340> down<00:03:19.370> nice<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:19.819> small<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.479> you

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
collapse it down nice and small so you

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.369 
collapse it down nice and small so you
can<00:03:20.720> put<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.989> inside<00:03:21.109> your<00:03:21.439> pocket<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:24.079> kit

can put it inside your pocket the kit

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.140 
can put it inside your pocket the kit
itself<00:03:24.530> for<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.189> cameras<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:25.790> there's<00:03:25.939> two

models<00:03:26.599> of<00:03:26.840> drift<00:03:27.319> camera<00:03:27.530> we<00:03:27.829> have<00:03:27.979> the<00:03:28.129> HD

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
models of drift camera we have the HD

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.449 
models of drift camera we have the HD
170<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:29.509> the<00:03:30.409> new<00:03:30.560> stealth<00:03:30.949> that<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.250> was

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
170 and the new stealth that I was

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.360 
170 and the new stealth that I was
showing<00:03:31.699> you<00:03:31.819> already<00:03:32.329> and<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:33.799> cameras<00:03:34.220> are

showing you already and the cameras are

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.999 
showing you already and the cameras are
basically<00:03:34.879> identical<00:03:35.449> except<00:03:36.139> for<00:03:36.229> the

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:37.009 
basically identical except for the
