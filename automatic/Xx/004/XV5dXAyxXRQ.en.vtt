to<00:00:23.160> us<00:00:23.279> especially<00:00:24.060> from<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> design

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to us especially from a design

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.210 
to us especially from a design
perspective<00:00:24.960> because<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> first

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
front with the new grille what we call

what we've described as a bow wave
grille<00:00:42.000> which<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.200> car<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:44.040> if

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
grille which is like the the car as if

the<00:00:51.329> mkr<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:52.050> an<00:00:52.710> exercise<00:00:53.010> where<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.460> were

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the mkr was an exercise where we were

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.520 
the mkr was an exercise where we were
able<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.969> show<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.780> new<00:00:54.930> direction<00:00:55.350> of

able to show the new direction of
Lincoln<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.699> think<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> beautiful

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
Lincoln this is I think as a beautiful

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
Lincoln this is I think as a beautiful
car<00:00:57.660> we've<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> linkage<00:00:59.100> features

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
car we've got all the linkage features

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.920 
car we've got all the linkage features
that<00:00:59.640> kick<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.910> over<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> wheels<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that kick up over one of the wheels a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.180 
that kick up over one of the wheels a
beautiful<00:01:01.260> shampoo<00:01:01.710> running<00:01:01.890> down<00:01:02.070> the

entire side and this wonderful badge set
into<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> side<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> car<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:05.760> perhaps

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
into the side of the car I think perhaps

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.500 
into the side of the car I think perhaps
the<00:01:06.869> best<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:08.189> key<00:01:08.909> element<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the best the really key element of that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
the best the really key element of that
car<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:09.990> rear<00:01:10.350> end<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> flows

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
car is the rear end see how it flows

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.460 
car is the rear end see how it flows
down<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> rear<00:01:12.689> almost<00:01:13.229> bump

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
down and out to the rear almost bump

that we found in in Lincoln's history
which<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.659> felt<00:01:45.840> were<00:01:45.990> useful<00:01:46.380> again<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

which we felt were useful again in the
future<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.450> feel<00:01:48.689> gives<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> brand<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
future this we feel gives the brand a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.780 
future this we feel gives the brand a
whole<00:01:49.680> new<00:01:49.860> beginning<00:01:49.979> we've<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> new

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
whole new beginning we've got a new

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
whole new beginning we've got a new
design<00:01:51.119> language<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> new<00:01:52.409> momentum

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
design language we have a new momentum

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.410 
design language we have a new momentum
with<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> brand<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.670> selling<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.270> well

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
with a brand it's selling really well

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.080 
with a brand it's selling really well
and<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> start<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and we think that this is the start of a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.120 
and we think that this is the start of a
whole<00:01:57.119> new<00:01:57.299> era<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.750> Lincoln

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
whole new era for Lincoln
