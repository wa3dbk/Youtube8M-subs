00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
thing sitting out next to his driveway

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.219 
thing sitting out next to his driveway
and<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> was<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.390> yeah<00:02:03.540> that'll<00:02:04.020> work

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.200 
and I was like yeah that'll work
and<00:02:04.799> didn't<00:02:05.640> even<00:02:05.760> look<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.090> an

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and didn't even look like an

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.520 
and didn't even look like an
air-compressor<00:02:06.510> tank<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.380> looks

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
air-compressor tank you know it looks

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.770 
air-compressor tank you know it looks
like<00:02:07.680> one<00:02:07.830> of<00:02:07.860> those<00:02:07.979> horizontal<00:02:08.780> propane

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
like one of those horizontal propane

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.199 
like one of those horizontal propane
tanks<00:02:10.320> people<00:02:10.649> use<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:12.000> what<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
tanks people use and that's what I

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.550 
tanks people use and that's what I
thought<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.570> was<00:02:12.690> at<00:02:12.870> first<00:02:13.110> but<00:02:13.320> nonetheless

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
thought it was at first but nonetheless

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650 
thought it was at first but nonetheless
it<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.340> beast<00:02:14.610> he<00:02:14.940> said<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.239> was<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.390> hundred

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
it is a beast he said it was the hundred

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.600 
it is a beast he said it was the hundred
gallon<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.200> don't<00:02:16.470> doubt<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:17.220> fact<00:02:17.459> if

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
gallon I don't doubt that in fact if

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.770 
gallon I don't doubt that in fact if
anything<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.970> think<00:02:18.030> it's<00:02:18.269> probably<00:02:18.450> more<00:02:18.600> than

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780

anything I think it's probably more than
that<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:20.160> weighs<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> freaking<00:02:20.880> ton<00:02:21.060> we
