00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.790
 and welcome to our tuning special want 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.840
 yes manufacturers sometimes make crazy cars 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.340
 but others don't think the weather is crazy 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.560
 enough and then you get to see that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.210
 start tackling again and we give way 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.620
 imbaba gem balla security 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.030
 tonight from tackling porsche 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.529
 is true sometimes this god 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.000
 do something else they do it crazy and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.160
 then you grab a glare and and like this one 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.690
 mp4 12c 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 they apparently did not find that extreme 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.500
 enough well look around you i think 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.860
 it's really fantastic you have to enjoy it 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.680
 to hold 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.240
 bright orange specially against our lives 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.120
 they say hey edgar 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.920
 wright a lot of carbon fiber really 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.199
 carbon fiber natural and all kinds 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 details however is fantastic and that is the 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.210
 inside but walk from it to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.210
 the outside 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.829
 only those doors are different in this 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.829
 fantastic 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 the special own carbon fiber 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.600
 to nose that the so to click on 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 say the original charging points of the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.170
 original nose 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.059
 they didn't do anything about the engine 650 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.799
 PK say the customers who have spacious 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.860
 enough to do nothing about 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.640
 in spite of that it costs to buy a construction kit 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.930
 47,000 euros 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.200
 then you have to do it your own with claire 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.090
 take a moment but now go back 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.950
 to the list of this shoemaker sometimes 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.619
 I said that Porsche is there and there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.880
 here 3 portions in a row, well really 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.880
 you don't believe your eyes 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.740
 yes like i said shoemaker 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.300
 make shoemakers green because that is 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.690
 see what has now been at work 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.009
 I think what their interior says we do 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.210
 many things you have to love but 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.220
 this car 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 I'm afraid even geer and gross here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.159
 not dare to be seen but there 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 Apparently people are ahead of it 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.940
 the stanton guy around i know by god 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.080
 disagree with its renewed and tokio 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.520
 I think one of the German 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.300
 folk singer from the last century 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.300
 really insane 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.209
 and of course the 911 does not die either 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.259
 to messed up hot shambhala 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.160
 end of the year to get started with 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.160
 the new turbo 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.440
 and a6 and is like a company of your b &amp; w 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.570
 can leave bg in the street at night 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.470
 unless you are like something is 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.720
 a whole package you get it all 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.610
 choose other wheels other interior 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.690
 the out that a modified the engine on 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.270
 that can be adjusted 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.270
 this is a 640 d or better this was a 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.860
 640 I'd suddenly notice who you 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.450
 inside is that we have outside color that you have 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.800
 from outside to inside everywhere 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.170
 comes back here on the dashboard there too 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.400
 control center and to send even 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.450
 a very nice send you by the way 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.980
 say 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.390
 and the rest compared to abroad 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.980
 falls is pretty well you have the pink one 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.610
 very separate button for so for the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.610
 multimedia 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.820
 yes i am mansory is even one 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.880
 lamborgini no longer safe look where 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.680
 This chop chop I have the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.390
 think of a pasta dish but this 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.770
 case it's a car and i think you 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.940
 I already understand why this car 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.940
 hot chop 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.230
 yes you don't have fun when we have brabus 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.670
 You've been here heart lays 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.310
 towards me on mercedes and of course 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.140
 this cls shooting brake 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.370
 only under the hood it shines all 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.849
 sides it is also motor 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:20.050
 this car has been adjusted to 730 hp 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.849
 and then this baby 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.440
 brabus clint more the fastest red test 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.049
 moment on the market is called brabus 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.160
 800 guessed it all this has 800 horsepower 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.160
 there goes your toupee 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.000
 no you don't need this at ted here 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.000
 to be 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.760
 here 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.260
 also very green, there are 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.960
 continued proof of this is this tech art 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.960
 porsche 911 carrera 4s 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.810
 and if you tober it out of the volkswagen 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.090
 then let it up now 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:27.419
 that is possible with an eight out of the whole 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.949
 normal groin wave but of course also 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.930
 just with your neat neat 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.930
 chic audi a5 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.770
 fairly modest also this audi a6 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.770
 avant but has 600 hp 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.390
 and that brings us to the end of 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.250
 Geneva 2013 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.150
 at least almost what of course come 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.320
 stock market bit 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.320
 but you don't need me for that
