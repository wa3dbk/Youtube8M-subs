00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
layers so now that i'm heading to the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.510 
layers so now that i'm heading to the
crown<00:01:01.109> i'm<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.649> lifting<00:01:02.100> her<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
crown i'm actually just lifting her up a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.250 
crown i'm actually just lifting her up a
little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.629> see<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.140> very

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
little bit more as you can see it's very

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.160 
little bit more as you can see it's very
very<00:01:04.920> light<00:01:05.220> tension<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.570> fine<00:01:06.900> thinning

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
very light tension because fine thinning

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.710 
very light tension because fine thinning
here<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.979> fragile<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.180> i'm<00:01:09.299> picking<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
here is very fragile so i'm picking it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.030 
here is very fragile so i'm picking it
up<00:01:09.840> lightly<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.850> just<00:01:11.850> trimming<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> hair

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
up lightly and just trimming the hair

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.370

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
again you want to just grab individual

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770 
again you want to just grab individual
curls<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.640> break<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.909> curl<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
curls and just break that curl up and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.899 
curls and just break that curl up and
when<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> break<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.860> curl<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.610> hair

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
when you break up the curl the hair

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
when you break up the curl the hair
bounces<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.869> create<00:01:22.710> more<00:01:22.979> volume<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
bounces up and create more volume and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
bounces up and create more volume and
body<00:01:24.150> at<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> crown<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> hair<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
body at the crown of the hair so it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.160 
body at the crown of the hair so it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
allows the curls to be a little bit

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.710 
allows the curls to be a little bit
shorter<00:01:28.439> which<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.450> also

and just apply some of the moves to her

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
and just apply some of the moves to her
hair<00:01:48.689> which<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> give<00:01:49.409> her<00:01:49.500> some

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
hair which is going to give her some

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.490 
hair which is going to give her some
hold<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.540> gonna<00:01:51.810> weigh<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.290> hair

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
hold but it's not gonna weigh the hair

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
hold but it's not gonna weigh the hair
down<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.100> what's<00:01:53.490> great<00:01:53.640> about<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.060> moves

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
down and what's great about the moves

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.399 
down and what's great about the moves
that<00:01:54.299> actually

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that actually

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
that actually
is<00:01:55.619> really<00:01:55.829> fast<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.399> well<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.179> will<00:01:57.270> still

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
is really fast as well but it will still

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
is really fast as well but it will still
give<00:01:57.929> that<00:01:58.140> hair<00:01:58.409> nice<00:01:58.679> cold<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.490> see

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
give that hair nice cold and you can see

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.840 
give that hair nice cold and you can see
the<00:01:59.759> shine<00:02:00.499> coming<00:02:01.499> through<00:02:01.679> her<00:02:01.799> hair<00:02:02.069> and

the shine coming through her hair and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.700 
the shine coming through her hair and
you<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.090> want<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.329> make<00:02:03.420> sure<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.750> section

you just want to make sure you section
by<00:02:04.890> section<00:02:05.000> there<00:02:06.000> well<00:02:06.840> sometimes<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.439> have

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
by section there well sometimes you have

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.400 
by section there well sometimes you have
people<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.099> fine<00:02:08.459> thinning<00:02:08.879> hair<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
front of the hairline and again that's

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.940

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
then I will bring her back with the end

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.869 
then I will bring her back with the end
result<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:37.010> here's<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.190> photo<00:02:38.430> look<00:02:38.700> with

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
result and here's the photo look with

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.940 
result and here's the photo look with
that<00:02:39.060> model<00:02:39.299> as<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.079> see<00:02:40.290> she<00:02:40.500> has<00:02:40.530> lots

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
that model as you can see she has lots

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.080 
that model as you can see she has lots
of<00:02:41.250> body<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:42.180> volume<00:02:42.599> in<00:02:43.319> her<00:02:43.440> hair<00:02:43.769> if<00:02:44.190> you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
of body and volume in her hair if you

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.699 
of body and volume in her hair if you
just<00:02:45.299> follow<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.840> steps<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.319> showed<00:02:46.680> you

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
just follow the steps that I showed you

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.380 
just follow the steps that I showed you
which<00:02:47.099> was<00:02:47.280> making<00:02:47.609> sure<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.060> use<00:02:48.209> your

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
which was making sure you use your

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.509 
which was making sure you use your
fingers<00:02:48.930> instead<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.620> comb<00:02:49.920> because<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
fingers instead of a comb because the

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.030 
fingers instead of a comb because the
hair<00:02:50.700> tends<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.209> more<00:02:51.390> fragile<00:02:52.040> sectioning

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
hair tends to be more fragile sectioning

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.220 
hair tends to be more fragile sectioning
the<00:02:53.069> hair<00:02:53.190> from<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.090> back<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.900> crown

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
the hair from the back to the crown

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.680 
the hair from the back to the crown
making<00:02:56.099> sure<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.489> trim<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.030> ends<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
making sure you just trim the ends and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.140 
making sure you just trim the ends and
create<00:02:58.019> layers<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.590> body<00:02:58.859> to<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.190> hair<00:02:59.519> make

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
create layers and body to the hair make

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.000 
create layers and body to the hair make
sure<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.540> break<00:03:00.840> up<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.170> curl<00:03:01.470> because<00:03:01.829> that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
sure you break up that curl because that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.830 
sure you break up that curl because that
curl<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.489> what<00:03:02.700> allows<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.329> hair<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.690> have

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
curl is what allows the hair to have

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
broadly professional which was the

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.030 
broadly professional which was the
thickening<00:03:09.000> mousse<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:10.170> gel<00:03:10.500> which<00:03:10.859> was

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
frizz around the hairline and it just

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.250 
frizz around the hairline and it just
allows<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.859> be<00:03:17.069> more<00:03:17.280> smoother<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.329> you
