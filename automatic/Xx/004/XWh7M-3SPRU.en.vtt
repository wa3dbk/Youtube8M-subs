that is much more affordable than the

that is much more affordable than the
other<00:00:47.309> alternatives<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.480> the

market right now because tables like
this<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.000> crazy<00:00:51.480> expensive<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.460> know

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550

this can be crazy expensive but you know
this<00:00:53.850> particularly<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.020> geek<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> son

this particularly that the geek and son
are<00:00:55.920> seein<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.280> doing<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.239> gotten<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
are seein is doing can be gotten for a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.000

fraction<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> regular<00:00:58.770> price

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
fraction of the regular price

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
fraction of the regular price
so<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.399> talked<00:00:59.670> quite<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.390> about<00:01:00.870> how

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
we could actually get one of these

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
we could actually get one of these
tables<00:01:02.520> from<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.510> believe<00:01:03.840> they're<00:01:03.960> made<00:01:04.110> in

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
tables from I believe they're made in

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.870 
tables from I believe they're made in
Poland<00:01:04.439> down<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.640> Malta<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:08.189> deal

put up a video of this weekend showing
the<00:01:50.610> dennis<00:01:51.119> gaming<00:01:51.600> table<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> i'm<00:01:52.439> just

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the dennis gaming table and i'm just

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.020 
the dennis gaming table and i'm just
going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> go<00:01:52.920> ahead<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.280> play<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.549> hopefully

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
going to go ahead and play it hopefully

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.520 
going to go ahead and play it hopefully
this<00:01:54.119> will<00:01:54.210> play<00:01:54.390> smoothly<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.320> shows

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
this will play smoothly and it shows

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
this will play smoothly and it shows
some<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> features<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.969> basic<00:01:57.450> line

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
some of the features of the basic line

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.899 
some of the features of the basic line
this<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.159> know<00:01:59.219> hot<00:01:59.460> off<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
this is actually you know hot off the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.639 
this is actually you know hot off the
assembly<00:02:00.060> line<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.689> their<00:02:00.899> copies<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
assembly line one of their copies as you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.300 
assembly line one of their copies as you
can<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.549> first<00:02:02.790> thing<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.719> notion

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
can see the first thing is the notion

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.059 
can see the first thing is the notion
that<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.450> vault<00:02:06.869> floor<00:02:07.259> i<00:02:07.560> believe

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
that there is the vault floor i believe

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.710 
that there is the vault floor i believe
the<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.550> i'm<00:02:08.759> getting<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.209> actually<00:02:09.360> going<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
the one i'm getting is actually going to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.839 
the one i'm getting is actually going to
be<00:02:09.780> white<00:02:10.110> much<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.129> know<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> tabletop

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
be white much like you know the tabletop

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.780 
be white much like you know the tabletop
i<00:02:11.970> film<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.420> right

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
i film on right

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.459 
i film on right
now<00:02:12.879> then<00:02:13.480> on<00:02:13.629> top<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.959> I'm<00:02:14.049> really<00:02:14.290> excited

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469

about this being able to get a crit a
clear<00:02:16.360> acrylic<00:02:16.810> layer<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.560> goes<00:02:17.739> on<00:02:18.010> top<00:02:18.250> of

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
clear acrylic layer that goes on top of

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.490

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
play a lot of prototypes on a lot of

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.229 
play a lot of prototypes on a lot of
paper<00:02:22.930> maps<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.439> mean<00:02:23.590> you've<00:02:23.709> seen<00:02:24.010> us<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.879> see

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
just cut a piece of acrylic that we took

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.140 
just cut a piece of acrylic that we took
off<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.829> a<00:02:29.890> picture<00:02:30.069> frame<00:02:30.459> which<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.700> less

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
off of a picture frame which is less

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.479 
off of a picture frame which is less
than<00:02:31.329> ideal<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.900> I'm<00:02:32.019> very<00:02:32.439> excited<00:02:33.069> as<00:02:33.340> you

being able to finally lay these paper
boards<00:02:38.980> I've<00:02:39.129> got<00:02:39.400> flat<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.359> film<00:02:40.659> them

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
boards I've got flat so I can film them

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.270 
boards I've got flat so I can film them
a<00:02:41.109> little<00:02:41.650> bit<00:02:41.769> more<00:02:41.799> nicely<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:43.680> see<00:02:44.680> oh<00:02:44.980> yeah

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
and also we can keep the plexiglass in

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.059 
and also we can keep the plexiglass in
the<00:02:49.629> table<00:02:49.930> we<00:02:50.019> don't<00:02:50.049> have<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.439> store<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.769> in

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
the table we don't have to store it in

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.220 
the table we don't have to store it in
Jen's<00:02:51.430> work<00:02:51.730> room<00:02:52.419> light<00:02:52.689> which<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.019> what<00:02:53.139> we

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
Jen's work room light which is what we

Jen's work room light which is what we
basically<00:02:53.439> do<00:02:53.709> right<00:02:53.889> now<00:02:54.040> now<00:02:54.639> this<00:02:54.849> next

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
you will notice boom this is a lit table

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.909 
you will notice boom this is a lit table
not<00:03:01.060> funny<00:03:01.329> this<00:03:01.689> was<00:03:01.900> actually<00:03:02.169> Jen's<00:03:02.709> idea

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
not funny this was actually Jen's idea

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.009 
not funny this was actually Jen's idea
when<00:03:03.340> Jen<00:03:03.609> started<00:03:03.939> talking<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.239> Marcin<00:03:04.689> this

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
when Jen started talking to Marcin this

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.270 
when Jen started talking to Marcin this
is<00:03:05.169> the<00:03:05.260> first<00:03:05.470> thing<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.650> came<00:03:05.829> into<00:03:06.040> mind

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
is the first thing that came into mind

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.550 
is the first thing that came into mind
LED<00:03:07.060> lights<00:03:07.359> that<00:03:07.629> you<00:03:08.019> know<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.139> could<00:03:08.379> add

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
LED lights that you know you could add

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.099 
LED lights that you know you could add
so<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:08.889> can<00:03:09.040> make<00:03:09.189> really<00:03:09.819> cool<00:03:10.180> Atmos<00:03:10.750> if<00:03:10.989> you

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
so you can make really cool Atmos if you

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.420 
so you can make really cool Atmos if you
wanna<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:11.379> a<00:03:11.409> dungeon<00:03:11.769> crawl<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.129> make<00:03:12.280> for

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
wanna have a dungeon crawl and make for

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.920 
wanna have a dungeon crawl and make for
some<00:03:12.549> really<00:03:12.819> interesting<00:03:13.150> creepy<00:03:13.689> lighting

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
some really interesting creepy lighting

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.720 
some really interesting creepy lighting
you<00:03:14.439> can<00:03:14.650> actually<00:03:14.889> have<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:15.220> apparently

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
you can actually have that apparently

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.449 
you can actually have that apparently
those<00:03:16.209> LED<00:03:16.659> strips<00:03:17.379> are<00:03:17.620> programmable<00:03:18.220> so

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
those LED strips are programmable so

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.789 
those LED strips are programmable so
they<00:03:18.549> can<00:03:18.760> do<00:03:18.909> strobing<00:03:19.599> and<00:03:19.780> flashing<00:03:20.379> it<00:03:20.650> can

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
they can do strobing and flashing it can

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.319 
they can do strobing and flashing it can
be<00:03:20.919> different<00:03:21.250> colored<00:03:21.549> lighting<00:03:21.849> as<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.180> can

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
be different colored lighting as you can
