loving this PS Vita edition and it's

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.150 
loving this PS Vita edition and it's
obviously<00:01:01.810> up<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:02.140> date<00:01:02.530> with<00:01:02.560> the<00:01:02.770> current

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
obviously up to date with the current

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.789
