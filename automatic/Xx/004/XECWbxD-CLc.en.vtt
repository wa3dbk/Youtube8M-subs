encourage<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.399> it's<00:01:59.149> just<00:01:59.270> whatever<00:01:59.539> you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
encourage you to it's just whatever you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.910 
encourage you to it's just whatever you
have<00:01:59.929> works<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:02.200> then<00:02:03.200> an<00:02:03.499> optional

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
have works and then an optional

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.289 
have works and then an optional

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
ingredient is some cinnamon

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.550
