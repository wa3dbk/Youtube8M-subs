00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.900

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.020
 to 650 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.980
 we can see the lockscreen from there 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.840
 we can make applications very quickly 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.650
 start up by simply lifting it up 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.090
 sweep 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.720
 can also just lure in this case 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.220
 have a pin code on it then a lock 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.759
 according to him on the home screen 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.590
 justly 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.899

 social media bike as in certain bike 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.610
 of certain websites such as 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.590
 news websites that get a bike 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.290
 according to self-setting so that 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.950
 there is always something what you want 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.570
 see 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.160
 Well do you get preview on what to 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.050
 your own social media linked is one 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.770
 open it directly in the application 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.750
 want to be super cool so you don't 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.920
 the separate sense interface only comes 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.910
 you just enter the application itself 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.579
 rightly from 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.360
 van van the social media feat so there 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.770
 so you can go through it very easily 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.869
 You can track everything right away 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.280
 what your friends do you want to refresh after 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.560
 then just move down and then 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.999
 he is going to immediately update positive 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.340
 act and time and temperature 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:13.600
 if we click this then come to it 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.490
 weather section 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 we see through everything and they applications 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.469
 just as left and right can 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.149
 scroll 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.100
 cindy for example the weather now you can 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.509
 see how the weather will be and per hour 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.679
 of course we can still see what the 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.840
 forecast will be in the longer term 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.030
 may also display the location 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.740
 adjust if we would like 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.090
 here we are going to be back here 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.219
 for the rest just tabs with 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.659
 widgets and shortcuts that you can 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.340
 by adjusting it in an empty place 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.840
 then you see all the windows that we have 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.549
 we now have another one here 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.079
 window can be set as your home screen 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.609
 itself can adapt quite yet 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.439
 add additional windows and here too 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.299
 add widgets immediately 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.859
 now we immediately see that sense year 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.799
 element affects how android 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.420
 looks own font looks yes 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.609
 especially the home screen is then natural 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.859
 a piece yes a lot different from what we do 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.929
 accustomed now we'll just see what 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.579
 add scenes even more, let's go 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.109
 look at the mail application 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.789
 if a mail also exists such as 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.920
 here we see see unread may see 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.450
 read in million times in that mail 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.599
 can do all kinds of things like us 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.600
 used to be very uncluttered and find 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.160
 you have a number of options 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.080
 this email 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.700
 it is also interesting that that is all 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.270
 emails become a credit employer so you have 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.650
 a mail 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.420
 conversation with someone then it becomes 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.800
 you also see all credit 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.210
 further all accounts that you can there 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.560
 of course I add another account 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.060
 can all synchronize 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.680
 can also click on certain account co 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.350
 on the folder next to it and then 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.520
 you can also view another folder 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.080
 so do not necessarily only have the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.160
 to synchronize your inbox 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.230
 here again we can go to it again 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.700
 scroll right to left to 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.470
 see different options have 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.690
 everything you have favorite and have some 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.580
 unread e-mail that sorts it then 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.070
 in a very handy and fun way 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.900
 He can also call the film this 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.460
 The phone screen is all he can 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.900
 see also calls we sweep here 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.060
 always back to the side 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.860
 find all contacts here can also be quite 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.540
 quickly scroll through contacts through Sun. 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.740
 to go up and down 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.530
 also never finds groups here that can 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.080
 Create and manage itself naturally well 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.250
 are going back again 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.960
 well we have seen the mail have you 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.540
 yet the agenda agenda is of course one 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.550
 also the same sense interface 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.920
 Yes, we see all appointments here 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.330
 just see it again on a certain day 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.030
 and can also go through the days 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.130
 so after we see all appointments 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.500
 come back when click on an appointment 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.340
 then you immediately see where that appointment 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.410
 comes from 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.300
 what that agreement exactly entails or the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.950
 invited people are people or not 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.780
 so well that is always very simple 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.580
 to find back 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.630
 now we go to the home screen for a moment 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.780
 can do some small application here 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.920
 so, for example, add one 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.230
 an application that lets you use the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.660
 stock exchange and can quickly view looks 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.280
 all look tight again and one 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.660
 note application this also integrates 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.130
 complete with evernote 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.290
 so all the notes that you made you can 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.700
 also add photos spoken messages 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.530
 very handy application that will also be 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.270
 synchronized automatically with 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.340
 evernote are fun and handy 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.730
 addition now finally also have 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.930

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.030
 see all the photos made here 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.290
 with this unit we see here too 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.120
 same bike being synchronized 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.910
 again from your social media 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.100
 so that is interesting in itself 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.480
 can also see photos of your friends we 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.830

 extensive watching the photo and video 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.790

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.050
 well finally let's take a look at the 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.610
 location screen here come all 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.229

 energy saving on and off quickly 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.250
 and we find all settings here 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.340
 back 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.900
 which we scroll through quickly 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.850
 we also see the settings menu 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.980
 small adjustment compared to 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.140
 the normal settings menu 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.790
