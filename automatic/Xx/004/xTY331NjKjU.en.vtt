you're<00:05:00.250> always<00:05:00.340> going<00:05:00.729> to<00:05:00.820> encounter<00:05:01.120> that<00:05:01.419> if

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
you're always going to encounter that if

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.600 
you're always going to encounter that if
you<00:05:01.750> got<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:01.960> strong<00:05:02.350> family<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.860> strong

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
you got a strong family a strong

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.520 
you got a strong family a strong
background<00:05:03.910> you'll<00:05:04.479> be<00:05:04.630> able<00:05:04.690> to<00:05:04.840> really

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
background you'll be able to really

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.000 
background you'll be able to really
fight<00:05:05.740> through<00:05:05.950> it<00:05:07.530> how<00:05:08.530> about<00:05:08.680> any<00:05:08.919> new

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
fight through it how about any new

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.120 
fight through it how about any new
year's<00:05:09.250> resolutions<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:11.190> think<00:05:12.750> New<00:05:13.750> Year's

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
year's resolutions I think New Year's

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.790 
year's resolutions I think New Year's
resolution<00:05:15.130> probably<00:05:15.580> would<00:05:15.700> be<00:05:15.850> just<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.419> uh

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
resolution probably would be just to uh

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.070 
resolution probably would be just to uh
you<00:05:17.800> know<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:17.979> have<00:05:18.250> family<00:05:18.520> around<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.870> have

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
you know to have family around to have

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.370 
you know to have family around to have
you<00:05:20.470> know<00:05:20.850> people<00:05:21.850> healthy<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:24.450> and<00:05:25.450> probably

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
you know people healthy and and probably

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.500 
you know people healthy and and probably
I<00:05:26.740> think<00:05:26.979> with<00:05:27.250> this<00:05:27.340> economy<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:28.180> stuff<00:05:28.360> like

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
I think with this economy and stuff like

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.659 
I think with this economy and stuff like
that<00:05:28.570> you<00:05:29.080> know<00:05:29.200> try<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.590> turn<00:05:30.370> this<00:05:30.430> around

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
that you know try to turn this around

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.640 
that you know try to turn this around
get<00:05:31.419> it<00:05:31.539> back<00:05:31.750> heading<00:05:32.289> in<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.500> right

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
get it back heading in the right
