00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.410
 new kirby compet last week 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.240

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.799
 I asked you to solve a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.599
 riddle from a disc that you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.690
 will give via the video 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.400
 number thirteen plus to 10 facebook i 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.199
 gave facebook cannabis why because 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.199
 that I noticed that the answer was 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 given several times just a few 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.119
 hours after the broadcast of the video 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 on youtube and ben two players were 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.250
 came out in the messages it was 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.380
 ratatouille and trivial pursuit it was 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.440
 especially thanks to a 10 cheeses and well 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.450
 the answer was trivial pursuit because 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 that already console new jeanne 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.860
 new generation is at 300 ps3 wii 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.750
 the outputs be the three consoles the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.710
 10 intelligence about the fact 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.969
 that star is a game of intelligence 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 that is to say to answer to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 questions and then the a10 cheese base 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 because that's with that represented the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.660
 pie chart for like in the game of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.360
 society and so suddenly the person who 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.800
 told me the answer first I think 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.719
 that he did not say a quarter of an hour later 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.070
 broadcast so good I was a little 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.110
 disgusted because I wanted to make it last 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.280
 the suspense but when we see that the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.060
 answer was given a quarter of an hour 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.850
 after j -p 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.729
 due will become monday this cheese all of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.240
