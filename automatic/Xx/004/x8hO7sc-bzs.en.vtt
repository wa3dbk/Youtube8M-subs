00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.839 
go and tire the second station then show
you<00:00:24.990> guys<00:00:25.140> where<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.350> disc<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
you guys where the disc is it's in a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.250 
you guys where the disc is it's in a
number<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> places<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.779> always<00:00:27.960> inside

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
number of places but it's always inside

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.019 
number of places but it's always inside
that<00:00:28.380> little<00:00:28.470> bunker<00:00:28.859> area<00:00:29.039> there's<00:00:29.429> bits<00:00:29.760> in

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that little bunker area there's bits in

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
that little bunker area there's bits in
one<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.900> maybe<00:00:31.080> three<00:00:31.349> different<00:00:31.619> places

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
one of like maybe three different places

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440 
one of like maybe three different places
inside<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> bunker<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.120> gonna<00:00:33.210> power

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
inside the bunker so I'm gonna power

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.780 
inside the bunker so I'm gonna power
this<00:00:33.600> up<00:00:33.780> right<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.140> go<00:00:34.739> down<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.190> area

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
this up right here go down in this area

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.280 
this up right here go down in this area
it's<00:00:35.940> usually<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> right<00:00:36.840> back

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
it's usually right to the right back

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.319 
it's usually right to the right back
where<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.370> shelf<00:00:38.670> over<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:38.940> or

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
where I was on that shelf over here or

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.170 
where I was on that shelf over here or
on<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.629> shelf<00:00:39.840> over<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.000> that's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
on this shelf over here which so that's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540 
on this shelf over here which so that's
that<00:00:42.450> part<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that part right there now you have to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
that part right there now you have to
basically<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.600> random<00:00:45.750> one

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
basically this is kind of a random one

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.100 
basically this is kind of a random one
you<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.039> able<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> dig<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.460> piles<00:00:48.110> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you have to be able to dig up piles and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.569 
you have to be able to dig up piles and
you<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.410> dig<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.860> random<00:00:50.219> piles

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you just dig up random piles

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.880 
you just dig up random piles
I<00:00:50.670> guess<00:00:51.210> supposedly<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.289> supposed<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.739> be

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
I guess supposedly it's supposed to be

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.200 
I guess supposedly it's supposed to be
snowing<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.460> areas<00:00:53.760> where<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.000> dig<00:00:54.149> them

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
snowing in the areas where you dig them

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.689 
snowing in the areas where you dig them
up<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.050> can't<00:00:55.410> confirm<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
up not I can't confirm that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.540 
up not I can't confirm that
I'm<00:00:57.090> gonna<00:00:57.420> guess<00:00:57.719> 100%<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> can

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
I'm gonna guess 100% or not but you can

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670 
I'm gonna guess 100% or not but you can
see<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.210> video<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.660> pick<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
see in this video I pick up all the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.189 
see in this video I pick up all the
pieces<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.300> snowing<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
pieces and it is snowing in all of the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
pieces and it is snowing in all of the
areas<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.280> basically<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.000> dig

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
areas so you just basically have to dig

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.580 
areas so you just basically have to dig
up<00:01:06.689> areas<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> don't<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.439> where<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
up areas if you don't know where the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.380 
up areas if you don't know where the
shovel<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.640> against<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> wall<00:01:09.210> in

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
shovel is it's up against the wall in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.640 
shovel is it's up against the wall in
the<00:01:09.479> very<00:01:09.630> first<00:01:09.869> room<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> second<00:01:10.530> room

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the very first room of the second room

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
the very first room of the second room
even<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> tutorial<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.720> where<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> find

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
even I have a tutorial on where to find

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.450 
even I have a tutorial on where to find
some<00:01:13.290> shovels<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> playlist<00:01:14.400> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
some shovels as well and the playlist in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.190 
some shovels as well and the playlist in
the<00:01:14.520> description<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.810> dig<00:01:16.049> up

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the description but you just dig up

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
the description but you just dig up
random<00:01:16.530> files<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> eventually<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:17.759> get

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
random files and eventually you will get

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.730 
random files and eventually you will get
three<00:01:18.299> pieces<00:01:18.509> once<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.560> three

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
three pieces once you get all three

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
three pieces once you get all three
pieces<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> disk<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.869> go

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
pieces and you have the disk you can go

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.630 
pieces and you have the disk you can go
ahead<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.439> down<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> snow<00:01:23.189> cave<00:01:23.400> or

up taking this portal over here and you
just<00:02:24.360> walk<00:02:24.569> straight<00:02:24.810> ahead<00:02:25.079> and<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:26.310> go

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
just walk straight ahead and you go

now you can you can see that the it
looks<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.430> snowflake<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.269> upper<00:02:33.510> left

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
looks like a snowflake in the upper left

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.660 
looks like a snowflake in the upper left
hand<00:02:33.810> corner<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.890> means<00:02:35.159> that<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.489> all

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
the parts I believe needed and I can go

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.860 
the parts I believe needed and I can go
back<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.459> actually<00:02:38.819> pick<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.239> my<00:02:39.329> staff<00:02:39.599> so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870

back and actually pick up my staff so
this<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.620> pretty<00:02:40.829> much<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.150> again<00:02:42.389> one

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
this is pretty much it this is again one

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.720 
this is pretty much it this is again one
of<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> most<00:02:43.109> random<00:02:43.290> ones<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
of the most random ones the the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.250 
of the most random ones the the
locations<00:02:45.269> are<00:02:45.569> different<00:02:46.049> every<00:02:46.139> single

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
locations are different every single

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.170 
locations are different every single
time<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.829> staff<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.430> lot<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.030> other

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
time for the staff a lot of the other

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.930 
time for the staff a lot of the other
ones<00:02:48.440> there<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.769> pretty<00:02:49.980> much<00:02:50.220> more<00:02:50.459> routine

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
ones there it's pretty much more routine

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.539 
ones there it's pretty much more routine
than<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.329> but<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:52.739> this<00:02:52.859> is<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.129> way<00:02:53.370> this

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
than this but but this is just way this

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.460 
than this but but this is just way this
one<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.819> now<00:02:54.359> you<00:02:54.420> go<00:02:54.659> to<00:02:54.720> go<00:02:54.930> back<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.349> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
one is now you go to go back to the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.710 
one is now you go to go back to the
other<00:02:55.650> area<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:57.030> need<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.359> go<00:02:57.510> ahead<00:02:57.599> and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
other area and you need to go ahead and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.660 
other area and you need to go ahead and
hightail<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.200> over<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.920> excavation<00:02:59.549> area

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
hightail it over to the excavation area

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.030 
hightail it over to the excavation area
which<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.389> no-man's<00:03:00.720> land<00:03:01.049> or
