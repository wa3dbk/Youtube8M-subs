00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.540
 i 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.550
 to what I think of the design landscape 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.370
 Mexican but before entering the subject 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.250
 and I will try to be as brief as possible 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.030
 that one thing to be a creative director 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.470
 and another thing is design direction as 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.720
 I think so 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.640
 a creative director is a person who 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.290
 he has a lot of wisdom experience 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.870
 uncertain then has the ability to 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.870
 lead 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.629
 and being a team manager and also 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.230
 do the job of design direction 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.690
 but what 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:10.210
 it is necessary that young people know about 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.369
 design direction design then 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.369
 what seems to remove the easiest 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.020
 it is important to say that beyond 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.810
 what are industrial designers 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.899
 if they see that we have this basic capacity 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.229
 to detect analyze and solve 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.229
 problems 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.090
 we also have to be aware 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.430
 that we can tell a person to a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.500
 brand one manufactured where it can well 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.229
 but there are different ways of doing it 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.120
 then imagine that you have two 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.910
 factories a factory there is a factory and 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.570
 the two factories in a useless product 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:00.130
 it's useless for the first factory 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.190
 it produces it sells and repeats this cycle 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.370
 always makes some changes from time to time 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.350
 when it depends what comments comes in 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.050
 it depends on how you see them number two but 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.750
 it stays linear is one more factory in 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.560
 the map 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.130
 the factory sees for example is a factory 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.810
 before d 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.380
 happen 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.780
 to this process 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.470
 something primitive of 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.340
 I have my product I produce it and I sell it 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.129
 before that it is dedicated to 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.790
 maybe detect or perhaps understand 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:44.810
 fund your users to your consumer and 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.090
 start to get a lot of 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.230
 information from all sides trends 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.050
 news new technologies 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.060
 what is this person thinking is this 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.280
 person as you want to do in the future 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.690
 what is this person's vision of 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.180
 perhaps of that useless product and in the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.450
 other information with whom you imagine 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.660
 which has a large library of 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.959
 of data you as a designer starts to 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.310
 take what you need most weapons in 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.700
 a collage used in your head and based on 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.769
 this you start to delimit certain 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.709
 information and with this information 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.090
 you start to create a story and a 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.870
 story that is somehow 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.410
 will clean your product to its functionality 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.410
 if it served for something and the person to 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.470
 what are you going to sell it to 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.890
 and based on this story you can 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.890
 assume 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.100
 of shapes that lines of colors that 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.340
 materials that processes that textures that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.240
 scents flavors start 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.460
 delimit then imagine that of all 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.650
 the information you came up with the super 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.230
 random 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.280
 a history of agence we are not going to because 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.590
 the consumer likes someone 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.390
 then it 's easy there like that 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.540
 will start through colors then 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.430
 one thinks immediately to the green and what 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.549
 contrast know what materials then 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.160
 at the moment of delimiting all this and 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.600
 create those stories in real is 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.030
 adding much more value to a product 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.070
 then the same product that is 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.750
 making the factory 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.880
 it was repeated has more value already has more 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.820
 connection with the person who is going to 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.350
 buy and this be in my context what 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.630
 that I also see as the direction of 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.270
 design to have this capacity as 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.700
 designers demarcate this 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.590
 information that can influence a 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.470
 product a lot or in a line of 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.120
 products 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.780
 then you as a designer have a 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.480
 capacity of 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.070
 create stories that are going to influence maybe 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.680
 in a whole line of products that 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.210
 several designers are going to execute but 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.950
 minimum in tourists saying where 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.550
 things go and they have much more 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.270
 potential in the market also has a 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.080
 level of a much higher level of 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.600
 authenticity and I think that this is 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.850
 part of the missing piece in the 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.950
 Mexican puzzle or pieces 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.380
 missing 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.380
 we have many factories we have many 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.230
 designers but we need to know 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.270
 tell them how to add this value how 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.669
 make this product more exciting for 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.140
 for users or even at 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.090
 investor who is watching it for 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.710
 what do you say you have to do it then 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.760
 it is a subject of the extensive but 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.449
 I think everything is limited to that process 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:52.199
 even before thinking about a problem 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.879
 how could you gather all this data and 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.460
 create all these stories that could 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.020
 be the attractive or they could be the 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.559
 context of a great product in the 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.979
 future and only happens compared to 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:05.099
 pain 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:08.099
 nike and is a company that is expert in 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:11.669
 this theme of the stories they can 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.229
 sell the same shoe a thousand times but 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.509
 house for all have a different 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.279
 story of house duck based a success to 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.860
 Although it may be the same shoe 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:22.490
 blank you know or maybe you have 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.039
 true color for some reason 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.580
 but history has that connection that 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:30.360
 hit with people who are successful 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.569
 so 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.580
 but there's a lot to dig up in this 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.830
 scheme and I think it's pretty pretty 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.770
 important for young designers 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.770
 in Mexico learn to dominate 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.770
 Y
