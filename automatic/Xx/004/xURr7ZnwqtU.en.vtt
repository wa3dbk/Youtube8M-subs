00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.900
 and 20 good afternoon a greeting very 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.180
 special to all those who follow me in 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.330
 the tutorial videos on this occasion 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.080
 let's talk about the famous rhythms of 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:25.270
 meringue but let's discuss a 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:28.119
 variant that is very true well known 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.090
 In the Dominican Republic I greet my 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.320
 Dominican friends this we are talking about 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.829
 of what is the famous gravel 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.270
 It is a very spicy variant and very very 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.790
 typical of the neighboring country 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.980
 let's make some true examples for 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.250
 that you see more or less of what 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250
 about 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 we go in F major 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.619
 how did you see that is a variant of what 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.170
 what is the weapon of libya 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.759
 ok let's make another example true 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 so they can see 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.640
 i 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.150
 on this basis I will learn 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.250
 more or less when it changes from greater to 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.520
 minor on this occasion truth let's 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.520
 use a re major I say minor pardon 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.180
 but let's use normal tones you're 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.180
 so brave these voices 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.920
 let's see with my older 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.920
 the smallest network 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.890
 Y 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:50.440
 and as you can see there are many variants around 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.940
 what is the gravel 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.330
 and without a novel two examples we can do 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.440
 a rhythm without that without touching much truth 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.440
 and it can be very nice today 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.990
 as they found the dairy level with 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.940
 different voices 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.430
 and using tones of them 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.630
 to give a touch see the topics more 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.090
 interesting if we also come this 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.230
 another variant that the group uses a lot 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.700
 he puts 21 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.210
 greetings to the defeated bullet 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.080
 this showed an example of the most or 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.080
 less than what he does 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.870
 thanks all this this time I would say that 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.140
 it's a lot of truth information for a 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.540
 small video but then we're going to do 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.290
 other videos explaining how to do this 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.290
 type of rhythms
