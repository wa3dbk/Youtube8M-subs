then<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.899> kind<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.170> long<00:00:46.379> yet<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.739> can

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
then this is kind of long yet you can

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
then this is kind of long yet you can
chop<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.100> off<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.640> end<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.879> wanted<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.329> i'm

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
chop it off the end if you wanted to i'm

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.720 
chop it off the end if you wanted to i'm
pretty<00:00:49.140> sure<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.890> really

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
pretty sure to just have this really

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
pretty sure to just have this really
long<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.329> safety<00:00:51.750> purposes<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.829> just

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
long for safety purposes and you just

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
long for safety purposes and you just
fire<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.870> whoops<00:00:54.870> move<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:58.170> i

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
fire it whoops move it like that but i

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.250

have<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:01.340> size<00:01:02.340> comparisons

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
have to like it off so size comparisons

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.530 
have to like it off so size comparisons
you<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.379> them<00:01:04.500> next<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.330> darken<00:01:06.330> moon

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you have them next to darken moon

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.050 
you have them next to darken moon

so honestly you know I don't think the
size<00:01:18.180> isn't<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.170> bad<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.710> scale<00:01:20.330> compared

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
size isn't that bad and scale compared

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.249 
size isn't that bad and scale compared

figures<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.500> know<00:03:39.650> there<00:03:39.860> are<00:03:40.030> basically<00:03:41.030> a

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
figures you know there are basically a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.060 
figures you know there are basically a
continuation<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:41.990> either<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.290> classics<00:03:42.860> line

but sometimes they come up with these

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.660

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
about it let's get into size comparisons

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.500 
about it let's get into size comparisons
alright<00:04:45.710> guys<00:04:45.860> size<00:04:46.160> comparisons<00:04:46.910> pretty

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
alright guys size comparisons pretty

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.580 
alright guys size comparisons pretty
average<00:04:47.720> size<00:04:48.050> deluxe<00:04:48.380> class<00:04:48.530> figure

average size deluxe class figure

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.159 
average size deluxe class figure
actually<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.640> bit<00:04:49.760> bigger<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.810> some<00:04:51.020> others

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
actually a bit bigger and some others

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.560

but<00:04:51.530> it's<00:04:51.620> pretty<00:04:51.800> good<00:04:52.419> understandable<00:04:53.419> he's

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
but it's pretty good understandable he's

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.750 
but it's pretty good understandable he's
a<00:04:53.600> tank<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.110> I<00:04:54.169> should<00:04:54.410> be<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.650> bigger<00:04:54.890> but

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
a tank so I should be the bigger but

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.580 
a tank so I should be the bigger but
overall<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.450> looks<00:04:56.480> pretty<00:04:56.780> nice<00:04:56.930> compared<00:04:57.530> to

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
overall it looks pretty nice compared to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.500 
overall it looks pretty nice compared to
the<00:04:57.650> rest<00:04:57.770> of<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.950> figures<00:04:58.360> whatever<00:04:59.360> you

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
the rest of the figures whatever you

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.510 
the rest of the figures whatever you
have<00:04:59.540> them<00:04:59.810> standing<00:05:00.080> next<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.530> standing<00:05:01.370> next

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
have them standing next to standing next

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.000 
have them standing next to standing next
to<00:05:02.050> one<00:05:03.050> thing<00:05:03.200> I<00:05:03.230> wanted<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.470> point<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.770> i

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
to one thing I wanted to point that i

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.390 
to one thing I wanted to point that i
forgot<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.310> if<00:05:05.000> you<00:05:05.060> look<00:05:05.210> at<00:05:05.330> his<00:05:05.780> arms<00:05:06.400> and

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
forgot to if you look at his arms and

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.300 
forgot to if you look at his arms and
also<00:05:07.850> his<00:05:08.150> legs<00:05:08.390> he<00:05:08.630> has<00:05:08.750> little<00:05:08.960> poles<00:05:09.350> it's

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
also his legs he has little poles it's

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.980 
also his legs he has little poles it's
okay<00:05:10.520> so<00:05:10.580> if<00:05:10.850> you<00:05:11.030> have<00:05:11.150> any<00:05:11.450> kind<00:05:11.690> of<00:05:11.780> weapon

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
okay so if you have any kind of weapon

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.010 
okay so if you have any kind of weapon
or<00:05:12.890> something<00:05:13.340> if<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.300> has<00:05:14.450> those<00:05:14.780> little

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
or something if it has those little

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.830 
or something if it has those little
hinges<00:05:15.640> like<00:05:16.640> that<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:17.330> guys<00:05:17.480> just<00:05:17.510> stick

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
hinges like that you guys just stick

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.370 
hinges like that you guys just stick
them<00:05:17.930> in<00:05:18.080> there<00:05:18.700> like<00:05:19.700> that<00:05:19.910> of<00:05:20.570> course<00:05:20.900> if<00:05:21.169> you

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
them in there like that of course if you

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.480 
them in there like that of course if you
have<00:05:21.560> an<00:05:21.800> accurate<00:05:22.810> rough<00:05:23.810> weapon<00:05:24.260> that<00:05:25.190> fits

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
have an accurate rough weapon that fits

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.219 
have an accurate rough weapon that fits
in<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.669> right<00:05:25.820> direction<00:05:25.910> would<00:05:26.450> make<00:05:27.050> more

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
in the right direction would make more

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.840 
in the right direction would make more
sense<00:05:27.290> but<00:05:27.770> either<00:05:27.919> way<00:05:28.160> you<00:05:28.220> could<00:05:28.520> do<00:05:28.700> that

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
sense but either way you could do that

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.330 
sense but either way you could do that
so<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.270> option<00:05:29.600> is<00:05:29.690> there<00:05:29.750> so<00:05:30.740> that's<00:05:31.160> about

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
so the option is there so that's about

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.230 
so the option is there so that's about
it<00:05:31.490> guys<00:05:32.470> obviously<00:05:33.470> he's<00:05:34.000> warpath<00:05:35.000> is

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
it guys obviously he's warpath is

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.969 
it guys obviously he's warpath is
obviously<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:35.780> character<00:05:36.380> that<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:36.620> did<00:05:36.830> not

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
obviously a character that I did not

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.400 
obviously a character that I did not
care<00:05:37.220> that<00:05:37.250> much<00:05:37.460> about<00:05:37.750> but<00:05:38.750> when<00:05:38.990> this

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
care that much about but when this

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.830 
care that much about but when this
