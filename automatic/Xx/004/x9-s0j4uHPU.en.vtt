00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
everyone today I wanted to show you this

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.610 
everyone today I wanted to show you this
analog<00:00:11.429> clock<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.090> made<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.630> Benidorm

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
analog clock that I made in Benidorm

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.039 
analog clock that I made in Benidorm
when<00:00:13.920> eight<00:00:14.040> using<00:00:14.969> command<00:00:15.330> blocks<00:00:15.570> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
when eight using command blocks and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.830 
when eight using command blocks and
armor<00:00:16.529> stands<00:00:18.560> this<00:00:19.560> clock<00:00:19.859> takes<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
armor stands this clock takes the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.099 
armor stands this clock takes the
Minecrafts<00:00:21.840> time<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.560> day<00:00:23.330> to<00:00:24.330> determine<00:00:24.570> what

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
Minecrafts time of day to determine what

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.859 
Minecrafts time of day to determine what
position<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.519> clock<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.300> if<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.599> did

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
position the clock is at so if I did

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.620 
position the clock is at so if I did
slash<00:00:28.410> time<00:00:28.769> set<00:00:29.099> six<00:00:29.400> thousand<00:00:29.880> which<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
slash time set six thousand which is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.580 
slash time set six thousand which is
midday

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
midday

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.850 
midday
it<00:00:32.430> makes<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.969> o'clock<00:00:33.180> twelve<00:00:33.719> o'clock<00:00:36.860> so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it makes the o'clock twelve o'clock so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160 
it makes the o'clock twelve o'clock so
if<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.390> nineteen<00:00:39.390> thousand<00:00:39.870> which<00:00:39.989> i<00:00:40.110> think

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
if I do nineteen thousand which i think

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.770 
if I do nineteen thousand which i think
is<00:00:40.410> 2<00:00:40.860> p.m.<00:00:41.750> or<00:00:42.750> 2<00:00:42.960> a.m.<00:00:43.140> actually<00:00:44.660> then<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
is 2 p.m. or 2 a.m. actually then it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.560 
is 2 p.m. or 2 a.m. actually then it
will<00:00:45.899> set<00:00:46.550> set<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.719> how<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.930> position<00:00:51.980> yeah

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
will set set it how that position yeah

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.570 
will set set it how that position yeah
sort<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> Bank<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> 6,000

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
sort of Bank of 6,000

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.610 
sort of Bank of 6,000
so<00:00:57.580> I'll<00:00:57.910> quickly<00:00:58.540> try<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.020> explain<00:00:59.260> how<00:00:59.500> it

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
so I'll quickly try and explain how it

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.430 
so I'll quickly try and explain how it
works<00:00:59.860> if<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:00.940> go<00:01:01.060> into<00:01:01.270> game<00:01:01.480> III<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.140> can<00:01:02.290> see

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
works if I go into game III you can see

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.920 
works if I go into game III you can see
that<00:01:02.650> there<00:01:02.770> are<00:01:02.860> two<00:01:03.130> armor<00:01:03.460> stands<00:01:03.700> here<00:01:03.970> one

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
that there are two armor stands here one

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.870 
that there are two armor stands here one
is<00:01:05.229> smaller<00:01:06.040> than<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.400> other<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:09.040> big<00:01:09.250> one<00:01:09.520> is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
is smaller than the other the big one is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.780 
is smaller than the other the big one is
used<00:01:10.360> for<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.660> minute<00:01:10.900> hand<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.350> has<00:01:12.310> they

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
used for the minute hand and has they

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.020 
used for the minute hand and has they
both<00:01:12.970> have<00:01:13.210> levers<00:01:13.960> in<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.500> head<00:01:14.680> slot<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
both have levers in the head slot the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.680 
both have levers in the head slot the
small<00:01:16.270> one<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.660> hour<00:01:17.020> hand<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:18.450> they<00:01:19.450> are

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
small one is the hour hand and they are

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:27.330 
small one is the hour hand and they are
named<00:01:20.080> hour<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.280> min<00:01:22.000> minute<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.950> if<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.190> go

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
named hour and min minute now if I go

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.800 
named hour and min minute now if I go
over<00:01:27.369> here<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:29.320> show<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:29.770> how<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
over here I will show you how it

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.290 
over here I will show you how it
actually<00:01:31.840> takes<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.740> time<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.250> day<00:01:33.460> that's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
actually takes the time of day that's

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.160 
actually takes the time of day that's
going<00:01:34.570> into<00:01:35.610> raining<00:01:36.610> so<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.630> takes<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.960> time

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
going into raining so it takes the time

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.570 
going into raining so it takes the time
of<00:01:38.380> day<00:01:39.750> by<00:01:40.750> using<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.470> time<00:01:41.830> query<00:01:42.130> day<00:01:42.340> from

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
of day by using the time query day from

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.330 
of day by using the time query day from
command<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:43.330> outputs<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.229> time<00:01:45.100> in

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
command so that outputs the time in

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.550 
command so that outputs the time in
ticks<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.330> it's<00:01:46.479> a<00:01:46.570> about<00:01:47.500> 7000<00:01:48.310> now<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.350> that

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
ticks so it's a about 7000 now and that

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.760 
ticks so it's a about 7000 now and that
goes<00:01:50.740> from<00:01:50.950> 0<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.690> 2400<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:55.030> I'm<00:01:55.149> saving<00:01:55.660> that

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
goes from 0 to 2400 so I'm saving that

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.639 
goes from 0 to 2400 so I'm saving that
result<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.369> query<00:01:57.670> result<00:01:58.149> for<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:58.750> 7000

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
result the query result for that so 7000

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.570 
result the query result for that so 7000
for<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.630> for<00:02:02.229> my<00:02:02.409> player<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.310> time

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
for the for my player in the time

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
for the for my player in the time
objective<00:02:04.119> so<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.420> sets<00:02:04.630> my<00:02:04.979> score<00:02:05.979> for<00:02:06.010> time

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
objective so it sets my score for time

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.120 
objective so it sets my score for time
to<00:02:07.600> whatever<00:02:08.260> this<00:02:08.590> outfit<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.369> 7000<00:02:10.179> 45

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
to whatever this outfit is so 7000 45

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.640 
to whatever this outfit is so 7000 45
I'll<00:02:12.130> show<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.700> better<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:13.500> school<00:02:14.500> and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
I'll show you it better in school and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.509 
I'll show you it better in school and
objective<00:02:15.130> satisfy<00:02:15.790> sidebar<00:02:16.450> time<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:18.459> you

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
objective satisfy sidebar time so you

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.479 
objective satisfy sidebar time so you
can<00:02:18.610> see<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.090> my<00:02:19.570> scoreboard<00:02:20.260> objective<00:02:20.799> for

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
can see that my scoreboard objective for

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.319 
can see that my scoreboard objective for
that<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.510> proper<00:02:23.200> time<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.920> ticks<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.910> you

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
that is the proper time in ticks and you

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.660 
that is the proper time in ticks and you
can<00:02:25.480> see<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.900> also<00:02:26.019> have<00:02:26.170> min<00:02:26.739> which<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.489> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
can see that we also have min which is a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.670 
can see that we also have min which is a
placeholder<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.799> have<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.280> two<00:02:30.489> others

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
placeholder and we have the two others

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.650 
placeholder and we have the two others
the<00:02:32.680> bottom<00:02:32.920> one<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.370> actual<00:02:33.850> hour<00:02:34.090> so

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the bottom one is the actual hour so

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.530 
the bottom one is the actual hour so
it's<00:02:35.079> 7<00:02:35.530> at<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.680> moment<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.820> takes<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it's 7 at the moment so that takes the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.380 
it's 7 at the moment so that takes the
actual<00:02:38.320> ticks<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.610> divides<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.209> by<00:02:40.239> a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
actual ticks and just divides it by a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.810 
actual ticks and just divides it by a
thousand<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.230> because<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.370> integer

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
thousand and because it's integer

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.610 
thousand and because it's integer
division<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.570> will<00:02:43.780> only<00:02:43.959> take<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.440> whole

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
division it will only take the whole

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.300 
division it will only take the whole
numbers<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.340> when<00:02:46.150> my<00:02:46.390> ticks<00:02:46.660> reaches<00:02:47.470> 8,000

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
numbers so when my ticks reaches 8,000

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.690 
numbers so when my ticks reaches 8,000
that<00:02:48.459> all<00:02:48.579> turned<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.970> 8<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:50.829> men<00:02:51.070> goes<00:02:51.400> from

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
that all turned to 8 the men goes from

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.979 
that all turned to 8 the men goes from
zero<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.269> thousand<00:02:53.549> once<00:02:54.549> it<00:02:54.700> reaches<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
zero to a thousand once it reaches the

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.210 
zero to a thousand once it reaches the
next

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
next

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.790 
next
thing<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.640> next<00:02:58.910> hour<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.840> resets<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.620> back

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
thing the next hour it resets that back

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.040 
thing the next hour it resets that back
to<00:03:01.069> zero<00:03:01.099> again<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.239> counts<00:03:02.599> up<00:03:02.750> and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
to zero again and that counts up and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.180 
to zero again and that counts up and
that<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.099> used<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.550> calculate<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:06.190> actual

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
that is used to calculate the actual

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.160 
that is used to calculate the actual
minutes<00:03:07.760> which<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.330> third<00:03:08.599> number<00:03:08.870> down

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
minutes which is the third number down

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.520 
minutes which is the third number down
so<00:03:09.790> 14<00:03:10.790> 15<00:03:11.300> 16<00:03:11.840> 17<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:13.520> that<00:03:13.730> takes<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.530> min

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
so 14 15 16 17 and that takes the min

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.600 
so 14 15 16 17 and that takes the min
number<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.550> divides<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.540> by<00:03:17.569> 17<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.650> get<00:03:19.280> about

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
number and divides it by 17 to get about

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.050 
number and divides it by 17 to get about
the<00:03:21.760> minute<00:03:22.760> score<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.660> can<00:03:24.620> just<00:03:24.769> do<00:03:24.890> that<00:03:25.060> so

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
the minute score I can just do that so

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.110 
the minute score I can just do that so
that's<00:03:26.209> roughly<00:03:27.200> how<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.800> works<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:32.090> to

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
that's roughly how that works so to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.259 
that's roughly how that works so to
divide<00:03:32.569> by<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> thousand<00:03:33.410> all<00:03:33.620> I've<00:03:33.739> got<00:03:33.950> is

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
divide by a thousand all I've got is

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.380 
divide by a thousand all I've got is
what<00:03:35.269> school<00:03:35.540> or<00:03:35.660> players<00:03:35.930> operation<00:03:37.330> for<00:03:38.330> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
what school or players operation for the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.390 
what school or players operation for the
entity<00:03:38.660> named<00:03:39.080> hour<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.860> we're<00:03:40.010> taking<00:03:40.280> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
entity named hour and we're taking the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.960 
entity named hour and we're taking the
time<00:03:40.670> objective<00:03:41.239> so<00:03:41.510> whatever<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.959> time<00:03:42.200> is

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
time objective so whatever the time is

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.020 
time objective so whatever the time is
and<00:03:43.970> we're<00:03:44.239> dividing<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.870> by<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:46.190> hours<00:03:46.640> score

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
and we're dividing it by the hours score

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.050 
and we're dividing it by the hours score
for<00:03:47.420> time<00:03:47.780> T<00:03:47.989> hour<00:03:48.230> which<00:03:48.830> is<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.130> thousand<00:03:49.819> so

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
for time T hour which is a thousand so

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.770 
for time T hour which is a thousand so
we're<00:03:50.180> taking<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.750> time<00:03:51.709> score<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.569> get

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
we're taking the time score and to get

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.229 
we're taking the time score and to get
the<00:03:54.640> whole<00:03:55.640> number<00:03:57.250> single-digit<00:03:58.250> number<00:03:58.549> or

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
the whole number single-digit number or

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.140 
the whole number single-digit number or
double<00:03:59.810> digits<00:04:00.200> actually<00:04:03.459> for<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.760> minute

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
double digits actually for the minute

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.390 
double digits actually for the minute
we're<00:04:05.630> sending<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.910> minutes<00:04:08.540> time<00:04:08.959> and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
we're sending it to the minutes time and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.449 
we're sending it to the minutes time and
then<00:04:10.400> dividing<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.180> by<00:04:11.390> time<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.230> min<00:04:12.440> which<00:04:13.250> is

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
then dividing it by time to min which is

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.259 
then dividing it by time to min which is
17<00:04:14.530> now<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.980> should<00:04:16.370> be<00:04:16.400> sixteen<00:04:17.390> point<00:04:17.989> six<00:04:18.440> or

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
17 now it should be sixteen point six or

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.570 
17 now it should be sixteen point six or
sixteen<00:04:20.269> point<00:04:20.539> seven<00:04:20.720> pretty<00:04:21.140> much<00:04:21.289> for<00:04:22.280> an

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
sixteen point seven pretty much for an

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.630 
sixteen point seven pretty much for an
accurate<00:04:23.180> time<00:04:23.919> so<00:04:24.919> you<00:04:24.979> can<00:04:25.100> see<00:04:25.280> that<00:04:25.490> this

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
accurate time so you can see that this

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.330 
accurate time so you can see that this
last<00:04:26.090> tick<00:04:26.690> here<00:04:26.960> is<00:04:27.229> a<00:04:27.260> bit<00:04:27.650> shorter<00:04:28.160> than<00:04:28.280> the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
last tick here is a bit shorter than the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.149 
last tick here is a bit shorter than the
others

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.100 

I<00:04:31.189> can't<00:04:32.030> really<00:04:32.180> hold<00:04:32.360> that<00:04:32.509> because<00:04:32.930> it's

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
I can't really hold that because it's

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.189 
I can't really hold that because it's
interested<00:04:33.560> division<00:04:34.069> without<00:04:34.490> having<00:04:34.789> some

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
interested division without having some

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.309 
interested division without having some
some<00:04:36.199> more<00:04:36.379> command<00:04:36.770> blocks<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.870> try<00:04:39.199> and

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
some more command blocks to try and

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.510 
some more command blocks to try and
handle<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:39.939> but<00:04:40.939> once<00:04:41.599> it<00:04:41.780> reaches<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.590> hour

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
handle that but once it reaches the hour

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.119 
handle that but once it reaches the hour
the<00:04:44.180> minutes<00:04:44.509> reset<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.379> it<00:04:45.620> doesn't<00:04:45.889> really

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
the minutes reset so it doesn't really

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.659 
the minutes reset so it doesn't really
lose<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.669> it<00:04:47.090> won't<00:04:47.360> skip<00:04:48.310> like<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.460> won't

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
lose it it won't skip like you won't

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.480 
lose it it won't skip like you won't
lose<00:04:50.270> track<00:04:50.689> after<00:04:51.259> a<00:04:51.590> while<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.129> it's<00:04:52.280> always

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
lose track after a while so it's always

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.129 
lose track after a while so it's always
accurate<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.259> time<00:04:54.650> of<00:04:54.830> day<00:04:55.009> so<00:04:55.930> you<00:04:56.930> can

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
accurate to the time of day so you can

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.790 
accurate to the time of day so you can
just<00:04:57.259> leave<00:04:57.439> it<00:04:57.469> running<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:58.370> work<00:04:58.789> and<00:04:59.800> then

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
just leave it running and work and then

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.619 
just leave it running and work and then
I'll<00:05:01.099> show<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.430> these<00:05:01.610> bits<00:05:01.909> here<00:05:02.150> now

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
I'll show you these bits here now

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.189 
I'll show you these bits here now
so<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.469> think<00:05:03.919> it's<00:05:04.190> this<00:05:04.460> one<00:05:04.699> yeah<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:05.990> it

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
so I think it's this one yeah so it

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.809 
so I think it's this one yeah so it
tests<00:05:06.710> for<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:07.789> entity<00:05:08.270> named<00:05:08.509> hour<00:05:09.789> with<00:05:10.789> a

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
tests for the entity named hour with a

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.610 
tests for the entity named hour with a
time<00:05:11.479> score<00:05:11.840> of<00:05:11.960> six<00:05:12.289> and<00:05:13.840> then<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:15.050> does<00:05:15.229> it

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
time score of six and then it does it

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.830 
time score of six and then it does it
does<00:05:15.800> these<00:05:16.069> two<00:05:16.340> command<00:05:16.699> blocks<00:05:16.940> also

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
does these two command blocks also

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.809 
does these two command blocks also
executes<00:05:18.349> this<00:05:18.530> comparator<00:05:19.159> and<00:05:19.460> then<00:05:19.610> runs

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
executes this comparator and then runs

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.420 
executes this comparator and then runs
these<00:05:20.319> so<00:05:21.319> it<00:05:21.740> does<00:05:22.039> entity<00:05:22.940> data<00:05:23.150> for<00:05:24.430> the

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
these so it does entity data for the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.929 
these so it does entity data for the
entity<00:05:26.270> named<00:05:26.690> hour<00:05:27.020> with<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:28.069> time<00:05:28.400> score<00:05:28.789> of

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:28.939 
entity named hour with a time score of

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:32.529 
entity named hour with a time score of
six<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.889> changes<00:05:31.279> the<00:05:31.550> pose<00:05:31.849> of<00:05:31.879> the<00:05:32.180> head

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
six and it changes the pose of the head

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:39.399 
six and it changes the pose of the head
through<00:05:33.409> zero<00:05:33.740> zero<00:05:34.240> minus<00:05:35.240> zero<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:39.080> last

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
through zero zero minus zero this last

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:40.899 
through zero zero minus zero this last
number<00:05:39.650> is<00:05:40.009> the<00:05:40.250> one<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.520> we're<00:05:40.639> interested

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
number is the one that we're interested

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.930 
number is the one that we're interested
in<00:05:41.240> because<00:05:41.690> that's<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.400> actual<00:05:43.400> rotation

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
in because that's the actual rotation

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.959 
in because that's the actual rotation
that<00:05:44.120> we're<00:05:44.419> using<00:05:45.159> this<00:05:46.159> is<00:05:46.370> just<00:05:46.550> used<00:05:46.789> to

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
that we're using this is just used to

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.850 
that we're using this is just used to
reset<00:05:47.389> the<00:05:47.569> mins<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.680> fake<00:05:48.889> player<00:05:49.219> min

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
reset the mins and the fake player min

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.779 
reset the mins and the fake player min
the<00:05:51.860> time<00:05:52.370> score<00:05:52.729> to<00:05:52.909> zero<00:05:53.180> again<00:05:54.129> but<00:05:55.129> this

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
the time score to zero again but this

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.309 
the time score to zero again but this
last<00:05:56.029> number<00:05:56.240> here<00:05:56.539> is<00:05:56.690> what<00:05:56.870> we're<00:05:57.020> using<00:05:57.169> for

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
last number here is what we're using for

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.200 
last number here is what we're using for
the<00:05:57.469> rotation<00:05:57.979> so<00:05:58.250> if<00:05:58.490> we<00:05:58.610> go<00:05:58.699> to<00:05:58.759> the<00:05:58.940> next

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
the rotation so if we go to the next

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.629 
the rotation so if we go to the next
hour<00:05:59.330> which<00:05:59.599> is<00:05:59.750> seven<00:06:00.169> you<00:06:01.099> can<00:06:01.250> see<00:06:01.430> that<00:06:01.580> it

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
hour which is seven you can see that it

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.740 
hour which is seven you can see that it
changes<00:06:02.000> from<00:06:02.180> one<00:06:02.479> is<00:06:02.750> zero<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.199> minus<00:06:03.379> thirty

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
changes from one is zero to minus thirty

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.200 
changes from one is zero to minus thirty
then<00:06:05.750> to<00:06:05.990> minus<00:06:06.259> 60<00:06:07.599> -<00:06:08.599> 90<00:06:08.629> and<00:06:09.500> that's<00:06:09.949> the

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
then to minus 60 - 90 and that's the

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.450 
then to minus 60 - 90 and that's the
degrees<00:06:11.210> the<00:06:11.599> angle<00:06:11.750> in<00:06:12.080> degrees<00:06:12.500> and<00:06:12.800> I'm

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
degrees the angle in degrees and I'm

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.219 
degrees the angle in degrees and I'm
using<00:06:13.699> negative<00:06:14.089> numbers<00:06:14.599> to<00:06:14.779> make<00:06:14.900> it<00:06:15.080> go

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
using negative numbers to make it go

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.760 
using negative numbers to make it go
clockwise

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
clockwise

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.950 
clockwise
well<00:06:18.520> just<00:06:18.729> to<00:06:18.789> make<00:06:18.849> it<00:06:19.060> easier<00:06:19.330> to<00:06:19.389> calculate

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
well just to make it easier to calculate

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.710 
well just to make it easier to calculate
it<00:06:20.139> going<00:06:20.380> clockwise<00:06:20.580> and<00:06:21.580> then<00:06:22.120> all<00:06:22.419> of<00:06:22.479> these

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
it going clockwise and then all of these

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.499 
it going clockwise and then all of these
ones<00:06:23.050> and<00:06:23.410> some<00:06:24.160> in<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.340> middle<00:06:24.580> row<00:06:24.729> is<00:06:24.970> for

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
ones and some in the middle row is for

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.820 
ones and some in the middle row is for
the<00:06:26.310> minute<00:06:27.310> hand<00:06:28.110> and<00:06:29.110> that's<00:06:29.259> just<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.620> same

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
the minute hand and that's just the same

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.409 
the minute hand and that's just the same
thing<00:06:30.069> so<00:06:30.280> that<00:06:30.310> we<00:06:30.400> don't<00:06:30.580> need<00:06:30.699> these<00:06:30.940> tests

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
thing so that we don't need these tests

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.520 
thing so that we don't need these tests
for<00:06:31.979> things<00:06:32.979> so<00:06:33.280> we<00:06:33.370> just<00:06:33.520> have<00:06:34.319> entity<00:06:35.319> data

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
for things so we just have entity data

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.939 
for things so we just have entity data
for<00:06:36.180> the<00:06:37.800> armorstand

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
for the armorstand

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:43.290 
for the armorstand
named<00:06:39.280> min<00:06:40.410> score<00:06:41.410> of<00:06:41.560> time<00:06:41.830> 12<00:06:42.340> and<00:06:43.120> we

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
named min score of time 12 and we

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.320 
named min score of time 12 and we
changed<00:06:43.660> the<00:06:43.840> head<00:06:44.020> pose<00:06:44.849> to<00:06:45.849> whatever<00:06:46.180> the

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
changed the head pose to whatever the

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.210 
changed the head pose to whatever the
appropriate<00:06:46.449> minute<00:06:47.259> is<00:06:49.470> so<00:06:50.470> these<00:06:50.650> ones<00:06:50.889> just

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
appropriate minute is so these ones just

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.320 
appropriate minute is so these ones just
follow<00:06:52.919> on<00:06:53.919> words<00:06:54.310> from<00:06:54.490> that<00:06:54.520> changing<00:06:55.180> by

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
follow on words from that changing by

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.689 
follow on words from that changing by
six<00:06:55.690> degrees<00:06:56.050> every<00:06:56.319> time<00:06:56.590> whereas<00:06:57.520> these

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
six degrees every time whereas these

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.370 
six degrees every time whereas these
ones<00:06:57.759> changed<00:06:58.479> 30<00:06:59.020> degrees<00:06:59.470> at<00:06:59.680> a<00:06:59.710> time<00:07:01.380> so

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
ones changed 30 degrees at a time so

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.640 
ones changed 30 degrees at a time so
yeah<00:07:02.530> that's<00:07:03.099> about<00:07:03.310> it<00:07:03.699> it's<00:07:04.659> not<00:07:05.289> terribly

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
yeah that's about it it's not terribly

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.050 
yeah that's about it it's not terribly
useful<00:07:05.740> thing<00:07:06.340> but<00:07:06.789> it's<00:07:07.000> quite<00:07:07.330> cool<00:07:07.509> I<00:07:07.569> think

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
useful thing but it's quite cool I think

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.490 
useful thing but it's quite cool I think
it<00:07:10.060> just<00:07:10.210> shows<00:07:10.419> you<00:07:10.449> some<00:07:11.080> of<00:07:11.110> the<00:07:11.259> sort<00:07:11.470> of

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
it just shows you some of the sort of

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.050 
it just shows you some of the sort of
things<00:07:11.770> that<00:07:12.009> you<00:07:12.099> can<00:07:12.250> do<00:07:12.430> with<00:07:12.669> command

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
things that you can do with command

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.999 
things that you can do with command
blocks<00:07:13.300> now<00:07:14.130> especially<00:07:15.130> armorstands<00:07:17.009> people

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:18.009 
blocks now especially armorstands people

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.649 
blocks now especially armorstands people
are<00:07:18.099> always<00:07:18.400> finding<00:07:18.639> out<00:07:18.880> new<00:07:19.090> things<00:07:19.120> to<00:07:19.509> do

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:19.659 
are always finding out new things to do

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:23.279 
are always finding out new things to do
with<00:07:19.810> them<00:07:21.120> I<00:07:22.120> don't<00:07:22.690> know<00:07:22.870> if<00:07:22.990> anyone's

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:23.289 
with them I don't know if anyone's

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:25.110 
with them I don't know if anyone's
actually<00:07:23.440> done<00:07:23.770> this<00:07:23.919> before<00:07:23.979> but<00:07:24.580> I<00:07:24.880> don't

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
actually done this before but I don't

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.520 
actually done this before but I don't
think<00:07:25.419> they<00:07:25.599> have<00:07:25.810> so<00:07:27.000> yay<00:07:28.000> I<00:07:28.360> just<00:07:29.289> put<00:07:29.409> it<00:07:29.469> on

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.530 
think they have so yay I just put it on

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.260 
think they have so yay I just put it on
a<00:07:29.590> course<00:07:29.889> block<00:07:32.310> it's<00:07:33.310> a<00:07:33.370> lot<00:07:33.520> more<00:07:33.759> modern<00:07:33.940> my

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.270 
a course block it's a lot more modern my

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.879 
a course block it's a lot more modern my
yes

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889 
yes

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.209 
yes
yeah<00:07:36.810> that's<00:07:37.810> thus<00:07:38.259> the<00:07:38.620> end<00:07:38.740> of<00:07:38.830> the<00:07:38.919> video<00:07:39.159> I

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:39.219 
yeah that's thus the end of the video I

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:42.540 
yeah that's thus the end of the video I
guess<00:07:39.490> so<00:07:39.909> thanks<00:07:40.300> for<00:07:40.389> watching<00:07:41.490> I'll<00:07:42.490> see
