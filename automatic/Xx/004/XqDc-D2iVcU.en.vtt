00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.850
 we often have mine 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.369
 to build longs to make sure 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.160
 on the wall or to do but 9 if we have to 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.340
 build a lanyard like a sling 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.530
 closed exit or with a closed ring 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.489
 remember we must avoid passing 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.790
 in suspension points 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.520
 of the harness the webbing that comes out 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.520
 with the node locked long because col 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.170
 well-known wolfhead shake the bridge 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.409
 Indigo we close the ventral part 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.890
 of the harness belt with a 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.019
 the crucial part and then we return 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.500
 the service ring for 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.250
 build the closure properly 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 of the launcher 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.020
 we have to build a mill 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.350
 let's take the exit part 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350
 housing 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:30.020
 and we build a mill chasing it in 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.050
 so that we have a year in the closed 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.440
 independent that joins the ring 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.820
 of services we will then brush the part that 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.450
 move forward and we will close it with a new one 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.450
 simple 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.440
 in the final part of the launch and we will do 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:56.710
 a boatman knot to which we will apply a 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.560
 carabiner with a possible closure a 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.979
 shot that constitutes ours 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.860
 insurance in the staggered ring will go 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.300
 applied our braking system 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:14.830
 in the case of double we know so a 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.860
 independent alonge closed with a ring 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.739
 from burin that joins the ring of 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.660
 service with two branches of which one 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.459
 constitutes our lodge that does not 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.280
 it must be longer than the extension 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.739
 of our arm and one of which we can 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.770
 enter the braking system we have 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.770
 chosen 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.680
 the realization of the graver node for 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.540
 close the webbing if disputed 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 the harness sometimes gives problems because 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.980
 the realization if done in a manner 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.300
 incorrect from a goal that flows and therefore 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.880
 compromises the idea of creating a 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.010
 independent fixed ring and return 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.000
 to the problems described before 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.490
 on the wolf's mouth to achieve in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.800
 another way 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.040
 an appropriate node we can however 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.870
 always use our webbing 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.980
 that goes into suspension points 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:20.670
 the knot of the embryo begins 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.650
 but instead of tightening it yes 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:34.650
 prevents scrolling with a new one 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:36.840
 simple that captures the part of the la 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.300
 in this way we create a ribbon 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.690
 an independent ring that does not flow 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.709
 much easier to implement and also 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.530
 to display 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.260
 then continue as before 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:54.980
 described with the realization of a 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.980
 single strained on the loggia and the well-known 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.920
