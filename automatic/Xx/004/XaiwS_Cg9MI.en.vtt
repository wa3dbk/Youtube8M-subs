282 pounds 28 you definitely notice that

282 pounds 28 you definitely notice that
the<00:01:40.789> steering<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.390> pretty<00:01:41.600> direct<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:42.259> like

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
the steering is pretty direct it's like

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.649 
the steering is pretty direct it's like
I<00:01:42.710> don't<00:01:43.399> know<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:43.759> it<00:01:44.179> doesn't<00:01:44.509> feel<00:01:44.600> too

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
I don't know it it doesn't feel too

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.779 
I don't know it it doesn't feel too
loose<00:01:45.170> like<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.860> power<00:01:46.250> steering<00:01:46.549> doesn't

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
loose like the power steering doesn't

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.850 
loose like the power steering doesn't
take<00:01:47.030> over<00:01:47.179> but<00:01:47.539> it's<00:01:47.690> it's<00:01:48.110> good<00:01:48.380> feedback

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
take over but it's it's good feedback

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.800 
take over but it's it's good feedback
it's<00:01:49.130> not<00:01:49.280> too<00:01:49.549> heavy<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:50.090> overall<00:01:50.690> I<00:01:50.750> think

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
it's not too heavy and overall I think

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.199 
it's not too heavy and overall I think
it's<00:01:51.020> just<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.200> really<00:01:51.440> good<00:01:51.590> feel<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.940> seats

then just plain Jane seats but I mean

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.679 
then just plain Jane seats but I mean
like<00:01:55.369> they<00:01:55.520> do<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.670> job<00:01:56.000> you're<00:01:56.210> comfortable

direct<00:02:29.640> where<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.120> pointed<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.540> where<00:02:30.690> it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
direct where you pointed is where it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.080 
direct where you pointed is where it
goes<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.560> think<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.340> especially<00:02:32.730> for<00:02:32.940> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
goes and I think for especially for a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.480 
goes and I think for especially for a
truck<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.570> really<00:02:33.960> gonna<00:02:34.080> handling<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:35.340> I

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
truck it's really gonna handling like I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.460 
truck it's really gonna handling like I

v6<00:02:49.890> which<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.130> pretty<00:02:50.520> good<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:50.970> pretty<00:02:51.030> big

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
v6 which is pretty good it's pretty big

v6 which is pretty good it's pretty big
but<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.350> put<00:02:52.530> your<00:02:52.650> foot<00:02:52.830> down<00:02:53.040> and

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
but you put your foot down and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.640 
but you put your foot down and
it<00:02:55.010> takes<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.370> while

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
it takes a while

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.860 
it takes a while
to<00:02:56.860> downshift<00:02:57.069> but<00:02:57.670> they<00:02:58.120> put<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.450> back<00:02:58.659> you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
to downshift but they put you back you

go<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.530> pick<00:02:59.709> up<00:02:59.860> pretty<00:03:00.040> well<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:01.269> v6<00:03:01.720> does

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
go you pick up pretty well this v6 does

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.149 
go you pick up pretty well this v6 does
make<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.170> really<00:03:02.349> good<00:03:02.470> sound<00:03:02.680> though<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:02.920> will

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
make a really good sound though I will

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.649 
make a really good sound though I will
say<00:03:03.189> that<00:03:03.519> it's<00:03:04.030> not<00:03:04.150> really<00:03:04.629> loud<00:03:05.110> but<00:03:06.659> you

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
say that it's not really loud but you

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.679 
say that it's not really loud but you
can<00:03:07.840> definitely<00:03:08.049> easily<00:03:08.739> like<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> good

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
can definitely easily like with a good

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.030 
can definitely easily like with a good
exhaust<00:03:11.019> swab<00:03:11.319> this<00:03:11.560> thing<00:03:11.739> would<00:03:11.860> sound

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
exhaust swab this thing would sound

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.569 
exhaust swab this thing would sound
really<00:03:12.400> good<00:03:13.079> what<00:03:14.079> I<00:03:14.109> did<00:03:14.470> put<00:03:15.040> my<00:03:15.159> foot<00:03:15.430> into

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
really good what I did put my foot into

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.369 
really good what I did put my foot into
it<00:03:15.790> though<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.239> transmission<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.109> a<00:03:17.140> bit

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
it though the transmission is a bit

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.000 
it though the transmission is a bit
sluggish<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:18.189> mean<00:03:18.569> that's<00:03:19.569> not<00:03:19.810> really<00:03:20.230> that's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
sluggish I mean that's not really that's

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.410 
sluggish I mean that's not really that's
probably<00:03:21.489> my<00:03:21.609> biggest<00:03:21.760> complaint<00:03:22.209> with<00:03:22.269> this

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
probably my biggest complaint with this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.390 
probably my biggest complaint with this
car<00:03:22.599> because<00:03:22.900> if<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.530> are<00:03:23.709> with<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.099> offer<00:03:24.250> a

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
car because if you are with the offer a

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.979 
car because if you are with the offer a
package<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:24.909> do<00:03:25.060> look<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.359> go<00:03:25.450> off-road<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
package you do look to go off-road it

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.780 
package you do look to go off-road it
you<00:03:26.079> kind<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.409> want<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.680> be<00:03:26.859> instantaneous

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
you kind of want it to be instantaneous

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.220 
you kind of want it to be instantaneous
you<00:03:28.120> need<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.450> when<00:03:28.659> you<00:03:28.690> need<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.989> especially

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
you need it when you need it especially

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.559 
you need it when you need it especially
off-roading<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.310> that's<00:03:30.970> kind<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.359> downside

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
off-roading so that's kind of a downside

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.599 
off-roading so that's kind of a downside
it<00:03:32.379> takes<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.709> lot<00:03:32.859> of<00:03:32.889> you<00:03:33.040> put<00:03:33.190> your<00:03:33.220> foot<00:03:33.430> into

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
it takes a lot of you put your foot into

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.660 
it takes a lot of you put your foot into
downshift<00:03:34.569> but<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.290> shifts<00:03:35.560> are<00:03:35.709> smooth<00:03:36.250> it's

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
downshift but the shifts are smooth it's

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.699 
downshift but the shifts are smooth it's
just<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.239> little<00:03:37.810> bit<00:03:37.930> slower<00:03:38.260> than<00:03:38.379> you'd<00:03:38.680> like

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
just a little bit slower than you'd like

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.229 
just a little bit slower than you'd like
especially<00:03:39.340> if<00:03:39.519> you're<00:03:39.609> going<00:03:39.700> off<00:03:39.849> running

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
especially if you're going off running

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.990 
especially if you're going off running
one<00:03:41.049> thing<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.260> do<00:03:41.379> you<00:03:41.439> notice

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.450 

you<00:03:44.300> can't<00:03:44.600> spend<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.140> tires<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.650> mean<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.430> a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
you can't spend the tires I mean it is a

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.540 
you can't spend the tires I mean it is a
truck<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.000> you'd<00:03:47.330> not<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:47.960> hit<00:03:48.260> that

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
truck so you'd not really hit that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.640 
truck so you'd not really hit that
confident<00:03:49.550> its<00:03:50.510> bone<00:03:50.780> stock<00:03:51.080> though<00:03:51.320> so<00:03:51.380> it's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
confident its bone stock though so it's

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.750 
confident its bone stock though so it's
not<00:03:51.740> like<00:03:51.920> we're<00:03:52.070> working<00:03:52.160> with<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.460> crazy

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
not like we're working with a crazy

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.840 
not like we're working with a crazy
amount<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.150> power<00:03:53.360> but<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:55.400> you're<00:03:55.640> high<00:03:55.820> up

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850

is suspension you lift it up and you do

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.770 
is suspension you lift it up and you do
feel<00:03:58.340> like<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:58.730> take<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.390> harder<00:03:59.630> on<00:03:59.720> the
