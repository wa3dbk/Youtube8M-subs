and<00:00:10.350> at<00:00:10.470> the<00:00:10.560> heart<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.860> new<00:00:11.010> boat<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.640> this

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
and at the heart of the new boat is this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.840 
and at the heart of the new boat is this
trolling<00:00:12.330> motor<00:00:12.510> that<00:00:12.720> we've<00:00:12.840> designed

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
trolling motor that we've designed

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.930 
trolling motor that we've designed
bit<00:00:13.970> integrally<00:00:14.540> into<00:00:15.320> this<00:00:15.440> kayak<00:00:15.790> you<00:00:16.790> can

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
bit integrally into this kayak you can

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.120 
bit integrally into this kayak you can
see<00:00:17.120> back<00:00:17.300> here<00:00:17.540> what<00:00:17.690> we<00:00:17.810> did<00:00:17.990> is<00:00:18.170> essentially

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
see back here what we did is essentially

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.450 
see back here what we did is essentially
incorporate<00:00:19.730> a<00:00:20.000> large<00:00:20.780> skipper<00:00:21.380> that<00:00:22.010> accepts

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
incorporate a large skipper that accepts

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.490 
incorporate a large skipper that accepts
this<00:00:22.610> motor<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.630> it<00:00:23.720> becomes<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.170> seamless

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
this motor so it becomes a seamless

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.200 
this motor so it becomes a seamless
integration<00:00:24.920> of<00:00:25.190> the<00:00:25.250> motor<00:00:25.490> into<00:00:25.790> the<00:00:25.880> kayak

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
integration of the motor into the kayak

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.090 
integration of the motor into the kayak
now<00:00:26.390> of<00:00:26.480> course<00:00:26.660> there<00:00:26.900> are<00:00:27.020> other<00:00:27.140> kayaks<00:00:27.890> out

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
now of course there are other kayaks out

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.200 
now of course there are other kayaks out
there<00:00:28.340> that<00:00:28.490> have<00:00:28.640> trolling<00:00:28.970> motor<00:00:29.119> is

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
there that have trolling motor is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.240 
there that have trolling motor is
attached<00:00:29.540> but<00:00:30.320> generally<00:00:30.530> they're<00:00:30.890> done<00:00:31.070> with

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
attached but generally they're done with

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.070 
attached but generally they're done with
two-by-four<00:00:31.790> technology<00:00:31.820> or<00:00:32.780> somehow

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
two-by-four technology or somehow

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.200 
two-by-four technology or somehow
strapped<00:00:33.440> down<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.860> a<00:00:33.890> rudder<00:00:34.160> this<00:00:34.879> one<00:00:35.090> by

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
strapped down to a rudder this one by

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.670 
strapped down to a rudder this one by
integrating<00:00:35.720> it<00:00:35.809> into<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.110> boat<00:00:36.320> we<00:00:36.500> make<00:00:36.650> a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
integrating it into the boat we make a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.470 
integrating it into the boat we make a
much<00:00:36.890> more<00:00:37.070> seamless<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:37.580> clean<00:00:37.790> design<00:00:37.820> and

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
much more seamless and clean design and

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.880 
much more seamless and clean design and
something<00:00:38.989> that<00:00:39.080> really<00:00:39.230> functions<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.739> lot

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
something that really functions a lot

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.820 
something that really functions a lot
better<00:00:40.040> as<00:00:40.250> well<00:00:40.720> now<00:00:41.720> this<00:00:41.840> is<00:00:42.020> a<00:00:42.080> 33-pound

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
better as well now this is a 33-pound

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.369 
better as well now this is a 33-pound
thrust<00:00:43.400> and<00:00:43.670> kota<00:00:43.940> trolling<00:00:44.150> motor<00:00:44.570> with<00:00:45.350> a

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
thrust and kota trolling motor with a

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.439 
thrust and kota trolling motor with a
weakness<00:00:45.770> wedge<00:00:45.980> propeller<00:00:46.460> sort<00:00:47.269> of<00:00:47.330> their

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
weakness wedge propeller sort of their

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.420 
weakness wedge propeller sort of their
standard<00:00:47.780> item<00:00:48.019> note<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:48.409> this<00:00:48.559> is<00:00:48.620> also<00:00:48.980> set

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
standard item note that this is also set

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.549 
standard item note that this is also set
up<00:00:49.550> for<00:00:49.730> saltwater<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:50.420> it's<00:00:50.600> got<00:00:50.809> a<00:00:50.839> saltwater

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
up for saltwater so it's got a saltwater

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.049 
up for saltwater so it's got a saltwater
coating<00:00:52.010> on<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.220> outside<00:00:52.250> it's<00:00:52.879> got<00:00:53.030> a

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
coating on the outside it's got a

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.880 
coating on the outside it's got a
sacrificial<00:00:53.479> anode<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.170> this<00:00:54.320> thing<00:00:54.470> is<00:00:54.500> fully

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
sacrificial anode so this thing is fully

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.610 
sacrificial anode so this thing is fully
saltwater<00:00:55.280> k<00:00:55.550> saltwater<00:00:56.089> capable<00:00:56.659> now<00:00:57.559> the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
saltwater k saltwater capable now the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.140 
saltwater k saltwater capable now the
biggest<00:00:57.890> thing<00:00:58.129> about<00:00:58.339> this<00:00:58.580> boat<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:58.879> when

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
biggest thing about this boat is when

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.399 
biggest thing about this boat is when
you<00:00:59.239> start<00:00:59.300> integrating<00:00:59.629> a<00:00:59.989> trolling<00:01:00.379> motor

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
you start integrating a trolling motor

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.079 
you start integrating a trolling motor
and<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.860> battery<00:01:00.890> into<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.580> boat<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.909> thing

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
and a battery into the boat the thing

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.180 
and a battery into the boat the thing
becomes<00:01:02.360> ungodly<00:01:02.900> heavy<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:03.620> what<00:01:03.769> we<00:01:03.890> did<00:01:04.010> is

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
becomes ungodly heavy so what we did is

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.740 
becomes ungodly heavy so what we did is
made<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.489> completely<00:01:04.729> modular<00:01:05.120> so<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:05.600> can

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
made it completely modular so you can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.330 
made it completely modular so you can
see<00:01:05.900> you've<00:01:06.080> got<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.290> motor<00:01:06.560> module<00:01:06.979> here<00:01:07.190> that

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
see you've got a motor module here that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.830 
see you've got a motor module here that
weighs<00:01:07.490> 20<00:01:07.790> pounds<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.210> actually<00:01:08.479> floats

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
weighs 20 pounds and actually floats

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.110 
weighs 20 pounds and actually floats
this<00:01:09.710> drops<00:01:10.070> into<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.340> motor<00:01:10.549> once<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.970> get

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
this drops into the motor once you get

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.850 
this drops into the motor once you get
down<00:01:11.299> to<00:01:11.510> shore<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.350> same<00:01:12.560> thing<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:12.830> true

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
down to shore the same thing is true

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.200 
down to shore the same thing is true
with<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.159> battery<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:13.760> can<00:01:13.970> take<00:01:14.090> the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
with the battery so you can take the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.380 
with the battery so you can take the
battery<00:01:14.540> as<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.720> separate<00:01:15.170> element<00:01:15.760> and<00:01:16.760> simply

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
battery as a separate element and simply

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.120 
battery as a separate element and simply
drop<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.780> into<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:17.990> battery<00:01:18.560> box<00:01:18.710> once<00:01:19.009> you

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
drop it into the battery box once you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.039 
drop it into the battery box once you
get<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.399> shore<00:01:19.640> saving<00:01:20.390> yourself<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.930> hassle

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
get to shore saving yourself the hassle

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
it is is an infinitely variable speed

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.510 
it is is an infinitely variable speed

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
infinitely variable speed is really

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.460 
infinitely variable speed is really
important<00:02:17.510> because<00:02:17.540> as<00:02:17.780> you're<00:02:18.020> working<00:02:18.170> on

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
important because as you're working on

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.900 
important because as you're working on
trolling<00:02:18.950> or<00:02:19.069> something<00:02:19.340> like<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.490> from<00:02:19.790> a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
trolling or something like that from a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.240 
trolling or something like that from a
kayak<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.480> typical<00:02:21.140> 5<00:02:21.380> speed<00:02:21.680> trolling<00:02:22.040> motor

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
kayak a typical 5 speed trolling motor

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.250 
kayak a typical 5 speed trolling motor
will<00:02:22.430> push<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.730> too<00:02:22.880> fast<00:02:23.150> even<00:02:23.510> speed<00:02:23.780> 1<00:02:24.020> on<00:02:24.230> a

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
will push you too fast even speed 1 on a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.020 
will push you too fast even speed 1 on a
typical<00:02:24.500> trolling<00:02:24.950> motor<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.280> way<00:02:25.520> too<00:02:25.580> fast

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
typical trolling motor is way too fast

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.670 
typical trolling motor is way too fast
so<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:26.960> allows<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.440> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
so this allows you to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.050 
so this allows you to
eventually<00:02:27.920> get<00:02:28.099> it<00:02:28.189> so<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> prop<00:02:28.609> is<00:02:28.819> barely

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
eventually get it so the prop is barely

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.910 
eventually get it so the prop is barely
even<00:02:29.269> visibly<00:02:29.719> moving<00:02:30.170> all<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.680> way<00:02:30.769> up<00:02:30.890> to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
even visibly moving all the way up to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.619 
even visibly moving all the way up to
full<00:02:31.310> speed<00:02:31.370> which<00:02:31.849> will<00:02:31.969> push<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.239> along<00:02:32.329> at

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
full speed which will push you along at

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.500 
full speed which will push you along at
five<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.109> a<00:02:33.140> half<00:02:33.170> miles<00:02:33.469> an<00:02:33.620> hour<00:02:33.680> or<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.510> also

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
five and a half miles an hour or so also

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.119 
five and a half miles an hour or so also
the<00:02:35.659> same<00:02:35.810> thing<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.079> true<00:02:36.109> in<00:02:36.260> Reverse<00:02:36.620> you

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
the same thing is true in Reverse you

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.069 
the same thing is true in Reverse you
can<00:02:37.250> go<00:02:37.370> any<00:02:37.609> infinite<00:02:37.969> speed<00:02:38.299> in<00:02:38.450> Reverse<00:02:38.540> and

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
can go any infinite speed in Reverse and

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.140 
can go any infinite speed in Reverse and
really<00:02:39.709> optimize<00:02:40.159> the<00:02:40.310> control<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:40.909> boat

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
really optimize the control of this boat

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.459 
really optimize the control of this boat
so<00:02:41.329> you<00:02:41.420> can<00:02:41.569> really<00:02:41.750> position<00:02:42.140> yourself

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
so you can really position yourself

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.750 
so you can really position yourself
anywhere<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.040> want<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.340> can<00:02:43.519> position

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
anywhere you want you can position

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.819 
anywhere you want you can position
yourself<00:02:43.939> stationary<00:02:44.719> and<00:02:44.870> occurrence<00:02:45.290> you

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
yourself stationary and occurrence you

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.069 
yourself stationary and occurrence you
can<00:02:45.980> cruise<00:02:46.549> along<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.939> shoreline<00:02:47.389> and<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
can cruise along the shoreline and the

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.599 
can cruise along the shoreline and the
beauty<00:02:48.319> of<00:02:48.409> this<00:02:48.500> whole<00:02:48.709> concept<00:02:48.980> really<00:02:49.519> is

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
beauty of this whole concept really is

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.369 
beauty of this whole concept really is
that<00:02:49.849> you<00:02:50.120> don't<00:02:50.299> have<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.719> use<00:02:50.870> your<00:02:51.019> hands<00:02:51.260> at

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
that you don't have to use your hands at

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.780 
that you don't have to use your hands at
all<00:02:51.469> once<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.859> set<00:02:52.069> your<00:02:52.099> speed<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.670> are

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
all once you set your speed you are

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.819 
all once you set your speed you are
entirely<00:02:53.120> hands-free<00:02:53.540> because<00:02:54.530> your

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
entirely hands-free because your

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.800 
entirely hands-free because your
steering<00:02:55.099> is<00:02:55.370> accomplished<00:02:56.060> by<00:02:56.269> these<00:02:56.629> two

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
steering is accomplished by these two

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.209 
steering is accomplished by these two
foot<00:02:57.019> pedals<00:02:57.379> which<00:02:57.500> are<00:02:57.620> connected<00:02:57.829> to<00:02:58.129> the

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
foot pedals which are connected to the

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.819 
foot pedals which are connected to the
rudder<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.670> back<00:02:58.819> of<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.060> boat<00:02:59.650> as<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
rudder in the back of the boat as you

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.250 
rudder in the back of the boat as you
can<00:03:00.950> see<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.280> rudder<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.669> quite<00:03:01.939> substantial

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
can see the rudder is quite substantial

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.149 
can see the rudder is quite substantial
compared<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.379> what<00:03:03.530> you're<00:03:03.620> used<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.919> seeing

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159

maneuverability<00:03:08.720> on<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.049> thing<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.370> a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
maneuverability on this thing this is a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.879 
maneuverability on this thing this is a
13<00:03:10.849> foot<00:03:11.090> boat<00:03:11.419> and<00:03:11.720> it'll<00:03:12.109> still<00:03:12.409> turn<00:03:12.680> on<00:03:12.859> a

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
13 foot boat and it'll still turn on a

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.409 
13 foot boat and it'll still turn on a
little<00:03:13.099> over<00:03:13.340> its<00:03:13.519> length<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.060> it's<00:03:14.180> extremely

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
little over its length so it's extremely

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.659 
little over its length so it's extremely
maneuverable<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.439> that<00:03:15.859> big<00:03:16.219> rudder<00:03:16.489> and

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
maneuverable and that big rudder and

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.399 
maneuverable and that big rudder and
maneuverability<00:03:17.329> combined<00:03:17.750> with<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.139> spec

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409

that you've got forward in Reverse makes

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:20.890 
that you've got forward in Reverse makes
this<00:03:20.000> thing<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.419> can<00:03:20.540> go<00:03:20.659> just<00:03:20.810> about

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
this thing so it can go just about

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.670 
this thing so it can go just about
anywhere<00:03:22.480> finally<00:03:23.480> this<00:03:24.139> boat<00:03:24.319> is<00:03:24.349> still<00:03:24.620> a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
anywhere finally this boat is still a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.179 
anywhere finally this boat is still a
kayak<00:03:25.359> it's<00:03:26.359> completely<00:03:26.900> palatable<00:03:27.889> as<00:03:28.129> a

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189
