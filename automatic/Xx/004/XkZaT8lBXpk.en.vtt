00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.290 
pretty clever with the words okay well
so<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.890> watch<00:02:13.160> them<00:02:13.340> for<00:02:13.489> six<00:02:13.730> or<00:02:13.879> seven<00:02:13.910> more

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
so I watch them for six or seven more

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.800 
so I watch them for six or seven more
games<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:15.230> if<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.560> ever<00:02:15.709> saw<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> locum<00:02:16.340> action

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
games and if you ever saw a locum action

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.059 
games and if you ever saw a locum action
he<00:02:17.810> didn't<00:02:18.019> even<00:02:18.080> have<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.379> get<00:02:18.470> off<00:02:18.650> his<00:02:18.769> feet

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
he didn't even have to get off his feet

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.110 
he didn't even have to get off his feet
to<00:02:19.640> dip<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.970> in<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.410> came<00:02:21.590> up<00:02:22.069> with

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
to dip it in and so I came up with

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.050 
to dip it in and so I came up with
dipper<00:02:23.120> dunk<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.040> figured<00:02:25.370> well<00:02:25.550> let's<00:02:25.849> see

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
dipper dunk and I figured well let's see

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.300 
dipper dunk and I figured well let's see
will<00:02:26.330> he<00:02:26.420> like<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.630> or<00:02:26.870> won't<00:02:26.989> he<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.739> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
will he like it or won't he and the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.460 
will he like it or won't he and the
first<00:02:28.550> game<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.970> tried<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.510> he<00:02:29.959> was<00:02:30.140> halfway

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
first game I tried it he was halfway

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.190 
first game I tried it he was halfway
down<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:31.370> court<00:02:31.700> with<00:02:31.940> his<00:02:32.090> long<00:02:32.450> galloping

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
down the court with his long galloping

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.890 
down the court with his long galloping
steps<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.920> he<00:02:34.370> went<00:02:36.610> well<00:02:37.610> wilt<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.269> gone<00:02:38.540> but

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
steps and he went well wilt is gone but

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.839
