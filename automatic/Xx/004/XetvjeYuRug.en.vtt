00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.099
 usually the bathrooms are spaces 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.200
 small but that does not mean that no 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.210
 we can give it a lot of style what if 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.130
 kingpin called interior decorator and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
 modern bathrooms and I'll show you how 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.270
 set this space through the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.420
 decorative accessories so that everything 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.660
 coordinate the end and look magazine well 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.399
 that ready we started in the majority of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.070
 the bathrooms the white color almost always 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.350
 predominates from the basins tiles and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.910
 toilets as they are fixed elements and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.980
 It would cost a lot to change them 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.379
 The solution is to give more personality to 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.660
 that space through painting and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.640
 decorative accessories 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.890
 the question that many ask me in the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.030
 social networks then what color is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.550
 choose to help me please and the good is 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.059
 that with white tiles everything coordinates 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.400
 the important thing and pay close attention is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.220
 look for a source of inspiration for 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.990
 all the decoration usually me 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.270
 like to combine three colors in one 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.550
 environment in this case we have the target 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 the coffee on the dresser and a light blue 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.900
 that I love because it enhances a style 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.280
 well modern that means that the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.920
 inspiration for the decoration of this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.060
 bathroom to see what is question question 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.390
 Question 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.280
 the blue so we started the problem 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.100
 What we have is that even with painting 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.659
 bathroom still does not look finished yet 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.149
 missing the decorative touches for 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.770
 complete the transformation is 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.780
 combination with different shades of blue 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.729
 I like it because it is a very serene color 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.159
 it looks perfect in a bathroom but if 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.380
 you prefer other options here I show you 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.299
 some that also coordinate by 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.399
 example we can use green as 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.100
 Our color accent on the curtain 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.590
 towels and carpet combined with 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.990
 silver accessories also a color 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.540
 purple with white touches that enhance 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.480
 a glamorous and modern style 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.320
 or even a combination of gray for a 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.630
 more classic and sophisticated style 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.970
 the key is to incorporate the color of the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.190
 wall around the space through 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.780
 the different decorative elements and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.720
 at the end you will have an atmosphere 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.250
 completely unified first step one 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.950
 bathroom curtain that allows us to bring 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.420
 more color to the shower area 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.340
 towels are another perfect way to 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.530
 add color and texture in the environment 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.680
 combining a solid towel with a 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.120
 royal print of a very luxurious style 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.730
 an advice to give that special touch 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.280
 of spa is that you roll some of them 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.280
 on top of a decorative tray what 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.140
 beautiful 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.500
 Other important elements are the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.300
 washbasin accessories on top of the toilet 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.069
 Now we go to the wall and hang a 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.800
 marking mirror that gives us much more 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.840
 style as art I love this panel 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.930
 in relief that has all the colors 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.660
 what we are using below is 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.880
 super modern shelf to put candles 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.739
 and other ornaments and if you have a bathroom 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.170
 small like this and you need more 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.940
 storage a basket like this is 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.250
 ideal to have it in front of the toilet 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.350
 because inside you can place your the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.060
 toilet paper and so have it always to 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.060
 hand and well organized 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.650
 Now we do have a bathroom with a lot 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.629
 style we see as all the accessories 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.340
 Decorative play a very role 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.110
 important to make a remarkable change 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.610
 in this space 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.319
 The advantage is that the accessories 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.330
 decorative and the painting does not cost much 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.849
 money however you can see 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.099

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.409
