00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
[Shannon] You have to understand, there's more to this story that I know, but won't tell you

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.300
even though you need to know

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.420
you'll just have to trust me regardless of the fact that you have NO reason to trust me

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.160
Now c'mon

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.720
Let's get out of here

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.120
[Burnie] Cut!

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.000
Perfect!

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.200
Nice man

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.700
[Geoff] C'mon out of the booth

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.500
[Shannon] Yeah? Good?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.620
[Burnie] Yeah, nailed it. 
Shannon: Thanks.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.120
(yawns) Oh man.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.960
[Geoff] Hey, are you okay?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.760
[Shannon] Yeah, I'm just beat.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.440
We had rehearsal until 2am

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.020
Our new play opens up tonight. So-

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.620
I am about to run home and catch some z's

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.080
'til I have to be back at the theater.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.960
[Burnie] Which theater? The one downstairs?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.100
[Shannon] Yeah.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.200
[Burnie] Well why go all the home just to come back up here?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.960
Why don't you go to our conference room, crash on the couch

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.210
We can wake you up when it's time for your show.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.000
[Shannon] Yeah?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.660
[Burnie] Yeah!

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.380
[Geoff] No problem.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.190
[Shannon] You sure?

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.870
[Burnie] Why wouldn't we be sure?

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.300
[Shannon] I-I don't know

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.100
I just-

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.600
I just-

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.160
[Shannon] Just right back in here, right?
[Burnie] Yeah.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.920
(heartbeats)

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.220
[Shannon] Huh? What-

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.070
What are you doing? Whats going on?

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.930
[Burnie] GREAT! He's awake-

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.170
[Geoff] I'll go get some more ice.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.550
[Shannon] Wait- What are you doing to me?

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.829
[Burnie] We are encasing you in ice.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.131
[Shannon] I'm freezing-

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.740
[Burnie] Yeah, that's because of all the ice but
now that you're awake

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.460
we can finally start your briefing.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.140
[Shannon] Briefing?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.640
[Burnie] Yeah.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.659
[Geoff] Okay, I got the ice. We can cover his head whenever you're ready!

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:59.679
[Burnie] Well that's exciting news.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.379
[Shannon] What- why are you doing this?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.020
[Burnie] Because we are sending you to the future.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.880
[Shannon] What?!

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.060
[Burnie] Yeah. We are going to cryogenically freeze you and then wake you up

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.649
like

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.749
you know thirty or forty years from now.

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.749
[Shannon] Geoff!

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:11.249
[Burnie] It's a great idea.

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:11.749
[Shannon] Geoff?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.840
Get me out of this box.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.200
[Geoff] No, silly! You've got to be in a box that's where all the ice is.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.769
[Burnie] Okay, now look. When you do wake up in the future you're gonna have to find us. Okay?

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.810
Time Magazine says that Americans are
becoming more racially and culturally

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.720
diverse

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.930
all the time so the future versions me
probably not gonna look like this

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.069
we did some computer simulations; I'm gonna look a something

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.129
like this.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.100
Okay.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.489
Now this is the important part. When you
find me

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.519
you need to give me the following
information

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.209
need to tell me to go to the nearest stock
market and buy stock

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.769
[Burnie] in the following companies:
[Shannon] Wait- what?

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:48.489
[Burnie] A. Google

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.680
B. Apple

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.500
C. Whatever the company is that makes email.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.200
[Shannon] Wait wait. That's not how time travel works! You have to send me back if you wanted to-

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.320
[Geoff] (sighs) He's not buying it.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.580
[Burnie] Yeah, listen. We knew you might not like the plan.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.300
[Geoff] "What's in it for you", right?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.620
[Burnie] 'K first of all, you get to keep the stock tips.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.520
Those are yours to use for free.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.940
[Geoff] and you
can bet any sports teams that you may remember

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.600
[Burnie] Another thing we're gonna do for ya' is this: We're gonna send you to the future

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.100
with modern-day currency which by the
time you arrive

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.720
will be valuable collector's item.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.600
[Shannon] Those are photocopies!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.019
[Geoff] Yeah, well, we spent out actually money on this box.

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.699
this thing was expensive!

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.400
[Shannon] Look, you guys seem to have

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.680
thought all this through. So why didn't just one of you guys go?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.760
[Burnie] Oh, come on. What're kidding me? You're the perfect candidate!

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.800
I mean first of all you got a shaved head, right?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.600
[Geoff] In the future, they love that shit.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.190
[Burnie] and we all know that eventually
America's gonna be overtaken by China

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.730
you already speak Chinese!

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.930
[Shannon] I don't speak Chinese!

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.569
[Geoff] Oh no?

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.389
you spoke it pretty well at lunch today.

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.040
[Shannon] You ordered Kung Pao chicken!

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.540
[Burnie] Kung Pao.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.860
[Geoff] You're gonna blend right in.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.720
[Burnie] You're just gonna be another half-black

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.950
half-latino bald dude walking around eaten 'n
speaking Chinese stuff.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.739
[Geoff] Except you''ll

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.839
have the greatest stock tips in the history of mankind.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.739
[Burnie] and you'll have a
pocketful a vintage currency.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.379
[Geoff] We're gonna be rich.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.220
[Burnie] Let's get the lid!

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.020
[Shannon] Please, please don't do this!

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.190
[Burnie] Shh look look look look just close your eyes and go to sleep.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.230
Just like bein' on a plane

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.530
You fall asleep and wake up in Seattle- except Seattle's the future.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.840
[Geoff] Hold your breath!
