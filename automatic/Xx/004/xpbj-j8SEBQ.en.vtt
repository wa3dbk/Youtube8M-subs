00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
a panic situation just early on what did

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.590 
a panic situation just early on what did
you<00:00:47.520> feel<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> time<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.420> were<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
you feel at the time what were you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.279 
you feel at the time what were you
thinking<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.910> was<00:00:50.910> thinking<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
thinking I was thinking that there was a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.200 
thinking I was thinking that there was a
window<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> either<00:00:53.250> popped<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.969> cargo

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
window and either popped out or a cargo

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
window and either popped out or a cargo
door<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.410> felt<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
door because it really felt like it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
door because it really felt like it
actually<00:00:56.160> buffers<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.940> plane<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.690> thought

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
actually buffers the plane and I thought

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
actually buffers the plane and I thought
this<00:00:58.109> there's<00:00:58.410> nothing<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.219> do

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this there's nothing that really can do

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
this there's nothing that really can do
that<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:00.899> smaller<00:01:01.199> there

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that you know going to be smaller there

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.270 
that you know going to be smaller there
would<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> fairly<00:01:02.100> significant<00:01:02.760> so

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
would have to be a fairly significant so

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
would have to be a fairly significant so
the<00:01:05.280> oxygen<00:01:05.670> masks<00:01:06.140> flying<00:01:09.470> all<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.650> we

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the oxygen masks flying all that we

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
the oxygen masks flying all that we
heard<00:01:11.100> except<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.670> got<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:11.939> life<00:01:12.119> sort<00:01:12.420> of

information<00:01:57.509> did<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.350> from<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.890> crew<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
information did you get from the crew I

mean once she got the masts working and
things<00:02:01.259> sort<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.530> stabilized<00:02:01.950> how<00:02:02.340> much

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
things sort of stabilized how much

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.740 
things sort of stabilized how much
information<00:02:02.969> did<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.149> get<00:02:03.299> from<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.540> crew

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and then how long was it before you were

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.469 
and then how long was it before you were
actually<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.509> know<00:02:06.630> safe<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> ground

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
actually you know safe on the ground

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.300 
actually you know safe on the ground
look<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.720> panic<00:02:10.289> guy<00:02:10.560> was<00:02:10.800> there

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
look the panic guy was there

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.479 
look the panic guy was there
be<00:02:11.849> true<00:02:12.150> immediately<00:02:12.870> ran<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.950> their<00:02:14.130> seats

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
be true immediately ran to their seats

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.940 
be true immediately ran to their seats
incessant<00:02:15.030> self-interest<00:02:15.930> no<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.709> really

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
incessant self-interest no one really

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.949 
incessant self-interest no one really
knew<00:02:17.099> what<00:02:17.280> was<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> happen<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.690> they

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
knew what was going to happen so they

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.350 
knew what was going to happen so they
were<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.680> was<00:02:19.890> method<00:02:20.430> everyone<00:02:20.940> else<00:02:21.120> it

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
were that was method everyone else it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.390 
were that was method everyone else it
wasn't<00:02:21.660> much<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> way<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.400> announcements

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
wasn't much in the way of announcements

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.100 
wasn't much in the way of announcements
it<00:02:23.520> was<00:02:23.640> basically<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.270> one<00:02:24.840> single

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
it was basically just one single

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.880 
it was basically just one single
announcement<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:27.239> know<00:02:27.380> put<00:02:28.380> your<00:02:28.530> masks

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
announcement so you know put your masks

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.759 
announcement so you know put your masks
on<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.550> stay<00:02:30.180> seated<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.200> actually<00:02:31.620> took

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
on and stay seated so it actually took

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.790 
on and stay seated so it actually took
some<00:02:31.830> time<00:02:32.250> before<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:34.050> aircraft<00:02:34.290> stopped

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
some time before the aircraft stopped

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.740 
some time before the aircraft stopped
stable<00:02:35.280> enough<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.700> guess<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.090> pilot<00:02:36.300> just

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
stable enough I guess the pilot just

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.949 
stable enough I guess the pilot just
dropped<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.580> latitude<00:02:38.580> sorry<00:02:39.239> altitude<00:02:39.720> down

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
dropped the latitude sorry altitude down

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.970 
dropped the latitude sorry altitude down
to<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> reasonable<00:02:40.860> level<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.700> speeds

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
to a reasonable level and the speeds

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.430 
to a reasonable level and the speeds
probably<00:02:43.980> within<00:02:44.690> 15-20<00:02:45.690> minutes<00:02:46.019> we<00:02:46.170> were<00:02:46.230> in

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
probably within 15-20 minutes we were in

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.030 
probably within 15-20 minutes we were in
a<00:02:46.560> non<00:02:48.049> area<00:02:49.049> where<00:02:49.290> we<00:02:49.440> didn't<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.920> use

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
a non area where we didn't have to use

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.420 
a non area where we didn't have to use
the<00:02:50.190> option<00:02:50.489> mark<00:02:50.900> my<00:02:51.900> gosh<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.890> see<00:02:53.190> some<00:02:53.400> of

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
the option mark my gosh we see some of

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.820 
the option mark my gosh we see some of
your<00:02:53.730> video<00:02:54.150> which<00:02:54.750> looks<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.440> applause

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
your video which looks like the applause

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.520 
your video which looks like the applause

what<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.310> moment<00:03:02.580> was<00:03:02.819> like<00:03:03.060> when<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.390> when

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
what that moment was like when you when

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.350

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
you touch the ground well it's kind of

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.820 
you touch the ground well it's kind of
weird<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:06.810> was<00:03:06.870> sitting<00:03:07.319> there<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.769> said

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
weird I was sitting there and I said

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.479 
weird I was sitting there and I said
well<00:03:12.170> my<00:03:13.170> phone<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.440> couldn't<00:03:13.739> get<00:03:13.920> my<00:03:14.069> camera

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.920 
well my phone I couldn't get my camera
like<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.910> couldn't<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.239> out<00:03:15.359> of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.480> suit<00:03:15.720> so

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
like we couldn't get out of the suit so

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.360 
like we couldn't get out of the suit so
I<00:03:15.989> just<00:03:16.170> started<00:03:16.470> filming<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.190> sort<00:03:17.340> of

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
I just started filming I just sort of

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.920 
I just started filming I just sort of
watching<00:03:17.549> kind<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.329> witnessing<00:03:18.690> what<00:03:18.810> was

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
watching kind of witnessing what was

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.440 
watching kind of witnessing what was
going<00:03:19.200> on<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.790> thought<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.000> was<00:03:21.120> kind<00:03:21.390> of

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
going on and I thought that was kind of

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.120 
going on and I thought that was kind of
important<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.049> record<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.650> know<00:03:22.769> what<00:03:22.980> was

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
important to record you know what was

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.000 
important to record you know what was
happening<00:03:23.489> because<00:03:23.549> often<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.090> don't<00:03:24.510> really

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
happening because often you don't really

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.430 
happening because often you don't really
hear<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.370> see<00:03:26.730> what<00:03:27.630> what<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.170> exit

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
hear and see what what the exit

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.949 
hear and see what what the exit
situations<00:03:29.100> are<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.970> an<00:03:30.120> aircraft<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.750> sort

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
situations are in an aircraft you sort

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:40.490 
situations are in an aircraft you sort
of<00:03:30.989> don't<00:03:31.079> get<00:03:37.280> amazing<00:03:38.280> robbed<00:03:38.730> amazing<00:03:39.510> now

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
of don't get amazing robbed amazing now

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.900 
of don't get amazing robbed amazing now
that<00:03:40.709> you're<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.220> know<00:03:41.310> you're<00:03:41.549> off<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
that you're you know you're off the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.340 
that you're you know you're off the
plane<00:03:42.120> you're<00:03:42.269> safe<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.660> sound<00:03:42.720> you've<00:03:43.079> seen

that gaping hole in the fuselage and I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.180 
that gaping hole in the fuselage and I
guess<00:03:45.900> have<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.109> bigger<00:03:46.380> sense<00:03:46.650> now<00:03:46.859> probably

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
guess have a bigger sense now probably

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.610 
guess have a bigger sense now probably
of<00:03:47.519> how<00:03:47.639> serious<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.150> was<00:03:48.230> how<00:03:49.230> do<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.410> feel
