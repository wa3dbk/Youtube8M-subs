00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.310
 at subaru the success model forrester 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.230
 in the fourth round 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.360
 the new generation should be especially new 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.049
 Buyers of the Japanese four-wheel brand 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.820
 to convince 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.889
 the hopes of subaru that the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.199
 growing community of forester continues to grow 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.720
 It is not outlandish the target group 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.530
 our new forster is both the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.590
 farmer the forester in the offroad area 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.540
 or even the normal driver with the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.100
 vehicle on the road on stretch 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.350
 on the go is safe driving or wants 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.790
 Even in the evening in the theater with this 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.350
 wants to be on the road 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.290
 last year decided 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.880
 More than 5000 buyers for the suv next to 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.070
 his skills in the urban jungle 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.750
 and on long autobahn naps it is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 the off-roadness always keeps him 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.410
 back to the first election makes it clear that 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.600
 the new model has to build on it 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 then he asks for a bit of terrain 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.309
 and see how well that works 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.130
 In terms of technology here is the ixs mode 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.840
 activated were the manual circuit 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.490
 is in the first construction stage so that 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.450
 car always stays nice and slow 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.549
 tries above all things here 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 These uneven places first 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.880
 to maintain movement that one 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.850
 does not stop constantly and restart 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.790
 but has to try a bit 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.400
 to have some momentum 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.450
 and if it's only 2 km h, that's why 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.549
 stay standing 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.229
 even in situations where many 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.030
 his competitors no longer 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.860
 the forrester remains unperturbed 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.960
 on his course the technology makes it 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.540
 possibly relieved too much in a council 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.160
 or there is in the air and see through 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.090
 would like to be detained by the brake system 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.480
 thus the drive to the other side 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.510
 The differential also changes here 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.900
 this big bumps in the back 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.940
 the air now that now the front wheel 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.780
 other back wheel just try nice 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.400
 gently smoothly all obstacles too 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.090
 override that speech always 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.920
 ground contact have vehicle movements 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 So body movements as possible 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.020
 be avoided if the ground clearance 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.000
 not unnecessarily reduced clear that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.070
 the driver in the terrain still in demand 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.040
 is despite the many electronic 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.610
 Helper try that it downhill 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.300
 not too fast is posing change 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.990
 of gas and brake small bit 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.850
 swing with the steyler goes up 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.230
 but do not try the mountain anymore 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.590
 to get faster but just 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.170
 to take advantage of the momentum here 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.240
 Of course, poor visibility downhill then 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.080
 Relatively relaxed works electronic 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.920
 for me in the forrester of 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.380
 Assistant systems do that today 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.790
 possible without braking here yourself 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.020
 car slowly driving water 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.120
 Drain at issue here in the 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.920
 Programming takes into account when you 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.570
 However, there are gas or any 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.100
 Pedals touched he controls it 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.590
 Of course, driver's wish always has 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.070
 not even streams are priority for the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.840
 forester an insurmountable obstacle 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.000
 also in the water crossings really 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.430
 low tempo a little bit of swing 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.430
 a little increased engine speed can help 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.530
 On the other hand, of course, then you have the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.870
 Underground also assess before 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.040
 not that in the 15 this hole 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.050
 is hello and drives too fast through and 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.640
 So conclude again a chic 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.830
 situation still a connection 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.020
 this is for the axes but then krems 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.910
 intervened master of forrester that 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.270
 We are super at the competition 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.300
 from toyota before and honda cr-v he can 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.830
 with a starting price of just under 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.960
 The five-year- olds are pumping 29,000 euros 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.940
 factory warranty may also be undecided 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.000
 convince with the purchase no mistake 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.000
 do
