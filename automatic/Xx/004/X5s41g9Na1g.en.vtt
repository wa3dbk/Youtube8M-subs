00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.210
 It's good to see the prize is joked. 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.710
 I hope this lightweight and easy to grow 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.549
 So I'm doing together with you. 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.609
 now the three skinny I was this one 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.560
 simple religion like soy and corn 3 only 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.960
 a lot to do 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:37.070
 I think it's cool and then the shantala standards 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:39.390
 [Music] 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.219
 so folks all the pieces that I used 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.190
 were bought at jewelry stores 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.440
 so it's also easy to find 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 this main piece is the basis and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 that we are going to use for 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 To start, we're going to take fernandinho. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.860
 she was very close and whispered with 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.070
 less than a real queen and use 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.739
 Universal tote bag catches her brand and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.140
 vote in the glue and pasting the little beaches or 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.140
 side by side until the end 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.100
 so people process this is pretty simple 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.259
 no mystery and throwing it up 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.509
 reach another tip using the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.509
 glue and the yarns side by side 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.400
 and it was 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.340
 now use a pebble I bought a blue 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.370
 The more clear the teacher, the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.440
 fringes are a darker one and I go 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.360
 put a beam using a ball that 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.229
 investor adin I bought with black 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.229
 also combines 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.620
 they stayed like that and I used the glue on the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.170
 end of the strip just not to shred 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.120
 It was just a little bit, you know, just collaborate. 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.330
 for us it does not appear 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.340
 so it will not break the strip and not 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.670
 it will appear that you have placed nothing in the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670
 little end 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.159
 [Music] 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.980
 good as I thought it was a little 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.280
 I'm going to add another layer of 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.150
 fringe will get fuller know why 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.690
 meaning very little with a 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.690
 layer only 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.840
 but the same process only make necklace 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:19.920
 same size and even size of the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.920
 first layer site people 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.340
 much better do not you look at the difference with a 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.380
 layer and with two layers better good 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.480
 the finishing we will do with this 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.970
 Ribbon but optional 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.130
 You know how well it's hidden in your ear. 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 but it always gives pleasure so we 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.160
 put a little piece of tape if it had 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.610
 I think it's really cool, the problem stays 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.239
 super cute and it's one more thing 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.799
 shop knows then I went back two ribbons in the 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.380
 back so as Peking 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.100
 a screen and ready 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.140
 Look at the difference with this, it's good, I'll go. 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.720
 to do this other is a yellow you 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.209
 can see that even if very different 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.040
 blue only has those holes you can 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.870
 that we increase more but the base 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.320
 It's the same thing I just put the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.750
 fringes in the same way as people 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:34.500
 put the zone 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:41.420
 [Music] 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.420
 and sticking to everything until the end 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.660
 we will put in schools until the 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.860
 A little bit because you talk a lot 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.040
 fast and always a little bit 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.040
 [Music] 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:08.810
 and there's just no way to stop the stripes 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.509
 with link the region is not joked is already 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.939
 very flashy very big so nothing 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.300
 fringe people always fringe more 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.949
 short 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.080
 Good, I'll use this string for a mother. 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.569
 which also comes bijuteria shop because 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.159
 she has this my base piece I have 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.499
 interest right in the middle so I'm going to 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.770
 string braiding is making kind 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:33.039
 sew up or down to the 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.039
 Last 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:42.310
 [Music] 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.520
 and O prontinho only put glue 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.400
 finish always finish count 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.590
 putting people is very important 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.990
 I'm not there then I'll put the river 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.699
 shiny designs I bought some 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.220
 pebbles and glitter only to place the 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.430
 furrows on top of smaller pebbles 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.980
 [Music] 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.520
 and on the bottom handles I bought some 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.409
 a little bigger pebbles 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.620
 [Music] 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:13.620
 I'll put it too 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.960
 [Music] 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.520
 and in that part of the world, I decided not to go 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.470
 use a more neutral stone because 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.630
 play as yellow 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.639
 and this and others between the other banks 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.820
 but I 'm not going too yellow 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.820
 france came out a little more on the fringes 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.790
 This one covered me well and well. 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.740
 Increased in people 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.740
 but I liked your models 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:46.710
 Let's end it with zip fasteners and I'll 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.669
 make one more layer because with this 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.669
 single layer was not cool 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:07:00.570
 [Music] 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.470
 prontinho seen and these were all 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.390
 earrings 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.860
 Look how nice it was, I almost did not 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.660
 I will be there for you because he 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.480
 much like the junction has changed the same 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:31.650
 colors but they look beautiful it is not 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:40.340
 I want to see everyone participating 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:40.340
 with the rain 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:54.380
 I think I know what this is.
