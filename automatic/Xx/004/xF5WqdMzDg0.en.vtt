online<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.050> guess<00:00:55.440> Sony<00:00:55.770> didn't<00:00:56.010> take<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
online now I guess Sony didn't take that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.119 
online now I guess Sony didn't take that
too<00:00:56.730> kindly<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.840> actually<00:00:58.140> retaliated

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
too kindly so they actually retaliated

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.180 
too kindly so they actually retaliated

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
Hut's lawyers so I honestly don't get

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.800 
Hut's lawyers so I honestly don't get
that<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.460> doesn't<00:02:20.670> make<00:02:20.760> any<00:02:21.030> sense<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.540> me<00:02:21.780> I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that it doesn't make any sense to me I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.950 
that it doesn't make any sense to me I
think<00:02:22.170> that's<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:22.740> plain<00:02:23.190> BS<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.300> I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
think that's just plain BS and I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.050 
think that's just plain BS and I
honestly<00:02:25.200> think<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.890> maybe<00:02:26.190> Sony<00:02:26.730> is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
honestly think that maybe Sony is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.350 
honestly think that maybe Sony is
actually<00:02:27.750> paying<00:02:28.470> off<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.280> judge<00:02:29.580> or<00:02:29.910> someone

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
actually paying off the judge or someone

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.570 
actually paying off the judge or someone
else<00:02:30.570> that's<00:02:31.020> higher<00:02:31.350> up<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.920> actually<00:02:32.130> pull

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
else that's higher up to actually pull

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.570 
else that's higher up to actually pull
the<00:02:32.610> strings<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:34.350> make<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.890> escalate

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the strings and to make this escalate

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.730 
the strings and to make this escalate
beyond<00:02:36.090> what<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.720> actually<00:02:36.990> should<00:02:37.530> have<00:02:37.650> in

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
beyond what it actually should have in

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.890 
beyond what it actually should have in
the<00:02:37.830> beginning<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.430> didn't<00:02:39.150> even<00:02:39.270> think<00:02:39.510> Sony

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
the beginning I didn't even think Sony

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.730 
the beginning I didn't even think Sony
had<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.740> big<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.540> advantage<00:02:42.540> at<00:02:42.780> all<00:02:43.140> when

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
had that big of a advantage at all when

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.250 
had that big of a advantage at all when
this<00:02:43.950> whole<00:02:44.160> thing<00:02:44.520> first<00:02:44.850> started<00:02:45.300> up<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.660> mean

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
this whole thing first started up I mean

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.440 
this whole thing first started up I mean
because<00:02:46.410> honestly<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.610> digital<00:02:48.000> millenium

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
because honestly the digital millenium

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.740 
because honestly the digital millenium
Act<00:02:48.630> states<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.520> jailbreaking<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:51.090> hacking

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
Act states that jailbreaking and hacking

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.900 
Act states that jailbreaking and hacking
of<00:02:51.960> consumer<00:02:52.470> electronics<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:53.280> completely

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
of consumer electronics is completely

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.200 
of consumer electronics is completely
legal<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.350> have<00:02:56.040> no<00:02:56.430> clue<00:02:56.730> where<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.000> is

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
legal so I have no clue where this is

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.800 
legal so I have no clue where this is
going

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
going

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.990 
going
basically<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.800> just<00:02:58.830> seems<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.730> big

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
basically it just seems like one big

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.270 
basically it just seems like one big
disaster<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.170> also<00:03:01.320> seems<00:03:01.710> like<00:03:01.830> some

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
disaster and it also seems like some

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.030 
disaster and it also seems like some
huge<00:03:02.850> publicity<00:03:03.120> thing<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:04.080> got<00:03:04.290> extremely

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
huge publicity thing that got extremely

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.410 
huge publicity thing that got extremely
blown<00:03:05.460> out<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.670> proportion

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
blown out of proportion

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.660 
blown out of proportion
I<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.410> said<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.770> honestly<00:03:08.310> don't<00:03:08.610> know

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
I like I said I honestly don't know

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.550
