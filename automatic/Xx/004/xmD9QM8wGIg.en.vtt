00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.939
 Ah, those good days are really fast! 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.290
 No matter what season, or wherever you are, when you ride a bicycle, 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 There are rules for proper clothing that you should follow. The following list, 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750
 Although not exhaustive, please do not hesitate to avoid these situations. 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.640
 Top 10 clothing that should not be worn while riding a bicycle 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.660
 No socks 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.250
 The parties have been arguing about the correct sock height, length or color when riding a bicycle. 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.660
 However, even with such an argument, you still have to put the socks in the first place. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.030
 Novices may not want to have sunburn and choose not to wear socks, but 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.680
 You need to overcome this. Sunburn is like a tattoo, indicating that you are a member of the bicycle circle. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.410
 If you don’t wear socks, you will be like an amateur. 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.820
 Risk of bruising your ankles and toes. 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.629
 Hey! Matt, I am a little scratched. Do you have a cream? 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.690
 have it! I think there are some in my car. 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.100
 Full-face helmet 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.280
 In my opinion, it is absolutely undoubted to wear a hard hat to ride a bike. but 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.470
 Cycling on the road wearing a full-face helmet, unless you are going to ride off-road downhill, or a BMX race, so you can't save. 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 Or a BMX race, so you can't save. First, he looks dangerous, and second, your head will be very hot. 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.729
 Second, your head will be very hot, and a wide field of view is very important. 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.729
 He not only hindered the flow of air, but it was also very funny. 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.610
 [I don't understand XD] 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.180
 Compression socks 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 The opposite of not wearing socks is wearing compression stockings. Whether riding or not, 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.280
 It seems very strange, and it also causes self-cognitive pressure, which in turn has a negative impact on the performance of the sport. 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.810
 Seriously, we take back that sentence - if you wear them, 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.600
 You may not know it. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.329
 Super hero. 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.479
 It’s precious to take time out to ride a bike, especially if you have to work or study in addition to training. 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.570
 So when you ride on your favorite route, 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.319
 Never want to save the disaster from coming to the world under the claws of a genius villain. 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.519
 By the way, the heroes are wearing the same clothes as the average person before they start to fight crimes! 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.659
 Simon! My good brother, I am going to fight the criminals until they disappear! 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.940
 National champion car coat 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.680
 Even if this is full of arguments, we believe that only under one condition 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.099
 You are allowed to wear a world or national championship car. This condition is 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.669
 You are still the current champion. 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:57.080
 Oh yeah! That’s a great day. 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.879
 God, Matt. That is the history of 16 years ago, take it off! 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.309
 I have to get some electrical tape. It’s too outrageous. 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:08.169
 Of course, if you were a national champion, you can continue to wear this strip on your arm. 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.529
 Can someone come to help me? 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.689
 Only suspender shorts - no tops. 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.939
 Since he started fitness, our Simon Richardson may be the only one 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.620
 You can get rid of people who are considered rude by normal knights. 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.260
 Usually the bicycling hair and sticky skin of the upper body of the bicyclist is best wrapped up. 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.940
 Throw into the best professional website for processing. 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.600
 I said, you look pretty solid. 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:37.419
 Thank you, dude. 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.439
 This looks like a very clear line. 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.769
 By the way, how often do you exercise? 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.829
 About ten years. 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.149
 I went there once. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.300
 Suit. 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.939
 Hey, Tally! 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.359
 If you are not an accountant who has been revoked your driver's license, or actually, avoid wearing a suit and cycling. 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.659
 You look good. 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.299
 Yes, things were solved last Friday. Now I can enjoy life! 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.139
 It is also absolutely impossible to check your files while traveling. We are not sure about your shoes 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.060
 There are splints installed. 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.909
 This won't work. What about a gorgeous sprint? 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.320
 Rock star 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.479
 GCN encourages you to sing while cycling is a very positive way to motivate yourself. 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.659
 This is no problem. 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.940
 However, we beg you not to use the kind of immersion in you when you are riding a bicycle. 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.319
 The way to love rock stars is to sing. 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:48.079
 Lyrics: (People try to belittle us / talk about our generation / just because we are gathering...) 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.750
 The Who's lead singer Roger Dahltree wears a rock-and-roll classic style on the stage with a pair of tannins. 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.920
 It should not be used on bicycles and is filthy. 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.300
 My generation, baby. My generation. My generation, baby. 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.800
 Animal jumpsuit 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.280
 Although it is very reluctant to admit that this is indeed a (cough) global phenomenon, 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.240
 These monsters should probably stay close to teenagers, students, and those who are misfitted. 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.919
 Of course, unless it makes you look like your favorite wild animal grows in a natural habitat, 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.879
 Just like what we did at GCN. 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.660
 Matt, what is that? 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.860
 I am a monkey. I have always liked monkeys since I was a child. 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.680
 Swimming pants 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.780
 In addition to providing only a few protections for men or women, swimming trunks 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.349
 And it looks very.....not comfortable. Yes, he can avoid the sunburn of a hidden car. 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.669
 But this is not a good excuse. If you want to ride a group and don't want to be abandoned by everyone. 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.189
 A little further from wearing swimming trunks - use it when you have it to the triathlon. So you are not easy because 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:57.550
 It involves arresting or reducing the ability to establish a family. 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.099
 Plus no one wants to ride behind someone who is covered in "food." 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.920
 I thought I would **** my lyrics, but I did a good job. 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.020
 National champion, you are! 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.530
 This wind is too big! 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.020
 Soon we will have a classic drama! 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.680
 I am excited about the appeal last night. 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.980
 This accent sounds weird, isn't it?
