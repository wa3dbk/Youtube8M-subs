00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 I bathe the health of his music lovers 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.240
 who opposes the axÃ© but in wintzenheim 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.240
 czapnik mertian than mike with cerium 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.700
 you people made themselves less 4 in hd 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.630
 I hope you are well then 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.100
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.990
 last video of al 2013 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.310
 the happy brand magazine so a 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.630
 review that I have been asked since a lot 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.010
 of time now we have it you see 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.869
 currently the team in which is 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.560
 placed happy mark so a 4 3 3 a 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.029
 bundesliga 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.800
 even if a few league 1 players 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.970
 currently you have the in-game stats 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.980
 from marco reus who are in the process of 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.230
 scroll in front of your eyes so pause or 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.540
 put back to see them there are 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.460
 a lot of green marc roze so 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.760
 I will start already by telling you that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.739
 he is an exceptional player of all 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 left backgrounds not a left wing that 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.640
 I tested behind Ronaldo this is the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.350
 I did not find better 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.449
 currently late I'm always looking 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.010
 again but there is no better there is no better 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.290
 there is ronaldo and after for me it's 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.489
 marco reus this is it said if I have to 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.470
 to give you advice is to do it 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.909
 play forward center left because 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.739
 I tried low in almost all 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.960
 the positions and in the middle left he is 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.790
 bad so when we finally in the middle 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.830
 left he is good but in the center front 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.600
 left he is simply monstrous 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.790
 in a 4 3 3 it's just a dinguerie 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.960
 and there is nothing else to say more 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.460
 I really advise you to 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.649
 place in a 4-3-3 or in a 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.119
 device to three attackers because 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.890
 there you will really go out a 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.600
 difference at the player level all 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.100
 simply at the negative points 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.640
 so I'll start with the points 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.560
 negative 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.030
 the negative point I put that one these 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.590
 head games that's it was throwing everything 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.109
 just fed up runners it's 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.399
 really the only negative point is at 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.170
 to say that he really has a lot of trouble 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.250
 to take balloons of the head even though 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.469
 I still scored goals of the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.259
 head with my child a goal of the head 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.149
 with it's still a stat that's 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.979
 bass and not its loud just the 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.390
 head and so that's his only point 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.249
 negative after at the points level 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.200
 positive there are a lot of 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:48.039
 things already started by the shots of 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.570
 foot stopped the set pieces 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.190
 marco reus is just a dinguerie 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.620
 you have the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.910
 you've got a mini stroke hardwood 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.910
 free kicks he really stretches very very 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.290
 well the corners the corners that are 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.570
 very well done I did a lot of 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.980
 decisive assists on corner including 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.540
 next to that there was a penalty kick review the 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.730
 penaltys I pulled only one was 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.110
 in a penalty shoot-out but he has 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.460
 a pretty correct stat after like 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.910
 usually as I often say them 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.220
 penalties is really 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.290
 it's really random, by the way 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.210
 when we talk about the penalty kick here see 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.160
 that he manages anyway but after 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.020
 it really depends on how to 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.730
 but still take it that this 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.350
 marco reus on the set pieces 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.330
 it's a dinguerie the free kicks 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.710
 even if I do not have one but you will see 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.760
 that free kicks that moan illustrates 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.920
 still a lot of quality 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.970
 after that it's true as often as I have 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.960
 bad luck on free kicks but 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.330
 it is true that with him I arrive rather 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.190
 to get to pretty well shoot them after 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.080
 in front of the goal of century finish 91 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.840
 definition it's just huge for a 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.230
 down for a left winger pot in front 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.640
 the goal 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.010
 it's a killing in front of the goal it's 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.210
 really a scorer there is nothing else 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.970
 to say when he passes in the ax 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.170
 usually it's always dangerous 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.190
 next to that there is a pass quality 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.440
 which is just huge 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.030
 he has a pass quality really 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.630
 really remarkable many passes 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.340
 decisive 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.800
 a vision of the game too kibaki makes the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.630
 difference technically it is very 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.860
 very very very good so that he wanted 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.870
 I forgot to put the dribbles 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.490
 his stats in dribbling but well here I am 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.900
 you say it now there are the four 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.220
 star technical gesture that make that I 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.410
 fight already technically you can have fun 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.420
 with there is way to have fun with and 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.680
 then down we also have the four 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.240
 bad foot star he has both feet 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.740
 so that and that does not seem to me that I 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.570
 put a lot of goals left foot with 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.070
 I think there are two memories I have 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.110
 failed to have a good review 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.250
 but there are still feet 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.000
 is still the two feet that him 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.310
 allow to make beautiful 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.560
 openings and very good in front of 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.050
 cages as I specified the 4-11 in 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.670
 finishing next to that there is a prostate 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.780
 in search of a big head in power of 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.240
 strikes even though it's true that I have not 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.830
 managed to make m long shot I 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.690
 believed in a big hit that I put 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.950
 on the bar it should not be long 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.260
 incidentally linked to that on the pole 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.459
 doyon has recovered I left the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.950
 continuity but good the strike on the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.870
 post that ends at the bottom that ends 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.670
 in goal there you once again have a 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.410
 parry on a shot on a free kick a 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.670
 free kick that went rather well 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.120
 there the corner on the defender's head 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.890
 felipe santana which makes purpose 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.330
 the mark to the Russians is a pass 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.650
 so the quality of passes as I said 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.420
 true 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.920
 exceptional i'm trying to 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.840
 think of others more than I would have 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.790
 not say so here is the speed the 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.799
 speed he's going really very very very 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.060
 soon that's really nothing 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.129
 else to say that's really his point 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.169
 years one of its strengths a rug 90 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.850
 in speed the guy I'm taking from 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.229
 speed anyone so saw her 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.449
 again a post and shots 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.639
 of arrested feet and finally I'm going 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.680
 finish talking about the price so the price 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.120
 gemini in the most nor in the east less 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.889
 for the simple reason that I do not 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.789
 do not put my nose - because I would not 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.830
 could put it in the hands because 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.630
 it is true that it has a price 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.150
 it's a genre that costs between 75 and 85 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.150
 me credit on xbox 360 on playstation 3 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.590
 his debt a bit more expensive but it's a 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.360
 player who is worth that price there he is 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.740
 really very very good as I tell you 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.660
 the above a lavezzi that is between 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.270
 40 and 50 me credit I believe ezequiel 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.889
 lavezzi currently he is above 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.479
 far above so for me it 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.740
 worth its price after that it's true that 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.970
 it's not given to bring everyone 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.830
 but I put it neither in the feathers in 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.150
 is - because as I say here it is 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.400
 deserves that price because it's a 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.380
 really exceptional player on the game 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.940
 and that's just for me it 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.770
 deserves this price there is not beautiful style 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.120
 and regular boost I will not here I 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.590
 will not try because here's more 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.630
 a million credits is so there we 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.520
 ends with the marco reus balance sheet so 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.229
 at the balance sheet level jusmy 19 surely 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.820
 so back notes I put the very 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.680
 very good rating of 19 out of 20 so in 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.760
 the limbs and the head game and finally 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.470
 in the east anymore so I put shots 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.990
 of foot stopped the effects resumption of 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.919
 stolen the vision his speed because he 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.020
 go very very fast 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.090
 finish his physical front in his 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.909
 physical I 'm equating the stat in equilibrium 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.919
 agility and strength then it's true 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.940
 that in strength he has less than 70 but that 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.740
 did not feel because 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.490
 honestly I rarely did 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.710
 to move too much with I have rarely had 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.180
 problems with him then at the level 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.560
 of a long hot as I have you a 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.449
 very big wait this same series that 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.800
 I did not really succeed in the illustrated 4 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.539
 stars bad foot a stat in 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.610
 really correct positioning and is 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.010
 always well offensively he 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.180
 makes attacker ball calls 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.130
 quality of typing power passes 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.080
 the four floors is technical and so 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.930
 that's 19 out of 20 as I said back 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.159
 notes is just here is the 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.930
 end of this review is the end of the 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.159
 marcory review i hope this
