00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 you have to walk youtube people as they are 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.410
 I hope they are very good, well 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.240
 today we are going to check this very good 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.680
 song of natalia lafourcade you know 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.790
 that we also have cover on this side and 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.320
 I also leave the link in the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.090
 description of the video and then I already know 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.740
 you know go for their guitars and we're going to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.389
 start that friends we're going to start 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.460
 with this very good song I'm going to play 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.150
 the first part that is the verse and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.150
 right now I explain it 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.900
 look 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.620
 two 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.850
 or that is very simple we only use 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.850
 four chords that would be less 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.450
 later it would be an E flat major but what 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.250
 is going to do this way we're just going 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.909
 to place the small finger in E flat 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.619
 which is the fret 6 of the fifth string and 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.290
 finger 1 instead of making the chair what 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.830
 let's put on the 3 fret of the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.390
 third is a very simple change do 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.500
 smaller and medium greater than the next 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.910
 chord cause is the flat major the form 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 popular that surely you already 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.360
 know and return to E flat 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.440
 that really are three chords and the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 made wood let's go making a 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.039
 rhythmic pattern that is going to repeat 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.280
 throughout the song that is this 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:47.789
 way we go in a nickname or what is going to be a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.050
 trait down one trait up 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:55.280
 I killed and then another received down 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:58.390
 ok then I repeat it a museum then 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.770
 work up 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.810
 and down 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.469
 then on this form we are going to join 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.469
 the chords 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.420
 in return 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.000
 instead 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.380
 i 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.130
 ah 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.360
 because it is really very simple and 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.550
 let's go to the next part which is the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.200
 chorus that continues to use the same 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.030
 rhythmic pattern but change the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.230
 chords I'll play it so that 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.230
 check and right now I explain it 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.170
 i 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.430
 one 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.800
 i 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.170
 ok the chorus is also very simple 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.420
 remember we continue with the same pattern 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.770
 rhythmic and a right hand and hand 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.100
 left we go to the sun chords 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.100
 less 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.810
 to less 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.579
 we return to the minor we go to do minor 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.370
 Y 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.110
 here we are a lower sustained fa 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.040
 we are the youngest with whom to see in passing 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.040
 a alpha less 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.860
 ok very simple and only at the end there is 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.050
 a small variation that the guitar 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.060
 does with some arpeggios really are the 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.400
 same chords only that we play it 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.840
 from the fifth string ok then 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.560
 we have the minor sun and we have to do 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.160
 this only down using the 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.830
 thumb of one of the fingers 3 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.030
 fifth fourth third and second strings 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.030
 let's go to F minor exactly the same 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.360
 we return to the minor 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.360
 C minor 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:50.259
 and we end up in a greater ok then this 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.300
 song is really very very simple 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:56.710
 really the most difficult thing is this wave 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.389
 of strumming but I really do not think that 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.610
 be very complicated for you as 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.629
 practice everything comes out so it could be 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.159
 all for this lesson 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.689
 ok friends that's it for this lesson
