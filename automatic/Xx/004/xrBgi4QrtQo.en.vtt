00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:08.290
 very good to everyone in the first place 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.210
 I want to apologize for taking more than 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.510
 two weeks without uploading any video but 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.040
 is that I have not had a galaxy operative 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.470
 to go since I had a few 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.020
 quibbles with him and well we're 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.520
 here again today I bring you a rumba 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.940
 quite peculiar a rom they are called 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.650
 Revolutions experiences is version 2 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.420
 and the truth is that I liked it 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.760
 quite 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.160
 I do not put training because the truth 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.340
 is that it is not has nothing to do 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.000
 we buy like for example the democracy 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.570
 final edition hello roman a version that 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.309
 they have taken out but to me what has most 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.410
 liked has been for aesthetics the 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:56.379
 true because you see that it's not just that 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.780
 not only have you caught they put the 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.839
 xperia launcher on the rom but that 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.960
 You see they have worked and the truth is 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.740
 that give 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.350
 good results for me a good 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.140
 result although as I say it is not 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.500
 the rom that more fluid goes there already what 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 We will see but I love them 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.159
 I like the style and good here 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.640
 we have the adjustments 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.909
 come on we see that the android version 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.689
 4.0 4 is based on one of the 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.390
 last 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.390
 s &amp; p that have been removed 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.420
 a bus that has found the moment 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:48.070
 meaningful book none the only one 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.369
 found has been once wifi day 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.799
 the phone was forwarded to me but then I 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.630
 has worked the other times I do not think 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.260
 that has not happened to me since the time 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.570
 but 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:06.890
 could stop and well we have we have the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:11.150
 same the settings that the rom in which 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.680
 is based only that we have an action 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.850
 own of this rom that is the navigation 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.040
 bar and we have two good options here 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.740
 we have the two options enable it 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.480
 disable the I have it is 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.070
 enabled because it is for them to have 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.600
 here three touch buttons and handle with 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.720
 them but good I think having 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.620
 it is foolish to have here the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.620
 three touch buttons 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.349
 and good that I wanted to comment on 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.349
 this is good, as you are seeing 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.820
 the special to a chef 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.560
 this for those who know the intern 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.690
 issued you already know more or less how 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.450
 it works I will teach 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.110
 the keyboard so that you see me in the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.300
 keyboard of one of the points 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.340
 he has not liked this reason 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:12.040
 why do not you write the everything quickly 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.040
 it turns quite a bit although I'm not going to go 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.640
 but hey, he does not have mistakes, you see everything 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.640
 perfectly and 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.950
 the truth is that it is a very very pretty 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.930
 for those who want to try and as soon as 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.500
 aa battery life the truth is that 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.510
 It is not one of those that 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.260
 of the branches that last the longest 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.269
 battery not much less 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.689
 but well I have the battery more and the 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.489
 I'm pretty tired and I can not not 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.700
 to be able to pay much attention to what I say 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.500
 me right now because as I say 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.640
 I have the battery 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.870
 a little 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.750
 annoyed 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.400
 and good another failure of what I do what 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.849
 least I liked in this rom so 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.720
 say the biggest mistake for me is that in 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:09.250
 up does not bring the little buttons we can 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.500
 be from here that you know they bring 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.739
 up I always do not know why here not the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.400
 bring you can each way to put them 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.400
 I have not found it 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.520
 but so good but for those who 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:29.630
 You see very essential you can leave 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.630
 here an energy widget like this 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.419
 that works perfectly but as 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.110
 I already tell you for me is one of the points 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:44.560
 that I liked the least about this rom 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.540
 and also good when 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.889
 we press on the screen you see that 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.530
 are the messages for 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.560
 to add widgets on the screen 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.620
 start and can go from the first 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.590
 that I have also for those who want 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.039
 change the background we just take the 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.039
 screen 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.090
 and let's see the gallery that brings 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.090
 default 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.789
 the truth is that I quite like the 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.210
 image that brings everything that 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.210
 we have always liked 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.220
 and I think that 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:30.390
 pretty colorful the images that brings 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.390
 by default thing that in some fault 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.760
 as you see, it looks pretty pretty 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.260
 the camera works 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.070
 okay pretty well they do not have some 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.280
 times 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.280
 blocks a bit but nothing 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.910
 nothing significant 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.230
 the camera is already watching what so that 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.020
 I do not have much light right now because I do not 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:08.270
 you see nothing but it works correctly 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.270
 you see here we have the adjustments 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.780
 and good the most applications 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.950
 they work right 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.950
 sometimes the whatsapp fails me but rare 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.430
 once the truth that 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:33.020
 they do not have either is not a rice that 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:35.030
 The truth is very false but as you already 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.180
 I say when for example this and I to 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.300
 Sometimes I'm on twitter and I give it back and 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:46.130
 the cne a bit but it's the only thing you're going 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:49.970
 to notice regarding failure of as for 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.989
 fluency plus a very recommended rom 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:56.360
 especially if you want to carry narÃ³n 

00:06:52.989 --> 00:07:01.150
 showy and that you like whenever the 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:04.390
 have willing and good from 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.430
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:13.250
 review and what 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.250
 bottles and the next a greeting
