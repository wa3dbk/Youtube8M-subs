00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:06.939
 what's up everybody talks to them mark mex and 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.310
 today I bring you what will probably be 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.820
 the last gameplay that will kill 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.250
 3 here on my channel 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.320
 it was a game so let's say you feel 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.060
 it's being done by teams on the sun map 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 how can you see he was wearing p 99 and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.779
 this I am taking arms ap-9 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.820
 with silencer 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.550
 do not ask me and why I chose it but 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.830
 good if the let's say that if they have their 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.250
 reason as I do not know if they saw a video 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.160
 previous that I climbed from which pm 9 is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.870
 bad that I thought not or that everything 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.519
 otherwise it 's pretty good and good 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.920
 what better way to prove it than 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.180
 with this game and well if you have not seen 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.840
 the video because surely I will leave them 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.780
 here in the description 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.360
 or in an annotation in the video and such and 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.540
 it is already the last game I have 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.860
 recorded of modern warfare 3 and nothing 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.309
 more here refining the last details 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.500
 for him the cops that will be epic when 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.530
 except that is the good video game here 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.930
 took out the predictor at the end and I think that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.420
 it remained good eye there that I risked 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.610
 that they were companions but by chance 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.190
 if they were enemies and mate or not so 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.900
 less and good as I said by tuning 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.399
 here the last details for the black 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.740
 ops 2 and no longer I think I will not go back to 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.920
 climb more modern warfare 3 had a 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.460
 game nor curious data 11 nothing 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.290
 because the truth was a call of duty that 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.020
 well is not going to throw much earth 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.229
 because it was a video game that has me 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.530
 I liked it and it took away so many hours of 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.050
 my activities so already the only thing that 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.900
 I have left to say of this game is that 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.630
 I decided this disappointed 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.350
 entertained that entertained a lot that is the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.390
 final goal of each game but then 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.250
 let's say we play it because 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.710
 we had another more recent call of duty 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.509
 no but right now with the black west 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.610
 will totally change that and eye here 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.340
 sack pib I saw it is what is going to be the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.700
 determinant in the game because good 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.519
 it was a super-mortal thing it's super 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.830
 matona as I say this one pelucones de 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.700
 laxe 6 here is kill me theme kills you and 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.440
 here or eat crazy and kill me for not 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.310
 but let's say that eye water and that almost 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.670
 finished people examine ah6 and I do not know if what 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.360
 would have destroyed but that courage if 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.320
 it would have been destroyed 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.150
 but hey I'm telling you it's a game 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.150
 well I do not know if I told them but it was 38 5 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.310
 at the end then a pretty good game 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.770
 in fact seeing it by teams obviously 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.420
 there are many much better but to me 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.000
 I liked it personally quite especially 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.280
 the ending that is not too epic but 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 I quite liked the way you 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.170
 I made the last low you will see it in a 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.700
 good moment here that says with eyes 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.800
 blind that we are missing there trying 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.870
 shoot and eye here here I say what 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.810
 happens what happens here that doing the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.670
 snail in there or incredible things can 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.040
 change to them does not even go for 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.260
 but get out and get to change or 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.760
 with the headshot the truth is that if 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.380
 keep playing this brown warfare 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.959
 try using the ap-9 is a weapon 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.540
 pretty good nothing but that yes there 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.330
 say that having a certain degree of 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.640
 ability or knowing how to move by 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.800
 maps more than anything boy here eye that 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.540
 meter read this here I do the 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.830
 envelope makes me the envelope without 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.290
 want because he does not even see me that goes 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.890
 out there it kills me 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.900
 like the people of your vegetable and well then 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.840
 As I was saying, it's a pretty good weapon 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.940
 in fact 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.190
 but as I tell you, you have to know 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.470
 move around the maps there is no one ever 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.300
 that shoot up close and this weapon is 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.670
 super effective shooting from the 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.099
 hip as I said in the video that 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.510
 your life the first baby is very very good 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.950
 and eye here good 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.540
 the ease with which die 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.430
 enemies and as you are seeing right now 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.040
 bustamante hair and mate and mate and mate 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.510
 and he does not get tired of killing and well he does not know 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.630
 They want to go to their house because they need to be 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.130
 here killing more soldiers and I do not 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.200
 had given the experience you know that from 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.880
 let go and see how they want them to be 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.680
 playing modern warfare 3 they already give 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.690
 double experience of 4 per experience and 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.690
 almost if we counted him 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.950
 the double express of the weapon and of 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.080
 normal experience 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.640
 up to four per experience but good 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.280
 here and basically it will end the 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.980
 gameplay left 7200 trabe reached 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.880
 kill everyone I think 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.670
 it is certainly not more killed one than eye 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.000
 well for us to get the bullets and 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.480
 pulled out the extreme beak with the magnum or 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.400
 good old because this has been all I 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.470
 I think if it's not the last gameplay 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.020
 It will be the second to last at least 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.060
 good warfare 3 and well then nothing I hope 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.270
 that you liked it and you know dale 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.130
 like if you liked it and like it above all 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.470
 as the last rich gameplay 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.320
 sea ​​rope woofer three so good 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.480
 I say goodbye and mark mex and see you 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.480
 in black ops 2 goodbye
