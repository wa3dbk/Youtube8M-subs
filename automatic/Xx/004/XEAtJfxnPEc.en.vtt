00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
discreet and so small and then the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.109

wrapping is so bright and also it's
quite<00:01:30.509> noisy<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.979> were<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.159> open<00:01:32.430> with

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
quite noisy so if you were to open with

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.440 
quite noisy so if you were to open with
someone<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> dare<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:35.150> okay<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.329> they

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
someone you dare it and okay so they

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
someone you dare it and okay so they
could<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.229> piece<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> candy

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
could just think it's a piece of candy

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.550 
could just think it's a piece of candy
if<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.820> guess<00:01:39.150> someone<00:01:39.509> has<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> piece<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.140> candy

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
if I guess someone has a piece of candy

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 
if I guess someone has a piece of candy
oh<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> handbag<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.939> they<00:01:42.090> have

oh I see it in the handbag and they have

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.990 
oh I see it in the handbag and they have
more<00:01:42.360> than<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:43.130> might<00:01:44.130> ask<00:01:44.369> them<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> shake

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
more than one might ask them to shake

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
more than one might ask them to shake
her<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.390> she<00:01:45.509> knows<00:01:45.659> sharing<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.229> caring

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
her because she knows sharing is caring

and I'm a chocoholic so that could be a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.679

those<00:03:51.510> heavier<00:03:51.989> days<00:03:52.489> when<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.760> regular<00:03:54.360> tampon

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
those heavier days when a regular tampon

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.720 
those heavier days when a regular tampon
just<00:03:54.989> won't<00:03:55.290> do<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.800> you<00:03:55.950> need<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.310> super

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
just won't do and you need a super

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.030 
just won't do and you need a super
temple<00:03:59.090> again<00:04:00.140> you<00:04:01.140> do<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.470> problem

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
temple again you do not a problem

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.460 
temple again you do not a problem
super<00:04:03.030> easy<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.510> hide<00:04:03.660> them<00:04:03.959> because<00:04:04.110> they're

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
super easy to hide them because they're

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.560 
super easy to hide them because they're
really<00:04:04.500> awesome<00:04:04.830> then<00:04:05.489> we<00:04:05.550> just<00:04:05.700> complicate<00:04:06.269> a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
really awesome then we just complicate a

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.490 
really awesome then we just complicate a
super-sized<00:04:07.260> temple<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:08.489> make<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.500> tiny

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
super-sized temple to make you a tiny

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.290 
super-sized temple to make you a tiny
difference<00:04:10.800> between<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.550> two<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.150> this

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
difference between the two is that this

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.940 
difference between the two is that this
one<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.540> slightly<00:04:12.720> thicker<00:04:13.230> than<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.709> one

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
one is slightly thicker than that one

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.400 
one is slightly thicker than that one
but<00:04:14.700> it's<00:04:14.820> not<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.480> big<00:04:15.780> huge<00:04:15.810> thing

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
but it's not like this big huge thing

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.930 
but it's not like this big huge thing
that<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:16.950> store<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.580> your<00:04:17.609> car's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
that you have to store in your car's

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.550 
that you have to store in your car's
boot<00:04:18.269> because<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.780> comforts<00:04:19.169> on<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.410> back

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
boot because it comforts on the back

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.250 
boot because it comforts on the back
seats<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.549> if<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.729> prefer<00:04:21.090> applicators

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
seats so if you prefer applicators

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.620 
seats so if you prefer applicators
puns<00:04:22.410> but<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.490> find<00:04:23.730> them<00:04:23.910> inconvenient

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
puns but you just find them inconvenient

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.810 
puns but you just find them inconvenient
because<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.050> how<00:04:25.290> bulky<00:04:25.650> they<00:04:26.040> are<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.520> how

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
because of how bulky they are and how

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.180 
because of how bulky they are and how
hard<00:04:27.030> they<00:04:27.240> are<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.390> carry<00:04:27.720> around<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.500> would

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
hard they are to carry around I would

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.220 
hard they are to carry around I would
highly<00:04:29.520> recommend<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.090> try<00:04:30.390> them<00:04:30.630> so

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
highly recommend that you try them so

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.710 
highly recommend that you try them so
convenient<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.700> it's<00:04:32.940> simple<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.480> use

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720
