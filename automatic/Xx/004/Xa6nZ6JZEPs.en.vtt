 I am a believer in the first instance reject the idea of ​​helping 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.360
 for considering it suddenly a reality too extreme 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.810

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.139
 thousand people an entire authority on the subject of fasting and once said something very 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:34.589
 Interestingly, fasting is not only the healthiest and fastest way 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.859
 to lose weight but 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.809
 it is the most pleasant 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:42.189
 and it seems that it does not, but it really is 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.109
 percent when you have experience they will realize that he was right 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.939
 in this way that I want to bring to be a good way 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.800
 hebe definition of fasting 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.830
 the year does not mean voluntary abstinence before all type of food 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.540

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.079
 well defined purpose 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.130
 the purpose may be that the weight then detoxify as he says 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.769
 but it may be the end 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.470
 heuer in the case of our demands separates earrings 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:19.389

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.379
 really fascinating 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.150
 and also we have strengthens the will and does not count on everything that 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.059
 we eat 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.069
 the character is to lose weight they will find in the fast a panacea 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.510
 because not only will they achieve their goal let's say leaders at the level of 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:42.659
 farm but also that fasting or manipulating the body by getting rid of 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.779
 all those waste that we have had in the body for so many years is going to 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.409
 politicize the organism 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.489
 and in general will promote the welfare percent 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.059

 under medical treatment concón 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.459
 a medicine document with medicines 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.909
 he did not advise 71 the youngest to start the week of August 20 with 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.129
 the fmi on day 2 and they gave him two days to
