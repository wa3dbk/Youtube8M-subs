00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
behind the doorframe if I'm hammering a

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.880 
behind the doorframe if I'm hammering a
nail<00:00:48.430> into<00:00:49.430> straight<00:00:50.149> into<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.420> piece<00:00:50.600> of<00:00:50.629> wood

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
nail into straight into a piece of wood

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.510 
nail into straight into a piece of wood
vertically<00:00:52.210> versus<00:00:53.949> hammering<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:55.039> nail<00:00:55.070> into

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
vertically versus hammering a nail into

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.510 
vertically versus hammering a nail into
a<00:00:55.610> doorframe<00:00:55.969> in<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:57.020> horizontal<00:00:57.440> manner<00:00:58.039> okay

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
a doorframe in a horizontal manner okay

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
to the right now in my tilted spiral
part<00:01:33.110> three<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:34.729> talked<00:01:34.970> about<00:01:35.270> how<00:01:35.650> when<00:01:36.650> you

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740

you get behind it it feels like you're

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.179 
you get behind it it feels like you're
going<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.729> go<00:01:40.939> way<00:01:41.540> off<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.229> right<00:01:42.320> right

in<00:01:59.719> to<00:01:59.840> hit<00:01:59.960> that<00:02:00.140> nail<00:02:00.380> you'll<00:02:00.649> feel<00:02:00.890> like

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
in to hit that nail you'll feel like

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.810 
in to hit that nail you'll feel like
you're<00:02:01.100> going<00:02:01.280> out<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.520> right<00:02:01.759> thing<00:02:02.600> is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
you're going out to the right thing is

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.700 
you're going out to the right thing is
the<00:02:04.820> golf<00:02:05.060> swing<00:02:05.210> forms<00:02:05.719> an<00:02:05.899> arc<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.469> club

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
the golf swing forms an arc and the club

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.340 
the golf swing forms an arc and the club
is<00:02:06.890> going<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.130> continue<00:02:07.460> around<00:02:07.729> its<00:02:08.149> arc<00:02:08.360> so

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
is going to continue around its arc so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.619 
is going to continue around its arc so
we<00:02:09.500> have<00:02:09.769> to<00:02:09.979> differentiate<00:02:10.579> the<00:02:11.180> difference

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
we have to differentiate the difference

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.740 
we have to differentiate the difference
between<00:02:12.050> static<00:02:12.800> thinking<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.750> dynamic

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
between static thinking and dynamic

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.330 
between static thinking and dynamic
thinking<00:02:15.140> right<00:02:15.760> so

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
thinking right so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.600 
thinking right so
the<00:02:17.550> golf<00:02:17.849> swing<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.920> dynamic<00:02:19.920> motion<00:02:20.489> it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
the golf swing is a dynamic motion it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.780 
the golf swing is a dynamic motion it
isn't<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.239> static<00:02:21.690> motion<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:23.069> cannot<00:02:23.430> allow

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
isn't a static motion you cannot allow

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.449 
isn't a static motion you cannot allow
yourself<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:24.540> become<00:02:24.690> static<00:02:25.290> when<00:02:26.160> you're

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
yourself to become static when you're

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.059 
yourself to become static when you're
addressing<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.420> golf<00:02:27.750> ball<00:02:28.050> when<00:02:28.920> you're

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
addressing the golf ball when you're

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.800 
addressing the golf ball when you're
addressing<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.550> golf<00:02:29.849> ball<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.660> are

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
addressing the golf ball you are

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.140 
addressing the golf ball you are
basically<00:02:31.560> already<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:32.520> your<00:02:32.730> perpetual

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
basically already in your perpetual

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.830 
basically already in your perpetual
motion<00:02:33.780> drill<00:02:34.080> back<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.459> through<00:02:36.330> letting

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
motion drill back and through letting

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.500 
motion drill back and through letting
the<00:02:36.989> arms<00:02:37.200> fall<00:02:37.530> in<00:02:37.769> each<00:02:37.860> direction<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.450> you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the arms fall in each direction so you

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.160 
the arms fall in each direction so you
notice<00:02:39.870> how<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.349> forms<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:41.040> wonderful

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
notice how that forms a wonderful

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.890 
notice how that forms a wonderful
elliptical<00:02:43.170> arc<00:02:43.500> oval<00:02:44.430> arc<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:45.690> both

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
elliptical arc oval arc in both

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.380 
elliptical arc oval arc in both
directions<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:47.459> when<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.670> address<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> ball

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
directions so when I address the ball

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.000 
directions so when I address the ball
now<00:02:48.630> what's<00:02:48.900> really<00:02:49.170> important<00:02:49.680> when<00:02:49.799> you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
now what's really important when you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.229 
now what's really important when you
when<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.610> perform<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:52.040> eyes<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.610> stay<00:02:53.970> on
