really<00:02:58.350> cool<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.280> right<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.459> I've<00:02:59.820> got<00:02:59.850> our

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
really cool so right here I've got our

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.760 
really cool so right here I've got our
little<00:03:00.420> pickaxe<00:03:00.870> go<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.230> we've<00:03:01.320> got<00:03:01.500> two

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
little pickaxe go and we've got two

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.350 
little pickaxe go and we've got two
sticks<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.310> then<00:03:02.640> three<00:03:02.850> planks<00:03:03.060> going

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
sticks and then three planks going

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.210 
sticks and then three planks going
across<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.690> top<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.350> this<00:03:04.500> pretty<00:03:04.770> much<00:03:04.890> acts

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
across the top so this pretty much acts

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.370 
across the top so this pretty much acts
as<00:03:05.490> your<00:03:05.520> regular<00:03:06.000> working<00:03:06.420> bench<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.260> can

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
as your regular working bench so you can

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.110 
as your regular working bench so you can
see<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.680> we've<00:03:07.800> got<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.190> our<00:03:08.430> three<00:03:08.940> by

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
like any other normal crafting bench and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.699 
like any other normal crafting bench and
then<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.720> guys<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:27.900> kind<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.290> put<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
then you guys just kind of put in the

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.440 
then you guys just kind of put in the
necessary<00:03:28.830> items<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.300> like<00:03:30.420> that

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
necessary items like that and like that

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.930 
necessary items like that and like that
and<00:03:30.900> there<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.590> go<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.980> got<00:03:32.010> your<00:03:32.250> pic<00:03:32.400> x<00:03:32.610> so

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
and there you go you got your pic x so

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.880 
and there you go you got your pic x so
that's<00:03:33.090> pretty<00:03:33.239> much<00:03:33.360> how<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.720> works<00:03:33.959> now<00:03:34.860> I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
that's pretty much how that works now I

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.130 
that's pretty much how that works now I
do<00:03:35.130> think<00:03:35.580> there<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.850> some<00:03:36.000> durability<00:03:36.300> also

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
do think there is some durability also

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.600 
do think there is some durability also
along<00:03:37.410> with<00:03:37.470> these<00:03:37.769> crafting<00:03:38.190> pillars<00:03:38.459> so

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
along with these crafting pillars so

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.729 
along with these crafting pillars so
once<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.269> like<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.720> certain<00:03:40.440> number<00:03:40.590> of

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
once you do it like a certain number of

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.680 
once you do it like a certain number of
times<00:03:41.070> they<00:03:41.280> degrade<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.239> kind<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.480> got<00:03:42.600> to

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
times they degrade so you kind of got to

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.910 
times they degrade so you kind of got to
watch<00:03:42.810> out<00:03:42.989> for<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.500> doesn't<00:03:43.739> stay

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
watch out for that so it doesn't stay

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.590 
watch out for that so it doesn't stay
here<00:03:44.160> forever<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.940> nevertheless<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.450> guys

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
here forever but nevertheless you guys

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.789 
here forever but nevertheless you guys
can<00:03:45.720> always<00:03:45.900> craft<00:03:46.140> another<00:03:46.380> one<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.680> I'll

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
can always craft another one and I'll

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.259 
can always craft another one and I'll
show<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:46.980> guys<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.370> crafting<00:03:47.640> recipe<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.180> a

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
show you guys the crafting recipe in a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.449 
show you guys the crafting recipe in a
second<00:03:48.630> but<00:03:49.080> that's<00:03:49.650> pretty<00:03:49.860> much<00:03:50.040> how<00:03:50.250> that

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
second but that's pretty much how that

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.400 
second but that's pretty much how that
works<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.030> last<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:51.630> not<00:03:51.750> least<00:03:51.810> over<00:03:52.200> here

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
works and last but not least over here

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.229 
works and last but not least over here
this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.860> very<00:03:53.040> self-explanatory<00:03:53.549> one

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
this is the very self-explanatory one

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.449 
this is the very self-explanatory one
this<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.900> furnace<00:03:55.320> pillar<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.070> all<00:03:56.340> it

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
this is the furnace pillar and all it

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.670 
this is the furnace pillar and all it
does<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:56.940> guys<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.239> put<00:03:57.450> or<00:03:57.600> into<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.230> like

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
does is you guys can put or into it like

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.820 
does is you guys can put or into it like
so<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.730> starts<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.930> know<00:04:00.959> process<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
so and it starts to you know process the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.039 
so and it starts to you know process the
item<00:04:02.070> in<00:04:02.220> our<00:04:02.459> case<00:04:02.730> iron<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:03.900> got

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
item in our case iron and you just got

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.020 
item in our case iron and you just got
to<00:04:04.080> go<00:04:04.290> ahead<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.680> put<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.100> cool<00:04:05.549> in<00:04:05.700> on<00:04:05.850> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
to go ahead and put a cool in on the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.130 
to go ahead and put a cool in on the
bottom<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.360> fuel<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:06.780> that's<00:04:06.900> pretty<00:04:07.080> much

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
bottom to fuel it so that's pretty much

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.710 
bottom to fuel it so that's pretty much
all<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.459> does<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:08.970> wish<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
all that that one does I wish the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.970 
all that that one does I wish the
animation<00:04:10.170> right<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.440> was<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> little<00:04:10.680> bit

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
animation right here was a little bit

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.650 
animation right here was a little bit
more<00:04:11.130> fancy<00:04:11.580> but<00:04:11.820> I'm<00:04:12.000> sure<00:04:12.239> that's<00:04:12.480> going<00:04:12.570> to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
more fancy but I'm sure that's going to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.240 
more fancy but I'm sure that's going to
be<00:04:12.720> worked<00:04:12.900> out<00:04:13.019> in<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.260> future<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:14.130> other

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
be worked out in the future but other

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.130 
be worked out in the future but other
than<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.459> that's<00:04:14.820> pretty<00:04:15.209> much<00:04:15.330> all<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
than that that's pretty much all the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.870 
than that that's pretty much all the
furnace<00:04:16.410> pillar<00:04:16.620> does<00:04:16.830> now<00:04:17.459> as<00:04:17.609> for<00:04:17.790> the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
furnace pillar does now as for the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.400 
furnace pillar does now as for the

that<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:44.970> think<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.389> would<00:04:45.479> look<00:04:45.569> really<00:04:45.629> cool

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
that I think it would look really cool

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.240 
that I think it would look really cool
if<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.199> just<00:04:46.349> have<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.500> like<00:04:46.740> outside<00:04:47.099> your

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
if you just have that like outside your

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.860 
if you just have that like outside your
house<00:04:47.430> they<00:04:48.090> were<00:04:48.210> just<00:04:48.419> up<00:04:48.569> because<00:04:48.750> they're

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
house they were just up because they're

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.540 
house they were just up because they're
all<00:04:48.990> like<00:04:49.169> twirling<00:04:49.470> at<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.889> same<00:04:50.069> time<00:04:50.310> and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
all like twirling at the same time and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.890 
all like twirling at the same time and
it's<00:04:50.699> just<00:04:50.909> it<00:04:51.030> looks<00:04:51.240> really<00:04:51.539> cool<00:04:51.780> in<00:04:51.870> my

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
it's just it looks really cool in my

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.659 
it's just it looks really cool in my
opinion<00:04:51.990> but<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:52.949> guys<00:04:53.069> can<00:04:53.280> use<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.490> how<00:04:53.610> you
