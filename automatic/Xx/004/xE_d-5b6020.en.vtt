00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.700 
got packaged a man with a new Iron Man
all<00:00:06.960> with<00:00:07.170> you

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710

all with you
it<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:10.080> quantum<00:00:10.650> Walker<00:00:11.540> okay<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.780> love

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
it is the quantum Walker okay I love

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.880 
it is the quantum Walker okay I love
this<00:00:13.349> Morpher<00:00:14.179> um<00:00:15.179> I'm<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.690> huge<00:00:16.109> fan<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.680> love

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
this Morpher um I'm a huge fan I love

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.000 
this Morpher um I'm a huge fan I love
time<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.000> having<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.199> thing<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.800> like

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
time for so having this thing was like

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.470 
time for so having this thing was like
you<00:00:20.220> know<00:00:20.340> pretty<00:00:20.670> awesome<00:00:22.189> alright<00:00:23.189> um<00:00:23.490> again

find<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.050> found<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.710> eBay<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.630> wanted<00:00:27.630> it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
find it I found it on eBay I wanted it

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.009 
find it I found it on eBay I wanted it
in<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.050> was<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.289> 20<00:00:28.859> bucks<00:00:29.689> before<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
in I was like 20 bucks before that

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.840 
in I was like 20 bucks before that
auction<00:00:31.439> though<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> did<00:00:31.980> bid<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
auction though I did bid on what I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.880 
auction though I did bid on what I
thought<00:00:33.120> was<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.719> more<00:00:33.960> providing<00:00:34.410> reality

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
thought was this more providing reality

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.069 
thought was this more providing reality
of<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> controller<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> q-rex<00:00:36.300> so

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
of just the controller for the q-rex so

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.190 
of just the controller for the q-rex so
you<00:00:37.980> know<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.190> was<00:00:38.340> glad<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> lost<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200

normally<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:02.940> Eric<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> quantum<00:01:04.199> rangers

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
normally for Eric the quantum rangers

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.219 
normally for Eric the quantum rangers
more<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.360> yo<00:01:06.360> use<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> voice

more if you just like yo use the voice
control<00:01:07.590> say<00:01:07.799> quantum<00:01:08.280> power<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.880> start<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
control say quantum power and start the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.149 
control say quantum power and start the
sequence<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.710> press<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> button

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so if you more like quantum power okay

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.039 
so if you more like quantum power okay
that's<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.439> light<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.890> also<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.049> these

is the mega battle button

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.130 
is the mega battle button
well<00:01:56.800> laughs<00:01:57.040> if<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:57.850> read<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.420> instructions

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
well laughs if you read the instructions

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.640 
well laughs if you read the instructions
then<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.619> know<00:02:00.510> well<00:02:01.510> I'm<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:02.050> lot<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.380> people

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
then you know well I'm a lot of people

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.650 
then you know well I'm a lot of people
they<00:02:02.800> just<00:02:02.979> press<00:02:03.160> it<00:02:03.430> if<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.270> didn't<00:02:04.510> come

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
they just press it if it didn't come

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.150 
they just press it if it didn't come
with<00:02:04.690> instructions<00:02:04.930> or<00:02:05.680> if<00:02:05.770> he's<00:02:05.890> through

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
with instructions or if he's through

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.400 
with instructions or if he's through
mouthed<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.869> would<00:02:08.110> have<00:02:08.140> with

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
mouthed and all I would have with

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.350 
mouthed and all I would have with
probably<00:02:08.770> this<00:02:09.100> probably<00:02:11.760> most<00:02:12.760> people<00:02:13.150> would

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
probably this probably most people would

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.060 
probably this probably most people would
all<00:02:14.050> they<00:02:14.170> think<00:02:14.230> they<00:02:14.560> would<00:02:14.680> do<00:02:14.800> I'd

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
all they think they would do I'd

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.680 
all they think they would do I'd
probably<00:02:15.370> think<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.850> same<00:02:16.060> if<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.360> had<00:02:16.540> this

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
probably think the same if I had this

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.650 
probably think the same if I had this
when<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.959> was<00:02:16.989> younger<00:02:17.290> but<00:02:18.360> what<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.570> to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
when I was younger but what you have to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.199 
when I was younger but what you have to
do<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.380> press<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:21.250> press<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.910> button

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
do is you press you press this button

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.229 
do is you press you press this button
and<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.840> hold<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.350> I<00:02:23.820> found<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:24.940> out<00:02:25.209> by

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
and you hold it I found that out by

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.100 
and you hold it I found that out by
