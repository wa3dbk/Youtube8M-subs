80 today maybe not quite and this is a
new<00:00:33.469> warning<00:00:34.469> ridge<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.190> set<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:36.200> for

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
new warning ridge that I have set up for

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:52.310 
new warning ridge that I have set up for
the<00:00:37.320> co<00:00:38.160> 16<00:00:46.340> that's<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:48.739> new<00:00:49.739> sail<00:00:50.100> cover<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:52.199> we

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the co 16 that's a new sail cover so we

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380 
the co 16 that's a new sail cover so we
can<00:00:52.440> leave<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> sail<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:53.789> times

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
can leave the sail on at all times

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.580 
can leave the sail on at all times
makes<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.559> faster<00:00:56.600> experience<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:58.379> we're

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
makes it a faster experience when we're

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.759 
makes it a faster experience when we're
getting<00:00:59.280> ready<00:00:59.399> to<00:01:00.199> get<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.690> a

five concrete blocks which constitute
the<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:29.490> anchor<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> works

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
the the anchor so that's how it works
