eavesdropping<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:19.050> then<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> big<00:02:19.709> moment<00:02:20.010> of

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
eavesdropping and then the big moment of

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.979 
eavesdropping and then the big moment of
assassination<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.849> then<00:02:21.030> really<00:02:21.660> fast-paced

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
assassination and then really fast-paced

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.140 
assassination and then really fast-paced
escapes<00:02:22.620> through<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.950> crowd<00:02:23.160> our<00:02:23.640> two<00:02:23.880> main

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
escapes through the crowd our two main

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.660 
escapes through the crowd our two main
game<00:02:24.450> plays<00:02:24.750> which<00:02:25.050> are<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.489> meant<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.550> be

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
game plays which are really meant to be

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.220 
game plays which are really meant to be
next-gen<00:02:27.060> an<00:02:27.180> action-packed<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.840> which<00:02:28.019> we've

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
next-gen an action-packed on which we've

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.250 
next-gen an action-packed on which we've
put<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> lot<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.800> emphasis<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.750> crowd<00:02:30.750> gameplay

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
put a lot of emphasis is crowd gameplay

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.680 
put a lot of emphasis is crowd gameplay
and<00:02:31.530> then<00:02:32.099> free<00:02:32.400> running<00:02:32.640> free<00:02:33.060> running<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.660> I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and then free running free running is I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.699 
and then free running free running is I
don't<00:02:33.989> know<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.140> you've<00:02:34.260> heard<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.590> it's

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
don't know if you've heard of it it's

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.320 
don't know if you've heard of it it's
also<00:02:34.890> called<00:02:35.130> live<00:02:35.340> cool<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.120> basically

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
also called live cool but it's basically

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.910 
also called live cool but it's basically
a<00:02:36.540> trend<00:02:36.810> that's<00:02:36.930> been<00:02:37.050> big<00:02:37.349> in<00:02:37.500> Europe<00:02:37.620> for

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
a trend that's been big in Europe for

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.350 
a trend that's been big in Europe for
the<00:02:38.069> last<00:02:38.220> level<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:38.730> skateboarding

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the last level it's like skateboarding

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.809 
the last level it's like skateboarding
without<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> skateboard<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:41.040> what<00:02:41.670> we've

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
without a skateboard and so what we've

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.660 
without a skateboard and so what we've
recreated<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.600> cities<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.980> are<00:02:44.190> completely

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
recreated is cities that are completely

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.850 
recreated is cities that are completely
interactive<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.750> rule<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.230> anything

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
interactive and the rule is anything

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.250 
interactive and the rule is anything
that<00:02:47.040> sticks<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.489> two<00:02:48.030> inches<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.569> an

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that sticks out two inches is an

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.050 
that sticks out two inches is an
interactive<00:02:49.769> ingredient<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:50.910> basically

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
interactive ingredient and so basically

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.910 
interactive ingredient and so basically
you<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.750> run<00:02:51.900> around<00:02:51.930> completely<00:02:52.650> free

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
you get to run around completely free

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.759 
you get to run around completely free
form<00:02:53.250> using<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.330> buildings<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.230> then<00:02:55.530> also

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
form using the buildings and then also

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.970 
form using the buildings and then also
using<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.370> crowd<00:02:57.170> there's<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.260> little<00:02:58.410> RPG

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
using the crowd there's a little RPG

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.620 
using the crowd there's a little RPG
element<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.549> which<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.209> assassin

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
element to which is that your assassin

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.770 
element to which is that your assassin
does<00:03:00.840> evolve<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:02.310> kind<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.910> level<00:03:03.269> up<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.569> you

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
does evolve you kind of level up and you

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.420 
does evolve you kind of level up and you
can<00:03:03.959> get<00:03:04.110> new<00:03:04.350> cool<00:03:04.590> weapons<00:03:04.980> new<00:03:05.190> cool<00:03:05.400> stuff

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
finding out bits of information from

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.509 
finding out bits of information from
them<00:03:33.810> about<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:34.230> bigger<00:03:34.590> conspiracy<00:03:34.980> that's

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
them about this bigger conspiracy that's

going on

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.440 
going on
so<00:03:37.070> you've<00:03:37.190> got<00:03:37.220> your<00:03:37.370> hidden<00:03:37.640> blade<00:03:37.880> you've

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
so you've got your hidden blade you've

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.870 
so you've got your hidden blade you've
got<00:03:38.690> swords<00:03:39.200> you've<00:03:39.800> got<00:03:40.040> throwing<00:03:40.490> daggers

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
got swords you've got throwing daggers

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.880 
got swords you've got throwing daggers
throwing<00:03:41.240> knives<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.020> basically<00:03:42.470> knives<00:03:42.740> that

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
throwing knives so basically knives that

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.430 
throwing knives so basically knives that
can<00:03:43.340> give<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:43.970> some<00:03:44.150> range<00:03:44.330> weapon<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.960> then

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
can give you some range weapon and then

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.780 
can give you some range weapon and then
and<00:03:45.650> then<00:03:45.980> there's<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.220> whole<00:03:46.400> bunch<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.670> other

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
and then there's a whole bunch of other

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.070 
and then there's a whole bunch of other
different<00:03:47.060> things<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:47.630> get<00:03:47.840> as<00:03:47.960> he

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
different things that you get as he

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.080 
different things that you get as he
level<00:03:48.380> up<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.860> main<00:03:49.070> inspiration<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
level up the main inspiration is the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.480 
level up the main inspiration is the
actual<00:03:50.330> clan<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.810> assassins<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:51.920> historically

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
actual clan of assassins so historically

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.090 
actual clan of assassins so historically
the<00:03:52.880> assassins<00:03:53.420> were<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.960> first<00:03:54.440> assassins

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
the assassins were the first assassins

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.130 
the assassins were the first assassins
so<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.850> know<00:03:55.970> all<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.390> mercenaries<00:03:56.960> that

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
so you know all of the mercenaries that

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.390 
so you know all of the mercenaries that
came<00:03:57.290> after<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.830> stuff<00:03:58.010> like<00:03:58.100> that<00:03:58.160> the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
came after and stuff like that the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.090 
came after and stuff like that the
concept<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.910> political<00:03:59.870> murder

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
concept of political murder

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.140 
concept of political murder
assassination<00:04:01.100> actually<00:04:01.520> came<00:04:01.730> from<00:04:01.760> these

about any potential controversy because

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.180 
about any potential controversy because
it's<00:04:34.790> important<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.240> us<00:04:35.300> to<00:04:35.510> not<00:04:35.800> be<00:04:36.800> taking

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
it's important to us to not be taking

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.710 
it's important to us to not be taking
any<00:04:37.250> sides<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:37.880> not<00:04:38.000> do<00:04:38.150> anything<00:04:38.180> that's

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
any sides and not do anything that's

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.150 
any sides and not do anything that's
offensive<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:39.530> we're<00:04:39.680> sticking<00:04:39.890> to

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
offensive and so we're sticking to

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.240 
offensive and so we're sticking to
historical<00:04:40.700> fact<00:04:41.740> besides<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.860> though

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
historical fact besides that though

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.130 
historical fact besides that though
there's<00:04:43.760> a<00:04:43.850> whole<00:04:44.030> undertone<00:04:44.570> that<00:04:44.780> was<00:04:44.900> going

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
there's a whole undertone that was going

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.860 
there's a whole undertone that was going
on<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.500> we<00:04:45.980> think<00:04:46.280> is<00:04:46.400> relevant<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:47.150> what's

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
on that we think is relevant to what's
