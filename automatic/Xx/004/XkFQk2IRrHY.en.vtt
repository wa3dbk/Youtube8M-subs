00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
a diagonal like that so that when you

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.769 
a diagonal like that so that when you
open<00:00:17.529> it<00:00:17.619> up<00:00:17.830> you<00:00:18.099> can<00:00:18.640> see<00:00:18.880> that<00:00:18.910> is<00:00:19.390> certain

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
open it up you can see that is certain

open it up you can see that is certain
in<00:00:19.900> place<00:00:20.169> and<00:00:20.500> that<00:00:21.039> is<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.369> actual<00:00:21.759> bag<00:00:22.210> part

of<00:00:22.720> it<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.920> it<00:00:24.670> obviously<00:00:25.090> doesn't<00:00:25.630> use<00:00:25.960> much

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
of it and it obviously doesn't use much

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.480

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.609 
two inch binding fabric and that's about
all<00:00:54.580> that<00:00:54.909> was<00:00:55.059> required<00:00:55.180> some<00:00:56.049> it's<00:00:56.350> just<00:00:56.559> a

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:56.619 
all that was required some it's just a

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.729 
all that was required some it's just a
bit<00:00:56.769> different<00:00:57.100> I<00:00:57.220> like<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.670> look<00:00:57.790> of<00:00:57.939> this<00:00:58.119> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
bit different I like the look of this I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.170 
bit different I like the look of this I
began<00:00:59.739> with<00:00:59.949> a<00:01:00.100> three<00:01:00.339> and<00:01:00.430> a<00:01:00.519> half<00:01:00.549> inch<00:01:00.879> strip

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
began with a three and a half inch strip

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.500 
began with a three and a half inch strip
each<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.750> white<00:01:02.080> and<00:01:02.110> yellow<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:03.239> I've<00:01:04.239> shown

each of white and yellow and I've shown

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.080 
each of white and yellow and I've shown
them<00:01:04.540> together<00:01:05.080> along<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.680> length<00:01:05.920> now<00:01:06.760> I've

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
them together along the length now I've

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.120 
them together along the length now I've
cut<00:01:07.750> them<00:01:08.049> in<00:01:08.200> half<00:01:08.229> I've<00:01:08.680> cut<00:01:08.860> off<00:01:09.010> the

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
cut them in half I've cut off the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.279 
cut them in half I've cut off the
salvages<00:01:09.610> from<00:01:09.760> that<00:01:09.939> end<00:01:10.150> folded<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.259> half

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
salvages from that end folded it in half

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.889 
salvages from that end folded it in half
and<00:01:11.740> then<00:01:11.799> cut<00:01:11.859> off<00:01:12.130> them<00:01:12.549> at<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:13.000> fold<00:01:13.270> so

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
and then cut off them at the fold so

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.550 
and then cut off them at the fold so
that<00:01:14.049> I've<00:01:14.170> got<00:01:14.409> two<00:01:14.649> pieces<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.390> equal<00:01:16.390> length

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that I've got two pieces of equal length

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
that I've got two pieces of equal length
now<00:01:17.560> I'm<00:01:17.890> going<00:01:18.189> to<00:01:18.490> sew<00:01:19.479> these<00:01:19.780> two<00:01:20.170> together

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
now I'm going to sew these two together

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.249 
now I'm going to sew these two together
so<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.719> will<00:01:22.929> end<00:01:23.079> up<00:01:23.289> with<00:01:23.320> one<00:01:23.939> strip<00:01:24.939> of

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so that I will end up with one strip of

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.419 
so that I will end up with one strip of
for<00:01:26.259> fabrics<00:01:26.799> cut<00:01:27.609> a<00:01:27.850> rectangle<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:29.429> lining

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
for fabrics cut a rectangle of lining

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.810 
for fabrics cut a rectangle of lining
fabric<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.509> same<00:01:31.869> size<00:01:32.170> as<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.890> striped

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
fabric the same size as the striped

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.550 
fabric the same size as the striped
fabric<00:01:34.030> so<00:01:34.749> it<00:01:34.780> will<00:01:35.020> be<00:01:35.049> 12<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.499> a<00:01:35.530> half

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
fabric so it will be 12 and a half

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.149 
fabric so it will be 12 and a half
inches<00:01:35.920> across<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:37.509> roughly<00:01:38.020> 25<00:01:38.679> inches

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
inches across and a roughly 25 inches

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.830 
inches across and a roughly 25 inches
long<00:01:39.460> but<00:01:39.969> just<00:01:40.240> check<00:01:40.450> with<00:01:40.630> your

long but just check with your

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.389 
long but just check with your
measurements<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.499> depends<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.009> width<00:01:42.280> of

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
measurements it depends on the width of

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.969 
measurements it depends on the width of
fabric<00:01:42.789> you<00:01:42.939> are<00:01:42.999> using<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.630> lay<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.649> lining

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
fabric you are using and lay the lining

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.980 
fabric you are using and lay the lining
fabric<00:01:45.159> down<00:01:45.609> with<00:01:45.909> right<00:01:46.149> side<00:01:46.450> down<00:01:46.719> and

fabric down with right side down and

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.059 
fabric down with right side down and
then<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:48.219> stripey<00:01:49.590> patchwork<00:01:50.590> with<00:01:50.829> right

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
then the stripey patchwork with right

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.830 
then the stripey patchwork with right
side<00:01:51.399> up<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.090> you've<00:01:52.270> got<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.450> two<00:01:52.600> wrong

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
side up so you've got the two wrong

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.739 
side up so you've got the two wrong
sides<00:01:53.139> together<00:01:53.409> there<00:01:54.179> I've<00:01:55.179> shown<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.600> two

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
sides together there I've shown the two

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.809 
sides together there I've shown the two
layers<00:01:55.960> of<00:01:56.109> fabric<00:01:56.319> together<00:01:56.649> along<00:01:57.369> all<00:01:57.670> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.080 
I'm going to do is use my ruler
to<00:02:19.130> cut<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.780> corner<00:02:20.780> off<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.580> will<00:02:22.880> have

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
to cut a corner off so that I will have

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.180 
to cut a corner off so that I will have
one<00:02:23.660> end<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.020> ruler<00:02:24.380> there<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.920> corner

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
one end of the ruler there on the corner

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.410 
one end of the ruler there on the corner
and<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:26.330> other<00:02:26.630> end<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.319> ruler<00:02:28.180> here<00:02:29.180> on

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and the other end of the ruler here on

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.449 
and the other end of the ruler here on
that<00:02:29.660> mark<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.200> now<00:02:30.680> I'm<00:02:30.800> going<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.099> make<00:02:31.280> that

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
that mark and now I'm going to make that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.460 
that mark and now I'm going to make that
cut<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:31.970> then<00:02:32.540> I'll<00:02:32.720> do<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.020> same<00:02:33.050> down<00:02:33.440> here

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
cut and then I'll do the same down here

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.430 
cut and then I'll do the same down here
I'll<00:02:33.890> make<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.099> cut<00:02:34.430> from<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.910> mark<00:02:35.270> across<00:02:35.989> to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
I'll make a cut from that mark across to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.059 
I'll make a cut from that mark across to
this<00:02:36.739> corner<00:02:37.160> I've<00:02:38.060> cut<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.390> two<00:02:39.069> diagonally

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
this corner I've cut the two diagonally

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.280 
this corner I've cut the two diagonally
opposite<00:02:40.430> corners<00:02:40.910> off<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.390> now<00:02:41.810> I'm<00:02:41.989> going

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
opposite corners off and now I'm going

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.720 
opposite corners off and now I'm going
to<00:02:43.000> bind<00:02:44.000> all<00:02:44.450> around<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.620> edge<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.280> main

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
to bind all around the edge of this main

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.800 
to bind all around the edge of this main
shape<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:48.080> now<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:48.580> am<00:02:49.580> going<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.060> use<00:02:50.090> double

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
shape and now I am going to use double

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.720 
shape and now I am going to use double
fold<00:02:50.989> binding<00:02:51.560> although<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.100> perhaps<00:02:52.310> might

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
fold binding although it perhaps might

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.400 
fold binding although it perhaps might
seem<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.030> bit<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.360> overkill<00:02:53.630> given<00:02:54.140> I've<00:02:54.230> only

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
seem a bit of overkill given I've only

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.710 
seem a bit of overkill given I've only
got<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.620> two<00:02:54.890> layers<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.340> fabric<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.910> do<00:02:56.330> think

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
got the two layers of fabric I do think

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.530 
got the two layers of fabric I do think
it<00:02:56.840> will<00:02:56.989> go<00:02:57.170> very<00:02:57.200> stronger<00:02:58.120> binding<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.510> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
it will go very stronger binding to the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.870 
it will go very stronger binding to the
bag<00:02:59.840> or<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.410> binding<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.010> used<00:03:01.280> two<00:03:01.700> inch

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
bag or the binding I used two inch

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.660 
bag or the binding I used two inch
strips<00:03:02.209> of<00:03:02.450> fabric<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:03.170> know<00:03:03.709> these<00:03:04.010> colors<00:03:04.489> may

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
strips of fabric I know these colors may

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.789 
strips of fabric I know these colors may
be<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.850> bit<00:03:05.030> lurid<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:05.720> it's<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.620> it's

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
be a bit lurid but it's so that it's

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.100 
be a bit lurid but it's so that it's
very<00:03:06.950> clear<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.760> exactly<00:03:08.600> what<00:03:08.750> I'm<00:03:08.900> doing

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
very clear to you exactly what I'm doing

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.680 
very clear to you exactly what I'm doing
at<00:03:09.200> each<00:03:09.319> stage<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:10.370> I've<00:03:10.700> from<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.239> folded<00:03:11.569> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
at each stage so I've from a folded the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.300 
at each stage so I've from a folded the
two<00:03:11.810> inch<00:03:11.959> strips<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:12.470> half<00:03:12.680> along<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.130> length

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
two inch strips in half along the length

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.350 
two inch strips in half along the length
and<00:03:13.549> sewn<00:03:14.060> them<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:15.760> outside<00:03:16.760> edge<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.239> the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
and sewn them to the outside edge of the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.250 
and sewn them to the outside edge of the
the<00:03:18.260> bag<00:03:18.440> panel<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.120> next<00:03:20.120> now<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.450> will<00:03:21.019> flip

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
the bag panel and next now I will flip

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.380 
the bag panel and next now I will flip
it<00:03:21.410> over<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.359> so<00:03:23.359> it<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.290> lining<00:03:25.239> when<00:03:26.239> you

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
it over and so it to the lining when you

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.840 
it over and so it to the lining when you
finished<00:03:26.750> answering<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.680> binding<00:03:28.100> on<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
finished answering the binding on to the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.280 
finished answering the binding on to the
back<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:30.100> fabric<00:03:31.100> onto<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.810> bag<00:03:32.810> lining

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
back of the fabric onto the bag lining

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.910 
back of the fabric onto the bag lining
lay<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.160> down<00:03:34.370> with<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.120> right<00:03:35.840> side<00:03:36.200> down<00:03:36.560> so

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
lay it down with the right side down so

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.810 
lay it down with the right side down so
you're<00:03:37.609> looking<00:03:38.510> at<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.870> lining<00:03:39.320> now<00:03:40.070> take

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
you're looking at the lining now take

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.400 
you're looking at the lining now take
the<00:03:41.890> bottom<00:03:42.890> right<00:03:43.430> hand<00:03:43.459> corner<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.420> fold

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
the bottom right hand corner and fold

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.150 
the bottom right hand corner and fold
the<00:03:45.829> whole<00:03:46.010> panel<00:03:46.430> in<00:03:46.609> half<00:03:47.019> so<00:03:48.019> that<00:03:48.200> those

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
the whole panel in half so that those

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.300 
the whole panel in half so that those
two<00:03:49.670> about<00:03:50.660> even<00:03:51.170> with<00:03:51.350> each<00:03:51.500> other<00:03:51.739> those<00:03:52.010> two

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
two about even with each other those two

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.960 
two about even with each other those two
points<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:53.920> think<00:03:54.920> that's<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.220> bit<00:03:55.400> more<00:03:55.519> like<00:03:55.730> it

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
points I think that's a bit more like it

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.050 
points I think that's a bit more like it
and<00:03:56.209> across<00:03:56.540> there<00:03:56.840> right<00:03:57.010> now<00:03:58.010> take<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.760> same

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
and across there right now take the same

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.080 
and across there right now take the same
corner<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.660> fold<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.620> back<00:04:00.799> down<00:04:01.100> again<00:04:01.130> so

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
corner and fold it back down again so

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.410 
corner and fold it back down again so
that<00:04:02.269> it's<00:04:02.420> almost<00:04:02.660> at<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.200> bottom<00:04:03.530> there<00:04:03.769> and

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
that it's almost at the bottom there and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.120 
that it's almost at the bottom there and
that<00:04:05.420> should<00:04:05.780> take<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.260> more<00:04:06.470> or<00:04:06.590> less<00:04:06.769> across

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
that should take you more or less across

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.210 
that should take you more or less across
to<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.459> side<00:04:07.700> there<00:04:08.030> with<00:04:08.269> that<00:04:08.299> corner<00:04:08.930> and

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
to the side there with that corner and

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.870 
to the side there with that corner and
now<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:10.549> can<00:04:10.819> pull<00:04:11.090> down<00:04:11.329> this<00:04:11.780> last<00:04:12.350> corner

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
now you can pull down this last corner

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.190 
now you can pull down this last corner
and<00:04:14.139> there<00:04:15.139> you<00:04:15.260> have<00:04:15.290> your<00:04:15.500> bag<00:04:16.870> I'm<00:04:17.870> sewing

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
and there you have your bag I'm sewing

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.520 
and there you have your bag I'm sewing
up<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.590> site<00:04:18.889> of<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.400> bag<00:04:19.789> using<00:04:20.530> double

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
up the site of the bag using double
