00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
on top okay let's take a look at it in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
on top okay let's take a look at it in
action<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.409> might<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.830> run<00:01:14.460> us<00:01:14.610> through

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
action you might just run us through

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.000 
action you might just run us through
here<00:01:15.210> we're<00:01:15.630> looking<00:01:15.869> at<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> drawing<00:01:16.860> their

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
here we're looking at it drawing their

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.399 
here we're looking at it drawing their
of<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.820> unit<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.780> seem<00:01:18.990> coming<00:01:19.320> in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
of the of the unit you seem coming in

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.170 
of the of the unit you seem coming in
towards<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> light<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.790> see<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
towards the light you can see the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.969 
towards the light you can see the
cylindrical<00:01:21.540> shape<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> unit<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.830> they

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
cylindrical shape of the unit so they

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.680 
cylindrical shape of the unit so they
come<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.909> don't<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.540> there's

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
come in they don't know that there's

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.210 
come in they don't know that there's
water<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.110> bottom<00:01:25.260> of<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.590> tray<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
water at the bottom of the tray with the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
water at the bottom of the tray with the
dishwashing<00:01:26.610> detergent<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.330> breaks<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
dishwashing detergent in it breaks a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
dishwashing detergent in it breaks a
viscosity<00:01:28.530> or<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> tension<00:01:29.400> hit<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
viscosity or the tension hit the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.240 
viscosity or the tension hit the
airstream<00:01:30.900> straighten<00:01:31.409> drown<00:01:31.799> actually

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
airstream straighten drown actually

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.399 
airstream straighten drown actually
drown<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.610> what<00:01:32.700> they've<00:01:32.850> bred<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.229> know

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
drown and what they've bred in you know

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.290 
drown and what they've bred in you know
so<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.100> certainly<00:01:35.700> environmentally

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
so it's certainly environmentally
