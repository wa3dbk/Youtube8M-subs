00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
this box it's in here right now is Brad

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.250 
this box it's in here right now is Brad
Tyson's<00:00:07.259> box<00:00:07.770> for<00:00:08.099> his<00:00:08.250> drag<00:00:08.580> bike<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.780> just

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
Tyson's box for his drag bike I just

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.700 
Tyson's box for his drag bike I just
finished<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.650> up<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:12.360> has<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> wireless<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.530> it

finished it up this has a wireless on it

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.029 
finished it up this has a wireless on it
so<00:00:14.540> we<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:15.900> wireless<00:00:16.260> communication<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
so we can do wireless communication to

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.040 
so we can do wireless communication to
the<00:00:17.220> laptop<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.300> don't<00:00:18.480> need<00:00:18.600> no<00:00:18.630> cable

laptop and the pits while the bikes
going<00:00:29.189> down<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> drag<00:00:29.609> strip<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.720> able<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
going down the drag strip and be able to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
going down the drag strip and be able to
tune<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.320> remotely<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.009> everything<00:00:33.920> let's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
tune it remotely and everything let's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
tune it remotely and everything let's
see<00:00:35.070> how<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.190> works<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.670> turn<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.320 

and<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.170> can<00:01:02.350> see<00:01:02.560> the<00:01:02.610> laptop

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
and you can see the laptop

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:23.730 
and you can see the laptop
we<00:01:05.810> have<00:01:05.930> our<00:01:06.080> wireless<00:01:07.090> transceiver<00:01:08.090> there

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:47.209 

that's<00:01:24.100> pretty<00:01:24.310> pretty<00:01:24.729> much<00:01:24.880> it

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.950 

the<00:01:48.219> transceivers<00:01:48.939> are<00:01:49.119> supposed<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.600> have<00:01:49.780> up

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
the transceivers are supposed to have up

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.239 
the transceivers are supposed to have up
to<00:01:50.170> six<00:01:50.439> miles<00:01:50.770> line<00:01:51.609> of<00:01:51.759> sight<00:01:51.999> range<00:01:53.249> but

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
to six miles line of sight range but

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.120 
to six miles line of sight range but
we'll<00:01:54.609> see<00:01:54.880> how<00:01:54.909> it<00:01:55.149> does<00:01:55.329> in<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.719> pits<00:01:56.130> with

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
we'll see how it does in the pits with

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.849 
we'll see how it does in the pits with
all<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.609> noise<00:01:58.270> from<00:01:58.840> all<00:01:59.079> electronics<00:01:59.740> and

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
all the noise from all electronics and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:00.959 
all the noise from all electronics and
everything<00:02:00.130> going<00:02:00.369> on<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.579> we'll<00:02:00.700> see<00:02:00.850> how

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
everything going on and we'll see how

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.020 
everything going on and we'll see how
well<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.270> works<00:02:01.479> but<00:02:02.429> hopefully<00:02:03.429> this<00:02:03.609> setup

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
well it works but hopefully this setup

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.179 
well it works but hopefully this setup
works<00:02:04.329> good<00:02:05.289> and<00:02:05.530> we<00:02:05.709> don't<00:02:05.890> have<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.069> worry

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
works good and we don't have to worry

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.219 
works good and we don't have to worry
about<00:02:06.280> having<00:02:06.939> palm<00:02:07.240> pilot<00:02:07.569> took<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.929> it<00:02:08.049> or

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
about having palm pilot took to it or

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.650 
about having palm pilot took to it or
cables<00:02:08.709> or<00:02:08.830> anything<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:10.179> can<00:02:10.269> just<00:02:10.390> pull

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
cables or anything you can just pull
