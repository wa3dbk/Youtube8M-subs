00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 and 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.790
 in the code of education we can read 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.980
 this compulsory schooling must at 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.890
 least guarantee each student the means to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.610
 necessary among others the mastery 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.590
 of the French language 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.570
 mastery of the main elements of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 mathematics a humanistic culture and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.050
 scientists allowing the free 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 exercise of citizenship practice 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 at least one foreign language 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.940
 end of quote then we see that the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.220
 ambitions that are officially 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 posted are still pegged and at 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.420
 the republican ideal the right for everyone 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.879
 to access knowledge and the obligation to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.199
 the republic to guarantee this right but 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.800
 in the classrooms the reality is 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.960
 other 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.449
 say that the goals that are 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.350
 posted are simply impossible 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.850
 to reach 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.010
 for many children the right to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.179
 educate and purely formal well 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.070
 sure presents them the knowledge 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.749
 fundamental at school but we do not put 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.820
 not really implement the means that 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.249
 would allow them to acquire them and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.290
 even everything happens as if we were trying 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:07.710
 knowingly to prevent some children 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.850
 to acquire his knowledge first the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.860
 question of the child's rhythms 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.360
 it does not take into account the normal age 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.210
 according to all the specialists of childhood 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.040
 to learn to read is between 3 and 8 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.259
 in gold we impose on everyone 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.090
 to learn to read at six from 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.490
 there we create a category of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.719
 latecomers and in some cases who 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.640
 will be judged as retarded 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.799
 secondly the question of numbers 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 when you put 25 or more students 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.509
 class one mechanically provokes that 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.110
 three four five of them will remain 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.270
 on the tile 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.710
 they will be in a gray area that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.799
 the teacher whatever his 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.070
 motivation and his talent can not 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.229
 consider 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 thirdly the question of programs 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.479
 school they define priorities 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.130
 and exclusions that are a way 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.200
 standardization of approval but 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.539
 would have said pasolini in any case they 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.479
 induce the idea that one must submit 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.549
 to an imposed will from above is no 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.310
 negotiable in this way by these three 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.969
 methods we create determinisms 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.140
 which reinforces the structural 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.560
 cultural social determinisms 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.690
 pre-existing and the rating will 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.820
 transform these determinisms into 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.770
 natural predisposition of everyone who 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.770
 are engraved in the marble of the newsletter 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.250
 school and even the school record of 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.340
 every child 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.379
 there are children more 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.180
 less intelligent more or less good more 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.099
 or less talented they have more or less 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.230
 means more or less more capacity or 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.629
 less talent and all these judgments do not 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.209
 never question the structure that has them 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.160
 products of this kind 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.000
 from the first classes of the school 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.920
 primary school we see that the school aims to 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.810
 stop and even in kindergarten 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.090
 aims to stop children in a 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.060
 intimate and public image 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.739
 likewise it is a pyramid alisation that 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.720
 the school is implementing a 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.450
 hierarchy that reproduces and who 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.400
 reinforces the social hierarchy and 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.500
 who is accustomed to this 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.739
 hierarchy that is customary to students 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.260
 instead that even will occupy and at 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.349
 especially because it's up to them 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.720
 that they will have this place from the outset 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.599
 the school takes charge of assigning to 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.319
 each a place and a class including 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.090
 in the sense of fixed social class and the 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.860
 gridwise orthonormal of the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.510
 classroom and the stress exerted 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.549
 on the body during the phases 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.920
 intellectual learning are at the 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.609
 times symptoms and ways of 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.769
 this operation 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.750
 so my proposals must be reduced 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.609
 drastically the workforce in particular 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.840
 in primary classes and in 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.239
 all the learning phases of a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.440
 new discipline when we are told 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.810
 that we can teach children to 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.349
 read to 25 students per class this is a 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.519
 lie 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:49.010
 eight students per class secondly there 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.230
 must thoroughly review the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.450
 school programs and stop opposing 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 head and hand 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.569
 third, we must abolish all forms 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.069
 labeling crystallization 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.019
 crystallizing skills of a 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.040
 individual at a given moment in other words 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.239
 you have to delete the notes 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.530
 it must be ensured through these measures the 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.630
 opportunity to learn by pleasure 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.250
 to learn in the game the game is a 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.959
 fundamental activity and it's through the 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.049
 game that children learn before 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.269
 discover the school and even the animals in 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.669
 italian old talento at dante by 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.740
 example means desire and well we 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.229
 have all the desires 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.180
 we all have the talents and 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.770
 the school of the republic must guarantee to 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.139
 everyone the opportunity to express and 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:38.949
 to develop the talents he desires and 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:42.879
 new here and if we touch that lock there 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.879
 we blow up a lot of things 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.710
 Yes 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.169
 and
