 for many are the processes by which they spend hours 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.470
 Fruits and vegetables 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.449
 from his record 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.880
 the world until its commercialization 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.739
 the group fomes a 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.769
 design and build custom installations 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.249
 tailored to each client for the perfect treatment - rating and 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.710
 packaging of fruits and vegetables 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.680
 covering all the processes that are carried out from the emptying of the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.240
 Field boxes until packaging 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.160
 going through all the intermediate processes 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.220
 from the control booth we visualize and program all the activity of 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.140
 our classification and faceted line 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.520
 different programs regulate and modify the operation of the compliant line 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.790
 to the needs of the client 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.790
 one hundred percent design and own technology 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.300
 Research and development are fundamental in the group of long distance runners 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.680
 the post-harvest laboratories of electronic optics and engineering etc 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.270
 constantly develop practical solutions to the challenges set day

 the department of engineering can also be engaged 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.550
 fundamentally to the implementation designs of solutions of 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.780
 traceability in fruit and vegetable warehouses although it has other 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.000
 applications like cargo control 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.110
 the control of packaging traceability and girls recalibrate abc city and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.260
 optimization of the process control necessary to obtain systems 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.580
 of quality iso 9002 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.190

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.260
 all the traceability projects carried out by promise are also 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.820
 strong are muscular so the different plots where the

 sonic implantation process 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.959

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.689
 control the infection

 pre-calibrated control of refrigeration chambers 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.639
 control of production sections control of shipments recounted from

 product my selfishness 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.839
 although really the only votes needed to complete the system 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.109
 traceability are fields 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.629
 manage your distribution and label this 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.159
 please the group elections is formed by a set of companies 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.120
 innovative and committed to our customers and the fruit and vegetable sector 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.779
 think of it, integrated systems converge to make the 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.209
 food to the consumer and not conditions with the scams and costs 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.210
 making them more salable 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.480
 and contributing to the rapprochement between the producer and the consumer 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.719
 for installations of any size and for a wide variety of fruits and 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.359
 Forbes age group vegetables we are sure we can offer you the solution 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.979
