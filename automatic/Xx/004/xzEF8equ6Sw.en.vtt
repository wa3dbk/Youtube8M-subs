00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 and we know that on Sundays they were made 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.910
 to rest but eventually it's going to 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.150
 be a time to wake up and have a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.980
 Sunday perfect for me on a Sunday 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 perfect always starts with breakfast 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.080
 I'm fat and almost every Sunday 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.240
 makes pancakes because it's the day that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.810
 we have time to make a breakfast a little 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.810
 more elaborate 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.519
 and it's no secret that we 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.620
 love to sit and eat and talk and 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.149
 offers that it's a super good ritual for 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.460
 start the day already live facilitates 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.960
 accompany pancakes with fruits and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.269
 I feel that it was full although 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.430
 honestly like 30 seconds later I 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.320
 I'm hungry again but the good thing is 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.000
 that after eating again I'm going to 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.370
 stay in bed and sometimes I go back to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.440
 fall asleep because we even 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.079
 Sundays we woke up early and by 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.780
 the custom but a little while later I 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.370
 awake and I like to organize the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.440
 Sundays and I think it's a good 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.300
 opportunity to take that day to do that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.970
 everything is in order to start over 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.380
 the next week and when you do not achieve 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.390
 that things are in perfect order 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.580
 because you know you have no idea where they are going 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.289
 things a good technique or so 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.539
 less what I tend to do is to do 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:18.260
 all to one side and forget pretty much 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.450
 that was there and ready 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.520
 and I know that many love to use the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.770
 comfort domain of relats and for 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.390
 take care of your skin so it's a good 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.100
 opportunity to make a mask 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.410
 facial because you're going to have some time 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.850
 extra and this one that I'm using here is 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.950
 a hydrating mask with a 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.690
 super weird texture and in fact it's 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.640
 transparent and I'm only applying 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.280
 in my face and letting her do her 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.230
 magical effect to take care of my skin and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.300
 moisturize it if something is done 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.980
 Sundays is definitely eating well 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.020
 that I'm eating a blanket 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.820
 while the mask goes into action 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.100
 it's okay I could play with my hair and 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.540
 this happened we can with your hair like 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.270
 He has a mask on his face 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.220
 simply no no and here simply 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.140
 I'm removing and masks but 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.850
 obviously you can use Sunday 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.040
 to do any other ritual of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.510
 beauty that seems necessary and another 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.580
 which I love to do on Sundays 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.280
 is to go to bed to watch movies and eat 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.650
 popcorn or popcorn and this is 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.900
 super simple but super relaxing 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.600
 only to make my body 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.060
 feel calm and have a good time without 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.830
 I was super stressed and for me the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.660
 Popcorn are necessary because they are my 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.590
 favorite snack and the one that I love 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.349
 do is 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.239
 that is comic that is comedy and 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.260
 I usually see her with the fat one 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.120
 corrupt 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.579
 but honestly I think what of 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.189
 true makes a perfect Sunday is 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.750
 spend it with your loved ones and 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.099
 this you can do obviously they read 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.049
 what to have lunch or making a 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.180
 fun activity but you can also 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.400
 be something super simple like at least 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.079
 go walking to a park to see is 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 super relaxing and you can share a 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.470
 extra time that maybe other days of 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.129
 the week you do not have why you're 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.060
 busy with all the obligations 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.190
 obviously each person has his 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.189
 different concept of what a day is 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.329
 perfect and some may decide to have 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.159
 more physical activities like going out to 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.079
 ride a bicycle or maybe you like it more 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.269
 stay home sleeping and not be 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.190
 absolutely nothing but the important thing is 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.379
 that they take this day not only for 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.840
 recharge the batteries so that the rest 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.400
 of the week is the maximum but also 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.560
 to give thanks for doing all this 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.870
 everything you have and all the beauties 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.690
 that they will be able to have throughout the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.000
 next week I hope you have a very 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.000
 happy sunday the best proactive chau
