 hello friends today we will 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.040
 make an origami frog and so for this 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.000
 we need a piece of paper size 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.330
 I took the size of 11 centimeters at 22 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.760
 centimeter remember what happened 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.439
 normal origami frog that the party 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.109
 must be exactly twice as large 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.260
 busy is arranged and so we fold the sheet 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260
 in half 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:58.140
 I add up in this way 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.120
 now put the second 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.180
 Moscow do like this 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.119
 and now he is 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:55.970
 pointed out once again why the middle and 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 we fold 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:29.290
 now this one we fold another 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:29.290
 do the side like this 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.150
 and return one and the second 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.150
 and from the second side we do the same 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.230
 fold again 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.549
 So 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.190
 now like this 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.870
 and the second side 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.200
 now everything is laid out 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:48.459
 and so you make it to them 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.459
 and along the lines we fold this dream 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:04:03.280
 pour in if the lines are well pressed 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.280
 problems with this should not have arisen 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.360
 and do the hind legs 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.719

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:39.560

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.750
 Now we do so that our hat 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:56.310
 the frog on could 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.310
