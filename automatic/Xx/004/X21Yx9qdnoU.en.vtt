at the moment and then this might be the
turning<00:02:20.239> point<00:02:20.299> this<00:02:20.629> might<00:02:20.870> be<00:02:21.019> where<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
turning point this might be where the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.099 
turning point this might be where the
hilum<00:02:22.670> turns<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.390> battle<00:02:23.689> around<00:02:23.870> and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
actually takes the win so let's say if

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.179 
actually takes the win so let's say if
they<00:02:27.049> can<00:02:27.200> do<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:27.439> another<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.099> I'm

to peels aam to keep in flame would get

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.490 
to peels aam to keep in flame would get
alive<00:03:10.489> in<00:03:10.669> the<00:03:10.760> beginning<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.470> he's<00:03:12.470> just

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
alive in the beginning and so he's just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.979 
alive in the beginning and so he's just
as<00:03:12.950> vulnerable<00:03:13.129> as<00:03:13.609> llamas<00:03:13.849> you<00:03:14.690> know<00:03:14.780> when

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
as vulnerable as llamas you know when

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.469 
as vulnerable as llamas you know when
they're<00:03:15.109> out<00:03:15.229> of<00:03:15.260> cooldowns<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.250> SK<00:03:17.000> has<00:03:17.239> got

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:17.479 
they're out of cooldowns so SK has got

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.809 
they're out of cooldowns so SK has got
more<00:03:17.720> burst<00:03:18.109> and<00:03:18.409> if<00:03:19.129> they<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.459> make<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:19.609> quick

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
more burst and if they can make a quick

more burst and if they can make a quick
swap<00:03:20.150> like<00:03:20.419> that<00:03:21.280> they<00:03:22.280> can<00:03:22.430> definitely<00:03:22.609> get<00:03:22.970> a

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
swap like that they can definitely get a
