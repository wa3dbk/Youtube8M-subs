00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
a race it's a challenge about teamwork

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080 
a race it's a challenge about teamwork
and<00:00:10.410> camaraderie<00:00:10.639> most<00:00:11.639> people<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:12.000> it

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
and camaraderie most people do it

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.570 
and camaraderie most people do it
together<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.139> truth<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.590> even<00:00:14.160> if<00:00:14.400> you're

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
together and the truth is even if you're

of tear gas mix that together create a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.650 
of tear gas mix that together create a

short period of time how do you think

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
short period of time how do you think
they<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.910> think<00:02:24.870> they'd<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:25.320> through

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
they do I think they'd get through

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.070 
they do I think they'd get through
they'd<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.160> work<00:02:26.400> together<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:26.940> I'm<00:02:27.270> I'm

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
they'd have to work together but I'm I'm

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.960 
they'd have to work together but I'm I'm
joking<00:02:28.500> aside<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.860> mean<00:02:29.190> most<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.760> them<00:02:29.880> are<00:02:29.940> in

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
joking aside I mean most of them are in

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.460 
joking aside I mean most of them are in
reasonable<00:02:30.180> shape<00:02:30.390> I'm<00:02:30.750> sure<00:02:30.900> they'd<00:02:31.050> be<00:02:31.080> just

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
reasonable shape I'm sure they'd be just

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.780 
reasonable shape I'm sure they'd be just
fine<00:02:31.650> all<00:02:32.100> right<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.370> they<00:02:32.460> would<00:02:32.610> probably

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
fine all right and they would probably

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.730 
fine all right and they would probably
want<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.210> for<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.510> beer<00:02:33.720> at<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> end<00:02:34.140> well
