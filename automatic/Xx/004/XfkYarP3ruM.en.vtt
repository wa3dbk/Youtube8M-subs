00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.430
 not 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.249
 hello there is still one of the most 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.029
 interesting matches of the Champions League and 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.709
 the defendant is real who comes up to 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.909
 this as a historical past 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.409
 but finally the galaxies are not new 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:22.059
 only played composition but that is very 

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.749
 nice risk rooms there are certain 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.460
 problems in the game thomas team times 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.779
 saying that the whole logistics team in 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.149
 including 0 and 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.749
 in principle, everyone understood perfectly 

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:34.140
 that the game will be difficult that the game 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.810
 will be tense 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.640
 on with all of this 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.310
 Bakulev still now again appeared 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.790
 the chances of a championship spain because 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.680
 barcelona 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.280
 on all sorts provided she did 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.730
 possible such an expense and therefore 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.820
 first and they are the champions alone 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.420
 she will begin to dream will be in my opinion 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.460
 very neat but there will be a lot of it 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.440
 struggle and very little risk because 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.450
 Now speaking, we must keep too 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.490
 big matter it's not even a semi final where 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.410
 you can try to jerk 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.050
 forward this is not the very end of the euro season yet 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.650
 there is a match a very important match 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.500
 and very complex and still need to think about how 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.140
 I think it will play the distribution of power 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.600
 one of the key roles so i would 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.220
 put on Hollywood all the same draws in this 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.520
 a meeting that will give opportunities yes 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.660
 Real Madrid to go further but managed 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.310
 meeting I think that there will be a draw both 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.950
 teams will score and I think that someone will 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.420
 as the first as well as in the second half 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.340
 from the real something more scored ball 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.930
 in the second half what will be the first will 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.350
 nobody's mother former cost to be not 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.730
 especially us spectacular but very emotional 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.950
 although the persons team knows how to surprise and 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.470
 sometimes a match 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.420
 expected boring and it turns out funny 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.330
 agree with this me just a little comment in 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.050
 Tobolsk shred specifically for 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.050
 ranking bookmaker
