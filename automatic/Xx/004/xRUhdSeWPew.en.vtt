00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
ago he did a video about an injury

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.910 
ago he did a video about an injury
muscle<00:00:30.689> injury<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.260> whether<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.619> not<00:00:31.710> you

muscle injury and whether or not you
should<00:00:32.130> continue<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> guess<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> first

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
should continue so I guess the first

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.770 
should continue so I guess the first
thing<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.489> ask<00:00:35.730> yourself<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.480> are

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
like Scott explained in that video I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
like Scott explained in that video I
guess<00:00:54.510> we'll<00:00:54.840> we'll<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.710> ahead<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> Scott

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
guess we'll we'll do go ahead and Scott

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.240 
guess we'll we'll do go ahead and Scott
put<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> video<00:00:57.059> right<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
put the video right there and then the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.119 
put the video right there and then the
injury<00:00:59.550> video<00:00:59.910> will<00:01:00.120> stick<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:01.129> so

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
injury video will stick right there so

I guess you can get different sizes but
there's<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.539 
that wide about that long and you can
actually<00:02:14.840> lay<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.349> ground<00:02:15.379> and<00:02:15.920> for

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
actually lay it on the ground and for

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.460 
actually lay it on the ground and for
example<00:02:16.819> if<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.180> was<00:02:17.330> working<00:02:17.480> my<00:02:17.720> chest<00:02:18.019> but<00:02:18.230> I

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
example if I was working my chest but I

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.650 
example if I was working my chest but I
lay<00:02:18.920> down<00:02:19.099> on<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.730> roll<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> over<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
lay down on that and roll it over the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.020 
lay down on that and roll it over the
muscle<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:22.040> helps<00:02:22.400> get

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
muscle and that that helps get

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.619 
muscle and that that helps get
circulation<00:02:23.750> going<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.500> area<00:02:24.920> for<00:02:25.629> free

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
circulation going in that area for free

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.380 
circulation going in that area for free
or<00:02:26.780> exercise<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.400> that's<00:02:28.610> another<00:02:28.879> good<00:02:29.209> way

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
or exercise so that's another good way

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.820 
or exercise so that's another good way
to<00:02:30.099> prep<00:02:31.099> yourself<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.819> guess<00:02:31.879> you<00:02:32.239> will<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:33.319> try

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
to prep yourself I guess you will to try

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.369 
to prep yourself I guess you will to try
to<00:02:33.950> prevent<00:02:34.489> injuries<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.840> are<00:02:39.019> going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.260> end

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
to prevent injuries you are going to end

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.229 
to prevent injuries you are going to end
up<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:39.680> sore<00:02:39.890> muscles<00:02:40.310> regardless<00:02:40.940> if

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
up with sore muscles regardless if

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.930 
up with sore muscles regardless if
you're<00:02:41.569> working<00:02:41.900> out<00:02:42.079> like<00:02:42.260> Scott<00:02:42.560> said<00:02:42.940> and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
when that happens I like to use ice

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.089

know any type of injury that an athlete

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.199 
know any type of injury that an athlete
might<00:03:33.500> get<00:03:33.709> they<00:03:33.919> they<00:03:34.489> put<00:03:34.730> ice<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:35.030> that

might get they they put ice on that
right<00:03:35.419> away<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.799> helps<00:03:37.870> rest<00:03:38.870> and

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
right away so so that helps rest and

right away so so that helps rest and
what<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.340> mean<00:03:40.549> by<00:03:40.609> that<00:03:40.760> is<00:03:41.269> more<00:03:41.630> sleep<00:03:42.109> than

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
what I mean by that is more sleep than

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.839 
what I mean by that is more sleep than
anything<00:03:42.769> making<00:03:43.010> sure<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.400> get<00:03:43.549> enough
