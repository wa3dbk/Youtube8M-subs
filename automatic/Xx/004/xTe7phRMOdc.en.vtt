00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello very good to all kids I am 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.950
 ferox and today we are in our video of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.620
 achievement of resident evil 6 and today is a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.349
 achievement of the ada wong campaign is worth the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 fourth and last campaign and the achievement is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.189
 sneak in what we have to 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.320
 to do is to cross the bridge area 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.669
 of the aircraft carrier without being detected and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 we have to do this in the chapter 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.109
 4 now with a video and pretty good 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.970
 explained because he is afraid of achievement what 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.279
 you're going to see everything pretty much better 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.500
 after moving a little in the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.590
 chapter 4 and others we will raise an elevator 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.840
 we will be here and when we get here 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.399
 we do not talk about that door there is that 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.540
 ok what we have to do is 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.660
 train what to slide it what you see 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.880
 as you know is running with the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.190
 and holding down the time to stay 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.190
 A) Yes 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.829
 we have to leave the ep pressed ie 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.339
 running with the lt if we do not we 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.640
 this will happen, the doll will rise 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:05.190
 we run and if we leave lp pressed 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.130
 slide but if you do not fall down you have to 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.260
 lie down so that for one thing 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.870
 I had shown later 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.870
 we open the door we get this video 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.439
 and we advance good here we do not have to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.460
 slide though here it's not going to be 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.830
 exactly what we need to for 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.270
 later 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.220
 we remember that we have to do this 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.290
 pretty fast it's just like I am 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.909
 doing what I slip is very 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.920
 important because later what 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.930
 we will have to use and it is to slide and 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.090
 stay lying down 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.810
 we continue very important that we do not 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.110
 discover because if they discover us the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.110
 we have screwed 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.710
 and you have to press a to go up 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.990
 I do it super fast 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.750
 we keep moving forward now there's no 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.750
 a lot of trouble is not very difficult or anything 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.270
 we're 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.069
 tell you that then not exactly but 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.430
 they have to discover nowhere in a 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.260
 principle the achievement trophy is like this 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.560
 crosses the bridge area without you 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.209
 detect me 1 a part no doubt the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.640
 more chunga for me so that you do not 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.750
 detect 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.240
 a part that later on they detect me and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.180
 I 'm going to try restarting point of 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.400
 control and appears just appears just a 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.310
 little above and then I did it already 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.640
 it went well but what I say I do not know 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.310
 exactly where you can make the point 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.650
 of control is valid, otherwise you will have to 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.920
 restart the whole mission good 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.320
 we come here we see this enemy that 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.930
 we have to go after him or him 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.610
 we shoot or nothing behind him 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.310
 little by little leaving a distance 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.790
 as you see considerable so that we do not 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.790
 detect 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.750
 very carefully do not approach 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.750
 much 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.210
 and we press the button and now the 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.610
 Key moment 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.860
 we will go down there, there will be a dinner of a 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.540
 video and there is a focus of the ship that is going 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.930
 following then here we will have to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.000
 use running and lying down and here 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.690
 I do not do it well and I shit on everything 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.360
 that it wiggles I stay there and it detects me and 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.530
 the street and I fall in everything I say my mother 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.030
 they are detected 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.950
 I'm going to try restarting point 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.620
 control to see if I know 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.459
 it works we are going to try it as you see 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.110
 control point begins to load and what 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.830
 I do again 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.830
 let's try 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.580
 and that catches me and the little feet and 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.160
 throwing himself back but nothing happens and 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.980
 we are already moving buzzing 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.240
 We stick fast to give to you 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.760
 hits as well as a style on about the 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.129
 ground 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.130
 and we hope to go back to advance 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.680
 we advance 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.500
 and we go running running 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.470
 running around here around here 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.630
 here the mess I go back down there that I 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.820
 ask for the focus 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.979
 and I go up fast, well, we have 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.310
 released now important we stick to 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.259
 the wall with the lt we crouch we take out 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.210
 the bow and we'll have to give it in the 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.009
 head is very important in the head 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.840
 so that he dies in the act because if 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.789
 we give in the chest or in the abdomen or something 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.789
 is going to stick is going to stay through 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:41.180
 water and we have to give it a head 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.180
 we continue advancing 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.190
 we are putting it through this conduit of 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.700
 ventilation we stick a lug and we 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.650
 we lay here to shoot it's worth when 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.810
 pass we give in the head 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.930
 there it is, we recharge fast and in the background 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.650
 comes one more there is and now 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.650
 we continue advancing 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.010
 we advance 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.759
 as I say an achievement that initially 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:21.979
 it seems easy but more general apart 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.240
 of the focus I think the most complicated 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.250
 she 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.810
 because there is a box you have to jump the 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:34.550
 box comes fast good we got the 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:37.840
 Room will leave dinner and assault 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.840
 we continue we turn around 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.710
 and we keep moving forward and it's going to be 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.869
 this is nothing and the easiest 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:51.509
 we go down here there is an enemy we aim now 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:51.509
 and in the head there is 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.610
 we go to the elevator 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.610
 to take us 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:09.879
 and it's already up here, it's going to be a 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:12.759
 of video you have to jump here more 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.919
 high, I do not know where you will have done 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.569
 the checkpoint or now something that 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.639
 but good to try to do it of the pull and 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.110
 it's worth the only part that I tell you will be 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.569
 more complicated of the focus that serves you 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.699
 so nothing remember line favorites and 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:28.319
 we liked it and it 's helped so 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.319
 see you in the next video bye bye
