00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.559
 Today I'm going to teach you how to root the lg l 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.520
 13 400 this channel because he just created it 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:47.150
 recently and will upload some gameplays 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.850
 something of android of games because I will be 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.640
 with the toilet filtres to the best of the call 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.640
 of duty minecraft maybe 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.730
 wow wow war of warcraft too 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.290
 Well, let's go to what I said to 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.470
 rotate on the axis shows 400 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.470
 well 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.980
 this method is to see 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.480
 it's for people who 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.159
 when they use the 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.380
 when they use the spectrum a windows 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.380
 he runs in the file a bat point 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.830
 the antivirus blocks them some 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.810
 files and they do not manage to root it does not 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.200
 different commands come out that do not 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.690
 could create music or something like a folder 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.280
 I do not know what then they found a new 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.700
 version of super one click 1.7 that is 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.910
 It calls rage against the cage and it is 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.130
 very simple we would give to here where 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.030
 says the application I all this what 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.030
 I will put in the description 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.140
 the spectrum here is the one that does not usually 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.550
 work very well a post to much 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.670
 people that did not work and we asked 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.490
 a solution for here the tip and good 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.590
 this is the one that is worth of oneclick super and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.080
 so that we can detect the phone and be able to 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.810
 rootear we will need to have 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.280
 I downloaded the lg I started sweet this one 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.600
 I will also put in the description all 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.600
 this will be the description 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.040
 well then to root first 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.090
 we would open the gpc sweet 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.090
 we wait for him to load 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.300
 Y 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.930
 Well, if I'm going to stop it, it's good and 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.290
 then here I would select mode of 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.090
 connection via usb cable and and we already 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.520
 detect more or less around here the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.090
 mobile would come out here on mobile and when 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.510
 already have it detected 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.580
 and we're going to open the super one click and 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.090
 we would open the application this super 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.470
 one click right click run as 5 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.290
 let's see what if the permits 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.599
 and then this would appear 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.709
 universal in the universal tab we 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:38.670
 appears in route to be root a rut student 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.560
 market to pp is from nate this from reuters 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.810
 to do the normal road to be root I think 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.560
 which is like a more powerful rugby but 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.500
 which is more unstable and already slower than 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.530
 mobile and and root as you can 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.720
 remove the root this if you take it to the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.440
 asad de lg 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.140
 Well, you could enjoy it before 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.790
 take it then if it has happened to you 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.890
 thing in the mobile has broken the screen 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.560
 because they do see it rooted not 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.630
 do and with this after rute eyes and 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.060
 you can take it and this I think is for 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.410
 put in the caps this to do some 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.170
 donation to those who have created this 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.670
 good program is very simple because you 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.680
 would give root 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.120
 and they would start to come out different 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.540
 commands over here 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.540
 Y 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.379
 or it would seem that it is being installed 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.560
 super usera pk creating abusive folders 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:37.720
 something like that and in the end 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.529
 ruth complete 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.149
 and he wins 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:47.229
 to close or finish and they already have it 

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:50.469
 rooted well this has been everything and 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.710
 if you want if you want more tutorials from 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:56.790

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.910
 wow games 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.580
 and well I forgot to root what 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.800
 you have to give rage against the case 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.990
 this is very important because this already 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.720
 he never tried it rage against the case and 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.370
 root and it works for you directly and what 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.420
 that is explained will come out those commands 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.490
