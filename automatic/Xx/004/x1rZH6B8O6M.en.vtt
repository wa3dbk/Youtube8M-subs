something<00:00:30.869> very<00:00:31.140> true<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.560> make<00:00:31.800> them

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
something very true and make them

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.170

bud<00:02:30.440> buzzwords<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:31.310> often<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.330> easy<00:02:32.480> to

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
bud buzzwords so often that it's easy to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.360 
bud buzzwords so often that it's easy to
lose<00:02:32.750> sight<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:33.050> what<00:02:33.410> they<00:02:33.500> actually<00:02:33.680> mean<00:02:33.980> by

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
lose sight of what they actually mean by

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.690 
lose sight of what they actually mean by
why<00:02:34.580> it's<00:02:34.790> important<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:37.220> think<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.550> can

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
why it's important and I think you can

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.130 
why it's important and I think you can
feel<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.000> when<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.450> eat<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.840> know<00:02:38.930> after

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
feel that when you eat you know after

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.920 
feel that when you eat you know after
you<00:02:39.350> eat<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.530> salad<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.460> is<00:02:40.670> totally<00:02:41.480> raw<00:02:41.660> I

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
you eat a salad that is totally raw I

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.360 
you eat a salad that is totally raw I
think<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.200> have<00:02:42.320> so<00:02:42.440> much<00:02:42.560> more<00:02:42.770> energy<00:02:42.830> than

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
think you have so much more energy than

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.270 
think you have so much more energy than
after<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.850> eat<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.330> cooked<00:02:44.810> meal<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.350> right<00:02:45.590> um

after you eat a cooked meal all right um

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.790 
after you eat a cooked meal all right um
and<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.030> third<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.630> cup<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:48.050> coconut

and this is a third of a cup of coconut

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.090 
and this is a third of a cup of coconut
oil<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.790> raw<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.360> unprocessed<00:02:51.140> it

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
oil this is raw and unprocessed it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.420 
oil this is raw and unprocessed it
actually<00:02:52.490> comes<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.410> solid<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.160> have<00:02:55.310> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
actually comes in a solid so you have to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.890 
actually comes in a solid so you have to
warm<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.760> up<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:55.970> usually<00:02:56.270> put<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.720> cup

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
warm it up I usually put it in a cup

with<00:02:56.959> warm<00:02:57.770> water<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:58.340> tried<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.880> stay<00:02:59.030> away

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
with warm water I tried to stay away

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.240 
with warm water I tried to stay away
from<00:02:59.240> microwaves<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.560> warm<00:03:00.770> water<00:03:00.980> around

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
from microwaves so the warm water around

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.890 
from microwaves so the warm water around
it<00:03:01.490> will<00:03:01.670> liquefy<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.120> how<00:03:02.570> long<00:03:02.720> does<00:03:02.840> that

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
it will liquefy it how long does that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.890 
it will liquefy it how long does that
take<00:03:03.220> not<00:03:04.220> long<00:03:04.490> i<00:03:04.790> usually<00:03:05.209> put<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.690> in<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
take not long i usually put it in the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.570 
take not long i usually put it in the
cup<00:03:06.110> when<00:03:06.290> i<00:03:06.350> first<00:03:06.680> start<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.190> by<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.340> time<00:03:07.400> i

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
cup when i first start and by the time i

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.600 
cup when i first start and by the time i
get<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.060> ingredient<00:03:08.770> 0105<00:03:09.770> fast<00:03:10.130> yeah

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
get to this ingredient 0105 fast yeah

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.420 
get to this ingredient 0105 fast yeah
it's<00:03:10.730> fast<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:12.170> then<00:03:12.350> i<00:03:12.470> do<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.650> half<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.220> cup

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
it's fast and then i do a half of a cup

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.570 
it's fast and then i do a half of a cup
of<00:03:13.700> raw<00:03:14.240> honey<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.690> again<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.410> raw<00:03:16.190> and

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
of raw honey and again this is raw and

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.930 
of raw honey and again this is raw and
not<00:03:17.060> processed<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.930> it's<00:03:18.620> not<00:03:18.920> vegan<00:03:19.340> when

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
not processed and it's not vegan when

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.880 
not processed and it's not vegan when
you<00:03:20.030> hear<00:03:20.150> me<00:03:20.300> mention<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.660> word<00:03:20.840> vegan<00:03:21.530> that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
you hear me mention the word vegan that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.540 
you hear me mention the word vegan that
means<00:03:22.130> no<00:03:23.200> animal<00:03:24.200> products<00:03:24.650> or<00:03:24.830> buy<00:03:25.010> products

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
means no animal products or buy products

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.550 
means no animal products or buy products
so<00:03:25.790> honey<00:03:26.480> is<00:03:26.660> actually<00:03:27.019> an<00:03:27.110> animal

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
so honey is actually an animal

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.220 
so honey is actually an animal
by-product<00:03:28.220> but<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.459> do<00:03:28.610> incorporate<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.600> into

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
by-product but I do incorporate it into
