winter storm warning in effect for heavy

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.370 
winter storm warning in effect for heavy
snow<00:00:08.220> those<00:00:08.910> planning<00:00:09.389> travel<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.019> warned

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
snow those planning travel in the warned

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.410 
snow those planning travel in the warned
area<00:00:10.530> should<00:00:11.040> be<00:00:11.160> prepared<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.700> hazardous

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
area should be prepared for hazardous

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.300 
area should be prepared for hazardous
conditions<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.290> planned<00:00:13.620> accordingly<00:00:19.310> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
conditions and planned accordingly the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.609 
conditions and planned accordingly the
extended<00:00:20.850> column<00:00:21.150> test<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.570> 90<00:00:22.109> centimeters

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
extended column test is 90 centimeters

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.580 
extended column test is 90 centimeters
wide<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.160> 30<00:00:24.029> centimetres<00:00:24.600> deep<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> can

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
wide and 30 centimetres deep so I can

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.070 
wide and 30 centimetres deep so I can
take<00:00:25.710> my<00:00:25.890> probe<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.400> measure<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.789> or<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> also

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
take my probe and measure it or I also

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.139 
take my probe and measure it or I also
have<00:00:29.750> centimeter<00:00:30.750> marks<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.199> my<00:00:31.380> people<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:33.090> I

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
have centimeter marks on my people so I

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.180 
have centimeter marks on my people so I
can<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.450> find<00:00:33.660> 45<00:00:34.200> centimeters<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> double

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
can just find 45 centimeters and double

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.910 
can just find 45 centimeters and double
that<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.020> need<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> take<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.620> apart

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that and I need to take this apart

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:55.910 
that and I need to take this apart
anyway

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.380 

so<00:00:56.920> there's<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.220> couple<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:57.670> ways<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:58.060> I<00:00:58.210> can

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
so there's a couple of ways that I can

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.890 
so there's a couple of ways that I can
cut<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.750> back<00:00:58.960> one<00:00:59.740> way<00:00:59.890> is<00:01:00.040> I<00:01:00.160> can<00:01:00.310> actually

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
cut the back one way is I can actually

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.940 
cut the back one way is I can actually
there's<00:01:01.900> certain<00:01:02.290> ski<00:01:02.500> poles<00:01:02.740> that<00:01:02.830> will

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
there's certain ski poles that will

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.420 
there's certain ski poles that will
actually<00:01:03.220> fit<00:01:03.630> with<00:01:04.630> the<00:01:04.809> snow<00:01:05.080> saw<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.680> can

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
actually fit with the snow saw I can

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
actually fit with the snow saw I can
attach<00:01:06.730> it<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.450> use<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:08.590> other<00:01:08.920> way<00:01:09.250> I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
attach it and use that the other way I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.310 
attach it and use that the other way I
don't<00:01:11.080> have<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:12.480> is<00:01:13.480> uh<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:14.080> can<00:01:14.440> have<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.590> cord

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
don't have that is uh I can have a cord

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280 
don't have that is uh I can have a cord
and<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.440> wouldn't<00:01:17.740> recommend<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.810> wires

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
and I wouldn't recommend these wires

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.880 
and I wouldn't recommend these wires
unless<00:01:21.060> you've<00:01:22.060> got<00:01:22.270> these<00:01:22.510> uh<00:01:22.620> steel<00:01:23.620> and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
unless you've got these uh steel and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.100 
unless you've got these uh steel and
carbon<00:01:24.160> fiber<00:01:24.490> clothes<00:01:24.820> um<00:01:25.210> or<00:01:25.630> just<00:01:25.840> anything

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
carbon fiber clothes um or just anything

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.980 
carbon fiber clothes um or just anything
with<00:01:26.350> not<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.710> carbon<00:01:27.100> fiber<00:01:27.430> throat<00:01:27.990> because

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
with not a carbon fiber throat because

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.940 
with not a carbon fiber throat because
with<00:01:29.410> carbon<00:01:30.040> if<00:01:30.130> i<00:01:30.250> Nick<00:01:30.970> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
with carbon if i Nick it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.390 
with carbon if i Nick it
so<00:01:32.950> with<00:01:33.850> these<00:01:34.110> combo<00:01:35.110> ones<00:01:35.350> are<00:01:36.009> fine<00:01:36.340> or

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
so with these combo ones are fine or

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.060 
so with these combo ones are fine or
with<00:01:36.759> just<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.240> non<00:01:37.900> carbon<00:01:38.380> fiber<00:01:38.590> ones<00:01:38.830> it's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
with just the non carbon fiber ones it's

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.600 
with just the non carbon fiber ones it's
fine

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
fine

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:48.810 
fine
what<00:01:40.300> I<00:01:40.330> do

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.460 

can<00:01:49.820> do<00:01:49.970> this<00:01:50.090> on<00:01:50.240> my<00:01:50.270> own<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:51.080> helped

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
can do this on my own I can have helped

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.280 
can do this on my own I can have helped
since<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:51.860> have<00:01:52.070> helped<00:01:55.270> yeah<00:01:56.270> I<00:01:56.450> just<00:01:56.930> wrap<00:01:57.260> it

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
since I have helped yeah I just wrap it

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.800 
since I have helped yeah I just wrap it
around<00:01:57.700> both<00:01:58.700> roads<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.270> we<00:01:59.330> can<00:01:59.480> hold<00:01:59.660> that

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
around both roads and we can hold that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.250 
around both roads and we can hold that
probe<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.290> place<00:02:02.980> we<00:02:03.980> now<00:02:04.510> just<00:02:05.510> thaw<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.810> back

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
probe in place we now just thaw it back

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.630 
probe in place we now just thaw it back
and<00:02:06.470> forth<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:08.600> these<00:02:08.750> cords<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.500> nights<00:02:09.710> when

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
and forth in these cords and nights when

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.150 
and forth in these cords and nights when
there's<00:02:10.850> any<00:02:11.030> sort<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.300> crust<00:02:11.860> or<00:02:12.860> when

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
there's any sort of crust or when

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160 
there's any sort of crust or when
there's<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.400> harder<00:02:13.940> snow<00:02:16.690> all<00:02:17.690> right

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
there's just harder snow all right

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.560 
there's just harder snow all right
the<00:02:19.130> extended<00:02:19.640> column<00:02:19.910> test<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.240> nice<00:02:20.390> because

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
the extended column test is nice because

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.480 
the extended column test is nice because
it's<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.960> wider<00:02:21.200> car<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.890> can<00:02:22.130> look<00:02:22.280> at

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
it's a wider car so I can look at

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.640 
it's a wider car so I can look at
initiation<00:02:23.480> or<00:02:24.340> how<00:02:25.340> hard<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.470> column<00:02:27.470> to

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
initiation or how hard is this column to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.100 
initiation or how hard is this column to
make<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:28.040> weekly<00:02:28.250> sale<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.690> can<00:02:29.870> look<00:02:30.020> at

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
make a weekly sale and I can look at

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.250 
make a weekly sale and I can look at
propagation<00:02:30.830> meaning<00:02:31.640> if<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.630> make<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.990> fail

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
propagation meaning if I make it fail

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.800 
propagation meaning if I make it fail
will<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.040> profit<00:02:34.220> will<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:34.940> go<00:02:35.090> across<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
will it profit will it go across the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.400 
will it profit will it go across the
column<00:02:36.200> or<00:02:36.520> fluid<00:02:37.520> go<00:02:37.640> across<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.060> stage<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
column or fluid go across the stage and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.690 
column or fluid go across the stage and
some<00:02:39.710> of<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.890> recent<00:02:40.220> research<00:02:40.250> also

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
some of the recent research also

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.150 
some of the recent research also
indicates<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.530> you're<00:02:42.530> more<00:02:42.740> likely<00:02:42.980> to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
indicates that you're more likely to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.400 
indicates that you're more likely to
have<00:02:43.430> failure<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.330> fracture<00:02:44.720> propagate<00:02:45.260> from

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
have failure and fracture propagate from

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.190 
have failure and fracture propagate from
the<00:02:45.560> same<00:02:45.860> side<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.910> fixed<00:02:47.240> size<00:02:47.390> which<00:02:48.110> is

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
the same side to a fixed size which is

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.870 
the same side to a fixed size which is
why<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.410> often<00:02:48.560> see<00:02:48.830> avalanches<00:02:49.400> trigger<00:02:49.640> to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
why you often see avalanches trigger to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.390 
why you often see avalanches trigger to
rock<00:02:50.090> or<00:02:50.510> trigger<00:02:51.320> from<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.650> trees<00:02:51.920> the

shallower<00:02:52.790> spot<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.270> tend<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.600> see<00:02:54.140> poverty

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
shallower spot you tend to see poverty

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.160 
shallower spot you tend to see poverty
versus<00:02:55.880> if<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.150> trigger<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.750> thicker

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.770 
versus if you trigger in the thicker
spot<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:58.489> doesn't<00:02:58.850> necessarily<00:02:58.940> propagate<00:02:59.660> as

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
spot it doesn't necessarily propagate as

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.650 
spot it doesn't necessarily propagate as
well<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.560> again<00:03:01.280> take<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.730> quick<00:03:02.030> step<00:03:02.239> back<00:03:02.450> and

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
well so again take a quick step back and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.540 
well so again take a quick step back and
see<00:03:02.959> if<00:03:03.170> there's<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.470> thinner<00:03:03.800> or<00:03:04.040> thicker<00:03:04.070> side

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
see if there's a thinner or thicker side

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.360 
see if there's a thinner or thicker side
to<00:03:04.730> my<00:03:04.820> slab<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:06.050> this<00:03:06.200> case<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.560> doesn't<00:03:06.770> seem

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
to my slab in this case it doesn't seem

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.240 
to my slab in this case it doesn't seem
like<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.140> can<00:03:09.320> pick<00:03:09.470> either<00:03:09.680> side<00:03:10.040> if

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
like it so I can pick either side if

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.940 
like it so I can pick either side if
there<00:03:10.489> is<00:03:10.760> just<00:03:11.510> go<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.930> thinner<00:03:12.290> side<00:03:12.560> and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
there is just go to the thinner side and

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.160 
there is just go to the thinner side and
then<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> basically<00:03:13.910> view<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.360> compression<00:03:14.780> test

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
then I basically view a compression test

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.350 
then I basically view a compression test
on<00:03:15.730> one<00:03:16.730> side<00:03:16.970> or<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.239> other<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:19.030> 10<00:03:20.030> from<00:03:20.209> the

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
on one side or the other so 10 from the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.760 
on one side or the other so 10 from the
wrist

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.640 

ten<00:03:24.770> from<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.070> elbow<00:03:25.600> we<00:03:26.600> can<00:03:26.750> see<00:03:26.990> it<00:03:27.140> twelve

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
ten from the elbow we can see it twelve

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.370 
ten from the elbow we can see it twelve
I<00:03:27.920> initiated<00:03:28.550> that<00:03:29.450> failure<00:03:29.750> underneath<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
I initiated that failure underneath the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.820 
I initiated that failure underneath the
crust<00:03:30.590> but<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.190> didn't<00:03:31.460> propagate<00:03:31.970> right<00:03:32.960> let

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
crust but it didn't propagate right let

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.430 
crust but it didn't propagate right let
me<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:33.950> keep<00:03:34.220> going<00:03:37.840> now<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:38.990> is<00:03:39.140> starting

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
me just keep going now this is starting

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.750 
me just keep going now this is starting
to<00:03:39.470> interfere<00:03:39.890> with<00:03:39.950> my<00:03:40.100> test<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:40.550> I'll<00:03:40.640> just

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
to interfere with my test so I'll just

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.660 
to interfere with my test so I'll just
move<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.060> out<00:03:41.210> of<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.360> way<00:03:42.310> again<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.400> can<00:03:43.520> see

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
move it out of the way again you can see

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:59.710 
move it out of the way again you can see
it<00:03:43.760> didn't<00:03:44.090> profit<00:03:57.520> now<00:03:58.520> didn't<00:03:58.940> propagate<00:03:59.450> it

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
it didn't profit now didn't propagate it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.500 
it didn't profit now didn't propagate it
didn't<00:03:59.990> initiate<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.650> did<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:01.940> but<00:04:02.360> I'm

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
didn't initiate you did it so but I'm

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.590 
didn't initiate you did it so but I'm
still<00:04:02.840> suspicious<00:04:03.290> about<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:05.180> one<00:04:05.390> thing

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
still suspicious about this so one thing

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.470 
still suspicious about this so one thing
that<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.900> do<00:04:05.960> is<00:04:06.230> just<00:04:06.260> give<00:04:06.710> it<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:06.890> couple<00:04:07.220> extra

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.590 

hard<00:04:11.480> passed<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:12.410> failed<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.640> propagated<00:04:14.360> in

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
hard passed it failed and propagated in

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.229 
hard passed it failed and propagated in
that<00:04:14.810> same<00:04:15.170> tap<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:16.430> what<00:04:16.580> that<00:04:16.730> tells<00:04:17.000> me<00:04:17.120> is

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
that same tap so what that tells me is

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:26.320 
that same tap so what that tells me is
if<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.690> hit<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:17.989> thin<00:04:18.350> spot<00:04:18.650> maybe<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.670> slabs

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.559 

maybe<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.289> slabs<00:04:27.530> on<00:04:27.740> realistic<00:04:28.180> if<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.360> can

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
maybe the slabs on realistic if I can

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.480 
maybe the slabs on realistic if I can
affect<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.229> depth<00:04:30.530> or<00:04:30.740> layer<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.129> we<00:04:31.280> could

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
affect that depth or layer that we could

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.540 
affect that depth or layer that we could
snow<00:04:31.699> they're<00:04:32.139> likely<00:04:33.139> but<00:04:33.919> initiate<00:04:34.430> that

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
snow they're likely but initiate that

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.089 
snow they're likely but initiate that
failure<00:04:34.819> it's<00:04:35.539> gonna<00:04:35.690> propagate<00:04:36.199> across<00:04:39.099> and

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
failure it's gonna propagate across and

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.010 
failure it's gonna propagate across and
that's<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.430> lot<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.120> snow<00:04:41.419> that<00:04:41.720> might<00:04:41.840> move

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
that's a lot of snow that might move

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.640 
that's a lot of snow that might move
down<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:43.400> when<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.580> look<00:04:43.909> at<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:44.210> show<00:04:44.539> pit<00:04:44.810> one

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
down so when I look at this show pit one

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.290 
down so when I look at this show pit one
thing<00:04:45.889> I<00:04:46.039> would<00:04:46.190> say<00:04:46.400> is<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.669> can't<00:04:46.909> make<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.180> the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
thing I would say is I can't make it the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.629 
thing I would say is I can't make it the
see<00:04:47.479> honey<00:04:47.810> if<00:04:48.470> I'm<00:04:48.680> gonna<00:04:48.800> ski<00:04:49.159> this<00:04:49.340> slope

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
see honey if I'm gonna ski this slope

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.800 
see honey if I'm gonna ski this slope
just<00:04:50.919> I'm<00:04:51.919> gonna<00:04:52.129> be<00:04:52.310> looking<00:04:52.759> at<00:04:52.909> is<00:04:53.599> there

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
just I'm gonna be looking at is there

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.180 
just I'm gonna be looking at is there
cracking<00:04:54.139> is<00:04:54.830> there<00:04:55.039> collapsing<00:04:56.800> if<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:57.949> have<00:04:58.159> a

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
cracking is there collapsing if I have a

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.040 
cracking is there collapsing if I have a
chance<00:04:58.520> if<00:04:58.729> I'm<00:04:58.849> efficient<00:04:59.360> I<00:04:59.419> can<00:04:59.569> also<00:04:59.690> dig<00:05:00.020> a

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
chance if I'm efficient I can also dig a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.499 
chance if I'm efficient I can also dig a

couple Center and begin to paint amends

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.969 
couple Center and begin to paint amends
on<00:05:02.659> that<00:05:02.919> but<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.280> bottom<00:05:04.699> line<00:05:05.409> all<00:05:06.409> over<00:05:06.470> the

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.379 
and this weak foundation in the snowpack
tells<00:05:14.030> me<00:05:14.180> I'd<00:05:14.979> because<00:05:15.979> if<00:05:16.460> I<00:05:16.610> can<00:05:17.060> initiate

tells me I'd because if I can initiate

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.900 
tells me I'd because if I can initiate
something
