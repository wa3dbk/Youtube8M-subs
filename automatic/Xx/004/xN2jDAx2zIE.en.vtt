00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.200
 greetings one hour let's do a review 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.200
 quick here 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.180
 of the device here 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.320
 The guys had an idea to track down a motorbike. 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:22.000
 paste collaboratively 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.000
 already the sport motorcycles 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.390
 basically is a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.900
 a tac a bluetooth identifier 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.230
 in combination with the cell phone 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.239
 creates a kind of tracker 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.719
 for the time being the attack is registered in the 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.670
 site by the advanced application to 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.449
 android and iphone 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.510
 and then you're calling the identifier 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:05.199
 bluetooth with a link actually né ô 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:07.479
 ô ô dedicated bluetooth with your bike and 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.149
 it is basically everyone who enters the 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.990
 range of the device through the 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:20.530
 bluetooth which limits to about 10 15 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:22.860
 meters identifies that its dead there 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.140
 provided that the person has an application 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.360
 with the intention of making a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.460
 tracker and collaborative using a 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.170
 very common swarm technique and is 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 distribution of social network invitations 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.770
 for example you have you have oo 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.830
 identifier associated with a device 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:50.020
 in the physical world and this indicator is 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.520
 traceable through everyone who has 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.979
 or 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 the application ie the more people 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:03.259
 have the larger application the chance to 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.319
 device tracking success 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.850
 associated with your motorcycle 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.930
 this is basically it is not a 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:16.220
 common tracker of those who is has gps 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.910
 gsm in cellular technology to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.319
 who saw in the attitude the title of his 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.470
 your crawler 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.530
 it is purely based on 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.260
 running the application but it 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.599
 works as a collaborative crawler 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.370
 and with the advantage of your own 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.519
 report that a motorcycle was 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.500
 be stolen and use your own 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.930
 tracking of the neighboring team since the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.930
 The team is hiding on the bike. 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.180
 has been removed it does not turn on 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.920
 spinning on the bike as common traced 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.650
 so it does not depend on energy 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.129
 but then how does it work well with 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.299
 radio signal and power time 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.799
 enough 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.980
 to aaualg I gave him the device for him 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.370
 transmits via bluetooth or ideli is a 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.370
 interesting idea 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.519
 but that's how ese works when 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.800
 There are a lot of people using when they have a 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.250
 large volume of people using 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.250
 and 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.780
 the event is a cool idea never anyone 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.650
 had thought of that the tracker 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.050
 collaborative and as I believe 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.300
 the guys going to use it is a way 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.060
 interesting is no longer depending on the 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.660
 to pay a monthly fee for a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.650
 tracker operator whose only 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.690
 goal is to keep a gsm chip there and say 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.860
 For you that ravage motorcycle then I played there. 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.240
 search 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.930
 so it's a cool idea and it saves a 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.930
 little bit 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.570
 anyway this is the site team boston no 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.220
 descriptive 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.220
 anyone who wants more information 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.870
 and that's it
