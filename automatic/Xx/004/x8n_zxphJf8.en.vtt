00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.780
 how about friends to be able to fight good 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.050
 Well to complete our videos 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.610
 about the galaxy know 3 because I already 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.230
 we publish the analysis and the book is 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.160
 is coming out and this is the proof of 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.470
 recording 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.210
 first I wanted to show you is this 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.940
 I traveled through the park Spain 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.950
 in Polanco, as you can see if it has 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.190
 a certain movement but in comparison 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.560
 of really how I was walking 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.930
 loading a tripod of 4 kilos the truth 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.370
 It is that it looks pretty good quality 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.850
 image is very good has a very good 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.810
 definition has a pretty contrast 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.820
 adequate and most astounding or 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.190
 correct is that the colors are not 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.480
 too over saturated I think 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.550
 it's even a little better than 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.740
 recording that we made with the s4 the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.629
 approach is very good the autofocus 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.909
 complete was not and using the mode 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.770
 manual and there you can see the 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.020
 stabilization and let's say being 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.060
 quiet and nothing else kicking the team 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.439
 I was not there, there is not very 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.390
 slow so they see difference between 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.890
 this one and the previous one good shots to 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.659
 then I will move a little more 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.550
 fast and it still feels much more 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.070
 fluid the truth is that the 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.650
 Stabilization is 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.630
 it's not so much hardware, but that's very 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.159
 good work the one who does and the most 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.290
 suggestive is that it is two colors that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.720
 are watching there can be increased or 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.979
 decrease in postproduction we say 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 that he does not take he will not do with his 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.660
 homemade videos but it 's a plus 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.460
 nice, well, there we do not have 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.850
 No problem is focusing on that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.619
 little squirrel as it goes down and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.420
 the camera immediately detects 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.850
 movement and focuses on it no no 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.130
 makes a focus and crazy there but we have 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.869
 an approach to an area in motion that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.020
 are the water zones and when going up 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.509
 automatically makes an adjustment and focuses 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.880
 the whole picture there we have a focus on 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.500
 first plane and ten meters away 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.970
 distance when the man and his daughter who 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.369
 They're chasing the poor little friend 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.950
 there you can see it and really also 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.530
 does a very good job and now we're going to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.440
 see the zoom that it makes and that it can reach 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.030
 very useful really are 4x zoom 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.910
 quite adequate where we have the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.230
 orillita how do we zoom in inputs and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.570
 the truth is that it makes an excellent 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.580
 work does not show a loss of 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.330
 too considerable quality that is 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.240
 very very 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.130
 a point in favor of 93 and there finally 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.450
 we have to manual approach that 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.310
 It is also very fast 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.960
 there was selection among the tree 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.030
 back and the length and trunk that was 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.090
 in front of me the truth is that it makes a 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.920
 very very appropriate approach very accurate and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.070
 especially the macro as you can see 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.420
 is high quality now in areas of 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.700
 little lighting here we are talking 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.160
 already of interiors does a good job 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.380
 the perfect colors had let's say light 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.540
 intermediate as 5 o'clock in the afternoon when 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.160
 I won this shot but as you can see 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.410
 does a good job here we already have the 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.760
 nocturnal shots and again the 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.620
 optical stabilizer well it makes a good 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.090
 work although the truth is that he did 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.340
 already causes the image to degrade 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.470
 quite while it has a good a 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.180
 good level of light capture not 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.040
 It is definitely the best of the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.140
 equipment to take pictures for a 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.270
 night video in photographs of 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.340
 pretty good indeed for both video 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.709
 as for peron as for day at night 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.260
 photo the galaxy no 3 is very good and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.540
 he fulfills what he promises and finally we go 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.060
 to the final scene and we have to ping or 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.280
 pda in practically total darkness the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.170
 iso is at maximum up to 1600 and as 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.569
 can see the picture is perfectly 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.819
 well not yet perfectly sharp but if 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.470
 it is very very adequate because this was the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.900
 galaxy friends recording test 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.040
 note I hope you liked this is 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.040
 mobile passion
