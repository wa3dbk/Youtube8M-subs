 one who did wrong pa 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:27.729
 now that I think about it 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:28.709
 he was a man 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.519
 he simply asked me to tell you that they know where you live here have found obvious 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.390
 the tedium who found you is not really understood yet 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.450
 but it's a trap I'm finished now they know that I know 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.379
 and now that they know it, they know that you also know that you know what this means 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.590

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.960
 but it is something to solve 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.089
 I'll have to start from the beginning 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:05.419
 I will have to go back as far as November of 1963 but one day 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.049
 it would change the course of history 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.599
 arrives there 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.509
 if you do it 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.509

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.340
 massive ditches 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.849

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.279
 conclusion 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.180
 It's a thing 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.989
 wonderful to see young people enjoying themselves 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.789

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.849
 vacation we will have to go around a bit 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.690
 according to my new texas tour guide 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.690
 the dallas book store is worth a visit 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.379
 what keeps us in there 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:25.729
 freezing boxes 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.139

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:54.949
 okay then i'm here alone going to jail 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.569
 but I don't think you should go to the city and why I never just have friends 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.479
 but I have a hunch something strange could happen to say 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.430
 baloney 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.960

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:25.800
 nice walk 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.669

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.259
 grab the ice cream and they were queuing up for the culattone ice cream 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.210

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.629
 precisely 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.629

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.999
