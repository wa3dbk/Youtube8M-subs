00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and give you a new color I didn't really

explain<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.079> too<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.620> feel<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
explain it too well I feel like in the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.959 
explain it too well I feel like in the
description<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:44.100> that's<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
description of it but that's kind of the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060 
description of it but that's kind of the
interpretation<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
interpretation that I got for it like I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.369 
interpretation that I got for it like I
looked<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.460> some<00:00:47.670> before<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> afters<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
looked at some before and afters and it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
looked at some before and afters and it
really<00:00:49.620> looked<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.219> completely

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
really looked like it completely

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
really looked like it completely
transformed<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.170> lip<00:00:52.350> shade<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
transformed the lip shade what I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
transformed the lip shade what I
actually<00:00:53.610> find<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.719> does<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.320> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
actually find that this does is it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.119 
actually find that this does is it's
more<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:57.199> not<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.620> pigmented

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
more just like a not very pigmented

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.200 
more just like a not very pigmented

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
all it does you could get like a really

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.660 
all it does you could get like a really
cheap<00:01:18.900> black<00:01:19.409> lipstick<00:01:19.950> somewhere<00:01:20.400> that's

not<00:01:20.850> pigmented<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.930> well<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.770> would

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
not pigmented very well and it would

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 
not pigmented very well and it would
give<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> same<00:01:23.610> exact<00:01:24.240> effect<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
give you the same exact effect so it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.590 
give you the same exact effect so it
didn't<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> thought<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.479> was

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
didn't really do what I thought it was

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.170 
didn't really do what I thought it was
going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.759> doesn't<00:01:30.090> really

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
going to do it kind of it doesn't really

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.350 
going to do it kind of it doesn't really
differentiate<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.470> lip<00:01:31.680> colors<00:01:32.040> either
