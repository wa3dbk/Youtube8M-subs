00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 so hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.670
 a new episode of the theke tutorials yes 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.750
 and today we will do one again 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.490
 new engine and the compassion 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 engine or the internal combustion engine comes 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.420
 but on what ticket you 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 used there are the classic ticket 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.960
 sorry we have the capacity classic and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.920
 sorry for the internal combustion engine in tekken 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.840
 I'm just doing tech envy now so 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.809
 and yes, once in the beginning how 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.850
 power animal that i give it now 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.739
 Just damn I give the forum 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.620
 works now I give that 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.620
 Just give it once 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.989
 Criminals are already there and already 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.020
 Do you have the recipe and need it 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.059
 For this we iron gears piston glass 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 and iron barin what that is you know 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.430
 everything but of course the railway that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.530
 Not everyone knows a micro set 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.149
 I do not think so right now 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 it was equal we have it soon 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.570
 we have it so now it would have to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.720
 actually be perfect now summarizes the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.619
 not wanted to be kidding me 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.750
 micro shot no, it works now 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.700
 iron gear works 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 Just like a stone 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.869
 Gear and four railway stone 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.479
 rad we make from the woodland 894 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.909
 Stone wood to wheel just with sticks 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.799
 So easy is this an upgrade 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.420
 was the gold and diamonds users 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.200
 we need a lot of gold ribbon 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.119
 for gold and 4 diaz for a dia 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.829
 gear once now, of course, I show 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.799
 as in the last two follow 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.960
 already an example of the internal combustion engine 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.060
 the commission is a little bit 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 more complicated than the last time 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 I have something special here 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.409
 The whole thing is going on here 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.689
 redstone still lingers where we have one here 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.780
 You just have a small pump 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.240
 water pumped out through the pipes there 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.239
 by the here you already know that 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.730
 dingsbums carabulut prof 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.050
 the waterproof pipes these here the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.450
 pflastersteine 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.290
 water became and the whole then in two 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.260
 tanks turgut also I have manual 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.430
 just filled where you get the lava 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.250
 have to decide for yourself 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.820
 a combustion is in this case 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.730
 Here we drive with something 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:42.210
 In this case , it must be either 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:43.920
 I need lava for gasoline or oil 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.080
 that showed that very but I am 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.640
 still stupid so he does then pure and 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.920
 So that's what their here with here is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.870
 a temperature gauge so that's not 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.170
 as high as if you steven 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.990
 decisively for too long there or at 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.820
 lets that do not use that up 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.290
 we water as coolant that is then 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.240
 namely that here through the complete 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.430
 the pipe too with redstone engines here 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.730
 driven then the water comes here 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.280
 through and then we drive the youngest 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.110
 sun and then the query you can 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.730
 then drive what you want only 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.040
 very short the engine are there for it 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.020
 to drive devices specifically with it 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.910
 are compatible sees her mind whether 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.790
 which move automatically so 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.090
 if i have a redstone engine here now 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.130
 I have the generation of a savior motor 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.570
 and then put in somewhere 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.130
 of course , just sat down 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.930
 high if I take the approaches here he fits 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.850
 Automatically to the device edge what 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.470
 Nearby so that could be so 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.080
 already recognize it or you read that 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.239
 just ask or ask for that 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.600
 of course in the comments 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.340
 I will then try to answer 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.800
 here is a steam engine in the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.800
 last episode done high exploded high 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.430
 so packs 399 now we do the whole thing 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.190
 let's see how good the query is right now 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.650
 we'll see it right now 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.270
 Of course, first of all, we turn on water 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.490
 and but we do like that then watch times 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.890
 nice as this is so beautiful everything through 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.660
 flows water has ever flowed 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.840
 a longer way that's actually 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.300
 not as bad as we see it fills 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.530
 slowly 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.330
 and of course I can do it manually too 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.100
 making it perhaps this is because 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.990
 I am for example if you then 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.590
 automatically emptied with water exactly 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.950
 the same thing 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.050
 and we already have two here 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.770
 more as you can see it works 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.690
 pretty good 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.030
 we have more and more in there 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.440
 ticket sorry is that feature there what 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.530
 you can open and close at the 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.140
 classic does not go on classic because it 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.430
 is not synonymous with the heat indicator 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.980
 makes it a bit complicated 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.580
 so I can do it now how 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.090
 we see 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:00.340
 she runs and runs and runs and the 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.650
 Krimi starts and right 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.330
 acceptable, I think so or so 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.040
 In the end he is not fast 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.400
 As if I would solar panel now 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.720
 Just put it in a classic box or something like that 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.210
 changes the left there are of course 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.950
 no more ticket sorry you have to 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.960
 then theoretically more of these 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.140
 reinvigorate best just the same 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.330
 by second we see grads rising 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.520
 very nice, although we are very nice with 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.460
 build water if you do so if I 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.280
 1000 degrees will be so if you see mine 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.050
 god soon 1000 degrees makes the raft out 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.020
 because otherwise you flying all capable 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.720
 high and goes well with flutes and s11 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.080
 diamonds worth guess I'll stay that way 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.740
 I do not know right now and 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:49.740
 i want to build this china build after 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.740
 Of course not very fast 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.060
 yes that was actually the 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.070
 You do not have to use an internal combustion engine 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.450
 drive the curry as you said you can 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.430
 do everything possible 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.520
 I wanted to sit that way as an example 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.990
 because it would be a bit stupid 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.980
 they had pumped him now 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.950
 drive 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.790
 although we will pump our stuff that will 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:16.460
 would be a bit illogical because of that 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.990
 I prefer that we do that 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.840
 namely a bit illogical one 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.190
 drive pump to drive the yes only 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.930
 to drive a pump 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.970
 So I'm for the crime 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.440
 decided is not my opinion 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.030
 after all, you can not see them 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.680
 best solution there i would others 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.730
 The small ones come in the 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.070
 next few follow 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.300
 and yes then I would say until the 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.790
 next time you still have questions 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.980
 Just make comments I'm trying 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.140
 answer or if you have desire I 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.550
 try to make tutorial listening and 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.080
 if you liked it would be nice if 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.150
 The men gave me that would make me very 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.170
 looking forward 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.130
 to subscribe would not have to be natural 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.300
 also cool of it fit a consequence of 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.760
 techland wood and from my day in 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.960
 let's play 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.300
 I almost wanted to say that I am 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.680
 the new shuffle lp but he me 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.640
 now again starting with ticket 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:08.390
 light so from day to next time so 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.340
 very briefly again we see it is 1000 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.850
 usually it would have flown high 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.110
 that would have come thanks to the water now 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.570
 we had no water in here 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.410
 that at 1000 degrees exactly now everything 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:23.210
 away this time does not think the water is 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.950
 the difference system must decide 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.280
 none of his coal is in that 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.880
 case 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.840
 He was then flown up without end 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.850
 have been so sad at this 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.050
 do not know how high that goes whether 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.330
 maybe at some point 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:43.540
 sometime also at 1000 which I laugh 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:45.680
 me dead or at least it goes on 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.970
 someday, is the good he 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.490
 the water does not bring anything anymore 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:53.030
 but you can see thanks to the water 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:58.520
 we push the problem longer 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:00.110
 where max speed is one 

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.550
 bad example, there are better 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.629
 Things to do with it 

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.219
 or if you have more of these four 

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:09.029
 Years here still another run there 

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:09.619
 pure and good is well until the 

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:11.489
 next time 

00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:14.179
 I know I have I have a 

00:08:11.489 --> 00:08:14.179
 oh no matter
