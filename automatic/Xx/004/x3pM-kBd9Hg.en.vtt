to<00:03:36.579> Mecca<00:03:37.000> salts<00:03:37.419> I<00:03:37.629> think<00:03:38.139> they're<00:03:38.290> just<00:03:38.319> a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
to Mecca salts I think they're just a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.909 
to Mecca salts I think they're just a
lot<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.859> games<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:39.669> year<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.739> during<00:03:41.739> the

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
gaming season for winter of 2013 I think

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.170 
gaming season for winter of 2013 I think
that<00:03:44.500> all<00:03:44.709> this<00:03:44.889> just<00:03:45.069> gonna<00:03:45.220> push<00:03:45.489> us<00:03:45.519> back<00:03:45.879> to

that all this just gonna push us back to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.599 
that all this just gonna push us back to
just<00:03:46.510> pure<00:03:47.379> gaming<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:48.069> that's<00:03:48.400> what<00:03:48.579> I
