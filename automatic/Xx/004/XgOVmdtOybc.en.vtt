you the story on why it's called a
pigeonhole<00:02:23.780> principle<00:02:24.040> think<00:02:25.040> about<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.340> like

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
pigeonhole principle think about it like

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.470 
pigeonhole principle think about it like
this<00:02:25.520> let's<00:02:26.480> say<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:27.080> an<00:02:27.520> s<00:02:28.520> number<00:02:29.300> of

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
this let's say you have an s number of

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.660 
this let's say you have an s number of
pigeons<00:02:30.080> for<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.860> K<00:02:31.310> number<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.170> cages<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.670> this

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
pigeons for a K number of cages if this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.320 
pigeons for a K number of cages if this
is<00:02:34.910> true<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:36.019> is<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:37.220> there'll<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.700> more

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
is true and it is then there'll be more

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.449 
is true and it is then there'll be more
pigeons<00:02:38.720> or<00:02:39.590> there's<00:02:39.769> going<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.950> be<00:02:40.010> more<00:02:40.310> than

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
pigeons or there's going to be more than

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.420 
pigeons or there's going to be more than
one<00:02:40.670> pigeon<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.480> cage<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.410> if<00:02:42.590> we<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.890> five

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
one pigeon in a cage so if we have five

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.750 
one pigeon in a cage so if we have five
pigeons<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.209> four<00:02:45.019> cages<00:02:45.560> then<00:02:46.160> one<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.610> those

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760
