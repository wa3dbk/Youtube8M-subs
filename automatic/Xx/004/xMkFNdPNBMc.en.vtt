Veritas that comes right through to your
hand<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.770> sensitivity<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.549> incredible<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
hand the sensitivity is incredible and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.120

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
living with this thing and I beat them

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.730 
living with this thing and I beat them
up<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> Veritas<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.290> using<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
up and you know the Veritas is using the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
up and you know the Veritas is using the
new<00:01:47.030> nanotechnology<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
new nanotechnology and really what that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.340 
new nanotechnology and really what that
does<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> gives<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.579> rod<00:01:50.820> strength<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.960> I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
does is it gives this rod strength so I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.190 
does is it gives this rod strength so I
