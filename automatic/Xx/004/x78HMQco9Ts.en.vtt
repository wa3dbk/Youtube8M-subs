 press you colleagues I purchased 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.950
 I think it will be interesting and torn 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.350
 group in contact I have long dreamed of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:25.369
 buy in sudan as for money anyway 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:25.369
 you come therefore now I will show 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:43.879
 additional capacity for putty 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:43.879
 mark 5 maxima 10 not seen 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:10.530
 distant from I did not think it was empty 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:10.530
 sealed what does it mean there means 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.220
 who is engaged in putty from anyone 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.980
 mark 5 mark 5 mark 10 units they know 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.769
 just want to say I'm not going to anyone 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.500
 agitate to buy and say more 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.350
 guys here from our city who have 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.790
 they use ordinary plumbing 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.650
 adapters and very easy to make a bucket 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.959
 with buckets just cut a hole 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.630
 filling putty but here one 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:48.700
 minus the last object that dressed that 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.290
 putty the second floor constantly 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.079
 have to go down on them 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.610
 kneaded following the next batch 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:59.850
 the next one is spending a lot 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.850
 time you can even say that a person 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.910
 90 liters that inside him we are now 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.900
 we'll see 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.970
 already on the design and wheels rubber 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:31.430
 as usual good quality 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:36.320
 I understand this is probably return yes 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.120
 additional long return yes yes yes 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.090
 Look here you see just the capacity is not 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.170
 This is a kakkac floor to the cartridge where the filter 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.880
 rough cleaning 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.350
 not a rough secondary here it is below 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.360
 screwed this return line only with 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.280
 long feed so you can back 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.280
 putty put right there in the bunker 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:22.870
 This here's a stub from there is put 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:22.870
 the pump is necessary it is a brother before I say 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 As usual everything is fine collected 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.979
 only yes he has 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.340
 the price tag is a little off scale but in 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:56.020
 Overall how would I like if in 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.669
 the usual bucket that is mixed in there 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.330
 First, the end is constantly lacking 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.810
 need to interfere 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.789
 It is emptied immediately as you if necessary 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:10.030
 it automatically goes down to the bottom 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.030
 rounded edges 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.980
 here the hole is the difference of this face there 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.840
 is inserted so that we have not only 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.910
 putty from them finishing putty 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.010
 liquid in bags by interesting just 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.350
 put the bag in there, put it in two 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.880
 rollers it turns out squeezing it yes 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:30.360
 are completed but we have now 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.420
 polymer putty by the way note 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.170
 analogue and vetonit lr plus we have Belarus 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:43.240
 and mind 6440 approximate putty very 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:46.410
 good 24 hours they freeze well 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.390
 polished well here is such a purchase 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.090
 to be honest, itâ€™s even worth it 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:56.050
 quite a lot but about this i'm not at all 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:59.110
 sorry because it is time-saving in 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.300
 lifetime that he repulsed 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.960
 some time i need this 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.610
 no doubt speed 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.040
 compactness that is all very fast 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.250
 By the way by bathing it seems to me she should 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.620
 wash normally too because 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.540
 rounded edges are not here if not 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.190
 launches immediately after each job she 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.710
 with putty washed off elementary 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:27.220
 water character and this is the way some 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:29.650
 light metal so good by the way 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:35.200
 plastic for i called not exposed 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:37.710
 ultraviolet but visible so dense 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.710
 enough 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.430
 such a purchase is closing 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.889
 the other side 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:13.560
 there you see a notch round under 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:16.169
 the return will be two engaged workshops 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.330
 lime chalk whitewash 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:21.789
 also poured here as necessary because 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.680
 that when large volumes well, just 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:27.460
 physically will not have time to slando 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.139
 I have enough well here such here pokupochka 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.210
 no longer know what to add if to someone 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:33.760
 something else there will be added write to 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.919
