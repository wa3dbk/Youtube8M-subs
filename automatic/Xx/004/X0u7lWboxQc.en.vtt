00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:27.750
 ban okay okay okay some guys my name is jones 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:38.280
 joaquim cascavel that likes this fashion 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:40.289
 I've talked to here Lamare rudders jones 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.260
 They play basketball here in rattlesnake more than 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:46.949
 had street 3 to 3 and it's a while ago 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 you have difficulty finding a 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:55.289
 ideal ball a ball that meets a ball 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.889
 which is a basketball that is good 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.079
 in my opinion and to use in this type 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.809
 of block in open court that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.950
 there is one that is more abrasive on the court than 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.140
 the floor is not those things 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 she was the first ball that I got 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.400
 was a ball of these traditional zones 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.710
 even a wilson ball such a ball 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.320
 in the area 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.540
 euro zelaya for only the two months 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.430
 this ball here and she has already started to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.250
 wear a lot of wear 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.880
 mainly on the banners on the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.970
 ball that the drawing of the ball began to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.470
 to spend is I stopped using it because I 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.480
 I ended up buying another good one that I 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.910
 I think it's even better than this, but it's a 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.020
 Ball for you that does not want to spend too much 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.120
 money and does not play much 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.210
 I think it's cool the second ball that 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.980
 very cheap and even under twenty 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.100
 nine reals you can find in the 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.220
 stores on the internet is is a good cool ball 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.450
 I like to play with her, but I think 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.700
 that the frequency that I'm playing 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.700
 she was currently using it directly 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.400
 You can exactly see that it's still pretty good. 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.400
 It's already started to wear 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.710
 that it was a another ball I 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.190
 she has bought just four months and 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:27.070
 use is a ball the ball of a nike version 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.170
 lebron james on a ball that is well 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.230
 It's very cool , I have flu. 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.780
 very cool if you still hold the buds well 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.600
 of them are half-emphasized 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.980
 Can you see that the goals are? 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.720
 are result is very cool well highlighted 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.790
 that's why it made the clip easier 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.220
 she's four months her 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.010
 basically lost all this texture 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.430
 the ball they gomes was just as well 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.270
 well spent even in part is very smooth 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.740
 even the store is very well and smooth here 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.070
 in the video it looks even better than 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:07.270
 she is really is the detail looks 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.520
 But she's pretty much lost the 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.890
 balls it what flu but 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.959
 a very good ball the ball is in the range 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.670
 of his fifty reais 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.320
 it's not a ball I bought was 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.810
 Imported, I do not know if we can 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.720
 I buy on the internet I do not think 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.640
 but only what I advise still has a 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.150
 life good because she has a grip 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.060
 very good despite a very rubbery 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.800
 cool 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.760
 robben is good for anyone who wants to buy 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.519
 Which I did not like at all is 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:48.220
 you get a ball of 200 accounts 200 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:51.489
 leather clubs and play on an open court 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.290
 this does not fit here a ball of 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.790
 leather 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.000
 logically it already has a very high time 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.420
 was used primarily in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.060
 asphalt on sidewalk on the sidewalk 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.430
 and it just does not exist. 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.160
 But the ball is horrible to play there. 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.200
 no adhesion or good for 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.239
 anyone who has played here likes to play with 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.940
 color ball on a good court does not have 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.440
 coolest thing is very good 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.250
 playing really now is super comfortable 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.980
 has flu's hot even in a no no 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.830
 there is nothing better else to type 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.540
 of basketball that especially the young to 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.510
 Most people believe that they play in the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.550
 street is or in open courts I do not 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.300
 I advise you in no way to spend 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.540
 money and melt on the floor and 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.570
 quickly the ball that I consider to be 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.490
 the best cost-benefit even though I 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.980
 advise buying'm really not 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.810
 wanting to make soap for anyone but 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.470
 a voice that I 've been seeking for a long time 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.200
 time because my friends have it and already 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.140
 have some time we always go 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.210
 for playing with her because she 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.730
 although this ball is one year old 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.430
 she is still a year and a half old 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:09.090
 The characteristics of her 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:13.800
 It's very good, you still have all of it in one of them. 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:17.280
 you can see that the mark screen that draws 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.800
 boot mayor still a good ball she has 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.080
 the feeling that you're with a ball of 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.200
 leather despite the relationship with a compound 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.430
 rubber stamp on what is written, I am 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.400
 a ball that I have been accompanying 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:34.590
 price price of it is in the 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:37.080
 internet between 39 and 80 reais and is worth 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.900
 very worth for the durability of you 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.730
 use this kind of in this type of 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.750
 block that type of floor 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.690
 It's a ball that came to me or to 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.930
 to use in this video before in that 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.030
 nike tech that is the same model of 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.980
 blue and white I've now shown myself 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.919
 I'll show you the difference. 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.350
 comparing one with the other is that they 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.730
 are really this is the new route 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.880
 will be in store 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.550
 This is where this has been used. 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.140
 emerges and such but you can see that it 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.440
 still presents a lot of 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.919
 feature of the original of the original 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.040
 original 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:20.290
 the two regions but the new 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.540
 after the ball bossa show that is 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.700
 highly recommended cost benefit 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.740
 it's worth it is not the cheapest 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.070
 but it's a ball that will last a lot 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.350
 it has a texture feature 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.020
 very reminiscent of a leather ball 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.940
 you can use it quietly on the street 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.850
 thanks guys, thanks 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.370
 I hope I have healed some 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.470
 given any tips to someone who is 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.200
 looking because I had this doubt and 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.270
 I did not find anything that told me 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.960
 start of the ball with the arm 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.960
 thanks
