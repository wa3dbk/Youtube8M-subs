00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.150
 such and as we again raise 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.640
 theme with the flaming legion so to speak 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.069
 back to basics in the past 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.260
 we also decided to observe in our company 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.090
 these rules are therefore today 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.030

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.230

 employee and he kazeko stas last name 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.730
 which is reminiscent of some Icelandic 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.989
 volcano 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.290

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:30.099
 he want the same and he's here crazy 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.120
 as soon as the shaft was okay no boys 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.519
 canine 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.440
 let's talk better about setting 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.120
 new additions as you can 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.699
 make sure don will act 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.319
 take place in a location called 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.590
 broken islands which one to one 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.970
 resembles draenor itself only a little 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.760
 oblate we just opened some 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.819
 golden ratio perfect view of locations 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.510
 on the left green above gray in the middle 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.280
 yellow 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.379
 but in the end I'm not going 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.590
 work here over and above your salary 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.750
 so I pass the word to the distinguished pseudo 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.109
 Krisu places but which will tell in detail 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.150
 about this story and other things yes thanks 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.310
 thank 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:16.229
 Well, hello everyone I came to tell you 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:19.560
 about don 1 let's slide 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.350
 as you can see from this 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.080
 picture in the new addition we made 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.930
 the world is so small in size that 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.530
 it can fit only one hunchback 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.009
 gul'dan or this no no means 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.500
 picture ok let's go next we 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.410
 added a new heroic class to the game 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.280
 the demon hunter will bring it 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.919
 our game is a little prison romance 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.190
 prisoners in dungeons all in tattoos 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.620
 on the face of the mask and in the hands of sharpening and 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.889
 pulls to sing you here blatnyak but better 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.229
 I'll tell you more about the locations because 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.690
 most of our audience are 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.990
 still Russian-speaking players 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.060
 and they as we know is not easy living now 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.729
 subscription went up to 550 rubles per month 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.280
 we decided to somehow compensate them 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.490
 hard life and therefore added to the game 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.400
 location with birch trees and all sorts of hut me 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.389
 yes it is purely Russian autumn in all its 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.270
 beauty 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:25.050
 even a tree is like a fairy tale 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:30.479
 about the fisherman and the fish in general, we are Russian 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:33.120
 by you again and about find work good 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.220
 before geyskom great thank you very much for 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.830
 the fact that I was so good at delirium 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.169
 need to get down to business now 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.389
 computer games become fashionable to buy 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.449
 all sorts of skins on weapons and so on 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.880
 caseics there and easier she you know here well 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.490
 we have added something similar now with us 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.460
 there will be class weapons that have to 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.070
 knock off skins from all sorts of cases you 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.650
 like it i realize that oldfagi are not 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.020
 understand this innovation and if 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.810
 Robert Dawney was in the hall now 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.820
 the older he would look at 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.520
 me 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.350
 but also believe that we are on the right track 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.780
 Well, that is, not to be unfounded 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.260
 let's take a look at an example here before 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.360
 with your eyes is in fila milorn 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.950
 that sounds certainly not very good 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.670
 like some medicine from the pharmacy 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.920
 Yes, and they look like a thing from hemorrhoids 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:29.270
 but not the essence you can clearly see 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.930
 what beautiful skins and stand out u be 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.420
 from the crowd 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.880
 so pre-order pre-order pre-order 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.490
 then we added another chip 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.860
 class stronghold and this is where i 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.320
 finally each of you will be the most 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.600
 a major member of his class then 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.580
 there is even if you are krivoruky clumsy 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.940
 paladin will take you there with a bang 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.200
 virtual characters blizzard will raise 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.660
 your self-esteem is low on Nepal 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.870
 but also to be remembered at least somehow 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.240
 I'll tell you finally about the most juicy 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.050
 This supplement and class hunter on 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.420
 demons 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.840
 demon hunters can only be 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.970
 night or until the blood elves 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.580
 finally at least someone in this game will 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.770
 play for elves main chip 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.080
 the demon hunter is what he 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.750
 can jump as much as two times 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.720
 in a row that is to make a double jump 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:27.500
 that is, we beat various sucks 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:31.340
 sucks korean marpa see each other jump in 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:34.550
 I also want to note twice 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.920
 which is very well standing on a green background 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.110
 therefore, it is very convenient to cut in 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.840
 some kind of video editor and impose 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:47.240
 some kind of epic background like burning 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:49.190
 bonfires space and so on well apparently I 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.030
 became crazy about it we will 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:56.630
 gradually close our game 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:59.540
 presentation with you is in touch 

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:02.960
 follow and the most important thing is that we have to 

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:07.270
 were say this add-on release date and i 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.270
 I will not tell you her data
