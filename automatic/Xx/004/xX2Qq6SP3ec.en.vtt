00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
week this week has been scary actually

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.790 
week this week has been scary actually
so<00:04:25.539> in<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.659> previous<00:04:26.840> weeks<00:04:27.289> we<00:04:27.469> were<00:04:27.590> growing

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
so in the previous weeks we were growing

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.149 
so in the previous weeks we were growing
like<00:04:28.099> bananas<00:04:28.639> and<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.990> think<00:04:30.409> like<00:04:30.710> this<00:04:30.919> week

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
like bananas and I think like this week

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.450 
like bananas and I think like this week
we<00:04:31.370> kind<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.669> slowed<00:04:31.909> down<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.419> i<00:04:33.280> think<00:04:34.280> i<00:04:34.340> was

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
we kind of slowed down and i think i was

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.189 
we kind of slowed down and i think i was
just<00:04:34.639> like<00:04:34.789> expecting<00:04:35.449> it<00:04:35.629> to<00:04:35.810> like<00:04:36.020> be

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
just like expecting it to like be

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.589 
just like expecting it to like be
continuous<00:04:36.889> but<00:04:37.159> at<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.340> same<00:04:37.550> time<00:04:37.729> i<00:04:38.030> was

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
continuous but at the same time i was

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.899 
continuous but at the same time i was
seen<00:04:38.870> like<00:04:39.110> maybe<00:04:39.349> if<00:04:39.590> it'll<00:04:39.860> go<00:04:40.009> back<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.639> the

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
seen like maybe if it'll go back to the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.080 
seen like maybe if it'll go back to the
way<00:04:41.569> it<00:04:41.750> was<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.110> if<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.710> if<00:04:43.099> it'll<00:04:43.639> ever<00:04:43.759> like

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
way it was and if it if it'll ever like

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.540 
way it was and if it if it'll ever like
slow<00:04:44.360> all<00:04:44.689> the<00:04:44.719> way<00:04:45.110> back<00:04:45.289> down<00:04:45.349> then<00:04:45.860> that

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
slow all the way back down then that

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.670 
slow all the way back down then that
would<00:04:46.669> be<00:04:46.699> sad<00:04:46.939> and<00:04:47.150> scary<00:04:47.419> and<00:04:47.629> i'd<00:04:48.289> be<00:04:48.469> sad

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
it's it's back to where it was last

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.519 
it's it's back to where it was last
month<00:06:03.879> which<00:06:04.879> it<00:06:05.029> would<00:06:05.599> like<00:06:05.870> blew<00:06:06.110> my<00:06:06.289> mind

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529

actually<00:06:06.740> so<00:06:07.250> i<00:06:07.490> shouldn't<00:06:08.029> be<00:06:08.210> scared<00:06:08.270> but<00:06:09.110> I

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
actually so i shouldn't be scared but I

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.990 
actually so i shouldn't be scared but I
was<00:06:09.379> just<00:06:09.529> afraid<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.919> it<00:06:10.219> might<00:06:10.250> like<00:06:10.669> slow

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
was just afraid that it might like slow

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.519 
was just afraid that it might like slow
down<00:06:11.210> all<00:06:11.419> the<00:06:11.569> way<00:06:11.719> and<00:06:11.900> go<00:06:12.050> back<00:06:12.199> to<00:06:12.349> the<00:06:12.439> way

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
down all the way and go back to the way

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.399 
down all the way and go back to the way

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
were stuck at 1600 and write that right

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.730 
were stuck at 1600 and write that right
right<00:06:17.900> now<00:06:18.199> hanging<00:06:18.589> right<00:06:19.279> now<00:06:19.460> we're<00:06:19.699> at

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
right now hanging right now we're at

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.369 
right now hanging right now we're at
9527<00:06:21.740> and<00:06:22.099> we're<00:06:22.759> growing<00:06:23.089> I<00:06:23.719> think<00:06:24.050> like<00:06:24.169> at

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379 
9527 and we're growing I think like at

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.070 
9527 and we're growing I think like at
90<00:06:24.879> subscribers<00:06:25.879> a<00:06:25.909> day<00:06:26.240> before<00:06:26.569> I<00:06:26.810> was<00:06:26.960> like

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
90 subscribers a day before I was like

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.829 
90 subscribers a day before I was like
200<00:06:27.319> almost<00:06:28.009> and<00:06:28.279> it<00:06:28.370> was<00:06:28.460> just<00:06:28.610> crazy<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:29.810> I

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:29.839 
200 almost and it was just crazy so I

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.149 
200 almost and it was just crazy so I
thought<00:06:29.990> we<00:06:30.139> were<00:06:30.259> going<00:06:30.379> to<00:06:30.409> hit<00:06:30.589> 10,000

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
thought we were going to hit 10,000

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.670 
thought we were going to hit 10,000
sooner<00:06:31.460> than<00:06:31.580> expected<00:06:31.759> but<00:06:32.300> it<00:06:33.289> might<00:06:33.469> take<00:06:33.649> a

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
sooner than expected but it might take a

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.159 
sooner than expected but it might take a
little<00:06:33.800> bit<00:06:33.979> longer<00:06:34.159> than<00:06:34.520> that<00:06:34.699> but

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
little bit longer than that but

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.709 
little bit longer than that but
I<00:06:35.460> mean<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.550> don't<00:06:36.729> mind<00:06:36.879> anything<00:06:37.029> as<00:06:37.449> long<00:06:37.479> as

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:37.719 
I mean I don't mind anything as long as

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.989 
I mean I don't mind anything as long as
it<00:06:38.020> doesn't<00:06:38.229> like<00:06:38.529> kill<00:06:38.889> everything<00:06:39.460> that

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:39.999 
it doesn't like kill everything that

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.959 
it doesn't like kill everything that
would<00:06:40.180> be<00:06:40.509> pretty<00:06:40.840> sad<00:06:41.169> i'd<00:06:41.379> be<00:06:41.529> like<00:06:41.969> we're

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:42.969 
would be pretty sad i'd be like we're

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.950 
would be pretty sad i'd be like we're
back<00:06:43.150> to<00:06:43.449> where<00:06:43.599> we<00:06:43.659> were<00:06:43.840> so<00:06:44.710> hopefully
