00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.290 

the<00:00:01.800> biggest<00:00:02.070> advantage<00:00:02.490> I'd<00:00:02.850> say<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.179> earth

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
the biggest advantage I'd say of earth

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.930 
the biggest advantage I'd say of earth
building<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:04.279> that<00:00:05.279> earth<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.700> such<00:00:05.910> a

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
building is that earth is such a

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.299 
building is that earth is such a
ubiquitous<00:00:06.770> material<00:00:08.960> most<00:00:09.960> places<00:00:10.380> that

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
ubiquitous material most places that

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.200 
ubiquitous material most places that
people<00:00:11.670> are<00:00:11.790> building<00:00:12.320> there's<00:00:13.320> earth<00:00:14.210> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
people are building there's earth and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.519 
people are building there's earth and
that's<00:00:15.839> huge<00:00:16.619> that's<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.670> huge<00:00:18.180> huge<00:00:18.720> factor<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
that's huge that's a huge huge factor I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.230 
that's huge that's a huge huge factor I
think<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.740> hard<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.189> people<00:00:23.789> who<00:00:24.060> have

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
think it's hard for people who have

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.679 
think it's hard for people who have
raised<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.840> an<00:00:24.990> industrial<00:00:26.000> society<00:00:27.000> where

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
raised in an industrial society where

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.779 
raised in an industrial society where
energy<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.199> very<00:00:28.500> very<00:00:28.769> cheap<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.189> understand

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
energy is very very cheap to understand

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.770 
energy is very very cheap to understand
the<00:00:30.570> significance<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.349> fact<00:00:31.740> because

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
the significance of that fact because

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.869 
the significance of that fact because
we're<00:00:33.980> used<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.190> thinking<00:00:35.730> nothing<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.469> being

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
we're used to thinking nothing of being

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.060 
we're used to thinking nothing of being

even in wealthy places like the United

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.010 
even in wealthy places like the United
States<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:05.159> learning<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.970> build<00:01:06.450> with

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
States so just learning to build with

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.630 
States so just learning to build with
the<00:01:07.350> stuff<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.330> site<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
the stuff that is there on the site is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.200 
the stuff that is there on the site is
an<00:01:11.640> incredibly<00:01:12.270> valuable<00:01:13.220> thing<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.760> us<00:01:14.970> at

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
an incredibly valuable thing for us at

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
an incredibly valuable thing for us at
this<00:01:15.390> I'd<00:01:15.689> say<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.259> stage<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:17.490> our

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
this I'd say at this stage in our

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.340 
this I'd say at this stage in our
history<00:01:18.060> -<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.659> relearn<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:21.200> there's<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
history - to relearn that there's a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.340 
history - to relearn that there's a
technical<00:01:22.740> aspect<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.549> building<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.060> earth

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
technical aspect to building with earth

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.179 
technical aspect to building with earth
that<00:01:25.350> makes<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:27.180> accessible<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.829> lots<00:01:29.040> of

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that makes it very accessible to lots of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.789 
that makes it very accessible to lots of
people<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> many<00:01:32.220> other<00:01:33.290> technical<00:01:34.290> materials

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
people so many other technical materials

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
people so many other technical materials
that<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.280> better<00:01:35.460> commonly<00:01:36.060> used<00:01:36.299> one

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that are in better commonly used one

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.480 
that are in better commonly used one
that<00:01:36.630> Springs<00:01:37.259> readily<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> mind<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> would

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.289 

require<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.540> more<00:01:43.909> training<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
require a little bit more training and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.580 
require a little bit more training and
technique<00:01:45.899> -<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:48.170> carpentry<00:01:49.170> is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
technique - to get good at carpentry is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.219 
technique - to get good at carpentry is
actually<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.520> its<00:01:50.729> practiced<00:01:51.360> currently

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
actually as as its practiced currently

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.690 
actually as as its practiced currently
and<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.020> Western<00:01:55.380> world<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.399> very

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and in the Western world is a very

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.380 
and in the Western world is a very
technical<00:01:56.969> skills<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.619> craft

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
technical skills and it's a it's a craft

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
technical skills and it's a it's a craft
so<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.689> people<00:02:00.990> take<00:02:01.259> years<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.040> learn<00:02:02.460> how<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so and people take years to learn how to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.289 
so and people take years to learn how to
become<00:02:03.210> good<00:02:03.240> carpenters<00:02:04.939> most<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
become good carpenters most of the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.210 
become good carpenters most of the
earthen<00:02:06.689> building<00:02:07.140> techniques<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.829> so

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
earthen building techniques are so

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.130 
earthen building techniques are so
simple<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:10.050> people<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.739> learn<00:02:11.400> how<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.910> do

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
simple that people can learn how to do

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.580 
simple that people can learn how to do
in<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.350> matter<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.890> hours<00:02:14.280> today's<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.350> then

really<00:04:09.209> when<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.570> need<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.930> heat<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:11.459> the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
really when you need that heat so the

I<00:04:58.950> don't<00:04:59.880> know<00:04:59.970> if<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.120> can<00:05:00.240> see<00:05:00.450> it<00:05:00.510> up<00:05:00.830> right

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
I don't know if you can see it up right

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.200 
I don't know if you can see it up right
here<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.310> picture<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:05.430> wood<00:05:05.880> stove

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
here in this picture the wood stove

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.630 
here in this picture the wood stove
right<00:05:06.540> here<00:05:06.990> is<00:05:07.230> built<00:05:07.560> right<00:05:07.890> up<00:05:07.950> against

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
right here is built right up against

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.810 
right here is built right up against
this<00:05:08.930> surrounding<00:05:09.930> cob<00:05:10.170> bar<00:05:10.460> so<00:05:11.460> when<00:05:11.670> the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
this surrounding cob bar so when the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.590 
this surrounding cob bar so when the
wood<00:05:12.000> stove<00:05:12.300> is<00:05:12.540> going<00:05:13.130> it's<00:05:14.130> releasing<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.360> lot

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
wood stove is going it's releasing a lot

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.350 
wood stove is going it's releasing a lot
of<00:05:15.780> heat<00:05:15.990> through<00:05:16.200> radiation<00:05:17.000> some<00:05:18.000> of<00:05:18.180> which

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
of heat through radiation some of which

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.860 
of heat through radiation some of which
is<00:05:19.280> projecting<00:05:20.280> out<00:05:20.430> into<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.790> room<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.570> warm

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
is projecting out into the room to warm

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.680 
is projecting out into the room to warm
us<00:05:22.110> directly<00:05:22.650> I<00:05:22.980> can<00:05:23.730> feel<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:23.970> lot<00:05:24.270> of<00:05:24.450> heat

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
us directly I can feel a lot of heat

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.960 
us directly I can feel a lot of heat
coming<00:05:24.960> off<00:05:25.230> that<00:05:25.500> stove<00:05:25.770> right<00:05:26.070> now<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.310> me

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
coming off that stove right now to me

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.900 
coming off that stove right now to me
but<00:05:27.750> in<00:05:28.170> addition<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.890> lot<00:05:29.100> of<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.430> he<00:05:29.640> is

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
but in addition a lot of that he is

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.930 
but in addition a lot of that he is
going<00:05:30.180> back<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:30.960> being<00:05:31.920> absorbed<00:05:32.430> into<00:05:32.760> this

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
going back and being absorbed into this

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.630 
going back and being absorbed into this
cob<00:05:33.210> wall<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.440> cob<00:05:34.650> is<00:05:34.860> heating<00:05:35.190> up

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
cob wall and the cob is heating up

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.660 
cob wall and the cob is heating up
so<00:05:36.450> what<00:05:36.600> that<00:05:36.630> means<00:05:36.930> is<00:05:37.260> in<00:05:38.100> an<00:05:38.250> hour

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
so what that means is in an hour

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.110 
so what that means is in an hour
we<00:05:39.150> can<00:05:39.360> stop<00:05:40.050> feeding<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.770> feeding<00:05:41.400> that<00:05:41.610> the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
we can stop feeding the feeding that the

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.110 
we can stop feeding the feeding that the
wood<00:05:42.300> stove<00:05:42.540> if<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:43.050> fire<00:05:43.260> will<00:05:43.560> go<00:05:43.590> out<00:05:44.120> but

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
wood stove if the fire will go out but

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.900 
wood stove if the fire will go out but
then<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.960> cob<00:05:46.230> will<00:05:46.590> be<00:05:46.710> continuing<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.670> heat

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
then the cob will be continuing to heat

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.530 
then the cob will be continuing to heat
the<00:05:48.060> space<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:49.430> that's<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:51.030> principle

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
the space and that's the the principle

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.810 
the space and that's the the principle
that's<00:05:51.720> been<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:52.200> principle<00:05:52.590> has<00:05:52.680> been<00:05:52.820> used

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
that's been that principle has been used

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.870 
that's been that principle has been used
for<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:55.200> know<00:05:55.230> millennia<00:05:55.980> probably

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
for you know millennia probably

particularly in really cold climates

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.960 
particularly in really cold climates
like<00:06:00.260> Scandinavia<00:06:01.430> where<00:06:02.430> there's<00:06:02.670> something

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
like Scandinavia where there's something

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.540 
like Scandinavia where there's something
called<00:06:03.120> a<00:06:04.130> finish<00:06:05.130> stove<00:06:06.260> Germans<00:06:07.260> had<00:06:07.440> a

called a finish stove Germans had a

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.900 
called a finish stove Germans had a

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.180 
similar technique called a capo ofin
Chinese<00:06:11.910> had<00:06:12.180> something<00:06:12.540> called<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:12.840> Kong<00:06:13.190> all

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
Chinese had something called a Kong all

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.750 
Chinese had something called a Kong all
of<00:06:14.430> them<00:06:14.610> are<00:06:14.760> basically<00:06:14.970> very<00:06:15.630> very<00:06:16.110> heavy

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
of them are basically very very heavy

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.290 
of them are basically very very heavy
massive<00:06:17.760> wood<00:06:18.390> burners<00:06:19.050> in<00:06:19.850> which<00:06:20.850> you<00:06:21.060> can

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
massive wood burners in which you can

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.690 
massive wood burners in which you can
make<00:06:21.480> a<00:06:21.540> very<00:06:21.870> hot<00:06:22.230> fire<00:06:22.500> for<00:06:23.040> a<00:06:23.070> short<00:06:23.400> period

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
make a very hot fire for a short period

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.050 
make a very hot fire for a short period
of<00:06:23.820> time<00:06:23.880> heat<00:06:24.720> up<00:06:24.840> all<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.230> mess<00:06:25.470> and<00:06:26.060> then

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
of time heat up all that mess and then

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.630 
of time heat up all that mess and then
have<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.570> heat<00:06:27.810> from<00:06:28.380> that<00:06:28.440> mass<00:06:28.860> continue<00:06:29.490> to

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
have the heat from that mass continue to

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.480 
have the heat from that mass continue to
rip<00:06:29.880> it<00:06:30.210> and<00:06:30.470> heat<00:06:31.470> your<00:06:31.650> space<00:06:31.920> for<00:06:32.190> a<00:06:32.220> period

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
rip it and heat your space for a period

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.910 
rip it and heat your space for a period
of<00:06:32.580> time<00:06:32.760> afterwards<00:06:33.390> it's<00:06:34.110> a<00:06:34.320> much<00:06:34.620> more

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
of time afterwards it's a much more

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.110 
of time afterwards it's a much more
efficient<00:06:35.490> way

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
efficient way

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.480 
efficient way
of<00:06:36.210> using<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:37.110> energy<00:06:37.320> that's<00:06:37.710> released<00:06:38.010> by

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
of using the energy that's released by

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.590 
of using the energy that's released by
the<00:06:38.550> combustion<00:06:39.000> of<00:06:39.300> the<00:06:39.360> wood<00:06:39.889> then<00:06:40.889> of<00:06:41.600> all

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
the combustion of the wood then of all

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.510 
the combustion of the wood then of all
relying<00:06:43.590> entirely<00:06:44.160> on<00:06:45.020> the<00:06:46.020> heythis<00:06:46.520> that's

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
relying entirely on the heythis that's

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.460 
relying entirely on the heythis that's
released<00:06:47.850> at<00:06:48.030> the<00:06:48.180> time<00:06:48.360> of<00:06:48.540> combustion<00:06:48.990> so

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
released at the time of combustion so

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.340 
released at the time of combustion so
again<00:06:49.710> it's<00:06:49.919> using<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:51.270> thermal<00:06:51.570> mass<00:06:51.870> of<00:06:51.900> the

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
again it's using the thermal mass of the

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.790 
again it's using the thermal mass of the
earth<00:06:52.680> as<00:06:52.979> a<00:06:53.150> battery<00:06:54.150> to<00:06:54.870> hold<00:06:55.139> the<00:06:55.320> heat<00:06:55.530> for

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
earth as a battery to hold the heat for

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.729 
earth as a battery to hold the heat for
when<00:06:55.949> you<00:06:56.070> actually<00:06:56.490> need
