00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 and good but 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.279
 They take this issue seriously supposed 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.230
 buy at least some time 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.019
 it seems that it was General Guibovich already 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.450
 I do not remember who exactly by 50 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.929
 helicopters so in the program 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.029
 initial that is medium term because 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.159
 also jaime one thing that has to be said 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.409
 with absolute frankness is that to buy 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.810
 helicopter is not like buying the 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:29.119
 very expensive sack that you use that you are going to 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.739
 the most inclusive store of the magnet and I'll 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:40.490
 shopping you prove it in relation to what 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:42.520
 what you talk about realization is not like 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.590
 buy a sack buy a helicopter 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.200
 implies a programming implies a 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.380
 manufacturing then it's a whole process 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.500
 long what is there to start how much 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.640
 before that's the reason it's also for that reason 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.550
 have made contacts to see the topic 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.200
 related to the purchase of 20 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.069
 helicopters that are extremely 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.900
 necessary but the initial idea is but 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:13.290
 with 20 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.330
 initial only conventions 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.630
 initially because there is also a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.780
 repair program and helicopters 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.780
 that has been boosted in this year's 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.970
 management to date you can not see that you do not know 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.160
 they see those results but there has been a 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.220
 program also repair just 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.400
 get some helicopters that are also going 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.410
 to count how many there will be operatives for 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.010
 this area of 67.6 thuds in hearts 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.020
 would prefer not to mention the 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.760
 amount of helicopters that good but 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.650
 what you can say well is already 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.140
 enough is a starting point 20 or 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.170
 I would say we would need at least 50 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.940
 but on the 20th and when these would be 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.920
 ready you have to send it to factories 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.680
 just do not air you have to send it to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.300
 manufacture in any case there is a group that 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.810
 An emergency situation also 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 think to see the mechanism so they can 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.480
 be used 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.640
 we are in talks with the us and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.740
 ask own 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.330
 crazy but second hand that 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.740
 they are probably canceling but that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.020
 for Peru are first we have 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.600
 conversed with the defense secretary 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.580
 Panetta to see the possibility that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.370
 some of the helicopters that are 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.920
 used in Peru for combat with 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.980
 drug trafficking can be employed 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.260
 because the concrete jaime here is a 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.100
 sinister alliance between terrorism and 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.500
 drug trafficking 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.480
 then there could be a 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.240
 flexibilization on behalf of the government of 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.210
 us so that part of those helicopters 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.820
 destined to fight 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.560
 in one against the drug trafficking they can be 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.310
 employees but those are the cut of 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.110
 but transport but also 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.650
 They need transport aircraft 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.780
 agreement the situation of the air force 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.050
 in general for this area it is extremely 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.940
 complicated that is the logistics that 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.590
 implies personal transportation food is 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.740
 complicated and additionally required 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.220
 to helicopters airplanes in state 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.490
 Optimal Colombian can lend us for 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.800
 temporarily good the idea is to request 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.510
 also this kind of meetings have 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.900
 served to request cooperation 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.750
 technique we are not doing all the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.780
 possible efforts to face the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.040
 problem with the limitations of the case 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.989
 but 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.989
 the effort is being made for another
