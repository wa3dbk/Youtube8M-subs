you

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.020 

we're<00:00:09.710> confident<00:00:10.040> we've<00:00:10.190> implemented<00:00:10.550> the

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
we're confident we've implemented the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.850 
we're confident we've implemented the
most<00:00:11.480> complicated<00:00:11.810> weather<00:00:12.320> system<00:00:12.680> ever

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
most complicated weather system ever

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.210 
most complicated weather system ever
seen<00:00:13.040> in<00:00:13.130> the<00:00:13.190> racing<00:00:13.370> game

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.589 

we've<00:00:20.220> got<00:00:20.460> basically<00:00:21.060> three<00:00:21.300> key<00:00:21.449> components

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
we've got basically three key components

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.659 
we've got basically three key components
that<00:00:22.050> make<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.740> weather<00:00:22.890> system<00:00:23.310> there's

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
that make up the weather system there's

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.130 
that make up the weather system there's
the<00:00:23.789> visual<00:00:24.000> effects<00:00:24.329> so<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> dry<00:00:24.960> it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the visual effects so in the dry it's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.859 
the visual effects so in the dry it's
the<00:00:25.320> iconic<00:00:25.650> details<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:27.239> the<00:00:27.360> way<00:00:27.509> it's<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the iconic details in the way it's the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.510 
the iconic details in the way it's the
visual<00:00:28.169> effects<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> camera<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> cars

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
visual effects on the camera on the cars

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.159

tie<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.950> track<00:00:41.160> simulation<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
tie into the track simulation so in the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.700 
tie into the track simulation so in the
drive<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.870> example<00:00:43.260> we're<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> start

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
drive for example we're going to start

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350 
drive for example we're going to start
off<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> green<00:00:44.579> track<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.210> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
off with it with a green track so it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
off with it with a green track so it
basically<00:00:45.629> got<00:00:45.960> no<00:00:46.110> grip<00:00:46.320> levels<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.040> as<00:00:47.220> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
basically got no grip levels and as the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520 
basically got no grip levels and as the
sessions<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.720> grip<00:00:48.870> levels<00:00:49.170> build<00:00:49.350> up

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
sessions of all the grip levels build up

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
sessions of all the grip levels build up
see<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> lot<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> times<00:00:50.130> get<00:00:50.310> faster<00:00:50.790> marbles

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
see a lot of times get faster marbles

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.540 
see a lot of times get faster marbles
form<00:00:51.750> offline<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.220> get<00:00:53.310> off<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
form offline so you can get off the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.650 
form offline so you can get off the
racing<00:00:53.850> line<00:00:53.880> it's<00:00:54.090> very<00:00:54.239> basically<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
racing line it's very basically the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.510 
racing line it's very basically the
intellectuals<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.399> also

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
intellectuals out there and you can also

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
intellectuals out there and you can also
sort<00:00:56.790> blister<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.300> damage<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:57.899> tires<00:00:58.730> on

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
sort blister and damage your tires on

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.340 
sort blister and damage your tires on
the<00:00:59.820> flip<00:01:00.000> side<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:00.540> rain<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:01.020> marvel<00:01:01.290> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the flip side in the rain the marvel is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
the flip side in the rain the marvel is
actually<00:01:01.590> wash<00:01:01.710> away<00:01:01.860> and<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.579> track<00:01:02.820> surface

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
actually wash away and the track surface

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.840 
actually wash away and the track surface
actually<00:01:03.570> knows<00:01:03.720> how<00:01:03.750> wet<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
actually knows how wet it is so this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.950 
actually knows how wet it is so this
give<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.180> gives<00:01:06.420> us<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.750> very

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
give this gives us and at very

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.090 
give this gives us and at very
interesting<00:01:07.350> angle<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.740> game<00:01:07.920> hey

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
interesting angle from the game hey

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
interesting angle from the game hey
going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.149> need<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> correct

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
going to do you need to have the correct

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.300 
going to do you need to have the correct
tires<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> different<00:01:10.860> tires<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.189> got

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
tires on the different tires have got

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.649 
tires on the different tires have got
different<00:01:11.399> levels<00:01:11.969> of<00:01:12.030> grip<00:01:12.270> different

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
different levels of grip different

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.749 
different levels of grip different
operating<00:01:12.990> temperatures<00:01:13.649> and<00:01:14.189> different

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
operating temperatures and different

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.069 
operating temperatures and different
tire<00:01:14.909> compounds<00:01:15.329> disappear<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.750> different

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
tire compounds disappear as different

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.050 
tire compounds disappear as different
different<00:01:16.350> levels<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.740> water<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> third

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
different levels of water so the third

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
different levels of water so the third
part<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.959> weather<00:01:19.109> system<00:01:19.469> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
part of the the weather system is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.870 
part of the the weather system is
actually<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.069> effect<00:01:20.399> it<00:01:20.549> has<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
actually the effect it has on the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.309 
actually the effect it has on the
gameplay<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.600> we've<00:01:21.719> got<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.929> visuals<00:01:22.229> we've

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
gameplay so we've got the visuals we've

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.779 
gameplay so we've got the visuals we've
got<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.499> simulation<00:01:23.039> and<00:01:23.249> that<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.639> actually

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
got the simulation and that is actually

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.989 
got the simulation and that is actually
tie<00:01:24.149> into<00:01:24.359> the<00:01:24.450> car<00:01:24.569> handling<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:26.999 
tie into the car handling and just to

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.389 
tie into the car handling and just to
enter<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.389> weather<00:01:28.200> dynamics<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.069> part<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
enter the weather dynamics the part I

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.099 
enter the weather dynamics the part I
really<00:01:29.670> enjoy<00:01:30.119> playing<00:01:30.149> at<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> moment<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
really enjoy playing at the moment is

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.039 
really enjoy playing at the moment is
how<00:01:31.920> they<00:01:32.069> attract<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.850> evolve<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.509> each<00:01:33.719> car

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
how they attract will evolve as each car

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.139 
how they attract will evolve as each car
individually<00:01:34.829> drives<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.279> that<00:01:35.429> surface<00:01:35.639> and

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
individually drives on that surface and

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.899 
individually drives on that surface and
from<00:01:37.109> wet<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> dry<00:01:37.709> you'll<00:01:38.219> naturally<00:01:38.490> dry

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
from wet to dry you'll naturally dry

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.059 
from wet to dry you'll naturally dry
where<00:01:39.209> the<00:01:39.270> cars<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.689> proven<00:01:39.929> on<00:01:40.139> just<00:01:40.950> like

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
where the cars have proven on just like

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.489 
where the cars have proven on just like
real<00:01:41.249> life<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.819> you're<00:01:42.389> left<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.289> a

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
real life and you're left with a

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.080 
real life and you're left with a
completely<00:01:43.950> dry<00:01:44.189> circuit<00:01:44.639> at<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.819> point

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
completely dry circuit at that point

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.569 
completely dry circuit at that point
with<00:01:45.599> puddles<00:01:45.929> in<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.740> undulations<00:01:47.069> in<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
with puddles in the undulations in the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.929 
with puddles in the undulations in the
small<00:01:47.819> engines<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.539> curbs<00:01:49.109> as<00:01:49.409> well<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.939> yeah

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
small engines and curbs as well and yeah

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.239 
small engines and curbs as well and yeah
very<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.539> accurate<00:01:51.959> you'll<00:01:52.859> actually<00:01:53.009> find

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
very very accurate you'll actually find

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.039 
very very accurate you'll actually find
that<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> game<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.090> wet<00:01:54.389> tires<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.959> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
that the game is on wet tires on the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.480 
that the game is on wet tires on the
drying<00:01:55.289> track<00:01:55.529> will<00:01:55.770> try<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.009> seek<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.340> those

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
drying track will try and seek out those

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.889 
drying track will try and seek out those
puddles<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.969> call<00:01:57.119> their<00:01:57.270> tires<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.749> stop

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
puddles to call their tires and stop

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.389 
puddles to call their tires and stop
them<00:01:58.049> from<00:01:58.079> damaging<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.859> all<00:01:58.979> about<00:01:59.009> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
them from damaging so it's all about and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.679 
them from damaging so it's all about and
sort<00:01:59.549> strategy<00:01:59.909> elements<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.389> these<00:02:00.509> points

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
sort strategy elements at these points

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
sort strategy elements at these points
where<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.259> try<00:02:01.859> to<00:02:01.919> change<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.219> from<00:02:02.310> wet<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
will be added into the game as well that

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.160 
will be added into the game as well that
a<00:02:16.739> you'll<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.879> aware<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.900> weather's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
a you'll be aware of what the weather's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.140 
a you'll be aware of what the weather's
doing<00:02:19.530> roughly<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.370> then<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:20.970> make<00:02:21.090> your

doing roughly and then you can make your
call<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.409> would<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.650> real

for the predicted weather conditions so

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.509
