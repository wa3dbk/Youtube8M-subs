00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 something fun apps for you the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.330
 actually not on android form 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 but you can get it out of jux 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 make a so-called i os 7 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:37.469
 launch screen and location yes looks here 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.629
 you already have the ios 7 lockscreen the above 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.230
 just no blackboard you can now 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.250
 Unlock here left or right 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.239
 I have the whole thing already on one 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.500
 As these are moving, iphone 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.449
 even bubbles depending on that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.219
 handicap move the safety is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.079
 just a screenshot but what I 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.350
 At the box fans cool is this 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.910
 function down here 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.829
 that we directly on the flashlight 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.100
 Rear access to our music 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.729
 player on brightness and and and and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.000
 what everything sees me wlan and data 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.280
 again data and gps and volume is 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.460
 in itself not so bad me 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 tell calculators immediately too 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.960
 very fast camera app works 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 also shows the father with which 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.500
 either want to start if we because 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.570
 several than one have yes looks funny 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.119
 is not bad you can get out 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.909
 do to 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.950
 did you hear that like that? 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.100
 competitive product 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.240
 that is then an ios 7 launch through 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.220
 honestly i have easy now 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.430
 times the complete package opened that is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.649
 the spring launcher and notification bar 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.380
 These are three free variants I 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.000
 can you guys to post 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.350
 for it is here we find halt 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.149
 our apps and something i say mario 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 s 7 design her good one looks like I said 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.160
 here is cut off the top is it 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.160
 still 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.030
 yes the symbols icons do not take 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.310
 really so here still looks 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.990
 reasonably out but here again 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.990
 I personally just do not like it 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.130
 and the last would be even if it was 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.610
 Okay, the feature works fine though 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.870
 even that is called this so-called yes 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.940
 I do not know what they call it 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.530
 Just here this one has the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.020
 Can somehow delete the last apps and 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.920
 can not delete 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.480
 actually wanted something else is there 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.160
 Is that the notification at the one 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.690
 just pull on it 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.040
 what I have just shown 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.500
 have apparently actually it was but 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.820
 this one apparently has lockscreen 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.390
 Prices accepted the function so 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.890
 if so seen you two now yes 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.150
 As I said, that's not the case 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.120
 bad as a bit as a myth 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.710
 you can do it all 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.840
 hero of course remains everything android who 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.860
 up here in eschenbach would like to have 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.040
 at ios the miss 90 cents spend that 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.420
 I did not want to do that for now 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.650
 I just have it as a job on it 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.440
 Of course you can do that with the home 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.170
 button again his launcher choose that 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.760
 This time it's mine as you can see 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.650
 then the background is everything again 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.420
 cut off and so on 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.130
 you just do it with the reboot 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.330
 that means we can do that once well 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.380
 mobile phone and then has as usual 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.330
 the world's biggest again or you can stop 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.200
 Just switch the apps back and forth 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.850
 should be compatible with all phones 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.200
 I make the whole nation easier 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.760
 some things so you have too 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.590
 Settings then it will turn 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.150
 charge full to the full version 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.220
 let unlock or similar things 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.660
 I do not know I do not care 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.660
 really keep busy 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.200
 to call tolerance or financial no 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.570
 Of course, I have nothing against that 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.910
 iphone ios it does not hold a bad either 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.790
 product but I am the android device 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.900
 I wanted to present something funny 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.130
 licon does not subscribe to it either 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.130
 forget until next time
