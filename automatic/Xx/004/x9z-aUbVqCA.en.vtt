00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
let's go ahead and see if we can do this

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.480 
let's go ahead and see if we can do this
here<00:01:45.079> okay<00:01:46.079> we're<00:01:46.200> gonna<00:01:46.290> click<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> camera

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
here okay we're gonna click the camera
and<00:01:47.729> we're<00:01:48.060> gonna<00:01:48.149> slowly<00:01:48.570> scroll<00:01:49.110> through

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and we're gonna slowly scroll through

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
and we're gonna slowly scroll through
trying<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> keep<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.579> arrow<00:01:50.820> as<00:01:51.119> straight<00:01:51.479> as

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
trying to keep that arrow as straight as

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.130 
trying to keep that arrow as straight as
possible<00:01:53.450> okay<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:56.630> we're<00:01:57.630> done

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
possible okay and we're done

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.580 
possible okay and we're done
and<00:01:58.469> either<00:01:58.920> it'll<00:01:59.880> stop<00:02:00.090> capturing<00:02:00.469> if<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and either it'll stop capturing if you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.410 
and either it'll stop capturing if you
kind<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.829> run<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.219> space<00:02:02.460> or<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.270> just

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
kind of run out of space or you can just

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.240 
kind of run out of space or you can just
click<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> camera<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> stop<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.799> let's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
click the camera to stop it and let's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.930 
click the camera to stop it and let's
see<00:02:05.399> how<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.610> came<00:02:06.030> out<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:07.369> not<00:02:08.369> too<00:02:08.640> bad

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
see how that came out here not too bad

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.020 
see how that came out here not too bad
but<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.239> see<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.550> mr.<00:02:11.550> Monty<00:02:11.849> Phone

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
but you see that the mr. Monty Phone

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.440 
but you see that the mr. Monty Phone
logo<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.599> starts<00:02:12.900> from<00:02:13.050> there

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
logo it starts from there

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.080 
logo it starts from there
it<00:02:13.959> has<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> panorama<00:02:14.920> view<00:02:15.280> all<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.000> way

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
it has a panorama view all the way

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.320 
it has a panorama view all the way
across<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.750> background<00:02:17.590> setting<00:02:18.069> here<00:02:18.250> so

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
across the background setting here so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.420 
across the background setting here so
again<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.599> really<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.410> cool<00:02:20.800> feature<00:02:21.160> if

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
again this really is a cool feature if

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.190 
again this really is a cool feature if
you<00:02:21.550> do<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:21.849> you're<00:02:22.000> big<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.629> pictures<00:02:23.050> of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
you do if you're big on pictures of

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.690 
you do if you're big on pictures of
landscapes<00:02:23.470> or<00:02:24.040> crowds<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.580> people<00:02:25.590> even<00:02:26.700> you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
landscapes or crowds of people even you

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.110 
landscapes or crowds of people even you
could<00:02:27.849> probably<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.239> like<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> 360<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.440> room

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
could probably do like a 360 of a room

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.270 
could probably do like a 360 of a room
so<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.349> said<00:02:32.530> just<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.860> great
