00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
of those pros on and it was finally time

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.020 
of those pros on and it was finally time
to<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:46.409> into<00:01:46.560> action<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> our<00:01:47.549> first<00:01:47.820> game

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to get into action and our first game

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.990 
to get into action and our first game
here<00:01:48.270> was<00:01:48.479> against<00:01:48.990> reading<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.759> was<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
here was against reading and and I was a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.780 
here was against reading and and I was a
little<00:01:51.270> bit<00:01:51.390> rusty<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> star<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.640> see

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
little bit rusty a star but you can see

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.160 
little bit rusty a star but you can see
there<00:01:53.939> took<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> shot<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> go<00:01:54.840> keep<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
there took a shot there and go keep it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.560 
there took a shot there and go keep it
was<00:01:55.259> well<00:01:55.439> saved<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> goal<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.299> was

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
was well saved and what a goal this was

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
was well saved and what a goal this was
just<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> 10th<00:01:58.710> minute<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.399> 11th<00:01:59.759> minute

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
just the 10th minute or the 11th minute

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
just the 10th minute or the 11th minute
of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> game<00:02:00.259> crashed<00:02:01.259> well<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of the game crashed well get on the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.160 
of the game crashed well get on the
scoresheet<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.509> unexpected

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
scoresheet and it's kind of unexpected

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.319 
scoresheet and it's kind of unexpected
because<00:02:04.320> normally<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.939> other<00:02:06.060> players

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
because normally and the other players

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.660 
because normally and the other players
they<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.020> mess<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.280> shot<00:02:08.489> goes

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
they kind of mess up and the shot goes

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.699 
they kind of mess up and the shot goes
anyway<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:10.050> nice<00:02:10.349> finish

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
anyway and that was a really nice finish

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.170 
anyway and that was a really nice finish
because<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.099> was<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> lot<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.489> fenders<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.060> him

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
because it was a lot of fenders on him

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.280 
because it was a lot of fenders on him
as<00:02:12.270> well<00:02:12.300> I

said previously previously guys I was a
little<00:02:15.390> bit<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.569> rust<00:02:15.689> you<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:15.989> see<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
little bit of rust you can see the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.410 
little bit of rust you can see the
destructors<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.950> wide<00:02:17.159> and<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:18.000> half<00:02:18.180> time

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
destructors going wide and a half time

abdicate<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.549> way<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.939> one<00:02:27.000> but

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
abdicate in the way of that one but

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.530 
abdicate in the way of that one but
overall<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:29.219> did<00:02:29.370> get<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.609> win<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.030> which<00:02:30.420> I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
overall and we did get the win I which I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
overall and we did get the win I which I
was<00:02:30.629> very<00:02:30.659> happy<00:02:30.989> about<00:02:31.230> because<00:02:31.500> i<00:02:31.709> myself

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
was very happy about because i myself

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.280 
was very happy about because i myself
was<00:02:32.579> very<00:02:32.879> very<00:02:33.209> rusty<00:02:33.659> in<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.870> game<00:02:34.049> you<00:02:34.170> can

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
was very very rusty in that game you can

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.099 
was very very rusty in that game you can
see<00:02:34.319> 6.6<00:02:35.099> train<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.659> was<00:02:36.810> kind<00:02:36.959> of

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
see 6.6 train but that was kind of

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.599 
see 6.6 train but that was kind of
expected<00:02:37.590> because<00:02:37.709> i<00:02:37.799> haven't<00:02:38.010> played<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.519> a

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
expected because i haven't played in a

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.729 
expected because i haven't played in a
long<00:02:38.640> time<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.480> i<00:02:39.659> was<00:02:40.170> trying<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.379> fix<00:02:40.560> those

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
long time so i was trying to fix those

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.410 
long time so i was trying to fix those
things<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.760> game<00:02:41.909> against<00:02:42.209> nottingham

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
things in this game against nottingham

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.899 
things in this game against nottingham
forest<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.319> hopefully<00:02:44.010> trying<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.430> lead<00:02:44.879> our

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
forest and hopefully trying to lead our

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.660 
forest and hopefully trying to lead our
team<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.389> back-to-back<00:02:46.170> victories<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.040> this

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
team to back-to-back victories and this

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.819 
team to back-to-back victories and this
is<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> huge<00:02:48.150> game<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:48.689> both<00:02:49.139> the<00:02:49.170> both<00:02:49.650> of

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
is a huge game because both the both of

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.589 
is a huge game because both the both of
the<00:02:49.950> teams<00:02:50.159> have<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.849> very<00:02:51.060> close<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.389> table

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
the teams have a very close to the table

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.390 
the teams have a very close to the table
I<00:02:51.750> think<00:02:51.930> Forrester<00:02:52.379> only<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> few<00:02:53.099> points

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
I think Forrester only a few points

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.199 
I think Forrester only a few points
ahead<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.669> us<00:02:53.909> at<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> table<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.439> it<00:02:56.370> was<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.549> you

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
ahead of us at the table so it was a you

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
ahead of us at the table so it was a you
know<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.450> was<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.599> big<00:02:57.810> mid<00:02:58.290> table<00:02:58.470> clash<00:02:58.919> and

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
know it was a big mid table clash and

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.009 
know it was a big mid table clash and
you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.879> see<00:03:00.060> they<00:03:00.180> went<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.599> there<00:03:00.750> nil-nil

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
you can see they went in there nil-nil

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.409 
you can see they went in there nil-nil
Akane's<00:03:01.530> forests<00:03:01.919> and<00:03:02.099> forest<00:03:02.909> red<00:03:03.239> little

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
Akane's forests and forest red little

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.819 
Akane's forests and forest red little
bit<00:03:03.510> unlucky<00:03:03.780> because<00:03:04.079> this<00:03:04.349> should<00:03:04.590> really

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
bit unlucky because this should really

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.349 
bit unlucky because this should really
been<00:03:05.099> ahead<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.639> first<00:03:05.879> half<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.269> you

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
been ahead in that first half but you

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.559 
been ahead in that first half but you
can<00:03:06.510> see<00:03:06.659> second<00:03:07.409> half<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.769> did<00:03:07.919> kind<00:03:08.099> of

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
can see second half we did kind of

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.300 
can see second half we did kind of
stabilize<00:03:09.569> some<00:03:09.750> things<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.319> got<00:03:11.129> some

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
stabilize some things and got some

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.250 
stabilize some things and got some
chances<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.849> in<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.389> 88th<00:03:12.720> minute<00:03:12.750> here<00:03:13.139> you

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
chances and in the 88th minute here you

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.920 
chances and in the 88th minute here you

the<00:04:44.070> end<00:04:44.160> otherwise<00:04:44.340> i'd<00:04:44.760> probably<00:04:45.000> end<00:04:45.240> up

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
the end otherwise i'd probably end up

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.900 
the end otherwise i'd probably end up
getting<00:04:45.750> injured<00:04:45.990> as<00:04:46.139> i<00:04:46.169> always<00:04:46.410> do<00:04:46.770> but<00:04:47.610> India

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
getting injured as i always do but India

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.430 
getting injured as i always do but India
we<00:04:48.060> did<00:04:48.210> get<00:04:48.389> the<00:04:48.570> one<00:04:48.780> little<00:04:48.960> victory<00:04:49.350> and

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
we did get the one little victory and

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.530 
we did get the one little victory and
you<00:04:49.500> could<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:49.800> another<00:04:49.889> solid<00:04:50.400> 8.3<00:04:51.330> mash

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
you could see another solid 8.3 mash

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.330 
you could see another solid 8.3 mash
rain<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.139> so<00:04:52.680> another<00:04:52.919> good<00:04:53.160> math

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
rain and so another good math

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.930 
rain and so another good math
performance<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:54.090> yeah<00:04:54.930> we<00:04:55.110> were<00:04:55.230> hopefully

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
performance and yeah we were hopefully

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.400 
performance and yeah we were hopefully
trying<00:04:56.940> going<00:04:57.540> to<00:04:57.630> try<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:57.810> replicate<00:04:58.139> that

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
trying going to try and replicate that

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.530 
trying going to try and replicate that
in<00:04:58.590> this<00:04:59.430> game<00:04:59.610> against<00:04:59.880> Millwall<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.390> can

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
in this game against Millwall you can

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.090 
in this game against Millwall you can
see<00:05:00.630> their<00:05:00.840> recent<00:05:01.200> results<00:05:01.440> weren't<00:05:01.770> great

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
see their recent results weren't great

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.310 
see their recent results weren't great
three<00:05:02.520> losses<00:05:02.760> in<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.090> row<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.660> obviously<00:05:04.050> we

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
three losses in a row and obviously we

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.810 
three losses in a row and obviously we
had<00:05:04.470> three<00:05:04.770> wins<00:05:05.010> in<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.250> row<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:05.550> this<00:05:05.700> is

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
had three wins in a row so this is

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.909 
had three wins in a row so this is
definitely<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.390> game<00:05:06.660> what<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.590> needed<00:05:07.770> to

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
definitely a game what you needed to

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.980 
definitely a game what you needed to
play<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.100> Millwall<00:05:08.669> we're<00:05:09.000> just<00:05:09.300> we're<00:05:09.840> just

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
amazing in the first half they really

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.400 
amazing in the first half they really
were<00:05:11.880> causing<00:05:12.150> our<00:05:12.360> defensive<00:05:12.810> problems<00:05:13.020> and

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
were causing our defensive problems and

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.440 
were causing our defensive problems and
then<00:05:14.130> late<00:05:14.310> in<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.550> second<00:05:14.850> half<00:05:14.880> we<00:05:15.150> did<00:05:15.270> try

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
then late in the second half we did try

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.060 
then late in the second half we did try
and<00:05:15.660> stabilize<00:05:15.870> some<00:05:16.230> things<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.680> try<00:05:17.010> and

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
and stabilize some things and try and

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.440 
and stabilize some things and try and

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
get back in the wall and you can see the

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.690 
get back in the wall and you can see the
40th<00:05:18.840> minute<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:19.320> go<00:05:19.710> through<00:05:19.950> your<00:05:20.100> uncle<00:05:20.490> I

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
40th minute I go through your uncle I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.640 
40th minute I go through your uncle I
got<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.330> little<00:05:21.540> bit<00:05:21.720> lucky<00:05:21.990> day<00:05:22.110> because<00:05:22.500> I

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
got a little bit lucky day because I

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.940 
got a little bit lucky day because I
wasn't<00:05:23.070> I<00:05:23.250> wasn't<00:05:23.580> quite<00:05:24.570> sure<00:05:24.660> what<00:05:25.229> do<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.650> was

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
wasn't I wasn't quite sure what do I was

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.409 
wasn't I wasn't quite sure what do I was
thinking<00:05:26.220> of<00:05:26.340> finesse<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.820> run<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.120> cookie

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
thinking of finesse to run the cookie

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.780 
thinking of finesse to run the cookie
but<00:05:27.570> but<00:05:27.690> I<00:05:27.720> just<00:05:27.930> kind<00:05:28.139> of<00:05:28.290> shot<00:05:28.919> on<00:05:29.070> hope<00:05:29.280> that

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
but but I just kind of shot on hope that

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.040 
but but I just kind of shot on hope that
it<00:05:29.910> would<00:05:29.970> end<00:05:30.180> up<00:05:30.330> in<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.510> back<00:05:30.660> and<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.930> you

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
it would end up in the back and that you

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.530 
it would end up in the back and that you
can<00:05:31.169> see<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.440> did<00:05:31.650> so<00:05:32.520> yeah<00:05:32.550> we<00:05:33.060> went<00:05:33.330> in

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
can see it did so yeah we went in

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.930 
can see it did so yeah we went in
halftime<00:05:33.890> with<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:34.919> one<00:05:35.130> day<00:05:35.280> lead<00:05:35.490> over

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
halftime with a one day lead over

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.210 
halftime with a one day lead over
Millwall<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.600> what<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.590> chance<00:05:37.860> mill<00:05:38.070> were

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
Millwall and what a chance mill were

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.150 
Millwall and what a chance mill were
hard<00:05:38.430> here<00:05:38.610> look<00:05:38.850> how<00:05:39.660> I<00:05:40.050> didn't<00:05:40.800> school<00:05:41.010> from

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
hard here look how I didn't school from

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.450 
hard here look how I didn't school from
that<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.370> still<00:05:42.300> don't<00:05:42.600> know<00:05:42.660> but<00:05:43.050> I'm<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.590> guess
