00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.570
 hello i will try to talk about 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.070
 tom as in the shortest time of 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.930
 the simplest materials to make 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.080
 fairly effective target you 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.240
 chromatic weapon for this from sheet 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.650
 tin 1 millimeter thick 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.030
 we cut off a strip of metal 20 wide 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:26.950
 millimeters and length 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:32.280
 millimeters spot 15 centimeters given 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:38.320
 strip we divide in half into two parts 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:43.510
 5 and 10 out of 10 centimeter 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:47.230
 we bend the detail of the bend angle of about 40 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.699
 degrees and bend distance approximately 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.969
 one third of the base we get here 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:01:04.420
 such a detail q translate it but. 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:06.219
 the carnal state here in this detail 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.009
 drill two holes first for us 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:12.479
 necessary in order to target 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.479
 bolted to base 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:31.840
 and the second we need to 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:34.380
 attach directly to the target here are two 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.170
 holes like this 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:48.970
 is the second in as zagotovochke 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:56.950
 Drill two holes the first where will 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:02:10.060
 fasten the second target to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:11.860
 to fix the target of which substrate 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.140
 the side where the hole is for 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.530
 mounting target substrate we do 2 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.010
 bend to the target when and fix 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:27.790
 do not twist our screws after 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:32.370
 hitting the bullets further seals these two 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.370
 billet bolt 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.870
 here it is necessary to bring in the simplest 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.359
 adjustment that is necessary to observe 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.659
 balance between mounting density 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.359
 targets that is so that they do not hang out 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:57.470
 blanks each other and at the same time that 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.950
 you interfere enough freely in them 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.639
 rotated so that when a bullet hit it 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:12.200
 worked properly that is filed 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:13.349
 so it happened further we bend 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.889
 corner 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:20.269
 that is, after all, I have put two parts 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:25.109
 targets regularly relative to each other 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:29.459
 did some stock and bent 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.349
 billet so check well 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.129
 walks, walks with us does not mean well 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.519
 it was too good to fix this 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.519
 moment 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:55.080
 like this all 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.630
 us target goes free same time 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.290
 well fixed 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.400
 extreme position all now bend 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:11.660
 corner where will be mounted 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:16.080
 directly target this way 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:21.630
 attach the target loop to these two 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:25.950
 billet contour target made of 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.980
 plywood trimming 10 millimeters thick 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.250
 can be done in principle be less 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.990
 quite tenacious and for lack of 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:40.820
 stiffness here is such a target here 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.820
 this target turned out we easily fix 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.680
 easily fix and pegs with 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.680
 again yourself 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:21.859
 all tests will be carried out using 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:25.959
 gamo hunter rifles and bullets cool 

00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:25.959
 example horse from 8 to 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.210
 Misha did not fall but we brought her to 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:06:01.810
 initial state as we see special 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:06:04.039
 Michelle suffered no damage with the help of 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.220
 such a simple design can 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:09.500
 do as you see 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.250
 complex of the targets on the principle 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.870
 discretion 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:19.570
 the manufacturer can attach them 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:23.510
 arbitrarily in different positions and 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:26.380
 arbitrarily by distance everything 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.380
 thank you for your attention
