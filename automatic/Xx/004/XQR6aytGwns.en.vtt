boof<00:01:05.939> Epps's<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.659> exactly<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> same

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
boof Epps's are exactly the same

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
boof Epps's are exactly the same
I<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.250> blue<00:01:08.520> balance<00:01:08.880> flip<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:09.330> see

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
I will just blue balance flip them see

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.550 
I will just blue balance flip them see
if<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.080> find<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.010> hard<00:01:11.250> drive<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.470> if<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
if we can find the hard drive so if you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
if we can find the hard drive so if you
go<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:13.950> computer<00:01:14.460> you'll<00:01:15.299> see<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.380> has

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
go to my computer you'll see that it has

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.539 
go to my computer you'll see that it has
the<00:01:16.830> OCZ<00:01:17.400> SSD<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:19.080> assistant<00:01:19.860> part<00:01:20.250> or

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
system drive and then all these

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.370 
system drive and then all these
different<00:01:23.400> partitions<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.210> gives<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
different partitions here gives from the

external<00:01:35.460> HDD<00:01:36.229> that's<00:01:37.229> pretty<00:01:37.470> cool<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.829> now

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
external HDD that's pretty cool so now

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
master if I go to Device Manager the see

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.719 
master if I go to Device Manager the see
it<00:01:48.540> has<00:01:48.750> disk<00:01:49.229> drives<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.310> look<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
it has disk drives here if you look it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.480 
it has disk drives here if you look it
says<00:01:50.759> attach<00:01:51.390> key<00:01:51.689> that's<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> hard<00:01:53.250> drive

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
says attach key that's the hard drive

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.870 
says attach key that's the hard drive
and<00:01:53.700> CD<00:01:54.090> drive<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> SSD<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.729> that's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and CD drive and then the SSD so that's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.910 
and CD drive and then the SSD so that's
quite<00:01:57.000> interesting<00:01:57.090> cuz<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:58.439> doesn't<00:01:58.619> have

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
quite interesting cuz it doesn't have

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.639 
quite interesting cuz it doesn't have
like<00:01:59.219> a<00:02:00.060> thing<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.600> CD<00:02:00.930> drive<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.469> so

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
like a thing for the CD drive here so

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.490 
like a thing for the CD drive here so
it's<00:02:02.189> recognized<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> thing<00:02:04.110> plugged

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it's recognized that the thing plugged

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.350 
it's recognized that the thing plugged
into<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.950> CD<00:02:05.219> Drive<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.700> actually<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.149> hard

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
into the CD Drive is actually a hard

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.169 
into the CD Drive is actually a hard
time<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.810> quite<00:02:06.899> clever<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.789> this<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> set

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
time it's quite clever and this is a set

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
time it's quite clever and this is a set
of<00:02:09.330> three<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:09.899> you'll<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:10.379> lots<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.920> speed<00:02:11.250> if
