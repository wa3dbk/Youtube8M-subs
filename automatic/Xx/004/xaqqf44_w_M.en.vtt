00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello then then that this is the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.570
 third video I shot today and in it 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.950
 I take advantage because I have some free time 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.670
 so decided to make three videos so 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.529
 to be able to publish them more then this 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.600
 in this video I talk about the new new 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.519
 foundation liquid mineros bear 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:34.950
 liquid foundation this is the bear skin 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:37.860
 then many of you are stay 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.980
 italy i don't know let me know how 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.190
 this is the foundation and unscrews here 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.120
 to this is the applicator a little with i 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 as the body foundation fei semba di 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.829
 mac foundation 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 then as always you know the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.989
 routine I show you the application 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.980
 see you right away with mine 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.980
 let's see what he combined impressions 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.060
 and this was the application then 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.479
 verminosa also came out with a brush 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.840
 that from the advertising I saw looks 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.850
 precisely that it is the only brush that can 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.100
 be used with this foundation 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.289
 I didn't buy it because in short, I didn't 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.390
 it seemed necessary then with all the 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.170
 brushes or different ways that application 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.119
 there are it seems more like a gimmick than 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.899
 marketing was however there are gods 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.700
 kabuki brushes with the flat top that 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.569
 they work great that they are a lot 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.190
 similar to what term you created in 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.630
 combine in combination to use in 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.830
 combination with this founded life 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.340
 inside is a kind of hollow in the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.470
 which to apply the foundation 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.120
 in short, you can do a bit with everyone like that 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.400
 let's close this parenthesis thing 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.959
 I think this photo is my color 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.930
 very reminiscent of Giorgio's master 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.400
 armani as a consistency by touching them fairies 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.720
 a serum is a serum and a dark serum 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.510
 rom foundation then serum foundation 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.130
 hilbers chine formulated without water all 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.620
 the silicones bar goods and fragrances and the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.070
 protection 20 I find that opacity 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.540
 this foundation is medium slips 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:02.220
 really very well on the skin and also 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.209
 rather pleasant to apply and then 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.980
 I must say that looking in the mirror 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.329
 looks like you have nothing on your skin 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.600
 because it melts on the skin giving 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.090
 however an average coverage e 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.480
 leaving the skin well hydrated 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.810
 I advise you to apply it or with one 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.480
 sponge or with the brush because with 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.850
 fingers perhaps one of the few foundations 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.419
 maybe the only foundation I say no not 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.699
 applied with the fingers because with the 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:39.769
 I find that fingers slip a little too much 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:43.530
 on the fingers and fails to adhere well 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.479
 and leaves the face a little shiny I noticed 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.760
 the difference by applying it with your fingers 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.570
 leave the face shiny by applying it with the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.310
 fine collage sponge with sponge 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.340
 definitely a better effect 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.760
 matt or two then with this brightness 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.919
 which is no light bulb and instead 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.959
 applying it with your hands noticed that later 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.479
 while applying even if I then go to 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.130
 apply the powder on top, however 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.320
 this shiny effect that I don't like 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.310
 right now in this period here is a skin 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.000
 mixed 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.180
 the duration is really good remains on 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.970
 skin even after several hours on 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.199
 result is however always a natural one 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.090
 face a fresh skin a skin 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.949
 transparent that then in short what is 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.290
 what we all want what 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:37.440
 we all look for a foundation to whom 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.270
 I recommend it to those who don't know who they want 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.650
 an average coverage therefore does not have any 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.910
 so maybe a few spots 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:51.259
 not of the most important needs 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.690
 as far as coverage is concerned and I am 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.710
 council 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.740
 especially for those with dry skin 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.919
 amistÃ  an oily skin 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.440
 I don't recommend it let me know if 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.590
 someone has got to try it and has 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.250
 a fatty skin however definitely from 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.990
 what I've seen is a little too much 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:20.030
 rich but light but still rich for 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.300
 an oily skin 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.000
 so my opinion is positive though 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.449
 needs just to understand if a 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.139
 foundation that is good for ours 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.490
 leather and for the needs we have and is 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.130
 all as usual I hope this 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.130
 useful magazine but does not make kiss hello
