00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
second time around actually I think I

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.570 
second time around actually I think I
read<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.289> because<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:54.009> kind<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.340> fact

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
read that because it's kind of a fact

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.719 
read that because it's kind of a fact
because<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:56.139> nutrients<00:04:56.740> or<00:04:56.919> whatever<00:04:57.190> sync

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
because the nutrients or whatever sync

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.749 
because the nutrients or whatever sync
in<00:04:57.970> overtime<00:04:58.630> so<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.530> taste<00:04:59.740> is<00:04:59.949> more<00:04:59.979> rich<00:05:00.400> I

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
in overtime so the taste is more rich I

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.839 
in overtime so the taste is more rich I
don't<00:05:01.210> know<00:05:01.449> if<00:05:01.539> that's<00:05:01.720> true<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.380> read<00:05:03.159> it<00:05:03.370> but
