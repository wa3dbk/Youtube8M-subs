say hey good that all right see it from
the<00:04:11.510> front<00:04:14.410> when<00:04:15.410> they're<00:04:15.560> got<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.829> 24-pin

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
the front when they're got the 24-pin

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.900 
the front when they're got the 24-pin
going<00:04:16.639> in<00:04:16.760> there<00:04:18.039> much<00:04:19.039> looks<00:04:19.459> much<00:04:19.669> cleaner

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
going in there much looks much cleaner

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.790 
going in there much looks much cleaner
down<00:04:20.209> there<00:04:20.389> I<00:04:20.419> think

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.909 

they<00:04:26.310> also<00:04:26.789> put<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.300> cold<00:04:27.479> cathode<00:04:27.900> box<00:04:28.139> all

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
they also put the cold cathode box all

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.800 
they also put the cold cathode box all
those<00:04:29.159> cables<00:04:29.550> or<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:30.150> was<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> pain<00:04:30.539> with<00:04:30.690> those

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
those cables or it was a pain with those

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.420 
those cables or it was a pain with those
things<00:04:30.990> coming<00:04:31.560> fine<00:04:31.860> up<00:04:32.009> all<00:04:32.159> over<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.370> place

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
things coming fine up all over the place

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.290 
things coming fine up all over the place
so<00:04:32.849> anchor<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.840> does<00:04:33.990> down<00:04:35.539> as<00:04:36.539> well<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:39.180> then

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
so anchor it does down as well and then

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.200 
so anchor it does down as well and then
