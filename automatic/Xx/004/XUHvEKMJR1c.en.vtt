standing on the Eiffel Tower so there

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
standing on the Eiffel Tower so there
are<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> few<00:00:56.699> clues<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:57.870> show

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
are a few clues in this that will show

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.080 
are a few clues in this that will show
that<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.440> game<00:00:58.649> will<00:00:58.859> take<00:00:59.219> place<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.640> France

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that this game will take place in France

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.160 
that this game will take place in France
I'm<00:01:00.420> guessing<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.670> game<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> 3ds

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
I'm guessing so this game is for the 3ds

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.500 
I'm guessing so this game is for the 3ds
it<00:01:04.470> seems<00:01:04.680> exclusively<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:06.119> show<00:01:06.299> some

character customization I'm assuming

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
character customization I'm assuming

have chespin as the grass and fennekin

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.280 
have chespin as the grass and fennekin
is<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.420> fire<00:01:33.630> type<00:01:33.990> he's<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> fox<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:36.290> froakie

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
is the fire type he's a fox and froakie

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.800

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
is a frog and again the grass type

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.109 
is a frog and again the grass type
chespin<00:01:40.530> looks<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.100> some<00:01:41.700> type<00:01:41.909> of

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
chespin looks like some type of

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.170 
chespin looks like some type of
groundhog<00:01:42.990> something<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.430> Bob's<00:01:44.759> mole

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
things anyway a while Pikachu appeared

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.050 
things anyway a while Pikachu appeared
so<00:01:48.210> looks<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.869> these<00:01:49.860> battle<00:01:50.220> sequences<00:01:50.399> are

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060

is<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.970> grass-type<00:02:30.599> start<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.769> grass<00:02:32.220> type

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
is a grass-type start is the grass type

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.890 
is a grass-type start is the grass type
starter<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.090> seems<00:02:33.330> like<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.540> has<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
starter and it seems like it has the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.809 
starter and it seems like it has the
potential<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.440> becoming<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:35.160> ground-type

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
potential of becoming a ground-type

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.360 
potential of becoming a ground-type
maybe<00:02:36.239> because<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.810> see<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.200> excadrill<00:02:37.799> kind

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
maybe because I see that excadrill kind

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.000 
maybe because I see that excadrill kind
of<00:02:38.489> thing<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.940> may<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.239> drover

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
of thing and it may be a drover

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.339 
of thing and it may be a drover
potential<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.160> don't<00:02:41.370> know<00:02:41.430> um<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:42.329> can<00:02:42.989> see<00:02:43.230> it

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
potential I don't know um I can see it

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.800 
potential I don't know um I can see it
being<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.739> like<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> mole<00:02:44.340> or<00:02:44.370> groundhog<00:02:45.299> of<00:02:45.480> some

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
being a like a mole or groundhog of some

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.740 
being a like a mole or groundhog of some
sort<00:02:46.579> I<00:02:47.579> feel<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.329> going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.599> them

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750

I feel like they're all going to have a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.210 
I feel like they're all going to have a
really<00:02:50.430> good<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:51.290> final<00:02:52.290> evolution<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:52.950> let's

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
really good on final evolution but let's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.990 
really good on final evolution but let's
move<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:55.010> fennekin<00:02:56.010> desde<00:02:56.579> what<00:02:56.879> I'm

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
obviously and it is uh seems like it's

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.770 
obviously and it is uh seems like it's
going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.349> be<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.590> pure<00:03:10.980> fire<00:03:11.280> type<00:03:11.609> but<00:03:12.389> if

going to just be a pure fire type but if
it<00:03:13.650> isn't<00:03:14.160> i<00:03:14.400> would<00:03:14.880> say<00:03:15.090> fire<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.720> psychic

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
