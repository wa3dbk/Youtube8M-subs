 tutorial I'm doing for all 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.939
 you agree well and let's start with 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.400
 the tutorial what we have to do 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.640
 when we have downloaded the program 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.859
 is to right click and execute it as 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.970
 administrator administrator of 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.370
 agreement 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.930
 let's go as administrator 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.390
 and good what we have to do here 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.500
 now it is to remove that box and then you 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.409
 we give here the button 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.789
 the aero win button 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.939
 and how can you go here now has 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.759
 activated the air of windows 7 as usual 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.250
 fixing friends is very, very easy 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.859
 it is simply with two clicks 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.189
 and we already have the air of our windows 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:50.209
 7 activated a click to execute it as 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.579
 administrator and another click to activate it 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.399
 in this program as you can set 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.380
 It is very, very easy to remember if 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.969
 you want to deactivate the aero 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.509
 simply what we have to do is 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:05.030
 close the little program and go back to 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.159
 open it in agreement but executing as 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.549
 the installer of the sector as 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.670
 administrator again and now for 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.099
 deactivate we must select this 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.340
 box and we give it here now in saber 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.620
 aero and as you can see here now 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.540

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.390
 windows 7 as is police has been 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.370
 deactivated and to reactivate it 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.330
 we come back to accept it as 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.340
 administrator 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.730
 we remove the box and we give noble 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.730
 aero 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.620

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.540
