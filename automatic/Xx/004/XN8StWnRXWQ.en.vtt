adding the egg mix in to the melted
butter<00:01:22.179> and<00:01:23.179> using<00:01:23.689> either<00:01:24.109> a<00:01:24.259> spatula<00:01:24.500> or<00:01:24.829> a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
the boiling liquid until it sets now a

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.580 
the boiling liquid until it sets now a
lot<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.439> chefs<00:01:36.740> will<00:01:37.219> cook<00:01:37.850> scrambled<00:01:38.179> egg

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
lot of chefs will cook scrambled egg

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.529 
lot of chefs will cook scrambled egg
directly<00:01:39.590> over<00:01:39.829> heat<00:01:39.979> but<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:40.520> find<00:01:40.789> once<00:01:41.359> you

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
directly over heat but I find once you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.719 
directly over heat but I find once you
use<00:01:41.749> the<00:01:41.929> boundary<00:01:42.229> method<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.979> cooking<00:01:43.369> it

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
use the boundary method of cooking it

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.660 
use the boundary method of cooking it
protects<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.359> egg<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:45.079> doesn't<00:01:45.439> cook<00:01:45.590> at<00:01:45.920> two

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
protects the egg it doesn't cook at two

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.819 
protects the egg it doesn't cook at two
quicker<00:01:46.969> speed<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:47.539> you'll<00:01:47.990> find<00:01:48.289> that<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
quicker speed and you'll find that the

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.739 
quicker speed and you'll find that the
finished<00:01:49.369> product<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:49.909> much<00:01:50.149> lighter<00:01:50.509> and

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
finished product is much lighter and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.450 
finished product is much lighter and
less<00:01:51.499> rubbery<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.859> takes<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.159> little<00:01:55.310> bit

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
less rubbery so it takes a little bit

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.789 
less rubbery so it takes a little bit
longer<00:01:55.640> course<00:01:56.060> using<00:01:56.869> this<00:01:56.960> method<00:01:57.319> as<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.679> is

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
longer course using this method as it is

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.160 
longer course using this method as it is
a<00:01:57.829> slow<00:01:58.159> method<00:02:00.609> now<00:02:01.630> we're<00:02:02.630> halfway<00:02:02.810> through

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
a slow method now we're halfway through

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.279 
a slow method now we're halfway through
cooking<00:02:03.409> here<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.950> as<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.219> can<00:02:04.340> see<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:06.020> egg

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
cooking here and as you can see the egg

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.760 
cooking here and as you can see the egg
is<00:02:06.530> starting<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.979> set<00:02:07.280> up<00:02:07.310> quite<00:02:08.119> Goulet's<00:02:08.770> now

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
is starting to set up quite Goulet's now

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.220 
is starting to set up quite Goulet's now
be<00:02:09.920> very<00:02:10.130> careful<00:02:10.520> because<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.729> course<00:02:11.230> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
be very careful because of course the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.220 
be very careful because of course the
heat<00:02:12.409> will

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
heat will

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.130 
heat will
go<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> bowl<00:02:15.550> so<00:02:15.970> use<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> cloth<00:02:16.780> at<00:02:16.990> all

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
go to the bowl so use a cloth at all

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.920 
go to the bowl so use a cloth at all
times<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:18.130> be<00:02:18.220> very<00:02:18.250> careful<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.780> a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
times and just be very careful it is a

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.960 
times and just be very careful it is a
beautiful<00:02:20.560> method<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:21.190> cooking<00:02:21.370> scrambled

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
beautiful method of cooking scrambled

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.550 
beautiful method of cooking scrambled
eggs<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.630> just<00:02:22.780> have<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.989> be<00:02:23.050> very<00:02:23.290> very
