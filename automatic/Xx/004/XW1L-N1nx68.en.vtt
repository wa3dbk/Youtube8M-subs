differences between this and say the mx1

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.320 
differences between this and say the mx1
okay<00:02:24.500> as<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.680> go<00:02:24.800> through<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.069> catalog<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
okay as we go through the catalog the

okay as we go through the catalog the
mx1<00:02:26.630> comes<00:02:27.080> with<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.770> alpinestars<00:02:28.670> back

protectors that cover that seam and
they're<00:02:36.620> also<00:02:36.770> event<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.489> there's<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.880> lot<00:02:38.060> of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
they're also event so there's a lot of

some<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.670> other<00:02:40.790> difference<00:02:41.150> would<00:02:41.239> be

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
some of the other difference would be

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.699
