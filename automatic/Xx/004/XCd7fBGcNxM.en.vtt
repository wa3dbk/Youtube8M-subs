guys have done you're really pushed
obviously<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> limits<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> technology

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
obviously the limits of the technology

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.190 
obviously the limits of the technology
one<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> great<00:01:45.420> things<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:45.689> black<00:01:45.990> ops

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
one of the great things about black ops

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
one of the great things about black ops
2<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> guys<00:01:46.829> are<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.430> pushing<00:01:47.700> to

2 is that you guys are really pushing to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.789 
2 is that you guys are really pushing to
innovate<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> gameplay<00:01:48.840> we've<00:01:49.229> said<00:01:49.530> on

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
innovate with the gameplay we've said on

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.870 
innovate with the gameplay we've said on
the<00:01:49.920> record<00:01:50.009> you're<00:01:50.250> gonna<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.490> branching

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the record you're gonna have branching

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.490 
the record you're gonna have branching
storylines<00:01:51.119> will<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.750> some<00:01:51.869> moments<00:01:52.229> or<00:01:52.320> even

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
storylines will see some moments or even

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.139 
storylines will see some moments or even
where<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.860> take<00:01:53.280> whether<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.610> snipe<00:01:53.909> or

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
where you can take whether you snipe or

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.280 
where you can take whether you snipe or
repel<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> mean<00:01:54.689> you're<00:01:54.780> trying<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.110> people

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
repel I mean you're trying to get people

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.510 
repel I mean you're trying to get people
more<00:01:55.409> options<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:56.009> how<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.189> play<00:01:56.399> through

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
more options about how to play through

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.310 
more options about how to play through
the<00:01:56.640> campaign<00:01:56.670> yeah<00:01:57.360> absolutely<00:01:57.750> look<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the campaign yeah absolutely look I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.959 
the campaign yeah absolutely look I
think<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> things<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.430> people<00:01:59.790> love

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
think one of the things that people love

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.250 
think one of the things that people love
with<00:02:00.149> call<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.479> duty<00:02:00.750> as<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:00.990> love

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
with call of duty as they love

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.020 
with call of duty as they love
of<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.830> cinematic<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.730> intense

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
of that that cinematic and intense

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.580 
of that that cinematic and intense
gameplay<00:02:03.300> experience<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.380> want<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
gameplay experience and we just want to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.040 
gameplay experience and we just want to
add<00:02:04.740> more<00:02:05.640> choice<00:02:05.940> so<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.510> example<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.840> this

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
add more choice so for example here this

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.410 
add more choice so for example here this
is<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.230> very<00:02:07.440> small<00:02:07.770> example<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.460> but<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.330> know

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
is a very small example but but you know

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.030 
is a very small example but but you know
this<00:02:09.570> this<00:02:09.630> level<00:02:10.320> will<00:02:10.410> play<00:02:10.619> differently

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
this this level will play differently

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.620 
this this level will play differently
whether<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.340> choose<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> snipe<00:02:12.030> your<00:02:12.270> rappel

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
whether you choose to snipe your rappel

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.750 
whether you choose to snipe your rappel
down<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.140> case<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:14.070> players<00:02:14.310> chosen<00:02:14.520> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
down in this case the players chosen to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.150 
down in this case the players chosen to
snipe<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.290> picked<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.860> sniper

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
snipe here so you picked up a sniper

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.510 
snipe here so you picked up a sniper
storm<00:02:17.340> which<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> future<00:02:18.180> eyes<00:02:19.520> sniper

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
storm which is a future eyes sniper

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.100 
storm which is a future eyes sniper
rifle<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.270> has<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.480> couple<00:02:21.780> pieces<00:02:21.900> of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
rifle that has a couple pieces of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.460 
rifle that has a couple pieces of
technology<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.710> here<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.340> are<00:02:24.090> from<00:02:24.330> 20<00:02:24.990> 25

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
technology on here that are from 20 25

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.410 
technology on here that are from 20 25
and<00:02:25.830> say<00:02:26.160> when<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.340> zoom<00:02:26.490> in<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:26.730> yeah<00:02:27.390> I

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
and say when you zoom in here yeah I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.270 
and say when you zoom in here yeah I
know<00:02:27.510> absolutely<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:29.010> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
know absolutely that that that that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.490 
know absolutely that that that that
technology<00:02:30.000> rate<00:02:30.240> there<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:31.140> sort<00:02:31.410> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
technology rate there that sort of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040 
technology rate there that sort of
inspired<00:02:31.710> off<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.610> sort<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.780> know<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
inspired off of the sort of you know the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.810 
inspired off of the sort of you know the
millimeter-wave<00:02:34.530> scanning<00:02:35.130> technology<00:02:35.700> that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
millimeter-wave scanning technology that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.920 
millimeter-wave scanning technology that
we<00:02:35.910> have<00:02:36.090> out<00:02:36.270> there<00:02:36.390> today<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.660> got<00:02:36.840> to

we have out there today you got to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.530 
we have out there today you got to
imagine<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.470> processing<00:02:38.070> power<00:02:38.250> gets<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:39.330> a

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
imagine as processing power gets it's a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360 
imagine as processing power gets it's a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
gets more powerful in the future you're

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.130 
gets more powerful in the future you're
gonna<00:02:41.490> get<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.910> down<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> much<00:02:42.930> smaller

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
gonna get that down to a much smaller

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.990 
gonna get that down to a much smaller
size<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.100> make<00:02:44.220> for<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.730> case

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.710

it<00:02:55.980> up<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.730> deeper<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:57.300> penetrate

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
the storytelling any game which I think

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.599 
the storytelling any game which I think
it's<00:05:27.469> something<00:05:27.589> that<00:05:27.829> you<00:05:27.859> know<00:05:28.009> call<00:05:28.249> duty<00:05:28.489> I

it's something that you know call duty I

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:30.279 
it's something that you know call duty I
