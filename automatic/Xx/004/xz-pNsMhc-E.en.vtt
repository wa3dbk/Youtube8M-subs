angle had to have it strapped yeah I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.319 
angle had to have it strapped yeah I
think<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.490> didn't<00:01:47.820> help<00:01:47.880> Arlen

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
think that that really didn't help Arlen

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.999 
think that that really didn't help Arlen

for he scores his runs it very very

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.410 
for he scores his runs it very very
quickly<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.890> runs<00:01:53.100> he<00:01:54.000> wasn't<00:01:54.299> taking

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
quickly but it runs he wasn't taking

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.569 
quickly but it runs he wasn't taking
quick<00:01:54.750> singles<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> he's<00:01:55.950> got<00:01:56.189> his<00:01:56.219> runs<00:01:56.460> at

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
