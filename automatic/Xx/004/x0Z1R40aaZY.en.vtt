00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
i'll just show you and obviously these

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.280 
i'll just show you and obviously these
are<00:02:15.250> slightly<00:02:15.640> different<00:02:15.850> shapes<00:02:16.330> but<00:02:16.750> it's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
are slightly different shapes but it's

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.320 
are slightly different shapes but it's
very<00:02:17.620> very<00:02:17.890> similar<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.880> obviously<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
very very similar this is obviously a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.930 
very very similar this is obviously a
hider<00:02:20.110> brush<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.519> obviously<00:02:21.700> a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
hider brush and this is obviously a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.699 
hider brush and this is obviously a
smaller<00:02:22.269> version<00:02:22.480> but<00:02:22.810> they're<00:02:23.019> very<00:02:23.410> very

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
smaller version but they're very very

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.420 
smaller version but they're very very
similar<00:02:25.500> obviously<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:26.709> different<00:02:27.010> sizes

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
similar obviously just different sizes

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.310 
similar obviously just different sizes
in<00:02:27.670> quality<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.570> i<00:02:30.630> really<00:02:31.630> can't<00:02:31.870> tell<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
in quality and i really can't tell the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.789 
in quality and i really can't tell the
difference<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.860> much<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.650> other<00:02:35.769> thing

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
difference that much and the other thing

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.810 
difference that much and the other thing
I<00:02:35.950> would<00:02:36.010> say<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.610> mac<00:02:36.820> brushes<00:02:37.269> kind<00:02:38.049> of

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
I would say is the mac brushes kind of

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.360 
I would say is the mac brushes kind of
have<00:02:39.820> soft<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.570> ever<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.170> softer<00:02:41.890> bristles

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
have soft just ever so softer bristles

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.289 
have soft just ever so softer bristles
and<00:02:42.700> also<00:02:43.630> um<00:02:44.430> they're<00:02:45.430> kind<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:45.940> packed

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
and also um they're kind of like packed

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.050 
and also um they're kind of like packed
more<00:02:46.630> tightly<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.380> this<00:02:47.950> one<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.610> mean

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
more tightly in this one but I mean

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.729 
more tightly in this one but I mean
that's<00:02:49.180> just<00:02:49.510> kind<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.810> nitpicking<00:02:50.320> there

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
that's just kind of nitpicking there

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.729 
that's just kind of nitpicking there
they're<00:02:51.400> really<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:51.819> good<00:02:51.940> brushes<00:02:52.390> and

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
they're really really good brushes and

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.530 
they're really really good brushes and
so<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.770> definitely<00:02:54.069> recommend<00:02:54.400> them

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
so I definitely recommend them

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.170 
so I definitely recommend them
I've<00:02:55.900> bought<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.829> few<00:02:57.189> different<00:02:57.519> boxes

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
I've bought like a few different boxes

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.059 
I've bought like a few different boxes
of<00:02:58.299> those<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:59.260> i'll<00:02:59.349> be<00:02:59.469> reviewing<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.950> other
