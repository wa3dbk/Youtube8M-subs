00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hi everyone guys are ultra first 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.690
 let's start enjoying the great 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:38.670
 battutona 10 auditore who made me 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 last night while I was playing then 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 this video I wanted to do a little bit the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.539
 a bit of clarity because I saw that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.760
 in the comments you are all a bit 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:51.300
 confused about something ie gta 5 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.730
 pc or console version that is what we are 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.370
 they are showing that he is doing us 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.620
 remain speechless and pc or console 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 many of you think it's the version 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.570
 pc because they see a graphic detail 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.790
 very very tall and not exactly 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 so it is absolutely not so in reality 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.740
 because I remind you that I also base myself 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.510
 a little about the experience of gta iv vi 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.909
 I remember that the PC version has not yet 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.979
 that is, the pc version will be made 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.740
 only after in fact the game will come out first 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.900
 for playstation 3 xbox 360 and then 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.840
 probably as it was for gta iv 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.549
 after a six or seven months the time of 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.270
 do the computer version 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.530
 windows will come out on pc but at the moment not 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.170
 that is to say the one that exists 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.240
 showing it seems among other things to have 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.759
 read that I can also tell you which one 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.009
 version is the playstation 3 version 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.560
 I believe this time unlike 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.170
 gta iv that they had started developing on 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 xbox 360 I believe this time with 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 the experience they have accumulated 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.850
 begin to exploit a little more 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.369
 playstation 3 its potential 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.189
 so the main version I think 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.740
 for the first time and in the history of gta 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.020
 next generation will be the ps3 version 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.630
 while for gta iv it was absolutely not 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.159
 so if you play gta iv on an xbox 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.049
 360 and a ps3 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.259
 notice a huge difference in the version 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.500
 ps3 has worse graphics more 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.000
 unstable 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.370
 slower etcetera etc. here instead 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.650
 I guess they will make a change 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.320
 a turnaround 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.640
 so the great detail e 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.530
 even on console then a game 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.780
 amazing I think they really are 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.940
 arrived at the maximum optimization 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.950
 no wonder why even on ps3 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.050
 there are masterpieces like uncharted 2 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.970
 uncharted 3 that have graphics 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.770
 comparable if not superior and therefore 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.959
 it is not that we say there is no ball 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.910
 playstation 3 you can do it on PC 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.560
 if they did a better job than 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.720
 what they did with gta iv 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.820
 an absurd beast would come out because up 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.560
 pc of course you can take advantage of a 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.260
 recent hardware while you know that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.800
 the console hardware is dated 2005 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.130
 2006 although they said that a lot 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.920
 probably this summer at e3 2013 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.140
 will present the new sony consoles 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.300
 almost certainly microsoft is not known but 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.400
 most likely it is so true that 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.709
 it was rumored that battlefield 4 will come out 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.330
 for next generation consoles 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.250
 also so what to say I wanted 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.080
 simply tell you this and tell you too 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.810
 that multiplayer.it has seen a preview 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.489
 of the demo game in new york in a way 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.650
 private course together with others 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.680
 news organizations said that 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.430
 the console version is still a few 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.590
 problem of framerate aliasing 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.790
 unstable but obviously still missing 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.350
 many months there is time for 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.600
 optimization I'm sure when 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.910
 they will launch it will be really perfect 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.620
 under points from all points of view 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.380
 I just wanted to clarify this 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.100
 I wait and see you at the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.100
 next bye bye
