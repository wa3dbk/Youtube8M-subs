let's go on to the mod alright so we're

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.310 
let's go on to the mod alright so we're
back<00:01:33.640> in<00:01:33.820> our<00:01:34.000> world<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.659> reason<00:01:35.079> why<00:01:35.289> I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
back in our world and the reason why I

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.289 
back in our world and the reason why I
was<00:01:35.740> actually<00:01:35.920> starting<00:01:36.369> from<00:01:36.670> here<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.119> not

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
was actually starting from here and not

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.319 
was actually starting from here and not
inside<00:01:37.899> is<00:01:38.200> because<00:01:39.159> as<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.520> can<00:01:39.820> see<00:01:39.880> from

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
inside is because as you can see from

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.779 
inside is because as you can see from
the<00:01:40.450> windows<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.170> placed<00:01:41.890> birds<00:01:42.219> in<00:01:42.430> there<00:01:42.579> and

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
the windows I placed birds in there and

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.910 
the windows I placed birds in there and
I<00:01:42.939> actually<00:01:43.119> did<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> bit<00:01:43.899> different<00:01:44.649> stuff

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
I actually did a bit different stuff

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
down so here we go so it's actually

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.320 
down so here we go so it's actually
going<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.860> make<00:05:39.980> some<00:05:40.190> movement<00:05:40.580> sounds<00:05:41.180> like

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
going to make some movement sounds like

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.610 
going to make some movement sounds like
when<00:05:41.480> it<00:05:41.570> actually<00:05:41.840> moves<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.290> makes<00:05:42.410> like<00:05:42.560> a

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
when it actually moves and makes like a

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.860 
when it actually moves and makes like a
robotic<00:05:43.040> sound<00:05:43.400> so<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:44.180> is<00:05:44.330> pretty<00:05:44.510> cool<00:05:44.630> and

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
robotic sound so that is pretty cool and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.870 
robotic sound so that is pretty cool and
also<00:05:45.110> just<00:05:45.350> like<00:05:45.470> background<00:05:46.010> music<00:05:46.550> as<00:05:46.670> well

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
also just like background music as well

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.570 
also just like background music as well
so<00:05:47.180> let's<00:05:47.390> just<00:05:47.570> turn<00:05:47.750> this<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:47.960> bit<00:05:48.410> like<00:05:49.220> that

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
so let's just turn this a bit like that

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.650 
so let's just turn this a bit like that
and<00:05:49.820> what<00:05:49.940> we're<00:05:50.030> going<00:05:50.120> to<00:05:50.180> do<00:05:50.330> am<00:05:50.450> I<00:05:50.570> actually

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
and what we're going to do am I actually

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.990 
and what we're going to do am I actually
lag<00:05:51.140> not<00:05:51.860> too<00:05:52.040> sure<00:05:52.220> sources<00:05:52.640> remove

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
lag not too sure sources remove

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.480 
lag not too sure sources remove
everything<00:05:53.480> around<00:05:53.780> us<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:54.170> let's<00:05:54.800> spawn

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
everything around us and let's spawn

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.010 
everything around us and let's spawn
this<00:05:56.150> rowboat<00:05:57.140> clock<00:05:57.710> in<00:05:57.950> so<00:05:58.400> here<00:05:58.640> we<00:05:58.760> go<00:05:59.020> look

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
this rowboat clock in so here we go look

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.680 
this rowboat clock in so here we go look
at<00:06:00.140> that<00:06:00.350> making<00:06:01.100> a<00:06:01.220> sound<00:06:01.460> making<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.420> sound

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
at that making a sound making the sound

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.750 
at that making a sound making the sound
now<00:06:02.900> let's<00:06:03.170> just<00:06:03.320> change<00:06:03.410> it<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.770> nighttime

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
now let's just change it to nighttime

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.370 
now let's just change it to nighttime
that's<00:06:05.090> the<00:06:05.390> reason<00:06:05.690> why<00:06:05.780> it's<00:06:05.960> burning<00:06:06.290> up

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
that's the reason why it's burning up

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.320 
that's the reason why it's burning up
but<00:06:07.100> look<00:06:07.220> at<00:06:07.310> that<00:06:07.430> look<00:06:07.670> at<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.300> sounds<00:06:10.330> how

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
but look at that look at the sounds how

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.220 
but look at that look at the sounds how
cool<00:06:11.690> was<00:06:11.840> that<00:06:12.790> how<00:06:13.790> cool<00:06:14.180> is<00:06:14.300> that<00:06:14.330> guys<00:06:14.840> and

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
creative so we can have a better look at

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.800 
creative so we can have a better look at
this<00:07:10.890> guy<00:07:11.160> and<00:07:11.430> it<00:07:11.520> is<00:07:11.670> a<00:07:11.880> bit<00:07:12.060> laggy<00:07:12.270> a<00:07:12.570> bit

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
this guy and it is a bit laggy a bit

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.150 
this guy and it is a bit laggy a bit
laggy<00:07:12.990> when<00:07:13.230> you<00:07:13.320> go<00:07:13.410> next<00:07:13.590> to<00:07:13.800> it<00:07:13.890> so<00:07:14.010> maybe

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
laggy when you go next to it so maybe

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.620 
laggy when you go next to it so maybe
don't<00:07:14.460> go<00:07:14.610> next<00:07:14.880> to<00:07:14.970> it<00:07:15.090> maybe<00:07:15.240> that's<00:07:15.450> not<00:07:15.570> a

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
don't go next to it maybe that's not a

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.990 
don't go next to it maybe that's not a
good<00:07:15.720> idea<00:07:16.110> but<00:07:16.260> look<00:07:16.530> at<00:07:16.650> that<00:07:16.800> look<00:07:17.040> at<00:07:17.790> that

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
good idea but look at that look at that

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.870 
good idea but look at that look at that
