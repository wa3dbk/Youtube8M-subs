00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.429 

if<00:00:16.699> my<00:00:16.850> voice<00:00:17.000> sounds<00:00:17.390> shaky<00:00:18.050> it's<00:00:18.260> because

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
if my voice sounds shaky it's because

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.230 
if my voice sounds shaky it's because
I'm<00:00:18.590> really<00:00:18.830> cold<00:00:19.039> it's<00:00:19.490> winter<00:00:19.849> right<00:00:19.880> now

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
I'm really cold it's winter right now

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.319 
I'm really cold it's winter right now
and<00:00:20.509> all<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:20.930> have<00:00:21.230> on<00:00:21.380> is<00:00:21.590> a<00:00:21.619> t-shirt<00:00:22.210> don't<00:00:23.210> ask

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
and all I have on is a t-shirt don't ask

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.580 
and all I have on is a t-shirt don't ask
me<00:00:23.419> why<00:00:25.029> yeah<00:00:26.029> first<00:00:26.960> thing<00:00:27.020> I<00:00:27.140> see<00:00:27.349> is<00:00:27.560> this

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
me why yeah first thing I see is this

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
me why yeah first thing I see is this
blue<00:00:28.039> white<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:28.579> orange<00:00:29.450> white<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:31.070> know

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
blue white and orange white and I know

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.250 
blue white and orange white and I know
that<00:00:31.820> if<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:31.969> go<00:00:32.090> like<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.419> I<00:00:32.599> can<00:00:32.780> get<00:00:32.899> both<00:00:33.050> of

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
that if I go like that I can get both of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.290 
that if I go like that I can get both of
them<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.950> bad<00:00:34.160> thing<00:00:34.190> with<00:00:34.790> that<00:00:35.000> is<00:00:35.059> that

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
them the bad thing with that is that

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.100 
them the bad thing with that is that
these<00:00:36.230> two<00:00:36.500> pieces<00:00:36.680> would<00:00:37.280> be<00:00:37.430> in<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.670> correct

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
these two pieces would be in the correct

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.080 
these two pieces would be in the correct
relative<00:00:39.110> position<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.770> blue<00:00:40.160> but<00:00:40.910> they're

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
relative position to blue but they're

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.250 
relative position to blue but they're
both<00:00:41.270> flipped<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.020> don't<00:00:42.289> like<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:42.739> I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
both flipped so I don't like that I

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.080 
both flipped so I don't like that I
think<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.440> better<00:00:47.079> better<00:00:48.079> thing<00:00:48.380> to<00:00:48.410> do<00:00:48.770> I

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
think a better better thing to do I

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.860 
think a better better thing to do I
don't<00:00:50.090> think<00:00:50.210> this<00:00:50.270> was<00:00:50.420> even<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.720> right

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
don't think this was even the right

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.220 
don't think this was even the right
scramble<00:00:52.270> well<00:00:53.270> okay<00:00:53.540> so<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.930> piece<00:00:54.079> is

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
scramble well okay so the piece is

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.080 
scramble well okay so the piece is
already<00:00:54.470> in<00:00:54.560> there<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:55.340> don't<00:00:55.850> actually

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
already in there and I don't actually

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.300 
already in there and I don't actually
even<00:00:56.420> remember<00:00:56.870> what<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.020> did<00:00:57.110> so<00:00:57.680> I'm<00:00:58.130> just

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
even remember what I did so I'm just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.340 
even remember what I did so I'm just
going<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:58.579> say<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.940> i<00:00:58.970> butchered<00:00:59.329> my<00:01:00.079> cross

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
going to say that i butchered my cross

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.100 
going to say that i butchered my cross
during<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.770> solve<00:01:00.980> which<00:01:01.130> happens<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:01.700> lot

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
during the solve which happens a lot

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.020 
during the solve which happens a lot
believe<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.200> or<00:01:03.260> not<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:03.710> I'm<00:01:04.549> going<00:01:04.759> to<00:01:04.820> say

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
believe it or not so I'm going to say

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.030 
believe it or not so I'm going to say
that<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:05.420> accidentally<00:01:06.079> did<00:01:06.229> that<00:01:06.439> i<00:01:06.649> didn't

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
that I accidentally did that i didn't

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.069 
that I accidentally did that i didn't
use<00:01:07.250> inspection<00:01:07.790> well<00:01:07.970> enough<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:08.990> i'm

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
use inspection well enough and so i'm

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.399 
use inspection well enough and so i'm
left<00:01:09.290> with<00:01:09.439> this<00:01:09.920> case<00:01:10.130> right<00:01:10.340> here<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:12.350> is

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
left with this case right here this is

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.709 
left with this case right here this is
not<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.710> lost<00:01:12.950> cause<00:01:13.180> what<00:01:14.180> you'll<00:01:14.299> notice<00:01:14.479> is

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
not a lost cause what you'll notice is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.780 
not a lost cause what you'll notice is
that<00:01:14.780> i<00:01:15.049> have<00:01:15.229> an<00:01:15.320> f2l<00:01:15.649> pair<00:01:15.649> right<00:01:15.979> there<00:01:16.250> then

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
that i have an f2l pair right there then

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.450 
that i have an f2l pair right there then
i<00:01:16.820> can<00:01:17.030> preserve<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.690> then<00:01:17.930> i<00:01:18.620> also<00:01:18.830> see<00:01:19.310> these

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
i can preserve and then i also see these

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.300 
i can preserve and then i also see these
two<00:01:19.700> right<00:01:19.940> here<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.570> what<00:01:21.560> i<00:01:21.590> can<00:01:21.770> do<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.070> i<00:01:22.280> can

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
two right here so what i can do is i can

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.130 
two right here so what i can do is i can
do<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:22.670> notice<00:01:23.180> it's<00:01:23.330> in<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.479> back<00:01:23.720> now<00:01:23.930> and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
do this notice it's in the back now and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.200 
do this notice it's in the back now and
it's<00:01:24.290> still<00:01:24.470> preserved<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.180> as<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:27.049> fix<00:01:27.350> this

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
it's still preserved and as I fix this

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.820 
it's still preserved and as I fix this
it's<00:01:29.210> not<00:01:29.390> back<00:01:29.600> here<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.049> i<00:01:30.080> have<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.350> very<00:01:30.500> easy

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
it's not back here so i have a very easy

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.070 
it's not back here so i have a very easy
first<00:01:31.580> pair<00:01:32.080> what<00:01:33.080> I<00:01:33.110> also<00:01:33.320> know<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.979> that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
first pair what I also know is that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
first pair what I also know is that
there<00:01:36.080> are<00:01:36.110> two<00:01:36.320> pieces<00:01:36.500> here<00:01:36.830> that<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:37.010> want

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
there are two pieces here that I want

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.359 
there are two pieces here that I want
and<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:38.390> see<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.080> also<00:01:39.290> makes<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.680> pair<00:01:39.890> so

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
and I see that this also makes a pair so

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.950 
and I see that this also makes a pair so
something<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:40.760> could<00:01:40.909> do<00:01:40.970> right<00:01:41.119> now<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.360> before

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
something I could do right now is before

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.320 
something I could do right now is before
even<00:01:42.140> inserting<00:01:42.619> this<00:01:42.740> on<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.670> can<00:01:43.909> knock<00:01:44.090> this

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
even inserting this on I can knock this

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.800 
even inserting this on I can knock this
one<00:01:44.600> out<00:01:44.810> but<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:46.549> think<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:47.330> keep<00:01:47.630> things

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
one out but I think to keep things

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.020 
one out but I think to keep things
simple<00:01:47.990> I'm<00:01:48.260> just<00:01:48.439> going<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.590> do<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:52.030> so

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
simple I'm just going to do this and so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.090 
simple I'm just going to do this and so
right<00:01:53.990> now<00:01:54.020> I'm<00:01:54.560> going<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.740> do<00:01:54.799> something<00:01:54.979> a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
right now I'm going to do something a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.830 
right now I'm going to do something a
little<00:01:55.130> bit<00:01:55.280> tricky<00:01:55.700> pretty<00:01:56.090> clever<00:01:56.330> in<00:01:56.689> my

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
little bit tricky pretty clever in my

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.190 
little bit tricky pretty clever in my
opinion<00:01:57.610> so<00:01:58.610> normally<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.420> would<00:01:59.689> do<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.869> cube

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
opinion so normally you would do a cube

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.870 
opinion so normally you would do a cube
rotation<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.950> then<00:02:01.070> pair<00:02:01.340> these<00:02:01.490> two<00:02:01.729> up

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
rotation and then pair these two up

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.630 
rotation and then pair these two up
using<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.420> empty<00:02:02.750> slot<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:03.350> see<00:02:04.310> these<00:02:04.490> two

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
using this empty slot I see these two

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.760 
using this empty slot I see these two
pieces<00:02:04.820> if<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.960> don't<00:02:06.170> get<00:02:06.259> these<00:02:06.409> out<00:02:06.560> right

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
pieces if I don't get these out right

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.229 
pieces if I don't get these out right
now<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.159> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.310> be<00:02:07.400> hassle<00:02:07.850> if<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.149> is

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
now it's going to be hassle if this is

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.850 
now it's going to be hassle if this is
my<00:02:08.360> fourth<00:02:08.599> f2l<00:02:09.019> pair<00:02:09.019> because<00:02:09.530> I'm<00:02:09.679> going<00:02:09.799> to

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
my fourth f2l pair because I'm going to

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.679 
my fourth f2l pair because I'm going to
have<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:09.979> break<00:02:10.610> them<00:02:10.700> up<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.120> then<00:02:11.239> you<00:02:11.510> know

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:11.689 
have to break them up and then you know

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.050 
have to break them up and then you know
do<00:02:11.840> all<00:02:11.870> sorts<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.349> crazy<00:02:12.950> stuff<00:02:13.040> so<00:02:13.790> instead

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
do all sorts of crazy stuff so instead

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.149 
do all sorts of crazy stuff so instead
i'm<00:02:14.269> going<00:02:14.299> to<00:02:14.480> do<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.629> you<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.260> notice<00:02:16.040> these

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
i'm going to do a you and notice these

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.160 
i'm going to do a you and notice these
are<00:02:16.310> not<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.819> same<00:02:16.970> color<00:02:17.239> but<00:02:17.480> i'm<00:02:17.959> going<00:02:18.110> to

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
are not the same color but i'm going to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.030 
are not the same color but i'm going to
perform<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.680> same<00:02:19.510> same<00:02:20.510> step<00:02:20.840> as<00:02:20.870> if<00:02:21.260> they

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
perform the same same step as if they

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.370 
perform the same same step as if they
were<00:02:22.099> over<00:02:22.430> here<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.880> notice<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.810> these<00:02:24.110> two

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
were over here and notice that these two

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.470 
were over here and notice that these two
are<00:02:24.590> now<00:02:25.130> up<00:02:25.400> here<00:02:25.430> so

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
are now up here so

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.570 
are now up here so
the<00:02:26.930> next<00:02:27.200> step<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.530> once<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.190> do<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.340> cue

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
the next step is once I do a cue

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.309 
the next step is once I do a cue
rotation<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.860> insert<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:32.629> these

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
rotation I insert this but now these

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.199 
rotation I insert this but now these
start<00:02:33.560> broken<00:02:33.860> up<00:02:33.980> completely<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:34.670> before

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
start broken up completely so before

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.180 
start broken up completely so before
these<00:02:35.360> two<00:02:35.540> were<00:02:35.629> down<00:02:35.750> here<00:02:35.950> by<00:02:36.950> pairing

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
these two were down here by pairing

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.339 
these two were down here by pairing
these<00:02:37.519> up<00:02:37.819> they<00:02:38.299> were<00:02:38.360> still<00:02:38.810> together<00:02:38.989> but

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
these up they were still together but

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.690 
these up they were still together but
they<00:02:39.470> were<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:39.709> least<00:02:39.769> out<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.220> slot<00:02:40.459> and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
they were at least out of the slot and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.280 
they were at least out of the slot and
then<00:02:40.730> by<00:02:40.970> inserting<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.569> I<00:02:41.780> broke<00:02:42.019> them<00:02:42.140> up

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
then by inserting this I broke them up

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.680 
then by inserting this I broke them up
so<00:02:42.500> that's<00:02:42.620> really<00:02:42.950> really<00:02:43.220> nice<00:02:43.450> at<00:02:44.450> this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
so that's really really nice at this

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.479 
so that's really really nice at this
step<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:46.629> think<00:02:47.629> what<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.870> would<00:02:47.959> do<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.459> would

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
step I think what I would do is I would

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.589 
step I think what I would do is I would
actually<00:02:49.879> do<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.650> pair<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.739> up<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:52.040> way<00:02:52.250> and

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
actually do this pair it up that way and

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.030 
actually do this pair it up that way and
go<00:02:53.599> like<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.200> now<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.250> have<00:02:55.459> these<00:02:55.700> two<00:02:55.940> um

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
go like that and now I have these two um

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.900 
go like that and now I have these two um
this<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.310> going<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.640> require<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.569> cube<00:03:00.110> rotation

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
this is going to require a cube rotation

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.319 
this is going to require a cube rotation
and<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.090> way<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.840> know<00:03:03.079> these<00:03:03.319> things<00:03:03.650> is

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
and the way you know these things is

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.539 
and the way you know these things is
because<00:03:05.329> this<00:03:06.170> edge<00:03:06.410> piece<00:03:06.709> if<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.129> just<00:03:07.370> use

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
because this edge piece if I just use

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.240 
because this edge piece if I just use
art<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:08.090> our<00:03:08.599> UNL<00:03:09.079> moves<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.829> put<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.099> down

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
art and our UNL moves I can put it down

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.710 
art and our UNL moves I can put it down
this<00:03:10.430> way<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.849> this<00:03:11.329> is<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.569> wrong

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
this way and this is the wrong

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.930 
this way and this is the wrong
orientation<00:03:12.049> so<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.530> know<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.519> put<00:03:13.819> this

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
orientation so I know that to put this

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.080 
orientation so I know that to put this
in<00:03:14.150> using<00:03:14.900> only<00:03:15.049> are<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.290> an<00:03:15.530> L<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.890> D<00:03:16.519> I<00:03:16.760> guess

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
in using only are you an L and D I guess

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.759 
in using only are you an L and D I guess
um<00:03:17.390> I'm<00:03:18.019> going<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.260> have<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.379> do<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.530> cube

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
um I'm going to have to do a cube

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.170 
um I'm going to have to do a cube
rotation<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:19.459> go<00:03:20.299> like<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:21.530> set<00:03:21.799> it<00:03:21.890> up

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
rotation so go like this to set it up

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.339 
rotation so go like this to set it up
you<00:03:23.180> two<00:03:23.209> cube<00:03:24.140> rotation<00:03:24.620> insert<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.900> a

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
you two cube rotation insert this is a

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:34.300 
you two cube rotation insert this is a
awesome<00:03:28.190> oh<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:30.970> here<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.510> is<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.660> V<00:03:32.930> perm<00:03:33.310> a

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
awesome oh and here this is a V perm a

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.550 
awesome oh and here this is a V perm a
really<00:03:35.030> easy<00:03:35.150> way<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.510> recognize<00:03:35.900> v<00:03:36.290> firms

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
really easy way to recognize v firms

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.080 
really easy way to recognize v firms
from<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.950> perms<00:03:37.220> you're<00:03:37.609> going<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.819> see<00:03:37.940> this

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
from a perms you're going to see this

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.960 
from a perms you're going to see this
block<00:03:38.329> on<00:03:38.480> both<00:03:38.750> if<00:03:39.500> these<00:03:39.829> are<00:03:40.010> if<00:03:40.519> these

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
block on both if these are if these

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.530 
block on both if these are if these
colors<00:03:41.450> are<00:03:41.690> opposite<00:03:42.319> on<00:03:43.269> then<00:03:44.269> you<00:03:44.389> know

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
colors are opposite on then you know

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.120 
colors are opposite on then you know
that<00:03:44.750> you're<00:03:44.989> going<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.260> have<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.620> perm<00:03:45.859> if

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
that you're going to have the perm if

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.979 
that you're going to have the perm if
they're<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.579> same<00:03:46.609> color<00:03:47.090> if<00:03:47.329> these<00:03:47.810> two<00:03:47.959> are

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
they're the same color if these two are

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:48.970 
they're the same color if these two are
the<00:03:48.049> same<00:03:48.230> color<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.590> know<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.799> have<00:03:48.889> an

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
the same color you know you have an

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.729 
the same color you know you have an
apron<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:50.329> is<00:03:50.359> V<00:03:50.630> perm<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:53.470> UF<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.590> you're

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
apron so this is V perm a UF and you're

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.859 
apron so this is V perm a UF and you're
done
