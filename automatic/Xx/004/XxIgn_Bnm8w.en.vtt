 thank you very much for your visits and good 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.059
 I want to introduce you now we are going to 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.780
 start as in season 1 we are going to 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.270
 start with fish for beginners and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.840
 we are going to increase the level and I'm going 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.430
 to introduce a fish for beginners 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.629
 he is nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.629
 Host in front of your 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.120
 what is a fish there its tomato 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.080
 there we can see the couple of fish 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.220
 clown regularly the females are more 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.430
 great is that you have the female 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.160
 to be 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.460
 about two centimeters one or two 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.409
 centimeters larger than the male 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.440
 and well I now tell you 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.159
 this is not yet a couple but without 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.159
 place to doubt 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.180
 the fact that they can live together 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.090
 together in the same aquarium 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.030
 these are already very healthy regularly 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.910
 clown fish tomato for those who already 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.500
 They know a little of the matter as 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.500
 they really are demons 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.950
 some authentic 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.600
 got damn 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.460
 many many people try not to have 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.659
 this kind of fish because it's very 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.410
 territorial let's see the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:12.090
 behavior if they notice the male 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.090
 keeps it a little bit at bay 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.590
 and the behavior 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.410
 but it is an aggressive behavior 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.250
 passive 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 we can say that they avoid the macho 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.010
 regularly be in the areas of the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.500
 female and is very healthy because if you do not 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.250
 they will be good for nothing simply not 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.010
 could live in an aquarium of 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.570
 preference if it is asked to be a 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:47.340
 minimum aquarium of 200 liters per 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.739
 Territory skill of this type of fish 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.890
 and that the aquarium has enough 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.310
 rock so you can hide the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.190
 another individual can measure up to 10 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.519
 centimeters in his adult age and good the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.640
 favorite anemone of these little friends is 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.720
 which color or anne moss a bubble 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.720
 in which you are 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.380
 and how well we were discussing it 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.160
 then it is a very important matter 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.160
 aggressive 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.840
 me when I put my hand for some reason 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.599
 to clean the aquarium 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.480
 or for any circumstance that you have to 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.670
 I have dropped a stone 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.099
 regularly the female releases me 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.520
 small taps with the mouth what 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.650
 me 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.470
 indicates is that it is highly territorial 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.770
 even this female and good the fact that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.460
 I told them to live together 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.930
 with another clownfish tomato because he talks to me 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.700
 that in the future we could put together a 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.430
 couple then this is the story 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.120
 I want to start writing from my 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.299
 clown fish tomato see well 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.390
 it is territorial clear as all tomato 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.519
 but as I was telling you, it is a 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.549
 territorially in a controlled manner if 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.340
 they realize the male has the fins 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.229
 complete does not have a single bite and 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.269
 they are already living together living here 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.549
 about two months 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.220
 If i were 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.590
 a 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.889
 very constant pressure because practically 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.680
 the male was not even alive anymore 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.330
 and regularly now associates this 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.789
 territorial activity or we see it a lot 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.680
 in this video because she is very attentive to 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.509
 the female knows that when I approach 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.610
 because I 'm going to feed them and that's what 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.340
 that is waiting for food and that's why 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.249
 behaves behaves even more aggressively 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.919
 what really is 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:49.649
 and good if you want to start in 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:53.069
 this world with a clown fish I 

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:55.589
 I recommend the tomato clown is for 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.700
 beginners if you are going to start with a 

00:04:55.589 --> 00:05:01.710
 Aquarius 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.710
 This is a good friend to start 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.560
 and in experience he tells me that they are from the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.050
 first clowns that grasp the anemone 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.090
 regularly clowns per ass 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.550
 or clark that even takes a little 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.529
 more in grasping the anemone and this kind of 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.379
 clowns are aggressive but 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.389
 well controlled and well studied 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.870
 they can become a wonder in their 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.870
 cheer up 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.580
 and that's great I would recommend that 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.409
 if you are going to start with a clown fish 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.710
 tomato 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:38.070
 eye introduce 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.450
 to the couple that is a female more 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.350
 great that the other remembers that the 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.540
 clown fish are all hermaphrodites the 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.790
 biggest clown will become 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.610
 the female or is the female and the clown more 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.010
 small the little ones in the nature 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.440
 are going to be the males once the 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.870
 female or that the biggest clown gets 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.840
 becomes a female can no longer return 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.130
 to your macho stage this is very 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.290
 important that you keep it in mind 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:09.220
 because if you buy a clown 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:12.250
 large is likely to be female 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.680
 can not go back to the macho stage if 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.410
 you buy two females then there they go 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.030
 to have problems yes or yes because they are going to 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.030
 be two females in the aquarium and they go 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.770
 to be fighting until one 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.750
 unfortunately lose your life that's the 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.750
 most important data that they have to have 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.030
 watch out 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.820
 with regard to clowns after 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.070
 there they are very very respectful with another 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.910
 type of fish for example those of the 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.840
 damsels that have a beautiful color and 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.610
 out there 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.610
 a little fish that I will soon 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.699
 the token 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.699
 it's the french angel 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.350
 and good coexists with the starfish 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.330
 who already know her 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.760
 and the brunette that at this moment 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.380
 it is hidden because there is no food 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.330
 Well, it does not come out 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.390
 well, practically everyone would say 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.080
 data if you want to start with a fish 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:15.060
 nice colors and very resistant so you 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.060
 I recommend the clown fish tomato 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.090
 as long as you take into account 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.340
 these recommendations that I make you 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.900
 whether it is the couple that is one more 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.960
 large than the other that are introduced to 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.880
 same time to avoid aggression 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.320
 future 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.770
 and good that your aquarium is 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.030
 mainly from 200 liters and up 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:37.100
 so they have room to give 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.440
 remember that they are species that fast 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.210
 grow up 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.689
 and the best thing is that they have a space 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.119
 suitable for nothing 

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:48.440
 I thank you for your visits I sent 

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:53.380
 please your videos 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.380
 my name is jose luis see you later
