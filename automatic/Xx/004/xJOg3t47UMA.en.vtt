00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.910
 you will rush to them without any capture of points 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.050
 something reluctant to mess with these points 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.039
 I want to break through and stumble so 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.180

 simus boil up to someone else and 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.580

 actually private owner to take something 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:44.520
 We're going to just the enemy to the base without 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:48.539
 superfluous objections as they say the plane 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.149
 I love the small auto plane back 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:58.950

 very quickly stabilized induced 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.950

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.630

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.590
 although we are not trying to look there object 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.510
 but there's nothing you can do 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.510
 there's nothing you can do 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:38.580

 pretty quick shoots by the way 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:05.710

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.930

 t3 fours in principle this is it 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.900
 An improved version I think so well 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:48.310

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.820

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.670
 ally 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:04:01.080
 I struck for the side more precisely so where 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.080
 they all did not even know 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.620
 I feel tomorrow morning will be gone 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.110
 only this mode 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.850
 lead something new they by the way to 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.160
 we can also drive to the base 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.770
 return 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:21.940
 You can safely return without any constraint 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:24.510
 do not give the enemy concessions Okay saytik 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.410

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:33.840

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:38.910

 I can't stand you but I know you 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:48.360
 I don't see you, but I know you 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.430
 practice and non mansi teams 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:57.470
 don't spoil 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:00.590
 And the boys do not spoil as well 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.790
 and it is not yet rapid-Puskas 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.270

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.270
 I shoot 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.940
 well we will have a kit allows 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:22.570
 indulge okay we will not be distracted by 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.570
 him here for now 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.560
 and we will go to protect the shield or 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.990
 website our way to you in the second 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.990
 disassembled that in general it is not surprising 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:43.590
 I understand the enemy's plan and the need to 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.630
 prevent conceived by him therefore we 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.229
 I’ll just go around it I don’t know maybe 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.690
 worth it in the side to get lost but somehow 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:54.210
 it's very risky you know let's 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.510
 better here first take a back and 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.919
 then we will deal with this 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.770
 for sure the more he is now to us 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:11.810
 right will stand well like you 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:16.050
 do you understand him ? 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:20.000
 right on target you 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.289
 and now you can and take this 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.900
 the main thing is that in our brain and it is not 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.599
 took it back and side more precisely below 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.669
 let's say we make it easier behind here 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.889
 hardly anybody else there 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:36.110
 on the right, too, I would not have stood there 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.110
 would go with my company 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:44.670
 so destroyed our ally after all 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.670
 nothing surprising 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.190
 So 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:56.760
 you 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:59.070
 covered my commander you so 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:04.590
 charging us alive and well 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:06.310
 bam and quiet quiet quiet 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.370
 fine 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:16.500
 so start they have 1 min left and all 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:26.960
 shorter hike we won 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:26.960
