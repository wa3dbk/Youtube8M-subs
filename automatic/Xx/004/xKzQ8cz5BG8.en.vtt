that<00:00:12.960> he's<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.469> race<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.160> my<00:00:14.490> question<00:00:14.969> is

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
that he's in the race so my question is

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240 
that he's in the race so my question is
can<00:00:15.839> Rick<00:00:16.109> Perry<00:00:16.350> actually<00:00:16.800> win<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
presidency and that is a hell of a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.950 
presidency and that is a hell of a
question<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.720> there's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
question because I think that there's

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.830 
question because I think that there's
some<00:00:22.199> chance<00:00:22.490> Jimmy<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.699> know<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.689> know

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
some chance Jimmy you know if you know

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.769 
some chance Jimmy you know if you know

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
playing George Bush in the movie w-wow

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.229 
playing George Bush in the movie w-wow
right<00:00:46.110> yeah<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.399> I'm<00:00:47.579> thinking<00:00:47.969> really

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
right yeah and and I'm thinking really

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
right yeah and and I'm thinking really
we're<00:00:48.629> gonna<00:00:48.870> go<00:00:49.079> back<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.680> direction

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
we're gonna go back in that direction

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
we're gonna go back in that direction
but<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> other<00:00:50.969> hand<00:00:51.090> Michael<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.629> think

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
but on the other hand Michael I think

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.180 
but on the other hand Michael I think
there<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:51.930> three<00:00:52.230> Republicans<00:00:52.770> who<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.039> win

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
there are three Republicans who can win

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.869 
there are three Republicans who can win
having<00:00:53.579> Romney<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.260> Perry<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.640> think

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
having Romney I think Perry and I think

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.520 
having Romney I think Perry and I think
Huckabee<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.449> he<00:00:57.539> gets<00:00:57.690> back<00:00:57.870> into<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> race<00:00:58.320> I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
Huckabee if he gets back into the race I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
Huckabee if he gets back into the race I
think<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.100> only<00:00:59.309> three<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> knock

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
think there was only three like a knock

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
think there was only three like a knock
off<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> course<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.660> could<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.870> wrong<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
off of course I could be wrong but I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.189 
off of course I could be wrong but I
think<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.670> mean<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.120> first<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
think I mean I think first of all the it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
think I mean I think first of all the it
it<00:01:04.530> shows<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> fluidity<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.880> race<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it shows the fluidity of this race I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.520 
it shows the fluidity of this race I
mean<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.750> shows<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> they're<00:01:07.320> not

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
mean it just shows that they're not

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
mean it just shows that they're not
happy<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.040> their<00:01:08.340> candidates<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.970> somebody

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
happy with their candidates are somebody

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.990 
happy with their candidates are somebody
comes<00:01:10.110> along<00:01:10.260> goes<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> head<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> pack

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
comes along goes to the head of the pack

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.130 
comes along goes to the head of the pack
of<00:01:12.210> course<00:01:12.390> these<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.689> polls<00:01:12.990> were

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
of course these are just polls were

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.649 
of course these are just polls were
relying<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.680> George<00:01:14.490> Pataki<00:01:14.820> now<00:01:15.150> deciding

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
relying on George Pataki now deciding

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.450 
relying on George Pataki now deciding
whether<00:01:15.810> or<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.259> run<00:01:16.439> Sarah<00:01:17.040> Palin

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
whether or not to run Sarah Palin

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
whether or not to run Sarah Palin
deciding<00:01:17.820> whether<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.360> run<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.780> course

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
deciding whether or not to run of course

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
deciding whether or not to run of course
I<00:01:19.470> still<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.580> Jeb<00:01:20.790> Bush<00:01:20.970> got<00:01:21.450> him

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
I still think that if Jeb Bush got him

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.550 
I still think that if Jeb Bush got him
to<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> race<00:01:21.900> he<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.200> win<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> nomination

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to the race he would win the nomination

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.399 
to the race he would win the nomination
hands-down<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> think<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.259> know

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
hands-down so I think that that you know

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.020 
hands-down so I think that that you know
they're<00:01:25.619> undecided<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.520> also<00:01:26.640> can't

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
they're undecided and they also can't

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
they're undecided and they also can't
figure<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.659> their<00:01:27.840> constituency<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.710> if

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
figure out what their constituency is if

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920 
figure out what their constituency is if
they're<00:01:29.369> try<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.729> independent<00:01:30.240> white<00:01:30.659> males

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
they're try if independent white males

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.929 
they're try if independent white males
in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> Midwest<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> swing

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
in the Midwest are the are the swing

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
in the Midwest are the are the swing
votes<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.479> election<00:01:33.540> yeah<00:01:34.470> Mitt<00:01:34.740> Romney

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
votes in this election yeah Mitt Romney

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
votes in this election yeah Mitt Romney
and<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> better<00:01:36.810> shot<00:01:37.079> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and I would think a better shot of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.660 
and I would think a better shot of
getting<00:01:37.530> those<00:01:37.650> voters<00:01:38.070> than<00:01:38.250> does<00:01:38.460> Rick

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
getting those voters than does Rick

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
anyway okay but so here's the thing

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.319

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
right

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.090 
right
obviously<00:02:06.229> he<00:02:06.380> appeals<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.740> social

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
obviously he appeals to social

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.650 
obviously he appeals to social
conservatives<00:02:07.640> but<00:02:07.939> at<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.149> same<00:02:08.300> time<00:02:08.509> he

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
conservatives but at the same time he

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.029 
conservatives but at the same time he
appeals<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.989> economic<00:02:09.470> conservatives<00:02:09.920> that's

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
appeals to economic conservatives that's

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.800 
appeals to economic conservatives that's
why<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.250> always<00:02:10.459> thought<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:11.000> if<00:02:11.300> he<00:02:11.420> got<00:02:11.569> in

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
why I always thought that if he got in

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.990 
why I always thought that if he got in
he<00:02:12.050> would<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.349> an<00:02:12.620> incredibly<00:02:13.280> formidable

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
he would be an incredibly formidable

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.970 
he would be an incredibly formidable
candidate<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.900> he's<00:02:15.200> got<00:02:15.379> this<00:02:15.560> record<00:02:15.860> where

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
candidate and he's got this record where

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.199 
candidate and he's got this record where
he<00:02:16.040> could<00:02:16.190> turn<00:02:16.340> around<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.700> say<00:02:16.879> look<00:02:17.000> at<00:02:17.120> all

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
he could turn around and say look at all

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.449 
he could turn around and say look at all
the<00:02:17.330> jobs<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.720> created<00:02:17.989> in<00:02:18.170> Texas<00:02:18.349> now<00:02:19.040> that's

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
the jobs I created in Texas now that's

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.520 
the jobs I created in Texas now that's
there's<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.060> lot<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.540> nuance<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.410> it's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
there's a lot of nuance to that and it's

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.710 
there's a lot of nuance to that and it's
not<00:02:21.620> exactly<00:02:22.040> right<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:22.340> there's<00:02:23.239> some<00:02:23.540> truth

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
not exactly right but there's some truth

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.410 
not exactly right but there's some truth
to<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.959> right<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:24.830> it's<00:02:25.280> at<00:02:25.459> least<00:02:25.489> enough<00:02:26.060> for

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
to it right so it's at least enough for

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.119 
to it right so it's at least enough for
a<00:02:26.450> Republican<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.049> be<00:02:27.200> able<00:02:27.349> to<00:02:27.440> say<00:02:27.560> oh<00:02:27.739> my<00:02:27.920> god

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
a Republican to be able to say oh my god

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.410 
a Republican to be able to say oh my god
I<00:02:28.160> did<00:02:28.370> something<00:02:28.670> good<00:02:28.819> for<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.060> change<00:02:29.120> can

I did something good for a change can

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.759

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.520 
ran on the messages is miracle and and
it<00:02:40.370> was<00:02:40.579> up<00:02:41.150> until<00:02:41.329> then<00:02:41.720> what<00:02:41.870> propelled<00:02:42.319> his

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
it was up until then what propelled his

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.039 
it was up until then what propelled his
candidacy<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.310> 1988<00:02:44.150> then<00:02:44.420> he<00:02:44.569> comes<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:44.959> to

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
candidacy in 1988 then he comes on to

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.020 
candidacy in 1988 then he comes on to
the<00:02:45.200> scene<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.650> they<00:02:45.769> tear<00:02:46.250> apart<00:02:46.519> bit<00:02:46.790> by<00:02:46.849> bit

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
the scene and they tear apart bit by bit

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.360 
the scene and they tear apart bit by bit
what<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.420> miracle<00:02:48.019> was<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.860> think<00:02:49.129> that

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
what that miracle was and I think that

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.530 
what that miracle was and I think that
that<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.819> know<00:02:49.910> there's<00:02:50.090> something<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.510> that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
that you know there's something of that

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.569 
that you know there's something of that
with<00:02:50.870> with<00:02:51.170> what<00:02:52.299> I<00:02:53.299> think<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.690> all<00:02:53.829> depends<00:02:54.829> it

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
with with what I think it all depends it

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.400 
with with what I think it all depends it
depends<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.090> if<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.390> media<00:02:56.690> shows<00:02:57.019> up<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
depends on if the media shows up and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.960

social Security's unconstitutional
Medicare<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.250> unconstitutional<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.150> we<00:03:14.209> see

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
Medicare is unconstitutional and we see

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.059 
Medicare is unconstitutional and we see
what<00:03:14.840> happened<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.260> New<00:03:15.350> York<00:03:15.590> when<00:03:15.799> people

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
what happened in New York when people

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.789 
what happened in New York when people
say<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.430> stuff<00:03:16.670> right<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:18.139> don't<00:03:18.470> I

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
say that stuff right so I I don't I

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.530 
say that stuff right so I I don't I
think<00:03:18.859> if<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.280> media<00:03:19.639> it's<00:03:19.790> all<00:03:19.940> depends<00:03:20.420> and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
think if the media it's all depends and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.420 
think if the media it's all depends and
if<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.720> media<00:03:21.019> shows<00:03:21.319> up<00:03:21.560> right<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:22.280> know<00:03:22.370> to

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
if the media shows up right you know to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.949 
if the media shows up right you know to
be<00:03:22.670> fair<00:03:22.880> now<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.090> think<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.480> media<00:03:23.599> is<00:03:23.750> done<00:03:23.930> a

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
be fair now I think the media is done a

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.960 
be fair now I think the media is done a
pretty<00:03:24.109> decent<00:03:24.290> job<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.769> showing<00:03:25.549> a<00:03:25.639> couple<00:03:25.819> of

pretty decent job of showing a couple of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.550 
pretty decent job of showing a couple of

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
reading too many of the progressive

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.000 
reading too many of the progressive
websites<00:04:07.400> but<00:04:07.669> be<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.750> case<00:04:08.959> but<00:04:09.590> look<00:04:09.859> i

think that there's some chance that at

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:14.830 
think that there's some chance that at
some

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
some

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.840 
some

that<00:04:28.100> kind<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.370> discipline<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.120> think<00:04:29.510> at<00:04:29.570> some

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
that kind of discipline I think at some

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.240 
that kind of discipline I think at some
point<00:04:30.050> he's<00:04:30.169> self<00:04:30.410> destroyed<00:04:30.770> that's<00:04:31.010> a<00:04:31.100> great

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
point he's self destroyed that's a great

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.530 
point he's self destroyed that's a great
point<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.610> mean<00:04:31.699> he<00:04:31.790> doesn't<00:04:31.940> have<00:04:32.090> the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
point I mean he doesn't have the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.719 
point I mean he doesn't have the
infrastructure<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.860> Bush's<00:04:34.250> gave<00:04:34.490> to

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
infrastructure that the Bush's gave to

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.180

for<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.639> candidate<00:04:53.090> again<00:04:53.389> so<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.570> think<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.020> I

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
for a candidate again so I think that I

for a candidate again so I think that I
wouldn't<00:04:54.979> trust<00:04:55.160> these<00:04:55.370> numbers<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:55.940> I

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
wouldn't trust these numbers and I

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.820 
wouldn't trust these numbers and I
certainly<00:04:56.360> would<00:04:56.690> not<00:04:56.870> trust<00:04:57.169> Rick<00:04:57.410> Perry<00:04:57.680> as

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
my nominee if I were a Republican right

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.170 
my nominee if I were a Republican right
now<00:04:59.870> yeah<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:00.830> know<00:05:00.950> what<00:05:01.130> as<00:05:01.280> as<00:05:01.700> bad<00:05:02.150> a

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
now is the thing my theory is that that

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.089 
now is the thing my theory is that that
you<00:05:38.930> know<00:05:39.050> I<00:05:39.080> think<00:05:39.260> that<00:05:39.530> it's<00:05:39.680> all<00:05:39.800> driven<00:05:39.950> by

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
you know I think that it's all driven by

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:40.930 
you know I think that it's all driven by
the<00:05:40.220> money<00:05:40.430> of<00:05:40.520> course

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
the money of course

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.820 
the money of course
man<00:05:41.120> you<00:05:41.330> know<00:05:41.450> so<00:05:41.690> it's<00:05:42.020> all<00:05:42.200> incentives<00:05:42.740> and

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
man you know so it's all incentives and

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.230 
man you know so it's all incentives and
disincentives<00:05:42.889> and<00:05:43.580> if<00:05:43.639> you<00:05:43.700> get<00:05:43.820> money<00:05:44.000> from

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
disincentives and if you get money from

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.310 
disincentives and if you get money from
a<00:05:44.270> certain<00:05:44.539> direction<00:05:44.660> you're<00:05:44.930> gonna<00:05:45.020> go<00:05:45.169> in

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
a certain direction you're gonna go in

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.170 
a certain direction you're gonna go in
that<00:05:45.410> direction<00:05:45.590> generally<00:05:46.310> speaking<00:05:46.610> it's

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
that direction generally speaking it's

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.940 
that direction generally speaking it's
an<00:05:47.539> institutional<00:05:48.200> corruption<00:05:48.440> rather<00:05:48.860> than

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
an institutional corruption rather than

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.790 
an institutional corruption rather than
a<00:05:49.010> personal<00:05:49.340> corruption<00:05:49.610> right<00:05:50.030> so<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:51.349> so

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
a personal corruption right so and so

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.129 
a personal corruption right so and so
the<00:05:52.669> system<00:05:52.880> sets<00:05:53.240> it<00:05:53.389> up<00:05:53.479> so<00:05:53.750> that<00:05:53.780> your<00:05:53.990> only

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
the system sets it up so that your only

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.510 
the system sets it up so that your only
two<00:05:54.380> choices<00:05:54.590> are<00:05:54.919> well<00:05:55.039> you<00:05:55.160> know<00:05:55.340> what<00:05:55.460> the

blow the whole place up right so go
ahead<00:06:05.599> and<00:06:05.690> choose<00:06:05.870> between<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.289> two

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
ahead and choose between the two

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.409 
ahead and choose between the two
corporate<00:06:06.740> robots<00:06:07.070> and<00:06:07.280> so<00:06:08.000> I<00:06:08.030> think<00:06:08.180> that's

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
corporate robots and so I think that's

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.650 
corporate robots and so I think that's
what<00:06:08.630> we're<00:06:08.780> stuck<00:06:08.990> unfortunately
