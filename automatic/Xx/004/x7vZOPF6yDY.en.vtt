00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.210
 this video review of pdf expert 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.210
 director 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.649
 as we have already shown you in 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.689
 many other reviews like me 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.890
 we have already talked about it on the site and the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.140
 law applications are 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.640
 productivity applications 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.040
 I really valid they already use 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.670
 several buso scanners use pdf 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.320
 expert use document five that anders e 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
 printer pro 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.269
 ok made application as the name implies 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.930
 allows us to make the most of pdf files 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:49.199
 on iphone and ipad how it works we can 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.619
 manage both the single file and all 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.820
 pages 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.009
 so besides the classic 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.680
 folder display where we can 

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:57.119
 manage files create folders 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.860
 insert them from dropbox tranche services of 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.170
 online storage from some hard drives 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.680
 shared on the network from remote computers 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.900
 etc 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.780
 we could obviously manage every single one 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.299
 pdf file then export it edit it 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.060
 save it send it by email move it 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.950
 open another application copy it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.100
 extract only pages, etc. 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.579
 create new pages and insert 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.050
 years of the signatures of the objects of the 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.550
 forms and so on 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.050
 in short, we will have a real one 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.700
 pdf editing suite 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.500
 like the best software for 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.870
 the desktop versions we will be able to insert 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.300
 written or in any case hand drawings 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.720
 free goes into a provision of penalties 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.260
 with various colors various types of opacity e 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.270
 size of the stroke we could 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.580
 use four different present 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.830
 which we are showing you will be able to 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.720
 customize with our colors 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.790
 favorite however with the colors that 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.710
 we use more often then we will have to 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.540
 also available a tire to be able to 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.229
 erase everything we have 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.670
 written that maybe we didn't want to write 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.690
 however some trait that there is 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.530
 escaped and we can access others 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.600
 tools of course we can also 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.100
 adjust the size of the rubber and 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.010
 we can access the other tools 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.380
 we can insert an underscore that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.110
 however the line will follow without problems 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.810
 as you are seeing we can use one 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 underline how 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.250
 pen or highlighter or 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.470
 tick our text directly 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.330
 obviously from the dart you see 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.709
 on your right we could also 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.599
 come back 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.190
 and now we're scrolling through a few pages 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.870
 to show you some other function 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.150
 we can insert shapes are 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.459
 available square or rectangular arrows 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.760
 of straight lines we can 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.099
 resize and move every single one 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.220
 form we use obviously change the 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.459
 color is obviously opacity is the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.260
 interesting trait size is 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.799
 this function we are going to 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.440
 show that it practically allows us to 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.120
 then gather various objects from this one 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.430
 selection we could bring together various objects 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.319
 change parameters in common as 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.940
 the color for example the size li 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.099
 we made both greens though 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.220
 we can also choose the size 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.590
 etc 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.480
 this application allows us 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.680
 really doing this anything 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.599
 with the pdf including the signature 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.810
 so we're making notes 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.489
 and notations we can write here test e 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.829
 we can also add another one 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.750
 maybe there's the word documents now 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.400
 add this year go 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.019
 we transcribe test 2 yet we can 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.579
 decide to use stamps then 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.910
 of the stamps of already among those for 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.260
 set or a tic a ics et cetera 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.599
 or even create us for 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.019
 our custom stamp account 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.760
 with a date one hour 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.010
 the phrase in particular something that 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.470
 however we may need it in our file 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.049
 by custom we can click on elite 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.819
 click on the plus and go to insert the 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.709
 Our stamp of course we can 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.709
 change all aspects including the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.769
 color of the book and then use it 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.209
 without problems without having to do any 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.010
 other operation 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.560
 obviously every object we can 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.870
 resize move and so on 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.280
 this also applies to books if you do 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.449
 you are asked about the seeds even going up a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.000
 tic and we can really use them on our own 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.310
 liking to compile ours 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.930
 documents as we said we can 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.240
 also insert a signature now we are one 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.840
 trial signature is obviously the can 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.430
 insert is inserted in the document 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.090
 also being able to resize it to 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.090
 move at will 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.300
 but it's not over we can also 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.680
 use of image prints 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.760
 all those commands we've already seen 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.889
 already by selecting a specific one 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.419
 word a specific section from the menu 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.150
 contextual that will appear we can also 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.760
 if in an audio note I can't do it now 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.470
 show why otherwise it comes 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.240
 screen recording locked 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.430
 of the iphone but I assure you that 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.180
 it works we can insert notes 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.650
 audio and we can also decide to 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.729
 paste directly what 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.319
 we had in the 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.020
 in the notes therefore that it is a text for 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:17.029
 change the color the size e 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.629
 the character we have various layout 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:25.039
 characters including bold italics 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:27.469
 etc. and we can even maybe go 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:33.080
 to copy an item we had taken 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:33.979
 another application without problems from 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.849
 this file we are editing 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:41.139
 however all the commands are explained 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:45.649
 available with in this application 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.379
 however we can re-order delete 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:50.149
 insert new pages do all 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.939
 a series of operations such as select 

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:55.279
 more pages etc. from the grid 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.749
 of the pages of a pdf then it will be enough 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:58.520
 go to the grid you can click on a 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:00.999
 elite and we can do various operations 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.210
 how to delete that to send back by mail 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.559
 extract etc. 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.499
 and then we created a blank page 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:12.289
 where we have precisely to write pages 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:14.029
 Test with a simple brush 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.779
 don't expect any kind of precision 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:21.050
 in writing and I'm not very good 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.399
 so now let's delete I show you 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.800
 however we can create some 

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:26.360
 folders we can move rename i 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.889
 documents we have now moved to 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.080
 test folder also delete the 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.750
 download folder and we also have a 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.480
 provision the 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.430
 icloud the network section where we have 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.990
 many services available anyway 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.210
 we can configure ours 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.310
 devices in network of remote computers e 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.990
 so many pdf options for the file 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.020
 security managers such as 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.340
 a block with code for wifi drive 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.920
 which will allow us to access via 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.390
 browser to all available documents 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.480
 on the net then 6 with the iphone is 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.640
 connected to the same computer network 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.530
 in the application and many others 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.900
 functionality this app is a lot 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.250
 useful is also compared to one more 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.250
 recent free application 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.930
 available for iphone and ipad that we 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.490
 allows you to make changes 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.960
 on the PDFs it always remains the best 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.850
 certainly the most complete and most 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.390
 efficient of course what application 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:24.360
 has a cost is not free and available 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.360
 on the app store for 8 euros and 99 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.760
 I thank you for following me and you 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.030
 I give appointment to the next videos a 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.030
 soon
