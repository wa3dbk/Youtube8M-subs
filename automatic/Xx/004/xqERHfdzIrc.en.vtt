00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
up I'll show the lights in just a bit so

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.490 
up I'll show the lights in just a bit so
let's<00:04:02.049> go<00:04:02.169> over<00:04:02.200> some<00:04:02.380> of<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.680> functions

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
let's go over some of the functions

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.569 
let's go over some of the functions
we're<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:05.680> more<00:04:06.130> phenomenal<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:09.160> bet<00:04:09.489> they

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
we're like more phenomenal I bet they
