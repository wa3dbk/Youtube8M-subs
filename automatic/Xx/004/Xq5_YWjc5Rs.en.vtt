might<00:01:56.700> want<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.939> try<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.240> once<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:57.990> you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
might want to try it once because you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.179 
might want to try it once because you
want<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> make<00:01:58.469> sure<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.680> don't<00:01:58.799> run<00:01:59.009> into

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
want to make sure you don't run into

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.429 
want to make sure you don't run into
anybody<00:01:59.659> because<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> run<00:02:00.990> into<00:02:01.110> anybody

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
anybody because if you run into anybody

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.760 
anybody because if you run into anybody
that<00:02:01.829> stops<00:02:02.420> let's<00:02:03.420> talk<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> don't

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that stops let's talk to you so I don't

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
that stops let's talk to you so I don't
think<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.159> run<00:02:05.399> into<00:02:05.610> anybody<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.390> you

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
think I run into anybody so then you

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.400 
think I run into anybody so then you
take<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> DES<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.550> take<00:02:09.200> this

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
take the DES and then you take this

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.950 
take the DES and then you take this
then<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.710> go<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:14.650> take<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:17.760> um<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.090> then<00:02:19.810> you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
then you go you take it um and then you

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.040 
then you go you take it um and then you
take<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.440> like<00:02:20.710> this<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:22.150> string<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.870> kind

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
take it like this the string it's kind

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.880 
take it like this the string it's kind
of<00:02:23.080> hard<00:02:23.290> because<00:02:23.410> I'm<00:02:23.820> okay<00:02:25.650> okay<00:02:26.650> there<00:02:26.800> we

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
of hard because I'm okay okay there we

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.030 
of hard because I'm okay okay there we
go

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
go

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.830 
go
so<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.850> get<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.090> lodged<00:02:28.330> like

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
so then you get it lodged like

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.400 
so then you get it lodged like
underneath<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.800> thing<00:02:30.550> here<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:32.080> as<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.260> can

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
underneath the thing here so as you can

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.930 
underneath the thing here so as you can
see<00:02:32.470> it's<00:02:32.890> underneath<00:02:33.280> there<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.760> that's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
see it's underneath there and that's

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.060 
see it's underneath there and that's
pushing<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.540> side<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.770> just<00:02:35.890> want

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
pushing it to the side so you just want

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.100 
pushing it to the side so you just want
to<00:02:36.100> readjust<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.700> again<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:37.780> going

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
to readjust it again so that it's going

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.350 
to readjust it again so that it's going
straight<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.850> don't<00:02:40.030> bump<00:02:40.210> into

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
straight and that you don't bump into

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360 
straight and that you don't bump into
anybody<00:02:40.660> okay<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.320> it's<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:41.740> off<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> little

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
anybody okay so it's going off a little

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.780 
anybody okay so it's going off a little
bit<00:02:42.490> just<00:02:43.030> take<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:43.240> little<00:02:43.480> time<00:02:43.690> um<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.730> you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
bit just take a little time um so you

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.720 
bit just take a little time um so you
want<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.330> make<00:02:46.660> sure<00:02:46.690> you're<00:02:47.370> doing<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.550> right

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
want to make sure you're doing it right

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.480 
want to make sure you're doing it right

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
I think I got it so I'm just making sure

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.580 
I think I got it so I'm just making sure
that<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:51.970> don't<00:02:52.180> run<00:02:52.390> into<00:02:52.570> anybody<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.170> then

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
that I don't run into anybody and then

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.690 
that I don't run into anybody and then
if<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.220> don't<00:02:54.400> run<00:02:54.580> into<00:02:54.730> anybody<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.840> just

you<00:02:57.700> plug<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.150> into<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.390> charger<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.290> then

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
you plug it into the charger and then

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.920 
you plug it into the charger and then
wait<00:02:59.860> um<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:01.410> got<00:03:02.410> my<00:03:02.620> froakie<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.160> my<00:03:03.930> my

wait um I got my froakie and my my
Charizard<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.860> level<00:03:06.280> 100<00:03:06.490> um<00:03:08.400> uh<00:03:09.400> when<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.820> went

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
Charizard to level 100 um uh when I went

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.640 
Charizard to level 100 um uh when I went
to<00:03:10.150> bed<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.390> just<00:03:10.600> plugged<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.170> in<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.560> then

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
to bed I just plugged it in and then

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.470 
to bed I just plugged it in and then
went<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.950> bed<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.310> then<00:03:12.430> in<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:13.090> morning<00:03:13.390> they

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
went to bed and then in the morning they

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.330 
went to bed and then in the morning they
were<00:03:13.600> level<00:03:13.870> 99<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.920> trained<00:03:15.160> them<00:03:15.250> up

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
were level 99 and I just trained them up

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.850 
were level 99 and I just trained them up
one<00:03:15.520> level<00:03:15.720> see<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:17.050> can<00:03:17.200> see<00:03:17.350> see<00:03:17.620> that's

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
one level see you can see see that's

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.900 
one level see you can see see that's
plugged<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:19.150> then<00:03:19.330> it's<00:03:19.480> going<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:21.459> and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
plugged in and then it's going so and

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.360 
plugged in and then it's going so and
then<00:03:22.060> every<00:03:22.630> stitch<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:23.380> counts<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.890> steps<00:03:24.190> at

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
then every stitch it counts the steps at

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.190 
then every stitch it counts the steps at
levels<00:03:24.670> them<00:03:24.820> up<00:03:24.940> about<00:03:25.180> how<00:03:25.540> many<00:03:25.720> steps<00:03:26.050> you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
levels them up about how many steps you

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.430 
levels them up about how many steps you
take

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
take

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.860 
take
