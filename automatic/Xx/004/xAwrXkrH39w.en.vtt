00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
time or maybe it's like say two major

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.709 
time or maybe it's like say two major
events<00:04:01.469> like<00:04:01.859> maybe<00:04:02.519> Khuhro<00:04:02.969> an<00:04:03.180> hour<00:04:03.389> long<00:04:03.599> at

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:03.719

the<00:04:03.780> same<00:04:03.959> time<00:04:04.169> or<00:04:04.379> something<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.889> you<00:04:05.219> might

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
the same time or something and you might

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.830 
the same time or something and you might
even<00:04:05.370> have<00:04:05.579> even<00:04:05.849> more<00:04:06.000> events<00:04:06.329> after<00:04:06.449> that<00:04:06.750> as

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
even have even more events after that as

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.619

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.969 
that just means that you'll have more
things<00:04:11.729> going<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.150> at<00:04:12.389> one<00:04:12.689> time<00:04:12.959> over<00:04:13.500> there

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
things going on at one time over there

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.159 
things going on at one time over there
on<00:04:14.189> extra<00:04:14.519> island<00:04:14.879> so<00:04:15.329> get<00:04:15.479> nothing<00:04:15.719> too<00:04:15.930> big

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
on extra island so get nothing too big

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.860

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
and finally mailbox capacity expanded by

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.909 
and finally mailbox capacity expanded by
a<00:04:21.570> hundred<00:04:21.930> this<00:04:22.079> isn't<00:04:22.320> really<00:04:22.529> too<00:04:22.710> relevant

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
a hundred this isn't really too relevant

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.010 
a hundred this isn't really too relevant
I<00:04:23.400> don't<00:04:23.820> know<00:04:23.909> why<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.690> would<00:04:24.810> need<00:04:24.900> a

I don't know why you would need a
hundred<00:04:25.380> mailbox<00:04:25.860> slots<00:04:26.159> but

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
hundred mailbox slots but

just means you can have more more friend
requests<00:04:46.050> or<00:04:47.009> stuff<00:04:47.340> like<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:48.770> but<00:04:49.770> yeah

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
to miss event however I believe they

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.779 
to miss event however I believe they
have<00:06:07.349> different<00:06:07.529> specials<00:06:08.159> that<00:06:08.310> evolved

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
have different specials that evolved

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.490 
have different specials that evolved
form<00:06:09.060> and<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.300> non<00:06:09.419> involved<00:06:09.839> so<00:06:10.229> you<00:06:10.289> will

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
form and the non involved so you will

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.890 
form and the non involved so you will
need<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.680> get<00:06:10.860> skill<00:06:11.159> books<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.610> power<00:06:12.150> up<00:06:12.419> the

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
need to get skill books to power up the

evolved<00:06:13.830> forms<00:06:14.219> skill<00:06:14.819> level<00:06:15.120> so<00:06:15.690> you<00:06:15.750> know

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
evolved forms skill level so you know

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.689 
evolved forms skill level so you know
between<00:06:16.319> all<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.740> our<00:06:16.919> lungs<00:06:17.190> that<00:06:17.400> you<00:06:17.490> feed

feed them I believe that I'm you're

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.659 
feed them I believe that I'm you're
going<00:06:21.270> to<00:06:21.949> end<00:06:22.949> up<00:06:23.069> with<00:06:23.129> a<00:06:23.279> pretty<00:06:23.430> high<00:06:23.639> level

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
going to end up with a pretty high level

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.269 
going to end up with a pretty high level
are<00:06:24.089> along<00:06:24.330> by<00:06:24.569> the<00:06:24.599> event<00:06:25.259> so<00:06:25.830> I<00:06:25.860> wonder<00:06:26.219> if

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
are along by the event so I wonder if

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.459 
are along by the event so I wonder if
there's<00:06:26.400> going<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.580> be<00:06:26.639> a<00:06:26.930> you<00:06:27.930> know<00:06:28.020> an<00:06:28.110> expert

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:28.469 
there's going to be a you know an expert

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:29.450 
there's going to be a you know an expert
level<00:06:28.740> and<00:06:28.860> that's<00:06:28.949> where<00:06:29.129> you<00:06:29.190> can<00:06:29.310> get<00:06:29.370> the

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
level and that's where you can get the

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.769 
level and that's where you can get the
skill<00:06:29.669> book<00:06:29.819> from<00:06:30.029> that's<00:06:30.270> probably<00:06:30.599> going<00:06:30.719> to

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:30.779 
skill book from that's probably going to

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:32.869 
skill book from that's probably going to
be<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:30.930> case<00:06:31.229> so<00:06:31.979> you<00:06:32.520> know<00:06:32.580> we'll<00:06:32.699> probably

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
be the case so you know we'll probably

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.139 
be the case so you know we'll probably
be<00:06:33.029> prepared<00:06:33.360> to<00:06:33.389> run<00:06:33.509> a<00:06:33.569> lot<00:06:33.750> of<00:06:33.779> expert<00:06:34.199> so<00:06:34.770> I

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:35.149 
be prepared to run a lot of expert so I

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:37.249 
be prepared to run a lot of expert so I
don't<00:06:36.149> leave<00:06:36.240> my<00:06:36.419> quick<00:06:36.599> thoughts<00:06:36.810> on<00:06:37.110> those
