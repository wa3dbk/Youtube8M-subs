00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.690 

okay<00:00:01.230> so<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.920> tutorial<00:00:02.340> on<00:00:02.580> the

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
okay so this is a tutorial on the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.249 
okay so this is a tutorial on the
muscles<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.330> neck<00:00:03.360> which<00:00:03.840> lined<00:00:04.140> the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
muscles of the neck which lined the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.400 
muscles of the neck which lined the
anterior<00:00:04.920> triangle<00:00:05.839> so<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.990> anterior

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
anterior triangle so the anterior

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.390 
anterior triangle so the anterior
triangle<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.160> neck<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:09.210> defined<00:00:09.990> by<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.590> few

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
triangle of the neck is defined by a few

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.339 
triangle of the neck is defined by a few
boundary<00:00:11.820> study<00:00:12.059> anterior<00:00:12.840> border<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
boundary study anterior border of the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.640 
boundary study anterior border of the
sternocleidomastoid<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:15.030> midline<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
sternocleidomastoid the midline and the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.359 
sternocleidomastoid the midline and the
inferior<00:00:17.510> border<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.900> mandible<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:20.189> this

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
inferior border of the mandible so this

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.880 
inferior border of the mandible so this
is<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.270> anterior<00:00:21.930> triangle<00:00:22.170> were<00:00:22.380> looking<00:00:22.769> at

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
is the anterior triangle were looking at

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.550 
is the anterior triangle were looking at
here<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.539> there<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.660> several<00:00:24.840> muscles<00:00:25.320> which

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
here and there are several muscles which

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
here and there are several muscles which
line<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.980> triangle<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.970> you've<00:00:27.090> got<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
line this triangle so you've got the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.019 
line this triangle so you've got the
suprahyoid<00:00:27.779> muscles<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.830> lie<00:00:29.039> above<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
suprahyoid muscles which lie above the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.910 
suprahyoid muscles which lie above the
hyoid<00:00:30.359> bone<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.320> infrahyoid<00:00:31.769> muscles

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
hyoid bone and the infrahyoid muscles

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.910 
hyoid bone and the infrahyoid muscles
which<00:00:32.579> lie<00:00:32.700> below<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> hyoid<00:00:33.420> bone<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
which lie below the hyoid bone so the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310 
which lie below the hyoid bone so the
infrahyoid<00:00:35.430> muscles<00:00:35.660> are<00:00:36.660> known<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:36.930> strap

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
infrahyoid muscles are known as strap

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
infrahyoid muscles are known as strap
muscles<00:00:37.590> presumably<00:00:38.550> because<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:39.059> look

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
muscles presumably because they look

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.319 
muscles presumably because they look
like<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:40.020> strap<00:00:40.530> oh<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.700> don't<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.090> something

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
like a strap oh I don't know something

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.799 
like a strap oh I don't know something
like<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.209 

so<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> suprahyoid<00:00:46.320> muscles<00:00:48.739> lie<00:00:49.739> above<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so the suprahyoid muscles lie above the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
so the suprahyoid muscles lie above the
hyoid<00:00:50.969> bone<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> hyoid<00:00:51.930> bone<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
hyoid bone and the hyoid bone is

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
hyoid bone and the hyoid bone is
important<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.610> serves<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> point

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
important because it serves as a point

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
important because it serves as a point
of<00:00:54.629> attachment<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.170> several<00:00:55.559> muscles<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
of attachment for several muscles the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.810 
of attachment for several muscles the
muscles<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.480> tongue<00:00:58.370> attach<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
muscles of the tongue attach to the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.200 
muscles of the tongue attach to the
hyoid<00:01:00.000> bone<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.399> it's<00:01:02.399> important<00:01:03.030> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
hyoid bone and it's important in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.010 
hyoid bone and it's important in
swallowing<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:07.460> there<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.580> four<00:01:09.020> suprahyoid

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
swallowing so there are four suprahyoid

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.010 
swallowing so there are four suprahyoid
muscles<00:01:10.430> you've<00:01:11.430> got<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> digastric<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
muscles you've got the digastric the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.109 
muscles you've got the digastric the
stylohyoid<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.570> mylohyoid<00:01:16.640> this<00:01:17.640> big<00:01:17.850> fan

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
stylohyoid the mylohyoid this big fan

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.270 
stylohyoid the mylohyoid this big fan
shaped<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.799> superior<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.040> you've

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
shaped one and superior to this you've

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
shaped one and superior to this you've
got<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> genial<00:01:21.090> hired<00:01:21.600> muscle<00:01:21.890> which<00:01:22.890> I'll

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
got the genial hired muscle which I'll

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.910 
got the genial hired muscle which I'll
show<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> moment

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
show you in a moment

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.690 
show you in a moment
so<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.640> stylohyoid<00:01:27.619> muscle<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.250> muscle

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so the stylohyoid muscle is this muscle

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
so the stylohyoid muscle is this muscle
here<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.119> connects<00:01:30.689> from<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> styloid

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
here which connects from the styloid

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.870 
here which connects from the styloid
process<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> skull<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.880> lateral

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
process of the skull to the lateral

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.020 
process of the skull to the lateral
surface<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.869> hyoid<00:01:37.259> bone<00:01:37.820> laterally<00:01:38.820> with

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
surface of the hyoid bone laterally with

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.039 
surface of the hyoid bone laterally with
the<00:01:39.210> body<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> hyoid<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.329> name<00:01:42.540> really

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the body of the hyoid so the name really

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.889 
the body of the hyoid so the name really
gives<00:01:43.350> away<00:01:43.500> its<00:01:44.630> origin<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> insertion

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
gives away its origin and insertion

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.730 
gives away its origin and insertion
which<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.860> quite<00:01:47.040> useful<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.740> originates

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
which is quite useful so it originates

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.950 
which is quite useful so it originates
on<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> styloid<00:01:50.399> process<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.180> inserts<00:01:51.659> onto

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
on the styloid process and inserts onto

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.679 
on the styloid process and inserts onto
the<00:01:52.200> lateral<00:01:52.619> area<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.579> body<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the lateral area of the body of the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.440 
the lateral area of the body of the
hyoid<00:01:54.899> bone<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> hyoid<00:01:58.439> bone<00:01:59.030> lies<00:02:00.030> at

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
hyoid bone so the hyoid bone lies at

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.600 
hyoid bone so the hyoid bone lies at
rest<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.439> level<00:02:01.710> roughly<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> level

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
rest at the level roughly at the level

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.340 
rest at the level roughly at the level
of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> base<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.180> mandible<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.840> lies

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
of the base of the mandible and lies

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.230 
of the base of the mandible and lies
just<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:05.040> bit<00:02:05.159> above<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.460> thyroid

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
just a little bit above the thyroid

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.830 
just a little bit above the thyroid
cartilage<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.250> several<00:02:09.239> muscles<00:02:09.599> attached

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
cartilage so several muscles attached

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.880 
cartilage so several muscles attached
here<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.810> stylo

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
here so this this is a stylo

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.130 
here so this this is a stylo
at<00:02:13.920> muscle<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.000> obviously<00:02:15.690> you've<00:02:15.840> got<00:02:16.020> this

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
at muscle and obviously you've got this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.690 
at muscle and obviously you've got this
on<00:02:16.319> both<00:02:16.530> sides<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> next<00:02:22.860> muscle<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
on both sides so the next muscle is the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.140 
on both sides so the next muscle is the
digastric<00:02:24.180> muscle<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.700> muscle

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
digastric muscle so this is this muscle

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.280 
digastric muscle so this is this muscle
which<00:02:27.330> loops<00:02:27.900> all<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.560> way<00:02:28.680> here<00:02:30.140> attaches<00:02:31.140> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
which loops all the way here attaches to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.620 
which loops all the way here attaches to
the<00:02:31.380> hyoid<00:02:31.590> bone<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:33.709> also<00:02:34.709> attaches<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.630> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the hyoid bone and also attaches on the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.449 
the hyoid bone and also attaches on the
inside<00:02:37.350> surface<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.490> mandible<00:02:39.410> so

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
inside surface of the mandible so

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.410 
inside surface of the mandible so
attaches<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.850> digastric<00:02:42.300> closer<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
attaches in the digastric closer and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.140 
attaches in the digastric closer and
also<00:02:45.420> on<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.440> medial<00:02:46.890> surface<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
also on the medial surface of the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.960 
also on the medial surface of the
mastoid<00:02:48.510> process<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.070> digastric<00:02:50.370> muscle

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
mastoid process so the digastric muscle

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.300 
mastoid process so the digastric muscle
is<00:02:51.060> called<00:02:51.270> digastric<00:02:52.019> because<00:02:52.650> Dai<00:02:52.950> means

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
is called digastric because Dai means

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.090 
is called digastric because Dai means
two<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.850> gastric<00:02:54.510> means<00:02:55.140> bellies<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
two and gastric means bellies so it's a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.180 
two and gastric means bellies so it's a
two<00:02:56.310> bellied<00:02:56.700> muscle<00:02:57.120> you've<00:02:57.660> got<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
two bellied muscle you've got the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.410 
two bellied muscle you've got the
anterior<00:02:59.190> belly<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:01.140> posterior<00:03:01.769> belly

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
anterior belly and the posterior belly

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.690 
anterior belly and the posterior belly
so<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.510> posterior<00:03:03.900> belly<00:03:04.200> originates<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
so the posterior belly originates on the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.449 
so the posterior belly originates on the
medial<00:03:06.540> surface<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.440> mastoid<00:03:07.950> process

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
medial surface of the mastoid process

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.420 
medial surface of the mastoid process
and<00:03:09.890> insert<00:03:10.890> via<00:03:11.550> this<00:03:11.820> tendon<00:03:13.310> onto<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and insert via this tendon onto the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.460 
and insert via this tendon onto the
hyoid<00:03:14.730> bone<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.830> anterior<00:03:17.640> belly

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
hyoid bone and the anterior belly

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.310 
hyoid bone and the anterior belly
originates<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:21.269> digastric<00:03:21.630> surface

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
originates on the digastric surface

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.740 
originates on the digastric surface
fossa<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.459> inside<00:03:24.150> surface<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.630> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
fossa on the inside surface of the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.539 
fossa on the inside surface of the
mandible<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:26.060> inserts<00:03:27.060> via<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.450> same<00:03:27.630> tendon

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
mandible and inserts via the same tendon

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.860 
mandible and inserts via the same tendon
so<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:30.209> muscle<00:03:30.690> has<00:03:32.480> various<00:03:33.480> actions

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
so this muscle has various actions

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.050 
so this muscle has various actions
depending<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.470> which<00:03:34.620> bone<00:03:34.829> is<00:03:34.980> fixed<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
depending on which bone is fixed so the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.470 
depending on which bone is fixed so the
hyoid<00:03:36.269> bone<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:37.320> move<00:03:37.709> up<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.010> down<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.489> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
hyoid bone can move up and down and the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.449 
hyoid bone can move up and down and the
mandible<00:03:40.230> obviously<00:03:40.680> has<00:03:40.890> several<00:03:41.220> movements

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
mandible obviously has several movements

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.360 
mandible obviously has several movements
you<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:41.850> get<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.870> truth<00:03:43.170> retract<00:03:43.709> depress

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
you can get the truth retract depress

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.270 
you can get the truth retract depress
and<00:03:44.549> elevate<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.350> hyoid<00:03:46.769> bone<00:03:47.040> is

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
and elevate so if the hyoid bone is

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.750 
and elevate so if the hyoid bone is
fixed<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:47.970> place<00:03:48.620> then<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> digastric<00:03:50.100> muscle

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
fixed in place then the digastric muscle

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.440 
fixed in place then the digastric muscle
will<00:03:51.360> act<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:52.160> open<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.670> mouth<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.360> will

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
will act to open the mouth so it will

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.580 
will act to open the mouth so it will
pull<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:55.079> jaw<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:56.100> mandible<00:03:56.340> down<00:03:57.590> opening

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
pull the jaw the mandible down opening

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.860 
pull the jaw the mandible down opening
the<00:03:58.739> mouth<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.850> you<00:03:59.940> can<00:04:00.060> imagine<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.510> action

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
the mouth so you can imagine this action

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.569 
the mouth so you can imagine this action
if<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.079> have<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.709> mastoid<00:04:02.040> process<00:04:02.430> is

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
if you have so the mastoid process is

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.030 
if you have so the mastoid process is
obvious<00:04:02.880> obviously<00:04:03.450> fixed<00:04:04.049> if<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.650> hyoid

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
obvious obviously fixed if the hyoid

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.819 
obvious obviously fixed if the hyoid
bone<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.310> fixed<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.850> place<00:04:06.000> then<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.290> anterior

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
bone is fixed in place then the anterior

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.039 
bone is fixed in place then the anterior
belly<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.459> digastric<00:04:08.579> muscle<00:04:09.390> will<00:04:09.660> pull

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
belly of the digastric muscle will pull

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.050 
belly of the digastric muscle will pull
the<00:04:10.290> jaw<00:04:10.500> bone<00:04:10.769> down<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.519> open<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.970> mouth<00:04:14.060> if

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
the jaw bone down and open the mouth if

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.240 
the jaw bone down and open the mouth if
the<00:04:15.720> mandible<00:04:16.169> is<00:04:16.260> fixed<00:04:16.620> however<00:04:16.769> and

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
the mandible is fixed however and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.640 
the mandible is fixed however and
obviously<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.000> mastoid<00:04:18.419> process<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.320> fixed

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
obviously the mastoid process is fixed

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.400 
obviously the mastoid process is fixed
then<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.269> digastric<00:04:21.269> muscle<00:04:21.840> both<00:04:21.989> bellies

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
then the digastric muscle both bellies

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.740 
then the digastric muscle both bellies
will<00:04:22.710> cause<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.789> hyoid<00:04:23.970> bone<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.599> elevate

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
will cause the hyoid bone to elevate

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.719 
will cause the hyoid bone to elevate
so<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.810> depends<00:04:28.199> which<00:04:28.349> bones<00:04:28.919> are<00:04:29.159> fixed<00:04:29.550> and

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
so it depends which bones are fixed and

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.999 
so it depends which bones are fixed and
so<00:04:30.659> it's<00:04:30.780> quite<00:04:30.870> an<00:04:31.020> unusual<00:04:31.110> muscle<00:04:31.710> cause<00:04:31.860> it

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
so it's quite an unusual muscle cause it

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.270 
so it's quite an unusual muscle cause it
has<00:04:32.819> three<00:04:33.240> attachments<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.650> next<00:04:37.949> muscle

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
has three attachments so the next muscle

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.850 
has three attachments so the next muscle
is<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.939> mylohyoid<00:04:39.449> so<00:04:40.409> I'm<00:04:40.500> just<00:04:40.680> going<00:04:40.800> to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
is the mylohyoid so I'm just going to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.309 
is the mylohyoid so I'm just going to
rotate<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:42.150> model<00:04:42.180> around<00:04:42.539> and<00:04:43.050> we're<00:04:43.199> going

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
rotate the model around and we're going

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.649 
rotate the model around and we're going
to<00:04:43.409> look<00:04:43.560> at<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.830> from<00:04:44.069> underneath<00:04:44.419> so<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:45.509> can

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
to look at it from underneath so you can

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.260 
to look at it from underneath so you can
see<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.050> digastric<00:04:46.430> muscle<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.969> lies

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
see the digastric muscle it lies

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.629 
see the digastric muscle it lies
inferior<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.289> mylohyoid<00:04:49.740> which<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.490> this

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
inferior to the mylohyoid which is this

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.700 
inferior to the mylohyoid which is this
fan-shaped<00:04:51.150> muscle<00:04:53.000> here<00:04:54.000> so<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.110> muscle

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
fan-shaped muscle here so this muscle

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.350 
fan-shaped muscle here so this muscle
forms<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.250> floor<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.879> the<00:04:57.120> mouth<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:59.360> this

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
forms the floor of the mouth and this

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.200 
forms the floor of the mouth and this
muscle<00:05:00.779> can<00:05:01.050> elevate<00:05:01.319> the<00:05:01.860> hyoid<00:05:02.069> bone<00:05:02.490> so

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
muscle can elevate the hyoid bone so

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.600 
muscle can elevate the hyoid bone so
it's<00:05:03.389> attached<00:05:03.750> on<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.139> inside<00:05:04.979> surface<00:05:05.580> of

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
it's attached on the inside surface of

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.260 
it's attached on the inside surface of
the<00:05:06.180> mandible<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.669> originates<00:05:09.150> on

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
the mandible and and it originates on

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.600 
the mandible and and it originates on
the<00:05:09.419> mylohyoid<00:05:09.840> line<00:05:10.680> on<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:10.979> mandible<00:05:11.279> and

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
the mylohyoid line on the mandible and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.309 
the mylohyoid line on the mandible and
it<00:05:12.210> inserts<00:05:12.629> obviously<00:05:13.620> onto<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.949> hyoid<00:05:14.159> bone

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
it inserts obviously onto the hyoid bone

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.700 
it inserts obviously onto the hyoid bone
so<00:05:16.319> these<00:05:16.469> muscles<00:05:18.139> separate<00:05:19.139> muscles<00:05:19.409> blend

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
so these muscles separate muscles blend

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.589 
so these muscles separate muscles blend
in<00:05:20.189> the<00:05:20.490> midline<00:05:20.879> in<00:05:23.300> originate<00:05:24.300> on<00:05:24.509> the

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
in the midline in originate on the

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.779 
in the midline in originate on the
inside<00:05:25.590> surface<00:05:25.919> of<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.039> mandible<00:05:26.279> on<00:05:26.639> the

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
inside surface of the mandible on the

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.459 
inside surface of the mandible on the
mylohyoid<00:05:27.210> line<00:05:29.000> so<00:05:30.000> it<00:05:30.150> lies<00:05:30.349> superior<00:05:31.349> to

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
mylohyoid line so it lies superior to

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.860 
mylohyoid line so it lies superior to
the<00:05:31.589> digastric<00:05:32.009> muscle<00:05:32.699> and<00:05:32.909> it<00:05:33.060> supports<00:05:33.659> and

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
the digastric muscle and it supports and

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.839 
the digastric muscle and it supports and
elevates<00:05:34.469> the<00:05:35.460> flow<00:05:35.669> of<00:05:35.699> the<00:05:35.909> mouth<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:38.520> it

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
elevates the flow of the mouth and it

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.640 
elevates the flow of the mouth and it
also<00:05:39.000> elevates<00:05:39.479> the<00:05:39.690> hyoid<00:05:39.900> bone

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
also elevates the hyoid bone

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.619 
also elevates the hyoid bone
so<00:05:41.400> that's<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.879> mylohyoid<00:05:42.870> muscle<00:05:44.389> so<00:05:45.389> just

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
so that's the mylohyoid muscle so just

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.420 
so that's the mylohyoid muscle so just
superior<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.139> the<00:05:46.289> mylohyoid<00:05:46.680> muscle<00:05:46.860> you've

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
superior to the mylohyoid muscle you've

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.879 
superior to the mylohyoid muscle you've
got<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:47.729> final<00:05:47.969> muscle<00:05:48.509> to<00:05:48.870> super<00:05:49.139> high<00:05:49.259> super

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
got the final muscle to super high super

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.029 
got the final muscle to super high super
high<00:05:50.039> owed<00:05:50.159> muscle<00:05:51.139> which<00:05:52.139> is<00:05:52.289> that<00:05:52.529> geno

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
high owed muscle which is that geno

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.730 
high owed muscle which is that geno
hyoid<00:05:54.080> so<00:05:55.080> if<00:05:55.169> I<00:05:55.229> just<00:05:55.439> remove<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:56.580> mylohyoid

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
hyoid so if I just remove the mylohyoid

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.059 
hyoid so if I just remove the mylohyoid
you<00:05:58.740> can<00:05:58.919> see<00:05:59.509> there's<00:06:00.509> a<00:06:00.629> muscle<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:01.349> thin

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
you can see there's a muscle a thin

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:07.249 
you can see there's a muscle a thin
muscle<00:06:02.339> which<00:06:02.939> runs<00:06:04.400> from<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.580> hyoid<00:06:05.759> bone<00:06:06.259> to

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
muscle which runs from the hyoid bone to

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:13.269 
muscle which runs from the hyoid bone to
the<00:06:08.000> inside<00:06:09.000> surface<00:06:09.180> of<00:06:09.389> the<00:06:09.449> mandible<00:06:09.629> again

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:13.279 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:17.499 

so<00:06:14.279> this<00:06:14.759> muscle<00:06:15.439> originates<00:06:16.439> on<00:06:17.039> the

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
so this muscle originates on the

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.059 
so this muscle originates on the
inferior<00:06:18.509> mental<00:06:18.930> spine<00:06:19.259> of<00:06:19.439> the<00:06:19.529> mandible<00:06:19.800> so

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
inferior mental spine of the mandible so

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.869 
inferior mental spine of the mandible so
this<00:06:20.250> is<00:06:20.400> a<00:06:20.580> little<00:06:21.770> thing<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:22.800> lies<00:06:23.610> on<00:06:23.789> the

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
this is a little thing that lies on the

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.369 
this is a little thing that lies on the
inside<00:06:24.180> of<00:06:24.330> the<00:06:24.419> inside<00:06:24.900> surface<00:06:25.229> of<00:06:25.319> the

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379 
inside of the inside surface of the

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:27.829 
inside of the inside surface of the
mandible<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.699> inserts<00:06:27.180> onto<00:06:27.479> the<00:06:27.659> hyoid

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:27.839 
mandible and it inserts onto the hyoid

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:28.490 
mandible and it inserts onto the hyoid
bone

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
bone

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.529 
bone
so<00:06:29.159> again<00:06:29.520> the<00:06:29.879> action<00:06:30.120> of<00:06:30.210> this<00:06:30.330> muscle

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
so again the action of this muscle

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.639 
so again the action of this muscle
depends<00:06:31.080> on<00:06:31.199> which<00:06:31.439> and<00:06:32.779> which<00:06:33.779> bone<00:06:34.020> is<00:06:34.169> fixed

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:34.649 
depends on which and which bone is fixed

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:37.550 
depends on which and which bone is fixed
so<00:06:34.800> I'll<00:06:35.669> just<00:06:35.849> remove<00:06:36.330> the<00:06:36.630> mylohyoid<00:06:36.990> on

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
so I'll just remove the mylohyoid on

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.770 
so I'll just remove the mylohyoid on
this<00:06:37.680> side<00:06:37.919> just<00:06:38.069> so<00:06:38.190> you<00:06:38.250> can<00:06:38.459> have

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
this side just so you can have

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.860 
this side just so you can have
look<00:06:38.930> so<00:06:39.860> we've<00:06:40.430> got<00:06:40.670> so<00:06:41.389> you<00:06:41.450> can<00:06:41.570> see<00:06:41.720> this

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
look so we've got so you can see this

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.610 
look so we've got so you can see this
this<00:06:42.770> thin<00:06:43.220> muscle<00:06:43.700> set<00:06:44.030> lies<00:06:44.530> superior<00:06:45.530> to

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
this thin muscle set lies superior to

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.690 
this thin muscle set lies superior to
the<00:06:45.710> mylohyoid<00:06:46.040> muscle<00:06:46.220> on<00:06:47.210> its<00:06:47.780> medial

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
the mylohyoid muscle on its medial

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.940 
the mylohyoid muscle on its medial
medially<00:06:49.700> so<00:06:50.510> you<00:06:51.320> can<00:06:51.440> see<00:06:51.530> this<00:06:51.650> muscle

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
medially so you can see this muscle

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.650 
medially so you can see this muscle
above<00:06:52.190> it<00:06:52.340> this<00:06:52.460> is<00:06:52.639> a<00:06:52.669> muscle<00:06:53.090> of<00:06:53.270> the<00:06:53.360> tongue

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
above it this is a muscle of the tongue

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.750 
above it this is a muscle of the tongue
this<00:06:54.230> is<00:06:54.380> the<00:06:54.500> Gino<00:06:54.860> grossest<00:06:55.280> muscle<00:06:55.639> but

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
this is the Gino grossest muscle but

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.520 
this is the Gino grossest muscle but
ignore<00:06:56.060> that<00:06:56.210> for<00:06:56.419> now<00:06:56.480> just<00:06:57.020> looking<00:06:57.320> at<00:06:57.410> this

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
ignore that for now just looking at this

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.870 
ignore that for now just looking at this
thin<00:06:59.410> free<00:07:00.410> yeah<00:07:00.950> so<00:07:01.190> you<00:07:01.280> can<00:07:01.400> see<00:07:01.520> this<00:07:01.669> thin

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
thin free yeah so you can see this thin

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.580 
thin free yeah so you can see this thin
muscle<00:07:02.150> running<00:07:03.190> from<00:07:04.190> the<00:07:04.340> hyoid<00:07:04.760> to<00:07:05.419> the

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
muscle running from the hyoid to the

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.890 
muscle running from the hyoid to the
inside<00:07:06.590> surface<00:07:06.860> of<00:07:06.919> the<00:07:07.010> mandible<00:07:07.600> so<00:07:08.600> it

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
inside surface of the mandible so it

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.350 
inside surface of the mandible so it
depends<00:07:09.500> on<00:07:09.560> which<00:07:09.919> bone<00:07:10.190> is<00:07:10.370> fixed<00:07:10.850> as<00:07:10.970> to

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
depends on which bone is fixed as to

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.260 
depends on which bone is fixed as to
what<00:07:11.930> the<00:07:12.080> action<00:07:12.440> of<00:07:12.560> this<00:07:12.680> muscle<00:07:13.010> is<00:07:13.160> so<00:07:13.940> if

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
what the action of this muscle is so if

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.470 
what the action of this muscle is so if
the<00:07:14.630> hyoid<00:07:15.260> bone<00:07:15.620> is<00:07:15.860> fixed<00:07:16.460> then<00:07:17.000> the<00:07:17.150> Jeannie

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.480 
the hyoid bone is fixed then the Jeannie

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.680 
the hyoid bone is fixed then the Jeannie
Ohio<00:07:17.870> it<00:07:18.220> will<00:07:19.220> open<00:07:19.460> the<00:07:19.760> jaw<00:07:20.000> it<00:07:20.270> will<00:07:20.480> pull

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
Ohio it will open the jaw it will pull

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.790 
Ohio it will open the jaw it will pull
it<00:07:21.250> downwards<00:07:22.250> and<00:07:22.610> inwards<00:07:23.500> whereas<00:07:24.500> if<00:07:24.650> the

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
it downwards and inwards whereas if the

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.620 
it downwards and inwards whereas if the
mandible<00:07:25.310> is<00:07:25.430> fixed<00:07:25.820> it<00:07:25.910> will<00:07:26.030> elevate<00:07:26.270> the

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.630 
mandible is fixed it will elevate the

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.640 
mandible is fixed it will elevate the
hyoid<00:07:27.280> so<00:07:28.280> the<00:07:28.460> word<00:07:28.580> Gigi<00:07:29.240> know<00:07:29.450> refers<00:07:30.229> in

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.650 
hyoid so the word Gigi know refers in

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.400
