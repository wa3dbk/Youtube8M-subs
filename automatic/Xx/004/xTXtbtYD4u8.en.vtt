RPM doesn't fluctuate neither the
temperature<00:00:29.570> gauge<00:00:31.899> see<00:00:32.899> it's<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.199> park<00:00:33.500> right

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
temperature gauge see it's a park right

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.680 
temperature gauge see it's a park right
now<00:00:33.800> let<00:00:34.250> me<00:00:34.309> put<00:00:34.520> it<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:34.750> Drive<00:00:36.910> RPM<00:00:37.910> drops<00:00:38.270> and

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
now let me put it in Drive RPM drops and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.880 
now let me put it in Drive RPM drops and
the<00:00:39.289> car<00:00:39.559> starts<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:40.100> shake<00:00:40.840> more<00:00:41.840> we<00:00:42.680> had<00:00:42.800> the
