00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.959 
have to be very careful of your edges
hence<00:02:00.049> why<00:02:00.350> I'm<00:02:00.710> trying<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.369> reduce<00:02:01.759> the

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
hence why I'm trying to reduce the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.539 
hence why I'm trying to reduce the
tension<00:02:02.569> by<00:02:02.780> pulling<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.380> out<00:02:03.530> cuz<00:02:03.920> it'd<00:02:04.369> be

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
tension by pulling it out cuz it'd be

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.490 
tension by pulling it out cuz it'd be
quite<00:02:04.789> embarrassing<00:02:05.060> if<00:02:05.689> I<00:02:05.810> lost<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.259> braids

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
quite embarrassing if I lost the braids

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.850 
quite embarrassing if I lost the braids
on<00:02:06.679> camera<00:02:07.189> online<00:02:08.119> or<00:02:08.330> offline<00:02:08.860> cringe

with the twisting and you will find that

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.680 
with the twisting and you will find that
it<00:02:39.200> tapers<00:02:39.680> off<00:02:39.829> and<00:02:40.340> I'm<00:02:41.090> literally<00:02:41.569> just

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
that's keeping it all in place stiff but

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.449 
that's keeping it all in place stiff but
fair<00:02:50.030> my<00:02:50.390> bun<00:02:50.840> seems<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.380> be<00:02:51.530> in<00:02:51.680> place<00:02:51.889> I<00:02:52.190> quite

for some ratchet music which doesn't

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:01.750 
for some ratchet music which doesn't
happen<00:03:01.010> very<00:03:01.220> often

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
happen very often

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.879 
happen very often
anyway<00:03:02.090> mess<00:03:02.600> around<00:03:02.720> with<00:03:03.019> your<00:03:03.170> bun<00:03:03.380> as<00:03:03.650> much

as<00:03:04.069> you<00:03:04.220> like<00:03:04.400> until<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.880> get<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.299> way<00:03:05.329> you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
as you like until you get it the way you

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.110 
as you like until you get it the way you
want<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.109> be<00:03:06.350> now<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.069> am<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:07.609> making<00:03:08.030> a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
want it to be now I am just making a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.229 
want it to be now I am just making a
swoop<00:03:08.389> bang<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.290> I'm<00:03:09.530> trying<00:03:09.889> to<00:03:10.220> make<00:03:10.970> it

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
swoop bang and I'm trying to make it

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.660 
swoop bang and I'm trying to make it
look<00:03:11.420> flat<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.350> finja<00:03:12.620> bit<00:03:12.889> looks<00:03:13.130> flat<00:03:13.459> by

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
look flat so the finja bit looks flat by

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.089 
look flat so the finja bit looks flat by
placing<00:03:14.209> my<00:03:14.359> hand<00:03:14.690> on<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.900> while<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.530> scoop<00:03:15.889> it

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
placing my hand on it while I scoop it

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.349 
placing my hand on it while I scoop it
around<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:17.030> bun<00:03:17.299> like<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.819> again<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:20.060> hair<00:03:20.239> is

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
around the bun like so again the hair is

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.479 
around the bun like so again the hair is
going<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.690> taper<00:03:20.959> off<00:03:21.260> at<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.560> end<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:22.220> just

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
going to taper off at the end so just

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.849 
going to taper off at the end so just
tuck<00:03:22.700> in<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.000> tape<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.269> bit<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.590> also

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
tuck in the tape a bit and this also

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.339 
tuck in the tape a bit and this also
avoids<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.670> need<00:03:25.880> for<00:03:25.940> Clips<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.079> think

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
avoids the need for Clips so I think

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.400 
avoids the need for Clips so I think
that's<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.920> we're<00:03:28.160> done<00:03:28.359> I<00:03:29.359> like<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.200> I'm

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
that's it we're done I like it I'm

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.400 
that's it we're done I like it I'm
pretty<00:03:30.650> happy<00:03:31.010> with<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:32.109> let<00:03:33.109> me<00:03:33.139> know<00:03:33.319> if
