00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.949 
another one and a parallel to it but
this<00:02:06.149> time<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> ends<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> meet

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
this time the ends are not going to meet

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.570 
this time the ends are not going to meet
see<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.170> looks<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.920> about<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.129> meet<00:02:11.400> but

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
see it looks like it's about to meet but

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.050 
see it looks like it's about to meet but
it's<00:02:11.700> really<00:02:11.819> not

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
it's really not

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.699 
it's really not
and<00:02:13.270> then<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.510> take<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.750> same<00:02:14.110> hot<00:02:14.349> pink<00:02:14.680> and

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
and then I take the same hot pink and

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.870 
and then I take the same hot pink and
start<00:02:17.709> at<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> top<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.970> nail<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.849> draw<00:02:21.849> a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
start at the top of the nail and draw a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.920 
start at the top of the nail and draw a
line<00:02:22.150> intersecting<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.260> ones<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.220> just<00:02:24.280> made

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
line intersecting the ones you just made

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.920 
line intersecting the ones you just made
like<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.580> parallel<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.270> line<00:02:28.450> of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
like that and parallel to that line of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.850 
like that and parallel to that line of
course<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.410> space<00:02:29.849> do<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:31.000> same<00:02:31.209> thing

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
course you a space do the same thing

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.339 
course you a space do the same thing
like<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.630> usually<00:02:34.630> get<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.110> order

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
like that usually get this order
