00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
people's beliefs but I didn't want to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.819 
people's beliefs but I didn't want to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
wondering about that link it may have

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.080 
wondering about that link it may have
something<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.759> fact<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
something to do with the fact that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.899 
something to do with the fact that
athletes<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.869> general<00:01:55.429> stupid<00:01:56.429> earth<00:01:56.549> and

the rest of the population at large and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.539 
the rest of the population at large and

if you're playing sports you don't have

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.120

because athletes are pushed to excel at

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:57.770 
because athletes are pushed to excel at
what<00:05:56.280> they<00:05:56.400> do<00:05:56.460> which<00:05:56.849> is<00:05:56.879> play<00:05:57.030> sports<00:05:57.539> and

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
what they do which is play sports and

what they do which is play sports and
not<00:05:57.960> push<00:05:58.199> the<00:05:58.379> enter<00:05:58.530> exercise<00:05:59.520> their<00:05:59.789> mind

not push the enter exercise their mind

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.140 
not push the enter exercise their mind
and<00:06:00.300> essa<00:06:00.930> is<00:06:01.409> more<00:06:01.740> likely<00:06:02.009> that<00:06:02.220> they<00:06:02.580> will

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
and essa is more likely that they will

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.010 
and essa is more likely that they will

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
the answers there for them so they feel

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.180 
the answers there for them so they feel
like<00:06:09.270> they<00:06:09.690> don't<00:06:10.050> have<00:06:10.289> to<00:06:10.440> exercise<00:06:10.979> their

like they don't have to exercise their

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.830 
like they don't have to exercise their
mind<00:06:11.400> they<00:06:11.580> feel<00:06:11.819> like<00:06:11.849> they<00:06:12.150> already<00:06:12.330> know<00:06:12.659> it

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
mind they feel like they already know it

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.990 
mind they feel like they already know it
so<00:06:13.020> they<00:06:13.199> they<00:06:13.710> feel<00:06:13.979> more<00:06:14.190> comfortable<00:06:14.520> in

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000
