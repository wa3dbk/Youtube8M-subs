00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.450
 Zora continues with the multimedia pc's Nokia n8 is there for me 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:20.500
 now introduce the player first Aben 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.859
 Once again you glued in the interpretation of algae 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.880
 Development or reproduction 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.309
 this option he could then but again to filter for yourself 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.960
 Example of current songs Songs Jorgos Pott Chaos 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.649
 on 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.060
 and me 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.600
 "I just want something for now and then we'll have a look at it 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 such an insight I'm not fulfilling 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.100
 this is the speaker or the speaker here here 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.499
 he definitely liked the sound very much " 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:48.729
 I wanted to keep you wet for a short while you the in itself 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:49.610
 demonstrate 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.330
 it's just one really the typical view here he has been next to the FCA 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.170
 more right on Play and and back 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.960
 and no one around here 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.370
 still handy by hand 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.869
 the voting rights share of the lows become 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.869
 you want to hear under options 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:13.669
 For example, he could then call vocal details on repeat order 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.990
 Attitudes around us 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.819
 or just 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.259
 what I am doing now 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.629
 shut down 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.849
 in any case around the music player travel around 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.129
 Kuhn and still very high quality 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.359
 um and what should i still be interested in here below left 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.359
 and Dr ob Wiesdorf 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.449
 so 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.449
 how does the outlook in the way experienced now give 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.349
 that's he sees Orbis Tor and Obama 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.939
 how does it look like construction with percent with categories 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:04.509
 for example programs or games audio video collections 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:06.629
 then there is 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.559
 still are looking for point 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:13.819
 and just new own account but in the same can see what he is all about 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.659
 Eurocontrol has downloaded setting 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.659
 anyway 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:24.289
 so Rami a and here you will be recommended to the levels 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.449
 Depp displayed and I was now just ever the Angry Birds Seasons 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.449
 down because that's just testing for free 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.699
 so 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.389
 the values â€‹â€‹19 are still displayed in comments and ratings 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:46.019
 and I download the last time 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.479
 the download starts 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.479
 Of course this takes some time 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.149
 as you see 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.609
 the Engelbert are now 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.859
 installed and now I start like that and stupid Copenhagen 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.099
 that they do not play with the Nokia N8 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
 so 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.860
 I have to confess I have not played this game so often yet but three 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.499
 should yes 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:38.499
 visit as usual 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:41.860
 vintage 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.210
 he lived up to his rights 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.210
 Rhein-lahn talent for it but 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.360
 Spain is definitely going to be real 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.660
 I'm good 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.110
 m knows the suspected download and the installation went now too 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.110
 fairly 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.080
 he was experiencing Engelberg probably will not be my game 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.270
 but I believe that it is very very NT very popular and 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.270
 for those of you who can as well 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.400
 he becomes the percent I seem to 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.130
 even be
