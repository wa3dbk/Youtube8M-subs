00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.519
 what's up people zero tv with the new 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.380
 video to destiny the wiki update for 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.080
 this week is out we are looking 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.389
 once all the relevant information and indeed 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.080
 would we have the following topics and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.090
 Although the prison of the old patch 1.2 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.769
 point 0.3 and the connection 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 Restoration service yes, let's start 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.789
 with the prison of the old and that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.859
 is it so that bungie a little 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.230
 has published statistics to ours 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.579
 Run in the prison of the old and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 Although it is there so we are 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.840
 mostly in the corners and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.640
 We can do that very well here too 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.290
 look at this picture 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 then we still have the bungee bull 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.910
 dissatisfied with the way it is 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 how currently the rollers are placed and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.760
 Although they speak very clearly different there 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 in patch 1.2 point 0.3 the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.360
 modifications that is the solar 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.480
 damage the batteries damage or too 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.090
 empty damage from round 6 so the scola 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.960
 sandbox far away then 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.860
 we still have a number and that is 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.630
 378 1511 Einsatztrupps so far scolas 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.080
 that can be defeated that is already one 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.450
 pretty powerful number and then have 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.159
 we still the point the bungie very clear 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.500
 appeals and I call it now 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.350
 times the connection restoration 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.600
 service the bungie attest wise at the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.549
 has introduced tests of beer and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.979
 now it has been like that in the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.290
 Last week, the whole synonymous with the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.240
 patrol in the melting pot or too 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.549
 at raid have unlocked at least 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.950
 in some probably not all 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.380
 and then it is still so bungie 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.079
 a little taste for the e3 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.890
 There and a suitcase shows yes 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.020
