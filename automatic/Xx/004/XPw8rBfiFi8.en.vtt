00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
care group where I've learned everything

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.720 
care group where I've learned everything
from<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:30.230> lot<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:30.950> moms<00:00:31.130> said<00:00:31.400> that<00:00:31.580> they

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
from a lot of the moms said that they

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.520 
from a lot of the moms said that they
trim<00:00:32.090> their<00:00:32.270> daughter's<00:00:32.570> hair

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
trim their daughter's hair

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.759 
trim their daughter's hair
now<00:00:33.860> they<00:00:34.219> wears<00:00:35.120> her<00:00:35.450> hair<00:00:35.839> pretty<00:00:36.620> much

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
now they wears her hair pretty much

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.910 
now they wears her hair pretty much
always<00:00:37.219> either<00:00:37.460> in<00:00:37.670> cornrows<00:00:38.179> or<00:00:38.809> braids<00:00:39.379> or

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
always either in cornrows or braids or

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.119 
always either in cornrows or braids or
puffs<00:00:40.609> and<00:00:41.089> they're<00:00:41.839> very<00:00:42.109> forgiving<00:00:42.649> styles

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
puffs and they're very forgiving styles

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.660 
puffs and they're very forgiving styles
so<00:00:44.379> it<00:00:45.379> doesn't<00:00:45.739> really<00:00:45.800> matter<00:00:46.100> if<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.399> hair

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
so it doesn't really matter if the hair

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.149 
so it doesn't really matter if the hair
is<00:00:46.699> kind<00:00:47.539> of<00:00:47.600> different<00:00:47.809> lengths<00:00:48.289> all<00:00:48.530> over<00:00:49.010> or

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
is kind of different lengths all over or

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.590 
is kind of different lengths all over or
I<00:00:49.309> mean<00:00:49.460> we<00:00:49.550> try<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.789> get<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.059> generally<00:00:50.480> the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
I mean we try to get it generally the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.779 
I mean we try to get it generally the
same<00:00:50.780> length<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:51.769> you<00:00:52.069> know<00:00:52.249> it's<00:00:52.760> very

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
same length but you know it's very

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.610 
same length but you know it's very
forgiving<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:53.629> it<00:00:53.749> doesn't<00:00:54.079> matter<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:54.469> much

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
forgiving so it doesn't matter that much

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.180 
forgiving so it doesn't matter that much
if<00:00:54.979> we<00:00:55.780> if<00:00:56.780> she<00:00:57.079> wore<00:00:57.260> her<00:00:57.379> hair<00:00:57.409> more<00:00:57.769> in<00:00:58.010> like

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
if we if she wore her hair more in like

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.489 
if we if she wore her hair more in like
a<00:00:58.219> flat<00:00:58.550> ironed<00:00:59.359> or<00:00:59.629> you<00:00:59.870> know<00:00:59.960> we<00:01:00.109> blew<00:01:00.260> dry

her<00:01:57.910> hair<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.630> ends<00:01:59.020> get<00:01:59.290> stuck<00:02:00.280> together

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
her hair the ends get stuck together

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.120 
her hair the ends get stuck together
they're<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:01.960> more<00:02:02.200> difficult<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.920> comb

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
they're just more difficult to comb

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.850 
they're just more difficult to comb
through<00:02:03.360> more<00:02:04.360> tangles<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.140> everything<00:02:05.740> and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
through more tangles and everything and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.290 
through more tangles and everything and
then<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.010> can<00:02:06.310> tell<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:06.700> it's<00:02:06.850> kind<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.119> time

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
then I can tell that it's kind of time

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.460 
then I can tell that it's kind of time
for<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.570> trim<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:10.060> usually<00:02:10.509> wait<00:02:10.780> until<00:02:11.110> a

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
for a trim but I usually wait until a

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.440 
for a trim but I usually wait until a
time<00:02:11.770> when<00:02:12.040> she's<00:02:12.400> been<00:02:12.760> wearing<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.180> style

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
time when she's been wearing a style

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.260 
time when she's been wearing a style
like<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.989> where<00:02:14.320> she's<00:02:14.530> got<00:02:14.770> individual<00:02:15.580> box

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
like this where she's got individual box

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.860 
like this where she's got individual box
twists<00:02:16.930> or<00:02:17.110> braids<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.950> because<00:02:18.630> that's<00:02:19.630> how<00:02:19.840> I

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
twists or braids in because that's how I

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.110 
twists or braids in because that's how I
trim<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.350> hair<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.739> trim<00:02:21.100> them<00:02:21.280> by<00:02:21.489> little

trim the hair I trim them by little
individual<00:02:22.690> sections<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.680> know<00:02:24.190> she<00:02:24.340> had

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
individual sections so you know she had

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.160 
individual sections so you know she had
a<00:02:24.670> style<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.300> was<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.600> like<00:02:25.720> eight<00:02:25.959> big

you can see here I'm not sure this is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.729 
you can see here I'm not sure this is

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
too far away to see you're still good

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.940 
too far away to see you're still good
right<00:02:59.769> now<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.170> twist<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.769> then

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
right now so we have the twist and then

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.710 
right now so we have the twist and then
like<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.400> bottom<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.940> twist<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.390> just

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
like the bottom of the twist is just

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.050 
like the bottom of the twist is just
like<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.140> spiral<00:03:05.530> curl<00:03:05.950> because<00:03:06.549> when<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:06.940> do

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
like a spiral curl because when I do

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.270 
like a spiral curl because when I do
twist<00:03:07.450> like<00:03:07.600> this<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.019> chair<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.470> when<00:03:09.250> I

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
twist like this in the chair I when I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.490 
twist like this in the chair I when I
get<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.790> ends<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.360> twirl<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.110> around<00:03:11.140> my

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
get to the ends I twirl it around my

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.110 
get to the ends I twirl it around my
finger<00:03:11.769> like<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.980> that's<00:03:15.850> how<00:03:16.060> we

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
finger like this and and that's how we

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.610 
finger like this and and that's how we
get<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.420> little<00:03:16.570> spirals<00:03:16.989> on<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.260> end<00:03:17.410> where

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
get the little spirals on the end where

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.690 
get the little spirals on the end where
I<00:03:17.680> don't<00:03:17.799> have<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.190> use<00:03:18.310> I'm<00:03:18.640> sorry<00:03:18.940> let's<00:03:19.239> talk

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
I don't have to use I'm sorry let's talk

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.930 
I don't have to use I'm sorry let's talk
really<00:03:19.940> matches<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.310> don't<00:03:22.580> have<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.819> use

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
really matches so I don't have to use

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.100 
really matches so I don't have to use
any<00:03:23.150> kind<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.569> a<00:03:23.870> hair<00:03:25.420> rubber<00:03:26.420> band<00:03:26.629> or<00:03:26.900> beads

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
any kind of a hair rubber band or beads

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.140 
any kind of a hair rubber band or beads
or<00:03:27.410> anything<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:28.310> hold<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.670> ends<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.030> her

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
or anything to hold the ends of her

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.910 
or anything to hold the ends of her
twist<00:03:29.390> like<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.599> I<00:03:30.019> can<00:03:30.470> loop<00:03:30.680> them<00:03:30.830> around

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
twist like this I can loop them around

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.650 
twist like this I can loop them around
my<00:03:31.160> finger<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.519> twirl<00:03:32.030> them<00:03:32.180> up<00:03:32.269> really<00:03:32.450> good

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
my finger and twirl them up really good

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.690 
my finger and twirl them up really good
and<00:03:32.870> they<00:03:32.959> hold<00:03:33.200> all<00:03:33.379> on<00:03:33.530> their<00:03:33.650> own<00:03:33.769> now

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
and they hold all on their own now

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.210 
and they hold all on their own now
if<00:03:34.879> I<00:03:35.209> were<00:03:35.569> to<00:03:35.840> trim<00:03:36.200> these<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.680> cut<00:03:37.010> them

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
if I were to trim these and cut them

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.790 
if I were to trim these and cut them
straight<00:03:37.610> across<00:03:37.730> with<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.269> blunt<00:03:38.660> cut<00:03:38.930> then

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
straight across with a blunt cut then

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.830 
straight across with a blunt cut then
making<00:03:40.550> these<00:03:40.910> spirals<00:03:41.420> would<00:03:41.540> become<00:03:41.810> very

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
making these spirals would become very

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.979 
making these spirals would become very
very<00:03:42.319> difficult<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:43.489> it's<00:03:44.180> important<00:03:44.810> that

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
very difficult so it's important that

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.410 
very difficult so it's important that
when<00:03:45.290> we<00:03:45.470> trim<00:03:45.709> we<00:03:46.099> trim<00:03:46.340> on<00:03:46.549> an<00:03:46.700> angle<00:03:47.209> and

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
when we trim we trim on an angle and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.420 
when we trim we trim on an angle and
that's<00:03:47.870> what<00:03:48.200> allows<00:03:48.500> all<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.190> little

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
that's what allows all of the little

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.339 
that's what allows all of the little
curly<00:03:49.940> ends<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.360> hair<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.780> catch<00:03:51.019> around

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
curly ends of the hair to catch around

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.020 
curly ends of the hair to catch around
each<00:03:51.470> other<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.920> make<00:03:52.130> these<00:03:52.370> spirals<00:03:52.849> and

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
each other and make these spirals and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.729 
each other and make these spirals and
hold<00:03:53.239> nicely<00:03:53.450> on<00:03:53.750> their<00:03:53.900> own<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.560> that's

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
hold nicely on their own so that's

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.610 
hold nicely on their own so that's
really<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.160> only<00:03:55.190> thing<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:57.290> need<00:03:57.470> to

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
really the only thing that you need to

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.350 
really the only thing that you need to
remember<00:03:58.310> when<00:03:58.610> you're<00:03:58.760> trimming<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.150> hair

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
remember when you're trimming the hair

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.199 
remember when you're trimming the hair
is<00:03:59.569> to<00:03:59.780> not<00:04:00.019> cut<00:04:00.410> straight<00:04:01.220> across<00:04:01.280> but<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.000> cut

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
is to not cut straight across but to cut

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.390 
is to not cut straight across but to cut
at<00:04:02.420> an<00:04:02.630> angle<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.120> can<00:04:05.480> see<00:04:05.750> here<00:04:06.260> that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
at an angle so you can see here that

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.479 
at an angle so you can see here that
this<00:04:07.400> is<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.730> end<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:08.090> one<00:04:08.239> of<00:04:08.269> her<00:04:08.480> twists<00:04:09.019> and

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
this is the end of one of her twists and

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.400 
this is the end of one of her twists and
that<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.610> hairs<00:04:10.849> are<00:04:11.030> all<00:04:11.060> like<00:04:11.870> super

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
that the hairs are all like super

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.009 
that the hairs are all like super
varying<00:04:13.130> lengths<00:04:13.730> as<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.150> goes<00:04:14.329> down<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
varying lengths as it goes down to the

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.110 
varying lengths as it goes down to the
end<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.470> that's<00:04:15.890> good<00:04:16.280> because<00:04:16.519> that's<00:04:16.850> what

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
end and that's good because that's what

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.449 
end and that's good because that's what
helps<00:04:17.840> us<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.410> be<00:04:18.560> able<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.889> make<00:04:19.250> those

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
helps us to be able to make those

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.020 
helps us to be able to make those
ringlets<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.299> end<00:04:20.479> that<00:04:20.600> hold<00:04:20.989> nicely<00:04:22.030> but

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
ringlets on the end that hold nicely but

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.640 
ringlets on the end that hold nicely but
you<00:04:23.210> can<00:04:23.360> also<00:04:23.510> see<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:23.870> they're<00:04:24.200> kind<00:04:24.470> of

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
you can also see that they're kind of

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.590 
you can also see that they're kind of
they're<00:04:25.310> looking<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.389> little<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:29.090> know<00:04:29.120> frayed

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
they're looking a little you know frayed

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.719 
they're looking a little you know frayed

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
and just like they could really use a

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.480 
and just like they could really use a
good<00:04:32.000> fresh<00:04:32.270> trim<00:04:32.539> so<00:04:33.380> I'm<00:04:33.740> just<00:04:33.950> gonna<00:04:34.100> take

tiny<00:05:41.479> bit<00:05:41.690> and<00:05:41.870> then<00:05:42.050> trim<00:05:42.350> you<00:05:42.950> know<00:05:43.070> a<00:05:43.310> larger

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
tiny bit and then trim you know a larger

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.600 
tiny bit and then trim you know a larger
amount<00:05:44.330> off<00:05:44.600> of<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.440> sections<00:05:46.340> where<00:05:46.520> the

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
amount off of the sections where the

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.159 
amount off of the sections where the
hair<00:05:46.760> is<00:05:46.850> longer<00:05:47.090> and<00:05:47.419> you'll<00:05:47.540> start<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:47.990> even

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
hair is longer and you'll start to even

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.860 
hair is longer and you'll start to even
up<00:05:48.530> that<00:05:49.190> imbalance<00:05:49.850> between<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.450> lengths<00:05:50.810> of

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
up that imbalance between the lengths of

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.800 
up that imbalance between the lengths of
the<00:05:50.990> hair<00:05:51.169> and<00:05:52.040> that's<00:05:52.250> I<00:05:52.580> think<00:05:52.880> really<00:05:53.570> all<00:05:53.780> I

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
the hair and that's I think really all I

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:03.140 
the hair and that's I think really all I
have<00:05:54.050> to<00:05:54.200> say<00:05:54.350> about<00:05:54.440> that

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.210
