00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
be crafted at the top because he has all

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.610 
be crafted at the top because he has all
the<00:02:19.280> coal<00:02:19.489> as<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.660> see<00:02:20.930> he's<00:02:21.230> going<00:02:21.500> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the coal as you can see he's going to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.420 
the coal as you can see he's going to
craft<00:02:22.010> let's<00:02:22.849> see<00:02:23.030> um<00:02:23.799> yeah<00:02:24.799> so<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.099> that<00:02:25.310> he's

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
craft let's see um yeah so now that he's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.880 
craft let's see um yeah so now that he's
made<00:02:25.670> all<00:02:25.969> the<00:02:26.180> damn<00:02:26.329> blocks<00:02:26.599> he<00:02:26.719> can<00:02:26.989> it's<00:02:27.650> all

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
made all the damn blocks he can it's all

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.380 
made all the damn blocks he can it's all
it's<00:02:28.159> disappeared

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
it's disappeared

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.059 
it's disappeared
now<00:02:29.660> they<00:02:29.780> made<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.080> coal<00:02:30.290> blocks<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:30.890> down

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
now they made the coal blocks it's down

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.160 
now they made the coal blocks it's down
to<00:02:31.250> zero<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.819> guess<00:02:32.420> coal<00:02:32.630> blocks<00:02:32.840> are<00:02:32.960> actually

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
to zero I guess coal blocks are actually

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.490 
to zero I guess coal blocks are actually
located<00:02:33.290> at<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> top<00:02:33.740> um<00:02:34.959> let's<00:02:35.959> see<00:02:36.200> maybe

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
located at the top um let's see maybe

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.190 
located at the top um let's see maybe
I'll<00:02:36.680> craft<00:02:36.920> something<00:02:37.100> dymond<00:02:37.610> yep<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.200> as

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
I'll craft something dymond yep so as

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.309 
I'll craft something dymond yep so as
you<00:02:39.380> see<00:02:39.590> has<00:02:39.740> no<00:02:39.980> um<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.750> diamond<00:02:42.050> hoe<00:02:42.170> would

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
you see has no um the diamond hoe would

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.690 
you see has no um the diamond hoe would
be<00:02:42.440> located<00:02:42.770> at<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.860> bottom<00:02:43.010> but<00:02:43.310> instead<00:02:43.520> it

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
be located at the bottom but instead it

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.040 
be located at the bottom but instead it
is<00:02:43.819> right<00:02:44.090> there<00:02:44.350> able<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.530> be<00:02:45.709> crafted<00:02:46.280> so

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
is right there able to be crafted so

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
is right there able to be crafted so
that's<00:02:48.050> enough<00:02:48.290> with<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.440> hopefully<00:02:48.950> you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
that's enough with that hopefully you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.480 
that's enough with that hopefully you
guys<00:02:49.220> enjoyed<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.510> right<00:02:50.750> there<00:02:51.490> it's

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
1.7 pc that's a mega taiga biome and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.790 
1.7 pc that's a mega taiga biome and
here<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.430> clay<00:03:29.320> crap<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.350> don't<00:03:30.560> know<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
here is a clay crap I don't know the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.780 
here is a clay crap I don't know the
name<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.130> but<00:03:31.340> it's<00:03:31.430> sort<00:03:31.610> of<00:03:31.670> like<00:03:31.730> a

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
name of this but it's sort of like a

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.300 
name of this but it's sort of like a
desert<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:32.450> using<00:03:32.780> them<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.170> hardened<00:03:34.160> clay

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
desert but using them the hardened clay

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.250 
desert but using them the hardened clay
blocks<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.209> I'm<00:03:35.510> guessing<00:03:35.750> they<00:03:35.989> will<00:03:36.110> add

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
blocks and so I'm guessing they will add

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.569 
blocks and so I'm guessing they will add
this<00:03:36.470> because<00:03:36.739> it's<00:03:36.890> not<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.160> difficult<00:03:37.340> to

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
this because it's not that difficult to

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.039 
this because it's not that difficult to
generate<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.150> really<00:03:38.390> just<00:03:38.510> hills<00:03:38.810> with

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
generate it's really just hills with

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.039 
generate it's really just hills with
