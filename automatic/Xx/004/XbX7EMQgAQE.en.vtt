their arms when you but the arms up
you're<00:00:38.399> losing<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.820> corner<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> can

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
you're losing that corner if you can

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.260 
you're losing that corner if you can
utilize<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.010> corner<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> especially

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
utilize it that corner do it especially

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
up and maximize this space so bringing

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310
