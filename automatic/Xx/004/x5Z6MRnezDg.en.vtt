punch out the other two on the other
side<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.830> ahead<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:18.240> do

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
side and then you can go ahead and do

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320 
side and then you can go ahead and do
the<00:01:18.990> same<00:01:19.229> thing<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.979> across<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:21.150> not

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the same thing going across that but not

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.109 
the same thing going across that but not
under<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> or<00:01:22.020> meet<00:01:22.290> or<00:01:22.580> over<00:01:23.580> top<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
under it or meet or over top of it the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.359 
under it or meet or over top of it the
second<00:01:24.450> bridge<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.560> meet<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
second bridge you will just meet it in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
second bridge you will just meet it in
the<00:01:26.520> middle<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.060> continue<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the middle and then continue it on the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
the middle and then continue it on the
other<00:01:28.140> side<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.920> first<00:01:29.220> bridge<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
other side of the first bridge so you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.710 
other side of the first bridge so you
shouldn't<00:01:30.900> go<00:01:31.259> over<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.130> will

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
shouldn't go over it because that will

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.140 
shouldn't go over it because that will
ruin<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.979> dropping<00:01:34.979> point<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> middle<00:01:35.909> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
ruin the dropping point in the middle so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
ruin the dropping point in the middle so
right<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> exact<00:01:37.619> same<00:01:37.650> thing

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
right here you do the exact same thing

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.210 
right here you do the exact same thing
to<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> other<00:01:38.310> side<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.439> put<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
to the other side and you just put the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.370 
to the other side and you just put the
blocks<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.450> way<00:01:42.540> across<00:01:42.659> media<00:01:43.259> in

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
blocks in all the way across media in

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.020 
blocks in all the way across media in
the<00:01:43.500> middle<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.100> extending<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the middle and then extending it all the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.830 
the middle and then extending it all the
way<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.509> other<00:01:45.720> side<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.840> then

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
way to the other side like that then

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.569 
way to the other side like that then
once<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.680> those<00:01:49.829> bridges<00:01:50.070> down<00:01:50.369> you're

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
once you have those bridges down you're

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.380 
once you have those bridges down you're
going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> two-block<00:01:51.630> high<00:01:52.070> wall<00:01:53.390> nah

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
going to make a two-block high wall nah

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.569 
going to make a two-block high wall nah
it's<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.930> wall<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.439> also<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> platform<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it's a wall but it's also a platform and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's a wall but it's also a platform and
it's<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.270> blocks<00:01:57.450> high<00:01:57.810> from<00:01:58.259> those<00:01:58.590> blocks

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it's two blocks high from those blocks

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.219 
it's two blocks high from those blocks
right<00:01:59.189> there<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.670> around<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> edge<00:02:00.229> because

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
right there but around the edge because

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
right there but around the edge because
it's<00:02:01.439> already<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:02.009> block<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.210> only

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it's already one block up it will only

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.020 
it's already one block up it will only
look<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.860> block<00:02:05.040> high<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.700> is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
look like it's one block high but it is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.059 
look like it's one block high but it is
two<00:02:06.299> blocks<00:02:06.479> high<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.710> want<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> make

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
two blocks high and you want to make

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.609 
two blocks high and you want to make
sure<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.580> each<00:02:08.899> each<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.229> these<00:02:10.349> little

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
sure that each each of these little

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.520 
sure that each each of these little
square<00:02:10.979> sections<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.879> same<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.959> way<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
square sections is the same that way the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.470 
square sections is the same that way the
water<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.190> travel<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> right<00:02:14.819> distance<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
water can travel the right distance and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.080 
water can travel the right distance and
it<00:02:15.840> will<00:02:15.989> carry<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.379> mobs<00:02:16.590> down<00:02:17.069> where<00:02:17.879> you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
it will carry the mobs down where you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.570 
it will carry the mobs down where you
want<00:02:18.300> them<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> go<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.050> then<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
want them to go and then you can get the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.000 
want them to go and then you can get the
stuff<00:02:20.819> would<00:02:21.060> they<00:02:21.270> oh<00:02:24.110> man<00:02:25.110> move<00:02:25.440> then<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
stuff would they oh man move then you

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.320 
stuff would they oh man move then you
can<00:02:26.129> get<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> stuff<00:02:26.550> when<00:02:26.760> they<00:02:26.940> hit<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
can get the stuff when they hit the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.180 
can get the stuff when they hit the
ground<00:02:27.480> at<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> bottom<00:02:28.470> also<00:02:28.860> we're<00:02:29.010> going<00:02:29.129> to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
ground at the bottom also we're going to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.300 
ground at the bottom also we're going to
be<00:02:29.280> using<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.640> hopper<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.360> chess<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.410> one<00:02:31.980> chest

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
be using a hopper in chess and one chest

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.460 
be using a hopper in chess and one chest
and<00:02:32.610> four<00:02:33.209> hoppers<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.200> that's<00:02:34.319> how

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and four hoppers for this and that's how

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.600 
and four hoppers for this and that's how
we're<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.739> collect<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.099> items<00:02:35.430> at<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
we're going to collect the items at the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.110 
we're going to collect the items at the
mobs<00:02:35.849> drop<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:38.099> basically<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.940> kind<00:02:39.090> of

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
mobs drop so basically I just kind of

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.610 
mobs drop so basically I just kind of
sped<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.480> process<00:02:39.569> there<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.290> jumped

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
sped up the process there and I jumped

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
sped up the process there and I jumped
right<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:42.260> final<00:02:43.260> block<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.280> final

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
right to the final block the final

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.059 
right to the final block the final
square<00:02:44.910> piece<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:46.170> as<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.379> can<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:46.920> all

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
square piece and as you can see they all

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.559 
square piece and as you can see they all
look<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.370> same<00:02:47.519> they<00:02:47.910> are<00:02:47.970> two<00:02:48.150> blocks<00:02:48.300> high

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
look the same they are two blocks high

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.809 
look the same they are two blocks high
from<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.840> middle<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.349> they<00:02:50.099> are<00:02:50.370> four<00:02:50.790> of

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
from the middle and they are four of

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.930 
from the middle and they are four of
them<00:02:50.959> now<00:02:51.959> we're<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.769> put<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.010> wall<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.430> at

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
them now we're going to put a wall up at

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.869 
them now we're going to put a wall up at
each<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.629> little<00:02:54.810> sections<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:56.670> will

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
each of the little sections this will

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.020 
each of the little sections this will
make<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.780> water<00:02:58.050> doesn't<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.790> water

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
make it so the water doesn't the water

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.930 
make it so the water doesn't the water
doesn't<00:03:00.300> flow<00:03:00.569> off<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:00.959> other<00:03:01.290> end<00:03:01.940> because

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
doesn't flow off the other end because

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.880 
doesn't flow off the other end because
the<00:03:03.510> water<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.840> basically<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.470> only<00:03:04.590> thing

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
the water is basically the only thing

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.710 
the water is basically the only thing
that<00:03:05.040> makes<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.400> work<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.390> you're<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.629> to

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
that makes this work so you're going to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.259 
that makes this work so you're going to
put<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> water<00:03:07.110> too<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.280> going<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.760> take<00:03:08.970> two

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
put the water too it's going to take two

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.119 
put the water too it's going to take two
four<00:03:09.480> six<00:03:09.629> eight<00:03:09.840> eight<00:03:10.050> buckets<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.650> water<00:03:10.680> to

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
four six eight eight buckets of water to

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.350 
four six eight eight buckets of water to
cover<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.489> whole<00:03:11.640> thing<00:03:11.670> because<00:03:12.269> you're

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
cover the whole thing because you're

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.559 
cover the whole thing because you're
going<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.540> put<00:03:12.720> two<00:03:12.989> in<00:03:13.260> each<00:03:13.500> little<00:03:14.220> section

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
going to put two in each little section

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.759 
going to put two in each little section
that<00:03:15.569> just<00:03:15.870> make<00:03:16.050> sure<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.440> water<00:03:16.590> flows<00:03:18.769> that

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
that just make sure the water flows that

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.890 
that just make sure the water flows that
just<00:03:19.980> make<00:03:20.099> sure<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.340> water<00:03:20.550> flows<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.330> it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
just make sure the water flows and it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.979 
just make sure the water flows and it
just<00:03:22.080> makes<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.440> easier<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:23.400> i<00:03:23.810> get<00:03:24.810> actually

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
just makes it easier for i get actually

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.300 
just makes it easier for i get actually
doesn't<00:03:25.409> make<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.590> easier<00:03:25.830> if<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.129> water

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
doesn't make it easier if the water

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.009 
doesn't make it easier if the water
wasn't<00:03:26.549> there<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.940> moms<00:03:27.120> would<00:03:27.360> not<00:03:27.510> fall<00:03:27.780> and

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
wasn't there the moms would not fall and

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.509 
wasn't there the moms would not fall and
you<00:03:28.110> would<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:28.349> get<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.590> items<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.129> that

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
you would not get the items and that

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.710 
you would not get the items and that
would<00:03:29.670> defeat<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.030> purpose<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.540> building

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
would defeat the purpose of building

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.330 
would defeat the purpose of building
this<00:03:31.049> thing<00:03:31.110> in<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.890> first<00:03:32.250> place<00:03:33.409> so<00:03:34.409> yep

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
this thing in the first place so yep

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.220 
this thing in the first place so yep
basically<00:03:35.849> just<00:03:36.239> put<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.510> water<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.959> once

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
basically just put in the water and once

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.509 
basically just put in the water and once
you<00:03:37.379> do<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.500> you're<00:03:37.739> going<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.950> make<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.310> two

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
you do that you're going to make a two

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.000 
you do that you're going to make a two
block<00:03:38.700> hi<00:03:39.060> kind<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.900> wall<00:03:40.140> it's<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.860> end

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
block hi kind of wall it's going to end

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.399 
block hi kind of wall it's going to end
up<00:03:41.159> being<00:03:41.400> three<00:03:41.879> blocks<00:03:42.150> high<00:03:42.360> but<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
up being three blocks high but the the

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.490 
up being three blocks high but the the
third<00:03:43.709> block<00:03:43.980> isn't<00:03:45.170> isn't<00:03:46.170> up<00:03:47.099> all<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.670> way

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
third block isn't isn't up all the way

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.970 
third block isn't isn't up all the way
but<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.709> can<00:03:49.890> just<00:03:49.920> frame<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.849> roof<00:03:51.980> so

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
but you can just frame it like a roof so

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.110 
but you can just frame it like a roof so
um<00:03:53.489> yeah<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.870> two<00:03:55.110> blocks<00:03:55.230> high<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.120> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
um yeah it's two blocks high and the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.320 
um yeah it's two blocks high and the
third<00:03:57.540> block<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.140> going<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.879> be<00:03:59.879> like<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.060> roof

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
third block is going to be like a roof

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.750 
third block is going to be like a roof
like<00:04:00.569> I<00:04:00.689> just<00:04:00.750> said<00:04:01.159> so<00:04:02.159> that<00:04:02.310> will<00:04:02.430> make<00:04:02.580> sure

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
like I just said so that will make sure

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.910 
like I just said so that will make sure
it<00:04:02.909> stays<00:04:03.150> dark<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.959> makes<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:04.680> the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
it stays dark and that makes it so the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.740 
it stays dark and that makes it so the
mobs<00:04:05.220> can<00:04:05.519> spawn<00:04:05.790> because<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.269> do<00:04:06.390> not<00:04:06.510> have<00:04:06.689> a

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
mobs can spawn because you do not have a

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.949 
mobs can spawn because you do not have a
monster<00:04:07.200> spawner<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.780> because<00:04:09.780> this

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
monster spawner so because this

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.449 
monster spawner so because this
essentially<00:04:10.680> you'll<00:04:10.799> be<00:04:10.890> building<00:04:11.159> this<00:04:11.280> in

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
essentially you'll be building this in

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.699 
essentially you'll be building this in
your<00:04:11.580> survival<00:04:12.180> world<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.629> get<00:04:12.840> items<00:04:13.200> like

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
your survival world to get items like

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.969 
your survival world to get items like
bones<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.939> spider<00:04:15.720> webs<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.350> spider<00:04:16.709> eyes

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
bones and spider webs and spider eyes

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.979 
bones and spider webs and spider eyes
and<00:04:17.489> arrows<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.030> stuff<00:04:18.150> like<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.419> those<00:04:18.840> are

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
and arrows and stuff like that those are

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.870 
and arrows and stuff like that those are
all<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.799> things<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.190> can<00:04:20.370> get<00:04:20.489> from<00:04:20.639> all

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
all the things that you can get from all

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.030 
all the things that you can get from all
the<00:04:21.000> mobs<00:04:21.209> because<00:04:22.019> there's<00:04:22.199> no<00:04:22.380> individual

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
the mobs because there's no individual

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.740 
the mobs because there's no individual
monster<00:04:23.370> spotters<00:04:23.759> in<00:04:23.790> here<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.960> will

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
monster spotters in here you will

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.100 
monster spotters in here you will
get<00:04:26.050> all<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.650> mobs<00:04:26.890> in<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:28.210> game<00:04:28.450> except

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
get all the mobs in the game except

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.990 
get all the mobs in the game except
endermen<00:04:29.770> tenormin<00:04:30.160> won't<00:04:30.310> fall<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:30.700> because

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
endermen tenormin won't fall in because

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.640 
endermen tenormin won't fall in because
they're<00:04:31.180> not<00:04:31.330> they<00:04:31.780> can't<00:04:32.050> even<00:04:32.230> go<00:04:32.350> in<00:04:32.500> water

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
they're not they can't even go in water

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.890 
they're not they can't even go in water
so<00:04:32.980> they're<00:04:33.130> not<00:04:33.250> affected<00:04:33.700> by<00:04:33.820> those<00:04:33.970> but<00:04:34.300> you

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
so they're not affected by those but you

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.600 
so they're not affected by those but you
will<00:04:35.050> get<00:04:35.200> creepers<00:04:35.680> following<00:04:36.040> skeletons

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
will get creepers following skeletons

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.000 
will get creepers following skeletons
following<00:04:37.030> spiders<00:04:37.540> falling<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.320> zombies

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
following spiders falling and zombies

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.230 
following spiders falling and zombies
falling<00:04:39.460> all<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.700> way<00:04:39.820> down<00:04:40.150> into<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:42.240> hopper

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
falling all the way down into the hopper

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.270 
falling all the way down into the hopper
area<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.020> then<00:04:44.170> all<00:04:44.320> their<00:04:44.500> items<00:04:44.800> will<00:04:44.980> yes

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
area and then all their items will yes

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.090 
area and then all their items will yes
they<00:04:45.580> will<00:04:45.700> go<00:04:45.850> into<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.330> chest<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:47.620> is<00:04:47.920> at

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
they will go into the chest that is at

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.280 
they will go into the chest that is at
the<00:04:48.220> bottom<00:04:48.370> you'll<00:04:48.760> need<00:04:49.000> one<00:04:49.300> double<00:04:50.050> chest

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
the bottom you'll need one double chest

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.400 
the bottom you'll need one double chest
that<00:04:50.560> would<00:04:50.680> do<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.890> trick<00:04:51.010> for<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:52.410> that

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
that would do the trick for you and that

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.230 
that would do the trick for you and that
will<00:04:53.530> give<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:54.070> enough<00:04:54.310> space<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.640> fill<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.150> up

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
will give you enough space to fill it up

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.290 
will give you enough space to fill it up
with<00:04:55.300> all<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.840> items<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.170> need<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:57.370> I<00:04:58.000> mean

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
with all the items you need and I mean

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.880 
with all the items you need and I mean
you'll<00:04:58.419> be<00:04:58.540> checking<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:58.960> periodically<00:04:59.470> so<00:04:59.680> in

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
you'll be checking in periodically so in

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.770 
you'll be checking in periodically so in
the<00:05:00.040> mops<00:05:00.250> don't<00:05:00.490> drop<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:00.820> many<00:05:01.300> at<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.510> time

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
the mops don't drop that many at a time

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.840 
the mops don't drop that many at a time
maybe<00:05:02.080> two<00:05:02.380> bones<00:05:02.650> at<00:05:02.890> a<00:05:02.950> time<00:05:03.190> for<00:05:03.370> skeleton

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
maybe two bones at a time for skeleton

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.630 
maybe two bones at a time for skeleton
in<00:05:03.970> one<00:05:04.150> arrow<00:05:04.419> maybe<00:05:04.930> you<00:05:05.830> know<00:05:05.980> one<00:05:06.250> spider

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
in one arrow maybe you know one spider

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
in one arrow maybe you know one spider
web<00:05:06.880> from<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> spider<00:05:09.030> one<00:05:10.030> piece<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.450> rotten

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
web from a spider one piece of rotten

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.510 
web from a spider one piece of rotten
flesh<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:11.350> know<00:05:11.470> they<00:05:11.680> don't<00:05:11.830> drop<00:05:12.130> that<00:05:12.160> much

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
flesh you know they don't drop that much

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.300 
flesh you know they don't drop that much
but<00:05:12.760> over<00:05:13.360> time<00:05:13.600> if<00:05:14.200> you<00:05:14.380> just<00:05:14.560> leave<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:14.919> up<00:05:15.070> it

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
but over time if you just leave it up it

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.720 
but over time if you just leave it up it
will<00:05:15.580> have<00:05:16.480> a<00:05:16.510> substantial<00:05:17.230> amount<00:05:17.730> so

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
will have a substantial amount so

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.100 
will have a substantial amount so
remember<00:05:19.030> when<00:05:19.270> you're<00:05:19.390> putting<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.750> hopper

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
remember when you're putting the hopper

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.020 
remember when you're putting the hopper
on<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.500> chest<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:20.919> want<00:05:21.100> to<00:05:21.220> hold<00:05:21.400> shift<00:05:21.790> and

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
on the chest you want to hold shift and

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
it drops in the hopper it won't work

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.340

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
they'll just sit on top of it so make

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.070
