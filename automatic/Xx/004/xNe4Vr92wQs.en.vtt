00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
make high higher high resolution so it's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.899

you<00:02:05.760> can<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.180> quarter<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.050> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you can see it's quarter of it so you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.699 
you can see it's quarter of it so you
can<00:02:07.229> tell<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.539> rim<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.050> vehicle<00:02:10.289> it

can tell on the rim on this vehicle it

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.010 
can tell on the rim on this vehicle it
multiplies<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.430> by<00:02:11.459> four<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.300> two<00:02:12.750> three

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
multiplies it by four so one two three

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.660 
multiplies it by four so one two three
four<00:02:13.290> no<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:14.670> would<00:02:14.820> be<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.120> interior<00:02:16.670> this

now<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.019> use<00:02:43.350> paint.net<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.400> not<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.910> what

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
now I use paint.net I do not know what

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.440 
now I use paint.net I do not know what
program<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.630> guys<00:02:45.840> use<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.650> um<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:48.060> should<00:02:48.330> be

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
program you guys use but um it should be

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.940 
program you guys use but um it should be
pretty<00:02:48.750> much<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.110> same<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.880> open<00:02:50.880> up<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:52.769> can

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
pretty much the same so open up you can

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.040 
pretty much the same so open up you can
either<00:02:53.100> open<00:02:53.250> up<00:02:53.430> paint<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:54.060> or<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.900> can

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
either open up paint on that or you can

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.800 
either open up paint on that or you can
open<00:02:55.350> up<00:02:55.850> Microsoft<00:02:56.850> Paint<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.510> I'll<00:02:57.660> use

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
open up Microsoft Paint but I'll use

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
open up Microsoft Paint but I'll use
paint<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.650> this

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
paint on that and this

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.200 
paint on that and this
okay<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:01.460> here's<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.910> photo<00:03:02.830> pretty<00:03:03.830> uh<00:03:04.210> looks

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
okay so here's the photo pretty uh looks

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.480 
okay so here's the photo pretty uh looks
like<00:03:05.300> looks<00:03:06.080> like<00:03:06.500> pretty<00:03:06.860> much<00:03:07.100> you

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
like looks like pretty much you

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.310 
like looks like pretty much you
could<00:03:07.610> see<00:03:07.760> all<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.030> pixelization<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.230> it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
could see all the pixelization and it

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.910 
could see all the pixelization and it
looks<00:03:09.500> pretty<00:03:09.680> grabby<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:11.530> first<00:03:12.530> thing<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.710> do

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
looks pretty grabby so first thing to do

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.330 
looks pretty grabby so first thing to do
from<00:03:13.040> high-res<00:03:13.520> is<00:03:14.560> I'll<00:03:15.560> select<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.160> whole

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
from high-res is I'll select the whole

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.600 
from high-res is I'll select the whole
image<00:03:16.640> go<00:03:17.360> image<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:19.630> we<00:03:21.010> resize<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.490> I'm

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
image go image and we resize and I'm

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.960 
image go image and we resize and I'm
gonna<00:03:22.820> multiply<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.840> size<00:03:24.220> by<00:03:25.220> percentage<00:03:25.760> of

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
gonna multiply the size by percentage of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.670 
gonna multiply the size by percentage of
500<00:03:26.720> percent<00:03:27.490> okay<00:03:29.290> there<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.380> go<00:03:30.470> now<00:03:30.650> it's

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
500 percent okay there you go now it's

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.380 
500 percent okay there you go now it's
multiplied<00:03:31.220> by<00:03:31.400> 500<00:03:31.850> percent

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
multiplied by 500 percent

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.580 
multiplied by 500 percent
the<00:03:33.350> original<00:03:33.890> texture<00:03:34.520> size<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.390> rim<00:03:35.630> was

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the original texture size of the rim was

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
the original texture size of the rim was
64<00:03:37.310> bit<00:03:37.580> by<00:03:38.330> 64

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
64 bit by 64

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.850 
64 bit by 64
now<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.420> is

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.970 

512<00:03:47.850> by<00:03:48.150> 512<00:03:49.310> says<00:03:50.310> pretty<00:03:51.060> big<00:03:51.270> difference

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
512 by 512 says pretty big difference

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.440 
512 by 512 says pretty big difference
more<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.310> higher<00:03:53.460> resolution<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.420> more

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
more like the higher resolution the more

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.510 
more like the higher resolution the more
you're<00:03:54.840> able<00:03:54.960> to<00:03:55.140> put<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:55.620> more<00:03:55.860> pixels<00:03:56.340> in

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
you're able to put like more pixels in

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.400 
you're able to put like more pixels in
it<00:03:56.670> aka<00:03:57.270> a<00:03:57.390> better<00:03:57.660> picture<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.610> san<00:03:59.610> andreas

looking around but just get enough for

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:34.670 
looking around but just get enough for
her<00:04:33.699> tutorial

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680

okay<00:04:37.000> now<00:04:37.270> on<00:04:37.449> paint<00:04:38.139> on<00:04:38.259> that<00:04:38.410> would<00:04:38.590> he<00:04:38.680> hit

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
okay now on paint on that would he hit

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.150 
okay now on paint on that would he hit
control<00:04:39.250> end<00:04:39.460> for<00:04:39.789> new<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:41.380> since<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.770> copied

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
control end for new and since I copied

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.800 
control end for new and since I copied
the<00:04:42.280> picture<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.729> automatically<00:04:43.300> sets<00:04:43.690> the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the picture it automatically sets the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.640 
the picture it automatically sets the
resolutions<00:04:45.270> pixels<00:04:46.270> there<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.139> go<00:04:47.289> there's

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
resolutions pixels there you go there's

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.559 
resolutions pixels there you go there's
a<00:04:47.710> rim<00:04:48.009> there's<00:04:48.550> new<00:04:48.880> rim<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.150> we're<00:04:49.449> going

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
a rim there's new rim that we're going

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.980 
a rim there's new rim that we're going
to<00:04:49.630> be<00:04:49.720> replacing<00:04:50.259> with<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.919> old<00:04:51.449> so<00:04:52.449> as<00:04:52.840> you

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
to be replacing with the old so as you

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.080 
to be replacing with the old so as you
can<00:04:53.110> see<00:04:53.169> this<00:04:53.650> is<00:04:53.830> like<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.160> top<00:04:54.370> left<00:04:54.699> corner

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
can see this is like the top left corner

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.120 
can see this is like the top left corner
of<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.780> rim<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.289> on<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:56.710> you'll<00:04:57.069> take<00:04:59.069> try<00:05:00.069> to

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
of the rim so on this you'll take try to

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.520 
of the rim so on this you'll take try to
get<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.520> center<00:05:00.849> and<00:05:01.509> then<00:05:01.900> go<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.319> top

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
get to the center and then go to the top

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.110 
get to the center and then go to the top
