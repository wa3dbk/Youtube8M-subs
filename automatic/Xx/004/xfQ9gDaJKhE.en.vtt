00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:10.800
 Good time, I want to continue our 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.040
 work topic beginners with work 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.310
 similar means now work with which 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.640
 almost everyone started this one 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 simple such a housekeeper can do 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 pretty necessary in the household not 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.349
 especially complicated means to us for this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.809
 need to do exactly that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.540
 the housekeeper is desirable of course have here 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.940
 these are carabiners they are separately 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.210
 there are sold but pretty well 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.129
 It's hard to buy but if we were allowed 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.230
 some kind of factory exactly with such 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.230
 carbines then this is what they say 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 what you need here is what you need a piece of skin 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:59.660
 what I showed the previous video 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.489
 such are the fasteners of thread 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.870
 Threads can be taken here in ordinary 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.590
 hardware store 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.210
 but as if I just did not specify in that video 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 if we assume you are not able to buy 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.100
 true Italian here you can take 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.740
 ordinary yarns sold in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.290
 hardware stores but for that their 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.420
 need before them 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.330
 stitch them need to sew 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.500
 surely finally finally i have wax 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.140
 bee here that is how to make roughly 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.170
 speaking through 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.600
 wax skip so that they are waxed 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.360
 but before you start 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.130
 Of course, it is desirable to stitch it 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.380
 ordinary laundry soap for 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.950
 to better thread slipped in the skin 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.920
 Well, how would this performance but you so 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:59.229
 we have that is key house means but 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:10.160
 let's not fit it 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 it turns out we probably have somewhere 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:21.790
 lazy why you will be on the line 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:24.640
 more accurate and honest we have width 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:33.680
 140 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:36.950
 height 120 here for a drop allowance 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.769
 small i mean but again do 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.549
 how do you first need to cut from simple 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.430
 paper means a pattern that's neat everything 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.829
 it is folded so that you all come together here 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.290
 necessarily here here by centers like me 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.470
 already showed the line to you 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.049
 It turned out perfectly exactly this part 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.160
 that is, when folded 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.519
 folded up so here so 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.390
 she looked 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.420
 why because a place is necessary here 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.910
 for keys for future so here here 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.110
 should not be small naturally 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.770
 the gaper that is, it's freer 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:31.290
 I also want to notice here 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:32.470
 the stamping here is done ready and 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.280
 stamps 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.860
 here is this pussy celtic movie celtic 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.530
 the mosaic here this time is present 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.100
 these are all guys who are 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.680
 here how to emboss 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.400
 engage embossing can be 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.400
 if someone is interested 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.730
 This is done on hot skin 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:03.010
 prepared in a natural way 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:07.620
 as if wetted is aged means 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:11.110
 here are the hooks here we have how to sew 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.890
 Naturally, I already showed you can not 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.780
 use 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.540
 here let's say we have here let's say 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.160
 still here such things are specifically for 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.860
 skin but the same is 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.510
 tailoring as it were 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.480
 there is also a markup it is called 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.190
 marking wheel here is a distance of 4 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.830
 millimeter worth that is there it is like 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.750
 the best option that I am here 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.910
 picked up for myself that is here 4 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.850
 millimeter 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:50.680
 everything works just like this 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:52.930
 rolls and awl begin to drink I 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.430
 I just want to say something else 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:01.360
 such an author's work 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:03.460
 this is what they say to catch up with this 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.159
 why because if you allow 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.250
 There is now these carabiner of can 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:11.050
 do here so here how did i that is 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.780
 this here in the absence of this data 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.830
 carbines here you can just like this 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.629
 Kara stamp put here and here's the 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.789
 This belt is just inserted here. 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.919
 key ring by the way is very convenient 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.870
 why because that's when doing here 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.500
 so they close 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.550
 and when it opens it turns out that 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.400
 it pops up 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.169
 outside and very comfortable to have to engage 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:40.930
 Well, how can you do such here 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:44.490
 it is one kind that's what fantasy 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.419
 I made such a kind of soul to buckwheat 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.330
 jersey type 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.009
 but this one here is all similar 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.310
 that's done here 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.310
 markers that is like 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:04.029
 imitation of the seams and it turns out that the chest here 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.370
 as if it is a poppy paddock and 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:12.909
 Others such here we have 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:18.339
 things can be done without much use 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:22.960
 such tools just scissors here 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:25.560
 Knife skin sewed and needle just until new 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.560
 meetings yet
