thing I had said in the second video was

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290 
thing I had said in the second video was
that<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> thought<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.489> olive<00:00:32.940> oil<00:00:33.180> was

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that I thought that olive oil was

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.660 
that I thought that olive oil was
winning<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:34.079> liked<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.920> feel<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
winning I really liked the feel and the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.700 
winning I really liked the feel and the
way<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.880> eyebrows<00:00:36.420> were<00:00:36.630> growing<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.440> olive

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
way my eyebrows were growing with olive

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.790 
way my eyebrows were growing with olive
oil<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.610> general<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.180> enjoyed<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
oil I just in general I enjoyed it

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.090 
oil I just in general I enjoyed it
however<00:00:41.600> one<00:00:42.600> thing<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.170> did<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.860> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
however one thing I did see was that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.660 
however one thing I did see was that
after<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.879> while<00:00:45.270> my<00:00:45.770> eyebrows<00:00:46.770> stop<00:00:47.280> growing

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
after a while my eyebrows stop growing

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.690 
after a while my eyebrows stop growing
and<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.710> rel<00:00:50.399> sort<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and I think it's because I rel sort of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.229 
and I think it's because I rel sort of
growing<00:00:51.090> cycles<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.379> my<00:00:52.800> cycles<00:00:53.399> done<00:00:53.730> for

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
growing cycles and my cycles done for

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
growing cycles and my cycles done for
him<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> while<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:57.559> yeah<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> did<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.010> some

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
him for a while but yeah I did see some

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
him for a while but yeah I did see some
positive<00:00:59.820> effects<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.510> both<00:01:00.719> eyebrows<00:01:01.140> which

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
positive effects on both eyebrows which

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.399 
positive effects on both eyebrows which
was<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.190> interesting<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.140> let's<00:01:04.140> start

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
was very interesting and let's start

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.950 
was very interesting and let's start
with<00:01:04.470> olive<00:01:04.799> oil<00:01:05.210> okay<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.479> olive<00:01:06.840> oil

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
with olive oil okay now with olive oil

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.770 
with olive oil okay now with olive oil
what<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> found<00:01:07.680> was<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.159> my<00:01:08.700> eyebrow<00:01:09.270> should

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
what I found was that my eyebrow should

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.250 
what I found was that my eyebrow should
have<00:01:09.979> longer<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.790> example<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.869> eyebrows

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
have longer for example if my eyebrows

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.649 
have longer for example if my eyebrows
are sort<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> ending<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> this

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
are sort of ending right there and this

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.340 
are sort of ending right there and this
one<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:16.020> 40<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.799> bit<00:01:16.979> more<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.350> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
one would 40 a little bit more out and I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.429 
one would 40 a little bit more out and I
have<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.400> gap<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.119> little<00:01:21.180> bit<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.049> gap<00:01:22.229> in

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
have like a gap a little bit of a gap in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
have like a gap a little bit of a gap in
the<00:01:22.560> middle<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> eyebrow<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.670> sort<00:01:23.939> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the middle of the eyebrow and sort of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.320 
the middle of the eyebrow and sort of
covered<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:25.080> well<00:01:25.310> now<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.759> castor

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
covered it really well now with castor

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.760 
covered it really well now with castor
oil<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.810> difference<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> instead<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
oil the difference is that instead of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.800 
oil the difference is that instead of
growing<00:01:28.979> longer<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.970> sort<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> grew<00:01:30.420> thicker

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
growing longer it sort of grew thicker

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.350 
growing longer it sort of grew thicker
you<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.579> really<00:01:32.610> thick<00:01:33.090> in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you know it would get really thick in

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.350 
you know it would get really thick in
the<00:01:33.479> center<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.460> curve<00:01:35.909> at

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the center and I have like a curve at

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.450 
the center and I have like a curve at
the<00:01:36.390> end<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:36.990> eyebrow<00:01:37.229> I'm<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.220> show<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the end of my eyebrow I'm gonna show it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.039 
the end of my eyebrow I'm gonna show it
to<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.880> guys<00:01:39.030> later<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.659> there's<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
to you guys later but there's like this

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.539 
to you guys later but there's like this
curve<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.560> end<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> above<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
curve at the end of the above the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.399 
curve at the end of the above the
eyebrow

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
eyebrow

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.279 
eyebrow
and<00:01:42.999> since<00:01:43.999> it<00:01:44.179> didn't<00:01:44.450> really<00:01:44.539> grow<00:01:44.869> longer

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
and since it didn't really grow longer

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.950 
and since it didn't really grow longer
it<00:01:46.249> didn't<00:01:46.850> do<00:01:46.969> anything<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.630> sort<00:01:47.929> of

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
it didn't do anything to that sort of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.639 
it didn't do anything to that sort of
weird<00:01:48.259> curve<00:01:48.590> at<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.770> end<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.759> they<00:01:49.939> both<00:01:50.649> work

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
weird curve at the end so they both work

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.179 
weird curve at the end so they both work
in<00:01:51.950> different<00:01:52.159> ways<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:53.780> depends<00:01:54.259> on<00:01:54.380> what

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
in different ways it depends on what

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.010 
in different ways it depends on what
