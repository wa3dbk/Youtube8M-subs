when<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.710> used<00:00:31.770> to<00:00:31.950> test<00:00:32.130> cartridges<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.880> them

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
when I used to test cartridges on them

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
back of the printer it will actually

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.910 
back of the printer it will actually
stick<00:01:21.569> on<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.990> way

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920

there both it and as you can see the
pipe<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.920> coming<00:02:37.460> out<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.120> needs<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.360> go

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
pipe is coming out it and it needs to go

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.540 
pipe is coming out it and it needs to go
across<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:38.960> left<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:40.160> feed<00:02:40.400> it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
across to the left so just feed it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.870 
across to the left so just feed it
through<00:02:42.250> keep<00:02:43.250> feeding<00:02:43.490> it<00:02:43.610> through<00:02:43.670> I'll

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
through keep feeding it through I'll

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.120 
through keep feeding it through I'll
move<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.210> camera<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.660> can<00:02:44.780> see<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.440> it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
move the camera so you can see and it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
move the camera so you can see and it
comes<00:02:46.400> over<00:02:49.630> over<00:02:50.630> here<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.050> arm<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:52.150> into

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
comes over over here to the arm and into

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.290 
comes over over here to the arm and into
the<00:02:53.390> arm<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.960> arm<00:02:54.140> holds<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.130> I'm<00:02:56.060> going<00:02:56.240> to

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
the arm so the arm holds it I'm going to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.050 
the arm so the arm holds it I'm going to
go<00:02:56.390> into<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.720> printer

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
go into the printer

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.750 
go into the printer
so<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.300> see<00:02:59.480> how<00:02:59.690> it's<00:02:59.900> done<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.640> bit

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
so you can see how it's done it's a bit

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.430 
so you can see how it's done it's a bit

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.000 
if you look here see where my finger is
there<00:03:08.210> the<00:03:08.870> pipes<00:03:09.080> are<00:03:09.230> coming<00:03:09.470> out<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.890> the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
there the pipes are coming out to the

perfectly straight you don't want any
twists<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.430> then<00:03:13.610> it's<00:03:13.760> curling<00:03:14.030> over<00:03:14.300> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
twists and then it's curling over and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.260 
twists and then it's curling over and
through<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.770> arm<00:03:16.070> here<00:03:16.570> Tran<00:03:17.570> get<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:17.870> there

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
through the arm here Tran get in there

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.090 
through the arm here Tran get in there
there<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.570> can<00:03:20.840> see<00:03:21.020> there<00:03:21.260> comes<00:03:21.620> from<00:03:21.710> there

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
there you can see there comes from there

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.620 
there you can see there comes from there
over<00:03:22.790> here<00:03:23.000> curls<00:03:23.870> up<00:03:24.680> here<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.310> through<00:03:25.940> and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
over here curls up here and through and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.380 
over here curls up here and through and
across<00:03:27.020> here<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:28.070> it's<00:03:28.310> coming<00:03:28.610> out<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:28.880> this

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
across here and it's coming out of this

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.590 
across here and it's coming out of this
door<00:03:29.750> here<00:03:30.740> so<00:03:33.070> then<00:03:34.070> we<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.000> clip<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.360> into

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
door here so then we just clip it into

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.700 
door here so then we just clip it into
there<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:38.360> will<00:03:38.600> stop<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.140> from<00:03:39.350> moving

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
there and that will stop it from moving

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.460 
there and that will stop it from moving
around<00:03:40.570> so<00:03:41.570> I'll<00:03:41.690> try<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:41.930> get<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.140> camera

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
around so I'll try and get the camera

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.530 
around so I'll try and get the camera
right<00:03:42.740> in<00:03:42.980> here<00:03:43.340> it's<00:03:43.700> coming<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.270> left

look it's curling up and back through

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.110 
look it's curling up and back through

we've<00:04:06.710> got<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.920> bottles<00:04:07.220> they're<00:04:07.540> black<00:04:08.540> cyan

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
we've got the bottles they're black cyan

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.030 
we've got the bottles they're black cyan
yellow<00:04:09.500> magenta<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:12.200> if<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.590> look<00:04:12.770> here

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
yellow magenta and if you look here

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.340 
yellow magenta and if you look here
we've<00:04:13.340> taken<00:04:13.640> out<00:04:13.910> at<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.210> top<00:04:14.540> at<00:04:14.750> small<00:04:15.050> buns

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
we've taken out at the top at small buns

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.010 
we've taken out at the top at small buns
but<00:04:16.310> left<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.609> big<00:04:16.790> ones<00:04:17.060> in<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.570> bottom<00:04:17.870> you

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
but left the big ones in the bottom you

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.410 
but left the big ones in the bottom you
take<00:04:18.200> out<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.500> small<00:04:19.130> ones<00:04:19.340> at<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.580> top<00:04:19.820> and

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
take out the small ones at the top and

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.740 
take out the small ones at the top and
you<00:04:20.570> put<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:20.989> these<00:04:21.739> air<00:04:22.160> spaces<00:04:22.580> into<00:04:23.450> each

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
you put in these air spaces into each

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.310 
you put in these air spaces into each
one<00:04:24.260> which<00:04:25.040> allows<00:04:25.520> air<00:04:26.030> in<00:04:26.270> but<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.840> won't<00:04:27.080> let

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
one which allows air in but it won't let

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.610 
one which allows air in but it won't let
ink<00:04:27.919> fly<00:04:28.490> out<00:04:28.669> if<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.870> actually<00:04:30.140> don't<00:04:30.500> ly

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
ink fly out if you actually don't ly

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.270 
ink fly out if you actually don't ly
knock<00:04:30.800> it

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
knock it

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.580 
knock it
so<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.090> must<00:04:32.330> be<00:04:32.540> on<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.960> same<00:04:32.990> level<00:04:33.440> you

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
so that must be on the same level you

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.350 
so that must be on the same level you
cannot<00:04:34.010> have<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.430> higher<00:04:34.670> than<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.940> printer

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
cannot have it higher than the printer

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.510 
cannot have it higher than the printer
or<00:04:35.690> lower<00:04:36.440> than<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.740> printer<00:04:37.010> it's<00:04:37.160> got<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.430> be

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
or lower than the printer it's got to be

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.820 
or lower than the printer it's got to be
on<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.880> same<00:04:38.120> level<00:04:38.300> because<00:04:38.990> that's<00:04:39.200> how<00:04:39.620> it

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
on the same level because that's how it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.330 
on the same level because that's how it
is<00:04:40.040> balanced<00:04:40.640> right<00:04:41.630> before<00:04:41.930> I'll<00:04:42.110> print<00:04:42.440> it's

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
is balanced right before I'll print it's

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.860 
is balanced right before I'll print it's
got<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.670> think<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.060> lid<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.240> down<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.810> we

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
got to think that the lid is down and we

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.300 
got to think that the lid is down and we
don't<00:04:45.050> want<00:04:45.230> to<00:04:45.320> put<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.530> lid<00:04:45.710> down<00:04:45.890> totally

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
don't want to put a lid down totally

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.760 
don't want to put a lid down totally
because<00:04:47.090> of<00:04:47.240> this<00:04:47.420> pipe<00:04:47.690> even<00:04:48.500> though<00:04:48.620> it's

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
because of this pipe even though it's

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.790 
because of this pipe even though it's
only<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:49.040> mil<00:04:49.310> or<00:04:49.430> two<00:04:49.670> or<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.960> is<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.410> sensor

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
only a mil or two or this is the sensor

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.900 
only a mil or two or this is the sensor
here<00:04:52.510> which<00:04:53.510> goes<00:04:53.780> into<00:04:53.960> there<00:04:54.760> pushes<00:04:55.760> it

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
here which goes into there pushes it

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.400 
here which goes into there pushes it
down<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.420> the<00:04:56.510> printer<00:04:56.840> knows<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.260> lid

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
down and the printer knows that the lid

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.130 
down and the printer knows that the lid
is<00:04:57.650> closed<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:59.210> is<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.390> bit<00:04:59.570> rickety<00:04:59.780> to<00:05:00.020> this

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
is closed this is a bit rickety to this

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.140 
is closed this is a bit rickety to this
one<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.680> it's<00:05:01.340> an<00:05:01.430> old<00:05:01.550> printer<00:05:01.820> so<00:05:01.910> I'm<00:05:01.970> going

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
one and it's an old printer so I'm going

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.180 
one and it's an old printer so I'm going
to<00:05:02.240> tap<00:05:02.480> it<00:05:02.660> in<00:05:02.840> because<00:05:03.410> that's<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:03.680> bit<00:05:03.830> stiff

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
to tap it in because that's a bit stiff

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.100 
to tap it in because that's a bit stiff
but<00:05:04.490> what<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.060> do<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.390> just<00:05:05.450> put<00:05:05.630> something

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
but what you do you just put something

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.770 
but what you do you just put something
into<00:05:06.230> there<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:07.370> hold<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:07.790> down<00:05:08.030> I've<00:05:08.420> just<00:05:08.570> put

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
into there to hold it down I've just put

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.120 
into there to hold it down I've just put
that<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.140> you<00:05:09.200> can<00:05:09.320> put<00:05:09.440> something<00:05:09.620> smaller

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
that and you can put something smaller

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.430 
that and you can put something smaller
obviously<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:11.150> immediately<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:11.960> printer

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
obviously and immediately the printer

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.230 
obviously and immediately the printer
thought<00:05:12.800> that<00:05:13.100> with<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.250> lid<00:05:13.670> was<00:05:13.940> closed

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
thought that with the lid was closed

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.090 
thought that with the lid was closed
there<00:05:14.540> you<00:05:14.690> saw<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.200> was<00:05:15.350> starting<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:15.980> move

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
there you saw it was starting to move

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.430 
there you saw it was starting to move
around<00:05:16.310> so<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:17.690> can<00:05:17.810> actually<00:05:17.930> print<00:05:18.200> with<00:05:18.410> a

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
around so you can actually print with a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.280 
around so you can actually print with a
lid<00:05:18.590> open<00:05:18.890> if<00:05:19.010> you<00:05:19.100> want<00:05:20.140> so<00:05:21.140> that's

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
lid open if you want so that's

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.290 
lid open if you want so that's
registered<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.070> lid<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.370> down<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.970> it's

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
registered that the lid is down and it's

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.550 
registered that the lid is down and it's
ready<00:05:23.540> to<00:05:23.720> print<00:05:23.930> it's<00:05:24.140> going<00:05:24.350> through<00:05:24.470> its

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
ready to print it's going through its

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.520 
ready to print it's going through its
sequence<00:05:25.100> now<00:05:25.900> but<00:05:26.900> I'm<00:05:26.990> not<00:05:27.020> going<00:05:27.140> to<00:05:27.320> film

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
sequence now but I'm not going to film

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.010 
sequence now but I'm not going to film
it<00:05:27.650> it'll<00:05:27.920> be<00:05:28.010> quite<00:05:28.250> some<00:05:28.520> time<00:05:28.820> I'll<00:05:29.720> be<00:05:29.870> back

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
it it'll be quite some time I'll be back

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.290 
it it'll be quite some time I'll be back
in<00:05:30.050> one<00:05:30.350> second<00:05:30.830> with<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.610> next<00:05:31.850> stage<00:05:32.030> so

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
in one second with the next stage so

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.460 
in one second with the next stage so
we've<00:05:32.480> got<00:05:32.570> it<00:05:32.630> all<00:05:32.690> set<00:05:32.900> up<00:05:32.930> all<00:05:33.200> there<00:05:33.350> is

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470

left now is its a prince radish go on to

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.840 
left now is its a prince radish go on to
the<00:05:36.290> computer<00:05:37.450> and<00:05:38.450> tell<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:39.020> print

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
the computer and tell it to print

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.340 
the computer and tell it to print
I'll<00:05:40.850> leave<00:05:41.090> a<00:05:41.120> lid<00:05:41.330> up<00:05:41.450> for<00:05:41.660> a<00:05:41.690> bit<00:05:41.870> so<00:05:42.200> you<00:05:42.260> can

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
I'll leave a lid up for a bit so you can

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.910 
I'll leave a lid up for a bit so you can
see<00:05:42.440> it<00:05:42.650> printing<00:05:43.070> with<00:05:43.190> the<00:05:43.250> lid<00:05:43.370> open<00:05:44.920> then

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
see it printing with the lid open then

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:53.440 
see it printing with the lid open then
I'll<00:05:46.670> put<00:05:46.850> the<00:05:46.880> lid<00:05:47.030> down<00:05:47.060> as<00:05:47.480> well<00:05:52.450> you're
