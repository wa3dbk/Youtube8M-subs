there are three good things that go into
our<00:00:24.990> arm<00:00:25.530> swing<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:26.010> helps<00:00:26.280> us<00:00:26.370> maintain

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
our arm swing which helps us maintain

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.460 
our arm swing which helps us maintain
our<00:00:26.940> posture<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.510> sense<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.869> flow<00:00:28.140> while<00:00:28.350> we

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
our posture and sense of flow while we

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.910 
our posture and sense of flow while we
run<00:00:28.700> one<00:00:29.700> our<00:00:30.180> shoulders<00:00:30.990> need<00:00:31.350> to<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.650> nice

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
and driving straight behind us three our

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.299

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
wrists need to have just a little bit of

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.970 
wrists need to have just a little bit of
tension<00:00:44.580> not<00:00:45.300> too<00:00:45.540> much<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:46.230> too<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.530> as

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
tension not too much not too little as

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.439 
tension not too much not too little as
we<00:00:47.160> go<00:00:47.280> down<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.580> road<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.850> well

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.850 

the<00:00:57.449> first<00:00:57.720> main<00:00:57.900> problem<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.470> with<00:00:58.620> those

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
the first main problem is with those

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.160 
the first main problem is with those
tight<00:00:59.159> shoulders<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.909> you<00:01:00.360> think<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.720> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
tight shoulders if you think about it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.079 
tight shoulders if you think about it
gravity's<00:01:01.830> pulling<00:01:02.220> it<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.850> us<00:01:02.940> no

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
gravity's pulling it down on us no

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.060 
gravity's pulling it down on us no
matter<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:03.540> we<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.050> to<00:01:04.229> create<00:01:04.769> some

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
matter what we have to create some

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
matter what we have to create some
tension<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.700> stand<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.210> against<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.170> up

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
tension to stand up against it it's up

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.070 
tension to stand up against it it's up
to<00:01:07.500> us<00:01:07.650> where<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.460> put<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> tension<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.570> we're

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to us where we put that tension if we're

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
to us where we put that tension if we're
loose<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> middle<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.190> tension<00:01:11.549> goes<00:01:11.700> up

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
loose in the middle that tension goes up

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
loose in the middle that tension goes up
on<00:01:11.970> our<00:01:12.060> shoulders<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.320> real<00:01:13.470> stiff

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
on our shoulders and we get real stiff

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.670 
on our shoulders and we get real stiff
up<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.729> shift<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.690> tension<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.530> our

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
up here so shift that tension to our

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
up here so shift that tension to our
belly<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.100> butt<00:01:17.370> and<00:01:17.640> our<00:01:18.060> posture<00:01:18.510> video<00:01:18.780> we

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
belly and butt and our posture video we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.270 
belly and butt and our posture video we
talked<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> butt<00:01:19.710> squeeze<00:01:19.890> test

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
talked about the butt squeeze test

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
talked about the butt squeeze test
that's<00:01:20.670> gonna<00:01:20.909> help<00:01:21.119> us<00:01:21.299> relax<00:01:21.600> those

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that's gonna help us relax those

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.120 
that's gonna help us relax those
shoulders<00:01:22.080> relax<00:01:23.070> those<00:01:23.310> ankles<00:01:25.130> second

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
shoulders relax those ankles second

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.910 
shoulders relax those ankles second
thing<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:27.000> lose<00:01:27.300> that<00:01:27.330> 90<00:01:27.990> degree<00:01:28.320> elbow<00:01:28.740> our

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
thing we lose that 90 degree elbow our

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.610 
thing we lose that 90 degree elbow our
arms<00:01:29.400> start<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.730> swing<00:01:30.540> down<00:01:30.750> closer<00:01:31.170> towards

so<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> sudden<00:01:54.720> you've<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:54.870> this

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
so all of a sudden you've got this

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.990 
so all of a sudden you've got this
little<00:01:55.530> wrist<00:01:55.890> shake<00:01:56.250> when<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.490> run<00:01:56.760> down<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
little wrist shake when you run down the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
little wrist shake when you run down the
way<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.570> what<00:01:58.260> we<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.620> think<00:01:58.770> about

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
way and what we want to think about

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.160 
way and what we want to think about
actually<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.850> tightening<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.720> those<00:02:00.870> risks

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
actually it's tightening up those risks

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.990 
actually it's tightening up those risks
a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.440> bit<00:02:01.560> because<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.400> add<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.730> little

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
a little bit because if I add a little

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
a little bit because if I add a little
