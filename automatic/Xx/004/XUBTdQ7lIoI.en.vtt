her overall assessment right now we're

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.400 
her overall assessment right now we're
looking<00:00:31.149> at<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.480> chrome<00:00:31.719> where<00:00:31.989> I<00:00:32.050> cleaned<00:00:32.320> a

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
looking at the chrome where I cleaned a

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.780 
looking at the chrome where I cleaned a
little<00:00:32.619> spot<00:00:32.829> just<00:00:33.040> to<00:00:33.129> kind<00:00:33.370> of<00:00:33.399> see<00:00:33.550> how<00:00:33.579> it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
little spot just to kind of see how it

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.610 
little spot just to kind of see how it
is<00:00:33.940> now<00:00:34.629> we've<00:00:34.780> got<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.899> little<00:00:35.020> rash<00:00:35.260> on<00:00:35.500> the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
is now we've got a little rash on the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.810 
is now we've got a little rash on the
front<00:00:35.829> of<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:35.950> fender<00:00:36.190> here<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.670> little

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
front of the fender here and a little

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.540 
front of the fender here and a little
pitting<00:00:37.180> in<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.300> chrome<00:00:37.390> which<00:00:37.870> is<00:00:38.050> not<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:39.399> be

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
pitting in the chrome which is not to be

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.670 
pitting in the chrome which is not to be
unexpected<00:00:40.210> for<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.450> age<00:00:40.750> of<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:40.960> bike

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
unexpected for the age of the bike

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.500 
unexpected for the age of the bike
however<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.399> exhaust<00:00:42.699> cleaned<00:00:43.180> up<00:00:43.329> very

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
however the exhaust cleaned up very

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.690 
however the exhaust cleaned up very
nicely<00:00:43.840> just<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.770> one<00:00:44.920> little<00:00:45.100> spot<00:00:45.430> so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
nicely just the one little spot so

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.890 
nicely just the one little spot so
that's<00:00:45.940> going<00:00:46.060> to<00:00:46.120> be<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.270> nice<00:00:46.450> thing<00:00:46.690> that's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
that's going to be a nice thing that's

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.540 
that's going to be a nice thing that's
good<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.170> see<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.560> that's<00:00:47.650> also<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.100> kind<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.430> a

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
good to see and that's also a kind of a

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.310 
good to see and that's also a kind of a
rare<00:00:48.700> part<00:00:49.000> as<00:00:49.150> well<00:00:49.329> so<00:00:49.720> we'll<00:00:49.989> be<00:00:50.110> able<00:00:50.140> to

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
rare part as well so we'll be able to

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.650 
rare part as well so we'll be able to
save<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.770> make<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.130> look<00:00:51.250> really<00:00:51.520> nice<00:00:51.670> we

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
also went around and did the rear fender

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.280 
also went around and did the rear fender
as<00:00:54.820> well<00:00:55.000> just<00:00:55.270> clean<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.540> little<00:00:55.780> spot<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:55.989> it

as well just clean a little spot on it
just<00:00:56.470> to<00:00:56.590> see<00:00:56.739> how<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:56.950> was<00:00:57.130> in<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.640> wheels<00:00:57.820> and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
just to see how it was in the wheels and

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.150 
just to see how it was in the wheels and
now<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.020> next<00:00:59.260> step<00:00:59.410> we're<00:00:59.530> gonna<00:00:59.590> do<00:00:59.829> is<00:01:00.010> run

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
now the next step we're gonna do is run

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.710 
now the next step we're gonna do is run
a<00:01:00.190> compression<00:01:00.670> test<00:01:00.880> on<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.180> just<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.390> tell<00:01:01.600> us

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
a compression test on it just to tell us

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.709 
a compression test on it just to tell us
the<00:01:01.920> state<00:01:02.920> of<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.100> engine<00:01:03.399> and<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:04.299> we'll

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:04.719 
the state of the engine and so we'll

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.560 
the state of the engine and so we'll
detail<00:01:05.469> that<00:01:05.649> here<00:01:05.829> and<00:01:06.070> then<00:01:06.939> keep<00:01:07.270> moving

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
detail that here and then keep moving

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.440 
detail that here and then keep moving
along<00:01:08.460> alright<00:01:09.460> we're<00:01:09.729> now<00:01:09.820> ready<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.180> do<00:01:10.329> the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
along alright we're now ready to do the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.020 
along alright we're now ready to do the
compression<00:01:10.869> test<00:01:11.079> on<00:01:11.229> this<00:01:11.439> bike<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:12.790> you'll

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
compression test on this bike as you'll

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.310 
compression test on this bike as you'll
notice<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.390> looks<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.600> little<00:01:13.689> different<00:01:13.899> than

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
notice it looks a little different than

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.600 
notice it looks a little different than
it<00:01:14.439> did<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.680> first<00:01:14.710> time<00:01:15.130> around<00:01:15.310> that's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
it did the first time around that's

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.039 
it did the first time around that's
because<00:01:15.880> we<00:01:16.000> had<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.210> remove<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.570> tank<00:01:16.780> and

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
because we had to remove the tank and

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.389 
because we had to remove the tank and
both<00:01:17.409> side<00:01:17.649> covers<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.249> air<00:01:18.369> cleaner

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
both side covers and air cleaner

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.760 
both side covers and air cleaner
assemblies<00:01:19.270> because<00:01:19.450> well<00:01:20.350> if<00:01:20.409> carburetor

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
assemblies because well if carburetor

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.230 
assemblies because well if carburetor
slides<00:01:21.069> were<00:01:21.219> stuck<00:01:21.490> from<00:01:21.609> sitting<00:01:21.939> for<00:01:22.119> so

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
slides were stuck from sitting for so

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.779 
slides were stuck from sitting for so
long<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:23.619> those<00:01:23.920> carburetor<00:01:24.310> slides<00:01:24.579> are

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
long because those carburetor slides are

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.249 
long because those carburetor slides are
stuck<00:01:24.969> we<00:01:25.090> can't<00:01:25.299> properly<00:01:25.749> do<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:25.899> compression

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
stuck we can't properly do a compression

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.080 
stuck we can't properly do a compression
test<00:01:26.409> because<00:01:27.399> we<00:01:27.429> need<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.759> open<00:01:27.969> the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
test because we need to open the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.489 
test because we need to open the
throttle<00:01:28.270> wide<00:01:28.600> open<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:29.049> allow<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.289> engine

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
throttle wide open to allow the engine

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.379 
throttle wide open to allow the engine
to<00:01:29.679> get<00:01:29.829> as<00:01:29.920> much<00:01:30.100> air<00:01:30.369> in<00:01:30.399> as<00:01:30.639> possible<00:01:30.850> while

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:31.389 
to get as much air in as possible while

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:32.969 
to get as much air in as possible while
we're<00:01:31.509> doing<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.779> compression<00:01:32.200> test<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.950> now

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
we're doing the compression test so now

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.010 
we're doing the compression test so now
here<00:01:33.219> we<00:01:33.249> are<00:01:33.689> compression<00:01:34.689> gauge<00:01:34.840> is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
here we are compression gauge is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.840 
here we are compression gauge is

installed in the left hand cylinder I'm
holding<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.209> gauge<00:01:37.359> in<00:01:37.539> my<00:01:37.659> hand<00:01:37.899> we're<00:01:38.499> gonna

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
holding the gauge in my hand we're gonna

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.499 
holding the gauge in my hand we're gonna
turn<00:01:38.859> the<00:01:38.979> key<00:01:39.159> on<00:01:39.189> I've<00:01:39.759> got<00:01:39.999> it<00:01:40.090> connected<00:01:40.209> to

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:54.410 
it open and we're gonna give it a crank
and<00:01:46.119> see<00:01:46.299> where<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.539> compression<00:01:46.779> goes

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.970 

okay<00:01:55.420> we're<00:01:55.600> at<00:01:55.660> about<00:01:55.810> 160<00:01:56.440> pounds<00:01:56.620> which<00:01:56.950> is

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
okay we're at about 160 pounds which is

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.100 
okay we're at about 160 pounds which is
absolutely<00:01:57.670> excellent<00:01:58.030> that's<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:58.960> what

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
absolutely excellent that's just what

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.660 
absolutely excellent that's just what
we're<00:01:59.230> looking<00:01:59.500> for<00:01:59.740> now<00:02:00.250> we're<00:02:00.370> going<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.520> go

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
we're looking for now we're going to go

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.440 
we're looking for now we're going to go
over<00:02:00.820> we're<00:02:00.880> gonna<00:02:00.970> do<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.270> right<00:02:01.420> hand

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
over we're gonna do the right hand

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.780 
over we're gonna do the right hand
cylinder<00:02:02.080> all<00:02:02.980> right<00:02:03.100> now<00:02:03.280> we're<00:02:03.490> over<00:02:03.670> here

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
cylinder all right now we're over here

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.060 
cylinder all right now we're over here
on<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.000> right<00:02:04.150> side<00:02:04.440> Deeb's<00:02:05.440> is<00:02:05.590> installed<00:02:05.980> in

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
on the right side Deeb's is installed in

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.320 
on the right side Deeb's is installed in
the<00:02:06.130> right<00:02:06.280> cylinder<00:02:06.610> throttle<00:02:07.150> wide<00:02:07.300> open

the right cylinder throttle wide open

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.900 
the right cylinder throttle wide open
key<00:02:08.050> on<00:02:08.260> and<00:02:08.680> we're<00:02:09.130> gonna<00:02:09.220> start<00:02:09.550> cranking

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
key on and we're gonna start cranking

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:20.840 
key on and we're gonna start cranking
okay<00:02:10.180> we<00:02:10.930> turn<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.230> key<00:02:11.380> all<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.740> way<00:02:11.860> on<00:02:12.070> and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.250 

we're<00:02:21.850> almost<00:02:21.970> 200<00:02:22.570> pounds<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.110> right

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
we're almost 200 pounds on the right

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.010 
we're almost 200 pounds on the right
side<00:02:23.530> which<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.980> even<00:02:24.520> better<00:02:25.020> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
side which is even better the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.660 
side which is even better the
discrepancy<00:02:26.620> may<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:27.010> be<00:02:27.130> from<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.460> fact

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
discrepancy may just be from the fact

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.250 
discrepancy may just be from the fact
that<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.000> sat<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.420> long<00:02:28.570> time

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
that it's sat for a long time

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.890 
that it's sat for a long time
Carbon<00:02:29.770> behind<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.190> Rings<00:02:30.690> possibly<00:02:31.690> just

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
Carbon behind the Rings possibly just

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.890 
Carbon behind the Rings possibly just
dry<00:02:32.080> cylinders<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.130> again<00:02:33.790> not<00:02:34.240> any<00:02:34.570> cause<00:02:34.870> for

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
dry cylinders so again not any cause for

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.540 
dry cylinders so again not any cause for
concern<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:35.740> certainly<00:02:36.070> excellent

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
concern but certainly excellent

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.190 
concern but certainly excellent
compression<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.060> bike<00:02:37.210> should<00:02:37.450> run<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:37.990> that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
compression the bike should run on that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.840 
compression the bike should run on that
obviously<00:02:39.160> we<00:02:39.220> will<00:02:39.310> have<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.460> lot<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.670> other

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
obviously we will have a lot of other

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.520 
obviously we will have a lot of other
issues<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.300> tackle<00:02:40.690> here<00:02:40.870> but<00:02:41.110> at<00:02:41.230> least<00:02:41.350> we

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
issues to tackle here but at least we

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.960 
issues to tackle here but at least we
know<00:02:41.650> we've<00:02:41.830> got<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> solid<00:02:42.400> engine<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> start

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
know we've got a solid engine to start

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.210 
know we've got a solid engine to start
with<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.870> there<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.350> have<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.680> part<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.100> it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
with so there you have that part of it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.410 
with so there you have that part of it
there<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.430> we'll<00:02:45.700> move<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.120> with<00:02:46.300> our

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
there and we'll move on with our

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.510 
there and we'll move on with our
estimate<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.140> keep<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:47.800> along<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
estimate and keep going along on the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.390 
estimate and keep going along on the
seal<00:02:48.730> 170<00:02:49.360> all<00:02:50.170> right<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.620> we've<00:02:50.830> basically

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
seal 170 all right so we've basically

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.460 
seal 170 all right so we've basically
finished<00:02:52.060> up<00:02:52.180> our<00:02:52.300> assessment<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:53.080> on<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
finished up our assessment here on the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.180 
finished up our assessment here on the
CL<00:02:54.160> 175<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.410> looked<00:02:56.410> everything<00:02:56.860> over

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
CL 175 and looked everything over

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.650 
CL 175 and looked everything over
thoroughly<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.730> course<00:02:57.940> we've<00:02:58.120> got<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.540> back

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
thoroughly of course we've got it back

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.380 
thoroughly of course we've got it back
in<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:58.989> piece<00:02:59.230> again<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.880> we<00:03:00.880> really<00:03:01.150> didn't

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
in one piece again and we really didn't

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.180 
in one piece again and we really didn't
find<00:03:01.420> any<00:03:01.720> surprises<00:03:01.959> just<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.739> usual<00:03:02.890> that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
find any surprises just the usual that

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.949 
find any surprises just the usual that
we<00:03:03.250> expect<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.670> find<00:03:03.700> for<00:03:04.120> anything<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.720> this

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
we expect to find for anything of this

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.680 
we expect to find for anything of this
age<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.970> judging<00:03:06.970> from<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.300> initial

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
age and judging from the initial

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.320 
age and judging from the initial
assessment<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.410> initial<00:03:08.770> estimate<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:10.150> looks

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
assessment the initial estimate it looks

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.699 
assessment the initial estimate it looks
like<00:03:10.450> you're<00:03:10.570> gonna<00:03:10.660> have<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.900> very<00:03:11.140> nice<00:03:11.380> bike

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
like you're gonna have a very nice bike

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.550 
like you're gonna have a very nice bike
very<00:03:11.980> clean<00:03:12.340> very<00:03:12.370> writable<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.480> most<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.500> all

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
very clean very writable and most of all

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.470 
very clean very writable and most of all
very<00:03:14.830> reliable<00:03:15.370> bike<00:03:15.580> when<00:03:15.790> everything<00:03:16.150> said

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
very reliable bike when everything said

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.270 
very reliable bike when everything said
and<00:03:16.510> done<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.140> something<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.160> can

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
and done and something that you can

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.970 
and done and something that you can
enjoy<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.520> many<00:03:18.730> years<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.660> that's<00:03:20.650> part<00:03:20.950> of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
enjoy for many years so that's part of

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.620 
enjoy for many years so that's part of
the<00:03:21.040> process<00:03:21.250> that's<00:03:21.730> how<00:03:21.880> we<00:03:21.940> do<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.330> and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
the process that's how we do this and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.020 
the process that's how we do this and
you'll<00:03:22.870> get<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.230> see<00:03:23.440> more<00:03:24.010> as<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.489> move<00:03:24.880> along

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
you'll get to see more as we move along
