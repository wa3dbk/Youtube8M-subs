00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
could do it up high any easy cuz just

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.139 
could do it up high any easy cuz just
it's<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> same<00:01:00.859> eight<00:01:01.859> eight<00:01:02.370> eleven

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it's like the same eight eight eleven

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
it's like the same eight eight eleven
eight<00:01:03.690> eleven<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.559> practice<00:01:04.920> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
eight eleven so if you practice this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.469 
eight eleven so if you practice this
pattern<00:01:05.369> first<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.880> easier<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.360> these

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
pattern first it's easier to get these

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
pattern first it's easier to get these
notes<00:01:27.439> debating<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> last<00:01:28.829> part<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
notes debating with the last part is the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.840 
notes debating with the last part is the
tab<00:01:29.520> doesn't<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:31.850> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
tab doesn't have it right I think it's I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.350 
tab doesn't have it right I think it's I
think<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.630> eleven

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:48.420 

nine<00:01:37.840> eight<00:01:38.550> eleven<00:01:39.930> eight<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.100> go<00:01:48.280> last

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
nine eight eleven eight then I go last

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.250 
nine eight eleven eight then I go last
part<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.910> eleven<00:01:49.470> eleven<00:01:50.470> nine<00:01:50.920> eight

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
part is this eleven eleven nine eight

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.620 
part is this eleven eleven nine eight
eleven<00:01:53.260> ten<00:01:54.160> Hey

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
eleven ten Hey

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.330 
eleven ten Hey
so<00:01:56.260> you<00:01:56.320> could<00:01:56.410> play<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.710> intro<00:01:56.920> like<00:01:57.070> this<00:01:57.220> if

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so you could play the intro like this if

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:15.690 
so you could play the intro like this if
you<00:01:57.430> want<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.830> that's<00:02:14.920> one<00:02:15.160> way<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.340> could<00:02:15.520> do

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you want so that's one way you could do

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.040 
you want so that's one way you could do
it<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.270> don't<00:02:16.510> really<00:02:16.630> like<00:02:16.840> how<00:02:17.020> that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
it but I don't really like how that

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.229 
it but I don't really like how that
sounds<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.709> acoustic<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.880> if<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.120> was

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
sounds on acoustic so if I was

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.660 
sounds on acoustic so if I was
performing<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:19.959> or<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.130> want<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.400> do<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.520> for

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
performing this or you want to do it for

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.220 
performing this or you want to do it for
a<00:02:21.760> camp<00:02:22.000> sing-along<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.840> would<00:02:22.959> do<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.200> like

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
a camp sing-along I would do it like

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.020 
a camp sing-along I would do it like
down<00:02:23.500> here<00:02:23.530> I'll<00:02:24.010> hold<00:02:24.190> down

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.940 

so<00:02:28.540> basically<00:02:28.840> put<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> cape<00:02:29.380> on<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.620> first

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
so basically put the cape on the first

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.800 
so basically put the cape on the first

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.360 
fret if you want to play along I'll take
the<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.320> could<00:02:32.470> take<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.709> cable<00:02:33.010> off<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.310> do

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the you could take the cable off and do

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.420 
the you could take the cable off and do
the<00:02:33.459> same<00:02:33.610> thing<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.090> off<00:02:34.300> cable<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:36.220> go

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the same thing this is off cable to go

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:49.020 
the same thing this is off cable to go
zero<00:02:36.700> zero<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.280> D<00:02:39.430> string

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.089 

so<00:02:50.030> zero<00:02:50.510> four<00:02:51.290> two<00:02:51.860> zero<00:02:52.670> four<00:02:53.420> two<00:02:53.930> two<00:02:54.530> two

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
so zero four two zero four two two two

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:09.339 
so zero four two zero four two two two
two<00:02:55.129> four<00:02:55.879> four<00:02:56.269> three<00:02:56.470> two<00:03:08.080> now<00:03:09.080> would<00:03:09.230> you

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.850 

could<00:04:35.130> do<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> bar<00:04:35.550> chord<00:04:36.200> but<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.290> hate<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.620> bar

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
could do a bar chord but I hate this bar

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.490 
could do a bar chord but I hate this bar
chord<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.300> would<00:04:39.600> just<00:04:39.630> do<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:39.930> like<00:04:40.050> this<00:04:40.080> so

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
chord so I would just do it like this so

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.660 
chord so I would just do it like this so
much<00:04:40.650> because<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.920> don't<00:04:41.040> really<00:04:41.190> need<00:04:41.460> this

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
much because you don't really need this

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.340 
much because you don't really need this
it<00:04:41.910> just<00:04:42.060> happens<00:04:42.300> for<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.480> second<00:04:42.840> so<00:04:43.050> what<00:04:43.230> you

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
it just happens for a second so what you

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.830 
it just happens for a second so what you
do<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.620> you're<00:04:43.740> putting<00:04:43.860> into<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.250> major<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:45.690> do

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
do is you're putting into a major you do

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:56.200 
do is you're putting into a major you do
right<00:04:45.990> here

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.149 

so<00:04:57.210> should<00:04:57.389> be<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:58.169> whole<00:04:58.379> like<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:59.129> whole

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159
