00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.630
 motivational kick for riders on Mondays 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.360
 and rider my name is stephan hornung 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.259
 and I'm ready for horse training 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.740
 would 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.650
 and if this week I have you 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 brought technology as supported 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 stare 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.170
 a better sense of your own 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.289
 physical focus to prepare 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.960
 get and maybe know some 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.450
 of you only your body of focus 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.100
 maybe not even some 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.350
 he finds the physical focus 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.879
 away from people 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.059
 two down and so about here before the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.960
 cross simplifying the cross-most part of the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.780
 spinal column 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.239
 so if he has four times the spine 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.049
 street there was still going on there 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.329
 Feel where the spine is pretty much 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.760
 if he has the round from the round to the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.710
 hollow back goes back and forth that is the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.780
 lumbar spine and if you then 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.530
 going deeper is more like this 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 bisserl ne plate the cross are there 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.569
 several loosely grown together 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.909
 Dull wedge-shaped stable structure 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.929
 and there is the matter should the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.610
 connected 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:23.399
 So I am here at this position and 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.159
 drove this cross spa just behind 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:30.450
 below is as a physical 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.700
 focus to make it easier for you 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.190
 you can focus on the people 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.259
 also us lawyer can imagine 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.060
 about this size you can 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.189
 imagine you also smaller or size 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.649
 and this research of the ball is not 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.240
 to locate exactly where is the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.450
 focus and what does he do 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.250
 focus on making it easier for us 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.189
 He put a hand on the back of his hand 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.009
 or you can also make it from Kreuztal 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.229
 and the other hand is here with the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.979
 thumb in the navel and you like that 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.670
 down on then on the construction so then 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.829
 introduce yourself to a koubek and you 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.040
 are ball could roll 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.040
 in your imagination in which he respects 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.489
 So the ball wants to forward direction 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:32.590
 Schambach and so on and the ball after 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.500
 rear direction cross because if now 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.640
 also the drive would sit 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.590
 in thing you can imagine that 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.379
 this puzzle rolls in your basin 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.379
 has returned in parallel 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.840
 so now if a sword like this 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.330
 ball visualized without notes here 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.290
 sits most of the time so this 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.210
 ball he sits in the front direction pubis 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.830
 not a good idea 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.620
 with it sits the hollow cross and he brings 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.990
 the horse to the plan then would 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.310
 I recommend that the tank after 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.730
 see bottom back 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.760
 or put differently before the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.160
 pubis with it but visualized 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.470
 kugler body center again after 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.090
 behind rolls in front of the behind 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.950
 hand in front of the sacrum and if he does 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.980
 it will be a little more practiced 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.500
 that in most motion sequences 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.760
 as a legal laundry trot and gallop rides 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.160
 or since the gears 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.250
 when he realizes yes yes they are google 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.320
 is relatively stable and quiet 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.280
 this rear hand as they before 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.950
 cloister 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.560
 that's a very good sign then since then 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.239
 that should be very concentrated 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.510
 Riding always be like this 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.810
 this emphasis is deep down in the basin 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.850
 that brings you the deep seat and 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.280
 the supported horse more from behind 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.680
 to come and it supports the horse 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.150
 Being centered yourself and yourself 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.930
 alley on the band ok a lot of fun there and 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.930
 Until next time
