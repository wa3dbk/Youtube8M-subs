00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.729
 and well- versed guys and well then 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.720
 we are here in a new stage fright 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:11.990
 since the last one had enough for not 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.460
 say a lot of success and good for you 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.530
 I wanted to comment that below you have the 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.570
 new twitter that I have in the next 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.119
 video I will explain why changed from 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.240
 twitter and all this and well let's go 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.099
 with the following story titled the 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.099
 clown in the rocking chair 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.750
 Lucy woke up with the sound of a 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.300
 phone call when it stopped ringing 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.050
 she had not yet reached for it 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.180
 in the call log noted that 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.940
 were his grandparents so he went back to 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.760
 dial the number immediately but 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.400
 this time there was probably no answer 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.269
 the grandparents would have gone quickly or 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.850
 they just would not have heard it 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.600
 Lucy spent the normal morning did some 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.399
 shopping and came home when he came saw 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.449
 that there was another missed call from their 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.880
 grandparents 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.509
 this time there was a message or mailbox 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.600
 voice began to listen to him and in him 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.350
 there were knocks and footsteps we recorded off 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.220
 of his grandfather saying 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.890
 the clown 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.620
 that was the last thing he heard before a 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.860
 strong blow and that the message was cut 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.170
 with a sigh off lucy released the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.020
 phone and ran everything he could towards 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.570
 the car to go to his grandparents' house 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.240
 when he arrived there were three cars 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.290
 police and an ambulance surrounding the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.750
 house was paralyzed from house two 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.810
 guards took out a body with a 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.360
 sheet that dripped a trail of blood 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.000
 another policeman took his grandmother out 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.810
 was hysterical light and asked the 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.510
 guards and her grandmother what happened she 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.150
 He said there was someone in the house already 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.729
 they had killed their grandfather they took the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.940
 grandmother to the hospital since she had some 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.000
 bumps and a few bruises 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.880
 Lucy after a few weeks decided that her 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.760
 grandmother stayed to live with her that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.180
 I would sell that house but for that I had 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.310
 to paint it and reform some things 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.430
 for it he had to stay to sleep there 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.159
 which I did not have very sure 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.040
 I think that the one who entered the house would be 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.219
 a lunatic or a thief and probably 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.939
 he would have left the area that 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.609
 same afternoon 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.849
 Lucy prepared everything to leave a few weeks 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:43.879
 there a part of the house was surrounded 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.400
 of yellow police tapes that 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.349
 it was the first thing that was dedicated to remove the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.780
 finish pulling the last strip that 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.030
 it was hanging from a light tree and it 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.180
 He went to the door and took one last 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.370
 breath before opening it inside the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.620
 house the dust was rising by the 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.989
 current of air and the silence that 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.720
 had allowed the minimum movement to flee 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.569
 The blood that covered 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.639
 the second floor was a horror for 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.629
 she clean the blood of her own 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:16.879
 grandfather at that time I am a blow to the 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.080
 end of the aisle in one of the 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.110
 bedrooms 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.720
 Lucy was slowly approaching the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.480
 door with the fear that there 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.420
 someone inside 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.790
 he was slowly opening up to 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.700
 collided with the wall the room 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.970
 gave off very cold because 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.650
 the window was wide open 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.019
 but that was the minimum of the problems 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.620
 the room was full of little ones 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.110
 porcelain clowns that adorned her 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.920
 terrifyingly 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.110
 and at the same time it seemed very chilling in 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.040
 one of the corners on top of one 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.560
 rocking a clown of almost two meters 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.960
 leaning on it had a very smile 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.380
 unpleasant a white skin of 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.320
 porcelain red hair blood and 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.240
 black eyes like coal was the 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.300
 most scary doll of all the 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.049
 I did not want to be there like that 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.239
 who closed the window and left the room 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.459
 it was almost dinner time so 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.400
 lucy prepare before the room in the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.400
 I was going to sleep 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.580
 while he dined , footsteps were heard in the 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.900
 upstairs she was very scared 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.390
 I did not know what to do uploading check if 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.370
 there was someone 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.750
 or stay down and wait for them to stop 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.870
 the noises 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.110
 In the end I decided to go up to the floor 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.850
 up when climbing the last rung of the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.870
 staircase observed that the door in the 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.790
 clowns room was open 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.729
 giving to see the clown that was over 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.189
 of the rocking chair 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.580
 was when he was approaching little by little 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:11.569
 to go to close the door but before 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.980
 reach the bottom of the corridor sounded a 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:17.880
 Phone call 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.790
 on the scoreboard was his grandmother 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.010
 when he picked up they were talking 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.000
 quietly saying that he had heard 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:30.570
 something that if everything was fine 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.750
 Lucy told him that they gave him a little 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.990
 fear of clowns over all that 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:41.220
 big that looked like a person was 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.130
 then when the grandmother told her that 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.280
 I did not have any big clown that just 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.740
 I had some little clowns decorating the 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.990
 room because he liked to attract them 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.290
 of the circus when I was going to see them with their 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.290
 husband 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.270
 then it was when lucy looked towards the 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:05.199
 door at the end of the room and saw 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.150
 that the clown was not on top of the 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.720
 rocking chair 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.660
 at that moment light and the phone jumped and 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.440
 very scared cut the call to 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.610
 want to run out the phone rang 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.249
 again but this time the call 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.680
 came from inside the house 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:29.360
 when I asked who was 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.520
 I 'm just a phrase 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:38.020
 a sigh that said where is the 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.030
 clown lucy under the stairs running 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.430
 but the door was closed 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.759
 windows were sealed as if 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:50.390
 someone will jump sealed before 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:52.280
 let light and enter that house 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.500
 he was running again to the room 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.930
 above realizing that one of 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.930
 the windows could be opened 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:05.250
 but when you get to the bottom of the aisle 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.400
 laughter as a small child was heard behind 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.070
 her 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.889
 at that moment he turned around and saw 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:15.190
 that the clown was with a knife at 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:17.979
 At the end of the hallway she picked up and closed the 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.470
 door quickly using the rocking chair 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:25.750
 so that the clown could not enter 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:28.000
 the room but she thought not 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.910
 I would have enough strength to burst 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.060
 the door was then when the clown 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.630
 of a single investiture managed to open the 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.520
 door and before light opened the 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.880
 window to leave 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.680
 clown hair he caught saying one 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.780
 last sentence 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.780
 you do not like clowns
