safety<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.390> their<00:01:27.869> children<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.700> think<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
safety and their children I think it's a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
safety and their children I think it's a
great<00:01:30.119> idea<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:31.049> out<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.590> every<00:01:32.130> morning

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
with the kids and you see the cars they
don't<00:01:35.970> stop<00:01:36.360> they're<00:01:36.810> supposed<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> stop<00:01:37.409> both

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
