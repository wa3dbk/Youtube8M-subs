thought I'd do a five in one player
review<00:00:39.780> because<00:00:40.020> there'll<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.620> other<00:00:40.890> players

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
review because there'll be other players

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
review because there'll be other players
that<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.520> really<00:00:42.239> want<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.629> review<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.530> Tory

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that I really want to review like Tory

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
that I really want to review like Tory
for<00:00:44.249> example<00:00:44.699> that'll<00:00:44.999> be<00:00:45.120> by<00:00:45.329> themselves<00:00:45.539> but

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
for example that'll be by themselves but

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.110 
for example that'll be by themselves but
these<00:00:46.320> ones<00:00:46.620> or<00:00:46.829> ones<00:00:47.339> that<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.999> know

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
these ones or ones that you know

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.729 
these ones or ones that you know
wouldn't<00:00:48.510> usually<00:00:48.839> be<00:00:49.170> reviewed<00:00:49.530> by

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
wouldn't usually be reviewed by

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
wouldn't usually be reviewed by
themselves<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.489> thought<00:00:50.670> why<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:50.909> do<00:00:51.179> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
themselves so I thought why not do a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.739 
themselves so I thought why not do a
jumble<00:00:51.989> 15<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.100> 1<00:00:53.249> again<00:00:53.730> since<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.329> few<00:00:54.359> people

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
jumble 15 and 1 again since a few people

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.149 
jumble 15 and 1 again since a few people
did<00:00:54.929> say<00:00:55.109> they<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.469> these<00:00:55.679> type<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.979> things

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
did say they like these type of things

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.639 
did say they like these type of things
so<00:00:56.940> yeah<00:00:57.329> these<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> five<00:00:57.989> opted<00:00:58.499> to<00:00:58.620> go

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
