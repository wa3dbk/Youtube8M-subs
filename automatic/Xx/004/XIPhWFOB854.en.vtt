to do with Kingdom Hearts key per se but

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.349 
to do with Kingdom Hearts key per se but

key Kingdom Hearts fragmented keys it's

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.280 
key Kingdom Hearts fragmented keys it's
really<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.720> stretch<00:03:58.079> but<00:03:58.440> maybe<00:03:59.190> um<00:04:00.290> someone

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
really a stretch but maybe um someone

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.190 
really a stretch but maybe um someone
contracted<00:04:02.220> someone<00:04:02.670> else<00:04:02.880> or<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.690> American

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
contracted someone else or the American

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.580 
contracted someone else or the American
studio<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.709> do<00:04:05.069> a<00:04:05.510> kingdom<00:04:06.510> hearts<00:04:06.840> key<00:04:07.139> port

studio to do a kingdom hearts key port

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.569 
studio to do a kingdom hearts key port
now<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.829> only<00:04:08.040> thing<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.430> would<00:04:08.519> really

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
now the only thing that would really

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.879 
now the only thing that would really
discredit<00:04:09.359> this<00:04:09.540> little<00:04:09.870> thought<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.859> is

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
discredit this little thought I have is

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.339 
discredit this little thought I have is
obviously<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.880> concept<00:04:12.540> art<00:04:12.690> for<00:04:12.750> fragmented

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
obviously the concept art for fragmented

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.659 
obviously the concept art for fragmented
keys<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.769> looks<00:04:13.980> completely<00:04:14.400> different

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
keys this looks completely different

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:15.920 
keys this looks completely different
they<00:04:14.880> don't<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.090> any<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.480> same<00:04:15.660> worlds

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
they don't have any of the same worlds

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.719 
they don't have any of the same worlds
as<00:04:15.989> Kingdom<00:04:16.289> Hearts<00:04:16.349> key<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:17.130> art<00:04:17.280> style<00:04:17.519> is

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
as Kingdom Hearts key the art style is

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.520 
as Kingdom Hearts key the art style is
completely<00:04:18.180> different<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:18.840> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
completely different but the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.930 
completely different but the
similarities<00:04:20.130> are<00:04:20.159> you<00:04:20.459> create<00:04:20.760> your<00:04:20.880> own

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
similarities are you create your own

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.680 
similarities are you create your own
character<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.690> both<00:04:21.870> have<00:04:22.079> key<00:04:22.289> in

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
character and both have key in

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.560 
character and both have key in
now<00:04:23.530> on<00:04:23.890> what<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.460> think<00:04:24.850> is<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.060> Kingdom

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
now on what I think is that Kingdom

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.000 
now on what I think is that Kingdom
Hearts<00:04:25.660> fragmented<00:04:26.260> keys<00:04:26.470> which<00:04:26.680> was<00:04:26.860> in

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
Hearts fragmented keys which was in

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.090 
Hearts fragmented keys which was in
development<00:04:27.130> over<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> year<00:04:28.180> ago<00:04:29.100> was

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
development over a year ago was

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.610 
development over a year ago was
cancelled<00:04:30.640> maybe<00:04:31.150> because<00:04:31.390> their<00:04:31.870> plant<00:04:32.380> they

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
cancelled maybe because their plant they

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.680 
cancelled maybe because their plant they
were<00:04:32.740> already<00:04:32.980> planning<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:34.030> bring<00:04:34.210> Kingdom

random things not really a story or

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.630 
random things not really a story or
maybe<00:05:01.120> community<00:05:01.750> based<00:05:01.990> game<00:05:02.370> which<00:05:03.370> Kingdom

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
maybe community based game which Kingdom

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.580 
maybe community based game which Kingdom
Hearts<00:05:03.820> key<00:05:04.120> looks<00:05:04.390> to<00:05:04.510> be<00:05:04.720> at<00:05:04.840> least<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.260> me<00:05:05.380> or

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
Hearts key looks to be at least to me or

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.250 
Hearts key looks to be at least to me or
more<00:05:05.950> of<00:05:05.980> like<00:05:06.160> a<00:05:06.450> adventure<00:05:07.450> I<00:05:07.780> mean<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.140> know

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
more of like a adventure I mean I know

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.350 
more of like a adventure I mean I know
the<00:05:08.500> sonic<00:05:08.860> runners<00:05:09.460> has<00:05:09.670> sort<00:05:09.940> of<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.090> story

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
the sonic runners has sort of a story

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.600 
the sonic runners has sort of a story
but<00:05:10.660> that's<00:05:10.890> besides<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.010> point<00:05:12.100> so<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.460> think

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
but that's besides the point so I think

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.730 
but that's besides the point so I think
Kingdom<00:05:13.150> Hearts<00:05:13.270> fragmented<00:05:13.990> keys<00:05:14.200> maybe<00:05:14.500> was

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
Kingdom Hearts fragmented keys maybe was

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.070 
Kingdom Hearts fragmented keys maybe was
cancelled<00:05:15.280> in<00:05:15.430> order<00:05:15.910> for<00:05:16.510> this<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:16.900> get

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
cancelled in order for this to get

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.930 
cancelled in order for this to get
localized<00:05:17.560> so<00:05:17.830> that's<00:05:18.010> another<00:05:18.400> good<00:05:18.670> sign

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
localized so that's another good sign

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.570 
localized so that's another good sign
but<00:05:19.720> I<00:05:19.900> gotta<00:05:20.140> say<00:05:20.200> in<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.740> end<00:05:20.860> we<00:05:21.250> will<00:05:21.370> only

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
but I gotta say in the end we will only

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.190 
but I gotta say in the end we will only
find<00:05:21.850> out<00:05:22.000> if<00:05:22.150> this<00:05:22.240> is<00:05:22.300> coming<00:05:22.720> worldwide

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
find out if this is coming worldwide

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.550 
find out if this is coming worldwide
