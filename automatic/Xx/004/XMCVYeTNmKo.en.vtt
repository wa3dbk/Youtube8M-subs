hey<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.810> in<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.050> video<00:00:01.260> I'm<00:00:01.500> going<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.680> show

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
hey guys in this video I'm going to show

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.590 
hey guys in this video I'm going to show
you<00:00:01.920> everything<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:02.730> need<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:02.939> know<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.270> start

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
you everything you need to know to start

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.720 
you everything you need to know to start
taking<00:00:03.810> creative<00:00:04.230> longexposure<00:00:04.890> images

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
taking creative longexposure images

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.099 
taking creative longexposure images
we're<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.060> break<00:00:06.240> it<00:00:06.390> down<00:00:06.480> into<00:00:06.750> simple

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
we're going to break it down into simple

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.480 
we're going to break it down into simple
steps<00:00:07.350> run<00:00:07.589> through<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.799> bunch<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.189> different

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
steps run through a bunch of different

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.430 
steps run through a bunch of different
situations<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.240> show<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.809> how<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.080> make<00:00:10.139> some

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
situations and show you how to make some

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.200 
situations and show you how to make some
really<00:00:10.740> cool<00:00:10.980> effects<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.550> basic<00:00:11.940> equipment

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.519 

now<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> long<00:00:18.480> exposure<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.080> basically

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
now a long exposure is basically

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.900 
now a long exposure is basically
anything<00:00:19.830> where<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> shutter<00:00:20.430> stays<00:00:20.699> open

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
anything where the shutter stays open

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.330 
anything where the shutter stays open
longer<00:00:21.270> than<00:00:21.509> say<00:00:21.689> half<00:00:22.110> a<00:00:22.289> second<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> means

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
longer than say half a second it means

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.670 
longer than say half a second it means
that<00:00:23.520> you<00:00:23.610> need<00:00:23.759> a<00:00:23.789> tripod<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:25.259> you're

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
that you need a tripod because as you're

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.890 
that you need a tripod because as you're
leaving<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.460> shutter<00:00:26.699> open<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.449> image<00:00:27.660> is

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
leaving the shutter open the image is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.259 
leaving the shutter open the image is
building<00:00:28.410> up<00:00:28.560> over<00:00:28.739> time<00:00:29.189> depending<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:30.000> how

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
building up over time depending on how

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.030 
building up over time depending on how
long<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.779> leave<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> shutter<00:00:31.349> open<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.920> how

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
long you leave the shutter open and how

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.220 
long you leave the shutter open and how
fast<00:00:32.279> things<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.730> moving<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.839> blow

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
fast things are moving you can blow

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.259 
fast things are moving you can blow
things<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:35.940> make<00:00:36.120> them

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
things out a little a lot or make them

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.960 
things out a little a lot or make them
totally<00:00:36.750> disappear<00:00:37.290> okay<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.519> little<00:00:38.580> bit

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
totally disappear okay now a little bit

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.460 
totally disappear okay now a little bit
of<00:00:39.059> theory<00:00:39.330> there's<00:00:39.660> three<00:00:39.930> things<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.290> need

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
of theory there's three things you need

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.770 
of theory there's three things you need
to<00:00:40.500> think<00:00:40.620> about<00:00:40.949> to<00:00:41.610> let<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.970> know<00:00:42.150> how<00:00:42.540> much

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
to think about to let you know how much

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
to think about to let you know how much
time<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> need<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.769> leaving<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> shutter

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
time you need to be leaving the shutter

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.220 
time you need to be leaving the shutter
opening<00:00:44.909> your<00:00:45.030> long<00:00:45.239> exposure<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.960> get<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
opening your long exposure to get the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
opening your long exposure to get the
results<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:47.879> is

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
results you want first of all is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
results you want first of all is
consider<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> overall<00:00:49.170> light<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.100> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
consider the overall light now this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.860 
consider the overall light now this
comes<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.850> expose<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.600> check<00:00:51.750> out

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
comes down to expose you can check out

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.389 
comes down to expose you can check out
the<00:00:51.989> link<00:00:52.170> I've<00:00:52.289> done<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.649> using<00:00:53.219> manual

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the link I've done on using manual

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.220 
the link I've done on using manual
settings<00:00:53.879> below<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.719> we're<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
settings below but we're not going to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
settings below but we're not going to
need<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.410> use<00:00:55.530> manual<00:00:55.859> in<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.280> video<00:00:56.460> just

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
need to use manual in this video just

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.759 
need to use manual in this video just
think<00:00:57.390> about<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:58.230> we're<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> leave

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
think about that if we're going to leave

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.380 
think about that if we're going to leave
the<00:00:58.890> shutter<00:00:59.100> open<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> long<00:00:59.640> time<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.120> lots

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the shutter open a long time that's lots

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.910 
the shutter open a long time that's lots
of<00:01:00.539> light<00:01:00.750> coming<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.530> need<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> be

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
of light coming in so we need to be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
of light coming in so we need to be
careful<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.340> how<00:01:02.670> much<00:01:02.850> daylight<00:01:03.420> or<00:01:03.750> ambient

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
careful of how much daylight or ambient

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
careful of how much daylight or ambient
light<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> pitcher<00:01:06.179> you<00:01:06.270> were

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
light is there what a pitcher you were

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.020 
light is there what a pitcher you were
using<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:06.960> what's<00:01:07.170> our<00:01:07.380> ISO<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.190> we<00:01:08.700> may<00:01:08.850> need

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
using and what's our ISO and we may need

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.180 
using and what's our ISO and we may need
to<00:01:09.179> restrict<00:01:09.539> those<00:01:09.810> either<00:01:10.140> using<00:01:10.679> camera

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
to restrict those either using camera

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.499 
to restrict those either using camera
settings<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.670> putting<00:01:11.910> a<00:01:12.030> neutral<00:01:12.420> density

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
settings or putting a neutral density

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.749 
settings or putting a neutral density
filter<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.289> so<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> get<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.550> shutter

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
filter on so that we can get the shutter

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.940 
filter on so that we can get the shutter
speed<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.179> we<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.050> next<00:01:16.320> thing<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.590> how

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
speed that we want the next thing is how

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.130 
speed that we want the next thing is how
much<00:01:17.130> blood<00:01:17.429> do<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.149> in<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.360> shot<00:01:18.720> do

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
much blood do you want in your shot do

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
much blood do you want in your shot do
you<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.440> it<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.649> just<00:01:19.679> be<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.280> bit

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you want it to just be a little bit

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
you want it to just be a little bit
blurred<00:01:20.819> out<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.179> extremely<00:01:22.050> blurred<00:01:22.440> out<00:01:22.619> or

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
blurred out or extremely blurred out or

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
blurred out or extremely blurred out or
to<00:01:23.160> just<00:01:23.369> totally<00:01:23.789> disappear<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.599> then<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
to just totally disappear and then the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.589 
to just totally disappear and then the
last<00:01:25.470> thing<00:01:25.649> is<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:26.369> fast<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.970> your<00:01:27.000> subject

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:27.599 
last thing is how fast is your subject

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.020 
last thing is how fast is your subject
moving<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.140> you're<00:01:28.679> shooting<00:01:29.160> a<00:01:29.310> Formula<00:01:30.000> One

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
moving if you're shooting a Formula One

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.199 
moving if you're shooting a Formula One
car<00:01:30.209> at<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:31.520> hundredth<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> second<00:01:33.060> it's

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
car at one hundredth of a second it's

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.180 
car at one hundredth of a second it's
still<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.690> be<00:01:33.750> terribly<00:01:34.289> blurred<00:01:34.619> but

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
still going to be terribly blurred but

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.699 
still going to be terribly blurred but
you<00:01:35.550> know<00:01:35.670> someone<00:01:36.239> walking<00:01:36.569> you<00:01:37.200> may<00:01:37.380> need<00:01:37.530> to

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
you know someone walking you may need to

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.410 
you know someone walking you may need to
drop<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.039> down<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.729> fifteenth<00:01:39.179> of<00:01:39.330> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
drop it down to like one fifteenth of a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.389 
drop it down to like one fifteenth of a
second<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.899> really<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.349> much<00:01:40.530> blur<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.130> on

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
second to really get much blur going on

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.910 
second to really get much blur going on
same<00:01:41.910> with<00:01:42.119> water<00:01:42.479> same<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:43.110> clouds<00:01:43.470> same

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
same with water same with clouds same

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.639 
same with water same with clouds same
with<00:01:44.099> anything<00:01:44.550> moving<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.239> it's<00:01:45.840> moving<00:01:46.050> slow

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
with anything moving if it's moving slow

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.499 
with anything moving if it's moving slow
then<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.369> need<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.789> a<00:01:47.819> longer<00:01:48.179> shutter

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
then you need to have a longer shutter

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.120 
then you need to have a longer shutter
speed<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.929> get<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.349> blue<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.800> it's<00:01:49.950> moving

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
speed to get the blue if it's moving

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.490 
speed to get the blue if it's moving
quick<00:01:50.640> they're<00:01:51.239> not<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.869> long<00:01:52.050> of<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> shutter

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
quick they're not so long of a shutter

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.960 
quick they're not so long of a shutter
speed<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.099> still<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.550> to<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
speed and you're still going to get the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.180 
speed and you're still going to get the
blurred<00:01:54.360> effect<00:01:54.539> okay<00:01:55.500> does<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.160> sense

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
blurred effect okay does that make sense

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.160 
blurred effect okay does that make sense
so<00:01:56.819> let's<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.179> off<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.569> do<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.750> couple<00:01:58.080> of

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
so let's go off and do a couple of

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.300 
so let's go off and do a couple of
different<00:01:58.440> tests<00:01:58.739> now<00:01:58.890> we're<00:01:59.160> will

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
different tests now we're will

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.949 
different tests now we're will
demonstrate<00:01:59.670> all<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.239> this<00:02:00.360> I'll<00:02:00.539> give<00:02:00.869> you

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
demonstrate all of this I'll give you

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.630 
demonstrate all of this I'll give you
all<00:02:00.989> the<00:02:01.289> settings<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:02.069> can<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.489> out

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
all the settings so that you can go out

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.580 
all the settings so that you can go out
and<00:02:02.670> try<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.209> yourself

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.350 

to<00:02:06.590> kick<00:02:06.770> things<00:02:06.799> off<00:02:07.189> I<00:02:07.400> headed<00:02:07.670> out<00:02:07.909> into<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
to kick things off I headed out into the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.120 
to kick things off I headed out into the
rain<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.959> get<00:02:09.080> some<00:02:09.380> cars<00:02:09.709> headlights

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
rain to get some cars headlights

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.650 
rain to get some cars headlights
streaking<00:02:10.880> now<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.030> tricky<00:02:11.360> thing<00:02:11.569> about

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
streaking now the tricky thing about

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.510 
streaking now the tricky thing about
cars<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.290> they<00:02:12.440> actually<00:02:12.590> move<00:02:13.040> all<00:02:13.340> at

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
cars is they actually move all at

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.190 
cars is they actually move all at
different<00:02:13.670> speeds<00:02:14.180> especially<00:02:14.810> if<00:02:14.870> you're<00:02:15.080> at

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
different speeds especially if you're at

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.110 
different speeds especially if you're at
an<00:02:15.319> intersection<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.880> it's<00:02:17.000> all

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
an intersection like this so it's all

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.640 
an intersection like this so it's all
about<00:02:17.300> finding<00:02:17.600> lines<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.380> are<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.590> to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
about finding lines that are going to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.100 
about finding lines that are going to
give<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:18.950> nice<00:02:19.160> light<00:02:19.610> trails<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.540> here's<00:02:20.900> two

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
give you nice light trails so here's two

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.140 
give you nice light trails so here's two
shots<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.739> took<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:22.790> know<00:02:22.910> with<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
shots that I took you know with a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.750 
shots that I took you know with a
straight<00:02:23.660> line<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:25.010> course<00:02:25.280> getting<00:02:25.550> in

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
straight line but of course getting in

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.940 
straight line but of course getting in
being<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.540> an<00:02:26.660> intersection<00:02:26.959> being<00:02:27.650> able<00:02:27.860> to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
being at an intersection being able to

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.710 
being at an intersection being able to
get<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.310> angle<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.150> turning<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.600> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
get the angle and the turning of the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.570 
get the angle and the turning of the
cars<00:02:29.930> works<00:02:30.230> really<00:02:30.440> well<00:02:30.560> too<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.010> here's<00:02:31.520> a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
cars works really well too so here's a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.720 
cars works really well too so here's a
few<00:02:31.819> different<00:02:32.209> shots<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.459> see<00:02:34.610> it's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
few different shots and you can see it's

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.490 
few different shots and you can see it's
really<00:02:34.940> interesting<00:02:35.239> with<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.110> they<00:02:36.319> have

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
really interesting with it they have

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.009 
really interesting with it they have
flashing<00:02:37.010> lights<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.580> or<00:02:38.090> bright<00:02:38.750> headlights

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
flashing lights on or bright headlights

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.170 
flashing lights on or bright headlights
or<00:02:39.590> taillights<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.430> different<00:02:40.760> effects<00:02:41.030> that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
or taillights the different effects that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.110 
or taillights the different effects that
it<00:02:41.269> can<00:02:41.569> create<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.700> then<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:43.880> you're

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
it can create and then if you're

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.780 
it can create and then if you're
standing<00:02:44.870> still<00:02:45.050> enough<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:46.130> can<00:02:46.430> get

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
standing still enough you can get

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.570 
standing still enough you can get
yourself<00:02:46.970> in<00:02:47.390> there<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:48.100> wasn't<00:02:49.100> very<00:02:49.250> good<00:02:49.400> at

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
yourself in there I wasn't very good at

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.460 
yourself in there I wasn't very good at
it<00:02:49.850> but<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.209> guy<00:02:50.390> was<00:02:50.420> walking<00:02:50.780> past<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.380> was

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
it but this guy was walking past and was

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.380 
it but this guy was walking past and was
happy<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.890> oblige<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.610> one<00:02:52.819> had<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> shorter

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
happy to oblige that one had a shorter

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.210 
happy to oblige that one had a shorter
exposure<00:02:53.480> home<00:02:54.170> worked<00:02:54.410> out<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.590> lot<00:02:54.830> better

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.830 

now<00:02:58.220> I'm<00:02:58.519> sure<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:58.880> not<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.090> only<00:02:59.180> one<00:02:59.420> who

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
now I'm sure I'm not the only one who

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.809 
now I'm sure I'm not the only one who
hates<00:03:00.170> shopping<00:03:00.620> centers<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.489> all<00:03:01.640> the

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
hates shopping centers and all the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.520 
hates shopping centers and all the
crowds<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.420> people<00:03:02.630> especially<00:03:03.200> around

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
crowds of people especially around

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.340 
crowds of people especially around
holiday<00:03:04.130> times<00:03:04.459> but<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.720> make<00:03:06.140> them

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
holiday times but you can make them

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.710 
holiday times but you can make them
disappear<00:03:06.500> with<00:03:07.040> your<00:03:07.250> digital<00:03:07.580> SLR<00:03:08.150> just<00:03:08.510> put

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
disappear with your digital SLR just put

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.750 
disappear with your digital SLR just put
it<00:03:08.840> into<00:03:09.200> shutter<00:03:09.650> speed<00:03:09.950> priority<00:03:10.489> which<00:03:10.610> is

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
it into shutter speed priority which is

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.400 
it into shutter speed priority which is
what<00:03:10.940> we're<00:03:11.090> doing<00:03:11.120> in<00:03:11.450> all<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.870> these<00:03:12.049> shots

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
what we're doing in all of these shots

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.520 
what we're doing in all of these shots
and<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:13.340> time<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.030> down<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.450> like<00:03:14.630> 30<00:03:14.989> seconds

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
and then time it down to like 30 seconds

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.350 
and then time it down to like 30 seconds
it'll<00:03:15.709> give<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.100> really<00:03:16.459> small<00:03:16.820> aperture

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
it'll give you a really small aperture

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.270 
it'll give you a really small aperture
in<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.570> case<00:03:17.780> i<00:03:17.959> also<00:03:18.170> used<00:03:18.560> filters<00:03:19.070> and

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
in this case i also used filters and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.640 
in this case i also used filters and
then<00:03:19.880> there<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.299> go<00:03:20.329> you<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.140> make<00:03:21.290> everyone

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
then there you go you can make everyone

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.500 
then there you go you can make everyone
disappear<00:03:22.130> if<00:03:22.250> only<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:22.609> was<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.760> easy<00:03:22.910> in

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
disappear if only it was that easy in

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.680 
disappear if only it was that easy in

on<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.440> water<00:03:34.000> ok<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.329> first<00:03:35.660> set<00:03:35.989> up<00:03:36.109> I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
on the water ok for this first set up I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.259 
on the water ok for this first set up I
wanted<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.769> show<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.310> know<00:03:37.700> reasonably

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
wanted to show you you know reasonably

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.420 
wanted to show you you know reasonably
fast<00:03:38.510> moving<00:03:38.840> water<00:03:39.019> but<00:03:39.500> from<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.799> distance<00:03:40.010> so

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
fast moving water but from a distance so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.319 
fast moving water but from a distance so
this<00:03:40.640> one<00:03:40.850> was<00:03:41.359> half<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.959> second<00:03:42.380> at<00:03:42.500> f/16<00:03:43.329> next

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
this one was half a second at f/16 next

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.090 
this one was half a second at f/16 next
one<00:03:44.480> that's<00:03:44.690> one<00:03:44.959> second<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.680> can<00:03:45.799> see<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.070> has

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
one that's one second you can see it has

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.490 
one that's one second you can see it has
smoothed<00:03:46.579> out<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.760> little<00:03:47.060> bit<00:03:47.269> there<00:03:47.540> then<00:03:48.350> I

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
smoothed out a little bit there then I

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.410 
smoothed out a little bit there then I
put<00:03:48.739> filters<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:49.609> now<00:03:49.760> we're<00:03:49.970> at<00:03:50.060> three

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
put filters on so now we're at three

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.360 
put filters on so now we're at three
seconds<00:03:52.180> ten<00:03:53.180> seconds<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.950> can<00:03:55.100> see<00:03:55.280> it's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
seconds ten seconds you can see it's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.610 
seconds ten seconds you can see it's
really<00:03:55.519> smoothing<00:03:56.060> out<00:03:56.150> there<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.690> now<00:03:57.380> we're

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
really smoothing out there and now we're

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.490 
really smoothing out there and now we're
at<00:03:57.739> 20<00:03:58.160> seconds<00:03:58.790> using<00:03:59.150> lots<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.690> ND<00:04:00.019> filters

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
at 20 seconds using lots of ND filters

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.460 
at 20 seconds using lots of ND filters
at<00:04:00.709> f<00:04:00.920> 20<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.090> waters<00:04:02.480> really<00:04:02.870> nice<00:04:03.200> and

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
at f 20 and the waters really nice and

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.819 
at f 20 and the waters really nice and
smooth<00:04:04.480> next<00:04:05.480> up<00:04:05.600> I<00:04:05.750> move<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.109> this<00:04:06.200> area<00:04:06.470> where

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
smooth next up I move to this area where

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.680 
smooth next up I move to this area where
the<00:04:06.950> water<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.220> moving<00:04:07.370> reasonably<00:04:08.150> slow<00:04:08.450> but

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
the water is moving reasonably slow but

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.870 
the water is moving reasonably slow but
it's<00:04:08.810> also<00:04:08.989> beautifully<00:04:09.799> consistent<00:04:10.700> and

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
it's also beautifully consistent and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.090 
it's also beautifully consistent and
smooth<00:04:11.359> so<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:11.959> can<00:04:12.200> create<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.530> really<00:04:12.949> nice

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
smooth so you can create a really nice

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.090 
smooth so you can create a really nice
effect<00:04:13.609> there<00:04:13.900> this<00:04:14.900> first<00:04:15.199> one<00:04:15.380> using<00:04:15.769> a<00:04:15.859> load

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
effect there this first one using a load

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.849 
effect there this first one using a load

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
of ND filters is shot at 20 seconds

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.259 
of ND filters is shot at 20 seconds
you<00:04:18.889> can<00:04:19.009> see<00:04:19.219> the<00:04:19.370> waters<00:04:19.789> fairly

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
you can see the waters fairly

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.969 
you can see the waters fairly
transparent<00:04:20.719> that<00:04:21.169> you<00:04:21.259> can<00:04:21.439> almost<00:04:21.620> see<00:04:21.949> the

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
transparent that you can almost see the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.369 
transparent that you can almost see the
rocks<00:04:22.250> underneath<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.030> this<00:04:23.180> next<00:04:23.479> one<00:04:23.629> at<00:04:23.840> 30

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:24.379 
rocks underneath and this next one at 30

rocks underneath and this next one at 30
seconds<00:04:25.069> at<00:04:25.219> f11<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.599> really<00:04:26.960> can<00:04:27.139> start<00:04:27.469> to

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
seconds at f11 you really can start to

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.179 
seconds at f11 you really can start to
see<00:04:27.680> through<00:04:28.069> it<00:04:28.099> quite<00:04:28.460> nicely<00:04:29.860> next<00:04:30.860> up<00:04:31.009> I

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189 
see through it quite nicely next up I

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.249 
see through it quite nicely next up I
elegantly<00:04:31.789> climbed<00:04:32.210> over<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.659> rocks<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:33.110> get

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
elegantly climbed over the rocks to get

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.869 
elegantly climbed over the rocks to get
to<00:04:33.409> another<00:04:33.650> location<00:04:33.919> where<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.550> water<00:04:34.759> was

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
to another location where the water was

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.600 
to another location where the water was
a<00:04:35.060> lot<00:04:35.569> rougher<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.620> get<00:04:36.800> these<00:04:36.979> next<00:04:37.400> shots

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
a lot rougher to get these next shots

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.179 
a lot rougher to get these next shots
for<00:04:37.909> you<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.930> one<00:04:39.139> was<00:04:39.379> a<00:04:39.409> 10<00:04:39.740> second

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189 
for you this one was a 10 second

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.730 
for you this one was a 10 second
exposure<00:04:40.669> at<00:04:41.090> f/8<00:04:41.719> and<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.139> water<00:04:42.379> looks

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
exposure at f/8 and the water looks

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.550 
exposure at f/8 and the water looks
really<00:04:43.310> milking<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.969> then<00:04:44.629> he<00:04:44.900> had<00:04:45.139> 20

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
really milking and then he had 20

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.860 
really milking and then he had 20
seconds<00:04:46.009> at<00:04:46.099> f-14<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:47.030> can<00:04:47.180> see<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.360> timed<00:04:47.719> it

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
seconds at f-14 you can see I timed it

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.740 
seconds at f-14 you can see I timed it
between<00:04:48.289> strong<00:04:48.770> waves<00:04:49.069> and<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:50.150> waters<00:04:50.509> nice

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
between strong waves and the waters nice

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.869 
between strong waves and the waters nice
and<00:04:51.080> transparent<00:04:51.800> if<00:04:51.949> I<00:04:52.129> had<00:04:52.219> gone<00:04:52.400> for<00:04:52.669> 30

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:52.879 
and transparent if I had gone for 30

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.429 
and transparent if I had gone for 30
seconds<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.479> probably<00:04:53.779> would<00:04:53.930> have<00:04:53.960> taken<00:04:54.199> on

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
seconds it probably would have taken on

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.339 
seconds it probably would have taken on
that<00:04:54.469> really<00:04:54.770> glossy<00:04:55.129> look<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.990> I<00:04:57.020> hope<00:04:57.199> that

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
that really glossy look so I hope that

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.290 
that really glossy look so I hope that
