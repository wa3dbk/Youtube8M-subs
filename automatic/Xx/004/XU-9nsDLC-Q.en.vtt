hole<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.990> better<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.340> we're

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
hole is better so that is what we're

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.810 
hole is better so that is what we're
doing<00:01:17.759> here

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
doing here

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.550

once your hole is prepared you need to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
once your hole is prepared you need to
put<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> stake<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.580> tree<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.750> of

put in the stake for your tree one of
the<00:01:24.930> main<00:01:25.110> reasons<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> state<00:01:26.009> trees<00:01:26.310> is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the main reasons that we state trees is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.789 
the main reasons that we state trees is
to<00:01:26.640> prevent<00:01:27.000> root<00:01:27.299> Rock<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.380> tree<00:01:28.619> isn't

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
to prevent root Rock if a tree isn't

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.830 
to prevent root Rock if a tree isn't
staked<00:01:29.189> correctly<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.030> moves<00:01:30.299> around<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.720> its

planting position it can struggle to

planting position it can struggle to
establish<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> let's<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.170> our<00:01:34.380> stake<00:01:34.619> in

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
