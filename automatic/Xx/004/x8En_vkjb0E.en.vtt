00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 on monday is the apple with big trara 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.970
 Watch featured apple sprint 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.649
 with it on an acquisition of the levels 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.450
 calls everything around gadgets the one on 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.580
 body wears and the apple watch is there 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 Now my name is willing and that is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.449
 what exactly online Monday night has apple 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.529
 ceo tim cook introduced the apple watch 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.840
 They come in different variants 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.519
 The difference is not expensive 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.519
 starts at 400 euros and likes to go 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.230
 to 18,000 euros but can basically 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.760
 all the same with the apple watch 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.500
 I can see that on the small display 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.719
 show weather or appointments 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.520
 news and social media message 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.440
 I can also use it to record the music 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.629
 control my mobile phone 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.550
 so far so normal apple has come up with one 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.160
 few companies teamed around exclusive 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 offer services for example for 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.280
 music recognition also, one can 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.710
 but at least in the usa 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.480
 directly order a car 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.160
 simply in the shop to pay with 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.289
 apple pay be possible as well as the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.390
 Clock hotel as a key for room doors 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.680
 To generally use too much over 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.750
 the voice control siri works 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 what you have a lot of value is the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.809
 fitness area the eu can do the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.589
 heart rate and other fitness values 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.119
 to capture 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.100
 also the advertisement for apple watch counts 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.450
 exactly the clock should 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.020
 to get involved to move more 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 It's also more efficient 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.990
 organized and of course more productive 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.070
 and then, certainly, somehow 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.750
 enough for another 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 possibility of application in the field 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.229
 pharmaceutical company and scientific 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.479
 Facilities can develop apps around 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.250
 simply collect data for studies and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.110
 there is the potential of course huge 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 Some experts assume that I am 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.590
 around in the first three months 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.070
 sell seven million apple juice 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.930
 could 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.670
 That would be almost twice as much as all 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.200
 smart watch sold it out of the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.759
 last year together 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.680
 the baywatch is fully in the trend of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.049
 is called level computing or simply 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.820
 variable so gadgets are called the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.299
 used directly on the body of users 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.649
 become 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.450
 so it does not concern you 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.250
 active all the time as if on am 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.860
 laptop sits but the device so the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.759
 activities in the real world 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.500
 support what is there now 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.729
 Actually, that's the first thing you have to do 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
 say that, for example, a 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.570
 Hearing aid in principle a variable 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.549
 but a pretty simple one 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.020
 Modern applications can do a lot more 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.549
 as only one thing there it goes 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.990
 example wristwatches in the field 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.759
 are some other providers like samsung 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.530
 and Apple have been active for some time and also 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.720
 We also have quite successful 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.610
 bracelets like eg the Michael bay 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.320
 that can also be a lot of data especially 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.090
 to capture the movement the most 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.590
 to get attention next to the ears 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.570
 probably the glasses, among other things 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.220
 google glass or the hollow icons as well 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.470
 can do what we see through 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.690
 supplement additional information or 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.980
 show us directly hologram but there is 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.150
 even smart garments 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.140
 gloves with which one calls 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.780
 can 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.090
 t shirts with leds shoes with navi jackets 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.860
 with music playback and much more 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.110
 the market is already around 17 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.180
 million barrels became worldwide in 2014 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.010
 three quarters of it was sold 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.570
 fitness tracker the gfk so the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.890
 society for consumer research 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.070
 For this year of a tripling 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.600
 then it should be up to 51 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.830
 million devices be samsung that 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.330
 currently still market leader as here 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.200
 especially with the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.820
 greed series 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.470
 then comes directly to apple on the number 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.010
 Of course, two apple is not yet 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.350
 represent 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.660
 that's why the 2015 list will be natural 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.490
 look a little different so you still have 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.650
 he never owns me for that 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.120
 company 2013 her first smart watch 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.830
 I am told of one 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.060
 huge kickstarter campaign at the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.770
 more than ten million dollars 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.090
 have come together also the current 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.920
 model tablet home will be over again 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.260
 kickstarter finances the city there 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.970
 currently not more than 17 million 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.200
 By the way donate but preorder 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.000
 is, for example, the last week of the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.019
 co-financed with kickstarter 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.310
 although I do not really have an evening 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.480
 wanted or all have done 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.739
 I had to do that too and now 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.540
 Not curious what I'm there in may 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.310
 not only for people themselves 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.769
 improve yourself or get fitter 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.090
 want levels are interesting too 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.860
 industry and research have the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.540
 Body technology for yourself in the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.220
 Volkswagen will soon be one of them 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.780
 glasses then come to use 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.670
 you no longer need a handheld scanner for info 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.440
 sticker has to be read as well 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.940
 always hands free even difficult 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.620
 Doctors are already on the job 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.060
 data inside leave the war then 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.220
 important information just in the field of view 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.600
 displayed and from the military I want here 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.920
 do not even start that you can 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.570
 Certainly introduce yourself 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.310
 Of course we are evil despite everything 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.959
 That's why there is a new technology 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.640
 Also some problem of the battery 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.769
 holding apple watch for example just 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.299
 It's 18 hours by pure 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.130
 after own information after all already 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.540
 seven days and that will definitely be 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.489
 a crucial point like 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.260
 Practical are the things you have to 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.150
 to constantly have a blog pads 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.590
 to serve you have meaningful function 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.209
 with real value or one would 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.190
 Smartphone still there at the end 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.760
 Sufficient there are all the questions 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.350
 interesting is also if and bible 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.660
 accepted in their own social environment 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.550
 you live in googles trader 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.200
 a party because he secretly took pictures 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.550
 and video could also do for the 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.440
 privacy is the device he is 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.140
 constantly and automatically save data 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.190
 A big challenge for me 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.170
 easy to say 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.240
 after all, you can very still shut 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.980
 if you find the ending one 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.720
 little outlook where the journey goes 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.820
 Apple could apparently have a patent 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.650
 for new earplugs logged in the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.750
 should be temperature pulse and switzerland 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.700
 measure the word thus appears as 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.900
 just to be the starting point soon 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.790
 smart watch also recognize it 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.710
 Can or does skin tension skin 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.540
 moisture or body temperature the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.460
 derive appropriate mood 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.230
 so you could just stress me out 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.580
 Burnout tracks or the directly to the 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.900
 forward the health insurance fund 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.520
 the possibilities and the before and 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.860
 Disadvantages are huge in any case 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.990
 it would be more like smart weapons or 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.700
 There are shoes here and here you have 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.350
 maybe it's a smart one 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.970
 watch for example water experience 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.680
 so you would buy something like that and 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.090
 what are you looking forward to your 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.430
 opinions and skin also whole times nice 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.900
 the comments and mine was that was what 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.490
 the online and I'm happy now 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.140
 already on my paypal watch in may 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.140
 why ever I ordered them
