 casual youthful and the shoe tip 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.039

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.960
 be true the red booty because 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.080
 generally at the tip 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.150
 Classic closed shoes but as for 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.040
 dress but we see and now you said it in 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.619
 the informal or casual because it could also 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.800
 be and get along very well and put this 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.720
 true outfit if you are wearing pants the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.560
 Printed pants are so 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.290

 a shoe tip that looks its 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.840
 we lose we leave with the boots that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.570
 they are coming trying the same place 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.880
 to round and now since they are stylizing 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.800
 a little more if they are already then to 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.050
 see also the boots and we left a 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.990
 little the platform of and well 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.020
 then the look a bit more classic 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.720
 clear of a stick the thin heel and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.600
 the woman looks super stylish stylizes 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.670
 much the figure of the woman and we can 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.280
 the tips can really be applied 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.289
 almost any type of clothing that is 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030
 true the combination is with all truth 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.290
 is to be those formal shoes 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.680
 to apply in all 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.280
 and not just for looks 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.020
 executives to go to work but not 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.790

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.700
 to work 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.920
 but also comfort is what I 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.909
 I focus a lot on this collection because 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.519

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.489
 that is really duck is comfortable if not 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.129
 I'm focusing a lot on being able to do 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.169
 a shoe tip but that people already 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.450

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.430
 feel super in a coma did not come the day 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.220

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.109
