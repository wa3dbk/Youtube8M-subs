00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
as a 3d artist you know how

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.610 
as a 3d artist you know how
time-consuming<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.570> process<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.139> character

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
time-consuming the process of character

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.610 
time-consuming the process of character
animation<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:12.360> requires<00:00:12.929> begin<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
animation is it requires begin the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.200 
animation is it requires begin the
characters<00:00:14.160> posing<00:00:14.730> them<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.059> each

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
characters posing them for each

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.260 
characters posing them for each
animation<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.170> time<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.680> each<00:00:16.830> pose<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.520> this

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
animation and time in each pose and this

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.570 
animation and time in each pose and this
does<00:00:18.510> quickly<00:00:18.960> get<00:00:19.140> serious<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.980> when<00:00:20.460> you

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
does quickly get serious and when you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.880 
does quickly get serious and when you
think<00:00:20.820> about<00:00:21.000> motion<00:00:21.630> capture<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.470> find<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
think about motion capture you find the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
think about motion capture you find the
available<00:00:23.369> solutions<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.240> very<00:00:24.480> complex

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
available solutions to be very complex

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.950 
available solutions to be very complex
and<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.590> too<00:00:25.650> expensive<00:00:26.250> that's<00:00:27.210> why<00:00:27.539> we

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and way too expensive that's why we
