00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
really hoping that i can get one of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
really hoping that i can get one of
those<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.790> even<00:00:33.329> both<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.540> those<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.170> these

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
those or even both of those in these

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.670 
those or even both of those in these
four<00:00:35.280> packs<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.540> least<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> X<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
four packs or at least in the X that I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
four packs or at least in the X that I
don't<00:00:37.950> already<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:39.180> would<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.510> really

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
don't already have that would be really

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.410 
don't already have that would be really
nice<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> think<00:00:40.410> we'll<00:00:40.620> start<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.980> off<00:00:41.129> by

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
nice so I think we'll start it off by

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.690 
nice so I think we'll start it off by
opening<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.950> Venus<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.129> packs<00:00:44.340> first

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
opening one of the Venus or packs first

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
opening one of the Venus or packs first
and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.090> we'll<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> scrap<00:00:45.930> T<00:00:46.079> in

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and then we'll go with the scrap T in

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
and then we'll go with the scrap T in
the<00:00:46.230> dark<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> Venus<00:00:48.030> or

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the dark right and then the Venus or

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.860 
the dark right and then the Venus or
pack<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.600> end<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> off<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.289> well<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> let's<00:00:51.539> get

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
pack to end it off as well so let's get

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.180 
pack to end it off as well so let's get
straight<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:57.410> I'll<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.590> ahead<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.739> put

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
straight into it I'll go ahead and put

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.680 
straight into it I'll go ahead and put
the<00:00:59.309> code<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> guys<00:01:00.300> real<00:01:00.660> quick

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the code up here for you guys real quick

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.779 
the code up here for you guys real quick
so<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.710> barely<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.550> maybe

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so you can just barely see it maybe

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.280 
so you can just barely see it maybe
you'll<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.210> pause<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.570> video<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:04.110> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you'll have to pause the video to get it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.859 
you'll have to pause the video to get it
but<00:01:04.470> uh<00:01:04.640> there<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.850> hopefully<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> saw
