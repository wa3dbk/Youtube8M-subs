00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello friends how were you welcome to 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.680
 how to play and play on the guitar 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.410
 and this time we are going to talk about 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.059
 harmony let's talk about harmony or 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.549
 that therefore we are going to talk about chords 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.640
 which are interesting to enrich the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.740
 harmony of any song 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.910
 we suddenly make a song 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.990
 simple and we want to add tones 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.369
 within the bars that leads to each 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.279
 each melody of the song we want 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.530
 add tones not the common tones that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.720
 we usually use neither the natural ones 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 other kind of tones like seventh these 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.850
 novenas that can suddenly give you 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.700
 according to the style you have to study them 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.800
 can give you certain nuances and we 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.079
 will allow us to execute in a 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.640
 more categorical on the guitar 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.040
 then they give us more possibilities of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.149
 make more chords with the same song 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.219
 sometimes we can achieve that in a subject 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.170
 Simple of easier than few chords 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.910
 234 chords that we can add more 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.790
 chords and we make the subject 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.340
 raise your prestige up or it sounds 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.010
 much more much better and we 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.780
 serves to execute and exercise better 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.510
 within what are the positions of 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.490
 the guitar well then what are we going to 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.660
 do are seventh seventh chords 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.820
 greater chords of sixth chords of ninth 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.369
 and diminished chords then I'll 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.710
 I'm going to present the model of the chord that 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.560
 goes and then we are going to move in 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.680
 the fretboard on what they are going to change 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.270
 not its composition but its hue 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.610
 then that he speaks for example 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.880
 we have the seventh major fa that would be 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.880
 A) Yes 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.060
 alright then this seventh formation 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.270
 this model that we are seeing 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.450
 we can move it here and it becomes a sun 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.829
 of seventh major then what happens in 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.630
 this case we will respect the tonality 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.899
 in total what I mean then that 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.280
 let's use the thumb the finger 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.090
 index the big finger and the ring finger 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.209
 well for 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.860
 simply touch the tones that are 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.470
 forming the chord you remember that 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.330
 we are stepping on well in the case of fa 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.519
 citi mayor we can do it full 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.620
 because all the tones between the angry 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.019
 of seventh largest but being here the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.390
 notes that would remain on the air in the 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.190
 seventh sun and would change the hue 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.160
 of the chord and there we would not be 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.080
 doing the same chord that's why 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.370
 I propose to do it simply with the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.129
 notes that we are treading on the guitar 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.129
 in 12 well we have the seventh largest fa 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.430
 Sun 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.800
 always seventh largest remains if we 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.320
 we are here and we can continue 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.090
 forward by following what they would be 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.810
 the tones would come a 2 and so 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.400
 successively 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.400
 Well, let's see a novena 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.860
 [Music] 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.620
 all right 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.680
 22 20 and a cake 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:36.910
 [Music] 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:42.090
 now let's see diminished we have a 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.629
 sign we are on one side only 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.629
 fa 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.950
 well then what I said to them by 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.110
 example since we were in the fa of 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.030
 seventh largest we can take in this 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.410
 F chord circle greater than more or 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.910
 less has any of the tones we are going to 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.910
 use all for example 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.530
 so for example we are playing in 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.530
 an easy 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.650
 and suddenly we want to place our 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.650
 Sun 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.639
 and we want to put it in fact that if 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.330
 we're 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.330
 a minor 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.669
 instead of being touching the king with the fa 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.689
 we make 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.710
 but suddenly if the song was wearing 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.410
 that we were in and we had to go to 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.700
 funk inside the compass that what you are 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.700
 said we can do this 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.840
 and 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.020
 [Music] 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.480
 that is, we would pass within it 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.460
 compass at the same time we would place 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:15.660
 In between, another tone must also be seen 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:17.970
 that this can enter us and we add 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.010
 a good tone then they are chords 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.840
 interesting how good to practice it and 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.320
 knowing I'm going to be showing in 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.270
 different videos more chords this that 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.940
 what we have to always see 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.300
 just to see I say is this see how 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.680
 to end within the melody either 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.479
 coming from back for example in this 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.000
 case as we usually work between to 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.310
 pass the fa in the same tone or 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.900
 suddenly use another 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.169
 [Music] 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.680
 or 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:53.120
 another model with the same fa for example 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.370
 here, we would not like it because 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.999
 we would be far but we can always go 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.409
 finding on the guitar this tones on 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:02.319
 this kind of models that are not 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.789
 natural that will serve us for 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.439
 put more chords you just have to 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.169
 look for it in the circle of chords that 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.969
 we are working on the song and know 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.099
 the models then upon knowing this 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:16.120
 chord we know we're in fa 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.120
 we sing in the sun 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:20.270
 and good and so on then 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:24.580
 when suddenly we were working 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.580
 here we can 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.120
 to 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:38.189
 to find what purpose 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:38.189
 [Music] 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.660
 ok well there you can practice go 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.570
 watching these models and then I'm going to 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.150
 present more models and suddenly in 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.370
 some songs that are going to do I'm going 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.840
 to explain more these concepts more 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.670
 go ahead with other songs and others 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.200
 videos that will serve you very much 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.820
 good good see you next I hope 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.820
 that you liked luck
