00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.940 
nuclear bombs in vanilla minecraft so
you'll<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.140> creative<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:22.800> this

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
you'll have to be in creative for this

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.089 
you'll have to be in creative for this
and<00:00:24.020> you're<00:00:25.020> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.559> summon<00:00:25.890> some

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and you're going to have to summon some

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.990 
and you're going to have to summon some
fireballs<00:00:26.779> so<00:00:27.890> when<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.099> summon<00:00:29.430> a<00:00:29.520> fireball

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
fireballs so when you summon a fireball

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.790 
fireballs so when you summon a fireball
you<00:00:30.239> can<00:00:31.020> just<00:00:31.200> summon<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.590> normal<00:00:31.919> one<00:00:32.070> or<00:00:33.800> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you can just summon a normal one or you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.990 
you can just summon a normal one or you
can<00:00:35.010> type<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.770> fireball<00:00:38.000> little

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
can type this in here so fireball little

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.480 
can type this in here so fireball little
thing<00:00:39.180> little<00:00:39.390> thing<00:00:39.480> little<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.490> then

thing little thing little thing and then
all<00:00:41.880> that<00:00:42.420> what's<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:42.840> parenthesis<00:00:43.590> now

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
all that what's in the parenthesis now

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.270 
all that what's in the parenthesis now
you're<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.970> copy<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> exact

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
you're going to want to copy that exact

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.890 
you're going to want to copy that exact
just<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.490> a<00:00:47.520> good<00:00:47.760> look<00:00:48.000> at<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.420> maybe<00:00:48.600> write

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
just take a good look at it maybe write

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.140 
just take a good look at it maybe write
it<00:00:49.020> down<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:49.500> maybe<00:00:50.280> pause<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> video<00:00:50.970> just

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
it down there maybe pause the video just

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.490 
it down there maybe pause the video just
for<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> sec<00:00:52.130> all<00:00:53.130> right<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> got<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.550> good<00:00:54.500> so

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
for a sec all right you got it good so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.790 
for a sec all right you got it good so
the<00:00:55.650> only<00:00:55.860> thing<00:00:56.310> you<00:00:56.489> want<00:00:56.700> to<00:00:56.820> change<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the only thing you want to change is the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.340 
the only thing you want to change is the
last<00:00:59.010> number<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.880> where<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.420> says<00:01:00.450> explosion

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
last number here where it says explosion

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.569 
last number here where it says explosion
power<00:01:01.850> now<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.860> normal<00:01:05.129> gas

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
power now one is just a normal gas

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.090 
power now one is just a normal gas
explosion<00:01:06.509> power<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> same<00:01:07.470> thing<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
explosion power it's the same thing as a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.149 
explosion power it's the same thing as a
normal<00:01:08.579> gas<00:01:08.729> fireball<00:01:09.319> four<00:01:10.319> is<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.799> power<00:01:11.100> of

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
normal gas fireball four is the power of

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
normal gas fireball four is the power of
TNT<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.179> then<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:14.009> from<00:01:14.399> there<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.929> well<00:01:15.929> as

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
TNT and then up from there is well as

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.649 
TNT and then up from there is well as
powerful<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.069> want<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.399> to<00:01:17.549> become<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
powerful as you want it to become so you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.090 
powerful as you want it to become so you
can<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:21.770> 4400<00:01:24.499> 400,000<00:01:25.499> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.920> have

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
can have it as 4400 400,000 you can have

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.209 
can have it as 4400 400,000 you can have
it<00:01:26.280> literally<00:01:26.609> as<00:01:26.939> powerful<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:27.959> you<00:01:28.139> want<00:01:28.380> but

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
it literally as powerful as you want but

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.300 
it literally as powerful as you want but
be<00:01:29.639> very<00:01:29.819> careful<00:01:29.969> with<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.719> because<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.740> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
be very careful with that because it can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
be very careful with that because it can
corrupt<00:01:32.819> your<00:01:33.149> world<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.959> too<00:01:34.139> powerful

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
corrupt your world if it's too powerful

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.069 
corrupt your world if it's too powerful
and<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.789> can<00:01:35.939> run<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.240> memory<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.630> lot<00:01:36.929> of

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and you can run out of memory a lot of

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.889 
and you can run out of memory a lot of
problems<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.679> come<00:01:37.829> into<00:01:38.069> play<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.420> make

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
problems can come into play if you make

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.940 
problems can come into play if you make
it<00:01:40.049> too<00:01:40.200> powerful<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:41.249> the<00:01:41.429> option<00:01:41.819> is<00:01:41.969> there

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
it too powerful but the option is there

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.589 
it too powerful but the option is there
so<00:01:45.229> Jael<00:01:46.229> two<00:01:46.770> five<00:01:47.009> seven<00:01:47.399> nine<00:01:47.599> actually

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
so Jael two five seven nine actually

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.620 
so Jael two five seven nine actually
showed<00:01:49.499> this<00:01:49.740> off<00:01:50.069> in<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.179> his<00:01:51.329> recent

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
showed this off in one of his recent

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.199 
showed this off in one of his recent
videos<00:01:52.200> where<00:01:52.799> he<00:01:53.130> made<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.090> these

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
videos where he made one of these

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.309 
videos where he made one of these
powerful<00:01:54.749> enough<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.469> blow<00:01:56.039> up<00:01:56.279> bedrock<00:01:57.319> so

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
powerful enough to blow up bedrock so

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.249 
powerful enough to blow up bedrock so
that's<00:01:58.829> pretty<00:01:59.369> crazy<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.209> I<00:02:00.569> highly<00:02:00.929> suggest

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that's pretty crazy and I highly suggest

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.629 
that's pretty crazy and I highly suggest
you<00:02:01.560> check<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.799> out<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.189> will<00:02:02.310> be<00:02:02.429> in<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639 
you check it out it will be in the

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.039 
you check it out it will be in the
description<00:02:03.179> below<00:02:03.560> but<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.249> normal

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
description below but just for a normal

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.290 
description below but just for a normal
demonstration<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.520> gas<00:02:08.520> fireball<00:02:09.060> with

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
demonstration here a gas fireball with

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
demonstration here a gas fireball with
the<00:02:09.390> power<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.869> one<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the power of one so this is just a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.100 
the power of one so this is just a
normal<00:02:11.370> gas<00:02:11.730> fireball<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.630> don't<00:02:12.810> know<00:02:12.959> why

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
normal gas fireball and I don't know why

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.839 
normal gas fireball and I don't know why
it's<00:02:13.260> doing<00:02:13.290> that

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
it's doing that

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.360 
it's doing that
but<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.090> explosion

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
but the explosion

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.240 
but the explosion
it's<00:02:16.670> about<00:02:16.910> like<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.360> no<00:02:18.140> big<00:02:18.380> deal<00:02:18.830> tiny

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
it's about like that no big deal tiny

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.680 
it's about like that no big deal tiny
little<00:02:19.520> thing<00:02:21.310> now<00:02:22.310> when<00:02:22.670> it's<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.360> power<00:02:23.599> of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
little thing now when it's the power of

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.589 
little thing now when it's the power of
four<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> normal<00:02:25.160> TNT<00:02:25.880> let's<00:02:26.270> fire<00:02:26.569> it

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
four that is a normal TNT let's fire it

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.900 
four that is a normal TNT let's fire it
down<00:02:29.110> okay<00:02:30.140> normal<00:02:30.560> TNT<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.340> also<00:02:31.489> makes<00:02:31.760> a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
down okay normal TNT it also makes a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.610 
down okay normal TNT it also makes a
fire<00:02:32.150> around<00:02:32.480> everywhere<00:02:33.019> which<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.260> really

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
fire around everywhere which is really

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.070 
fire around everywhere which is really
cool<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.870> finally<00:02:35.870> let's<00:02:36.709> check<00:02:36.950> out<00:02:37.069> 40<00:02:38.080> so

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
cool and finally let's check out 40 so

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.820 
cool and finally let's check out 40 so
here<00:02:39.319> we<00:02:39.410> go

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.880 

now<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.069> lags<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.459> little<00:02:43.730> bit<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.090> there<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:44.569> go

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
now it lags a little bit and there we go

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.539 
now it lags a little bit and there we go
pretty<00:02:45.890> crazy<00:02:47.019> but<00:02:48.040> I'm<00:02:49.040> going<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.280> show<00:02:49.489> you

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
how far we can push this my computer I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.789 
how far we can push this my computer I
have<00:02:52.580> tried<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.269> out<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.690> can<00:02:54.260> get<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.560> about<00:02:54.739> a

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
have tried it out I can get to about a

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.070 
have tried it out I can get to about a
thousand<00:02:55.580> before<00:02:55.700> my<00:02:56.090> actual<00:02:56.540> game<00:02:56.780> just

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
thousand before my actual game just

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.170 
thousand before my actual game just
completely<00:02:57.670> dies<00:02:58.810> so<00:03:00.220> let's<00:03:01.220> fire<00:03:01.489> one<00:03:01.790> Adam

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
completely dies so let's fire one Adam

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.860 
completely dies so let's fire one Adam

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
one that's 400 explosive power and let's

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.280 
one that's 400 explosive power and let's
see<00:03:25.250> how<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.579> goes

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
see how this goes

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.060 
see how this goes

memory should be going up at least a

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.809 
memory should be going up at least a
little<00:03:36.859> bit<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:38.950> causing<00:03:39.950> quite<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.340> bit<00:03:40.609> of

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
lag my fps just died and once you hear

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.680 
lag my fps just died and once you hear
the<00:03:45.290> little<00:03:45.650> explosion<00:03:46.340> sound<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:47.510> know

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
the little explosion sound you know

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.170 
the little explosion sound you know
you're<00:03:47.870> all<00:03:47.989> good<00:03:48.230> but<00:03:48.470> before<00:03:48.889> then<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.819> may

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
you're all good but before then you may

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.199 
you're all good but before then you may
crash<00:03:51.100> so<00:03:52.100> be<00:03:52.250> careful<00:03:52.700> okay<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:55.549> I<00:03:55.700> think<00:03:56.030> it's

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
crash so be careful okay so I think it's

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.599 
crash so be careful okay so I think it's
loaded<00:03:56.600> in<00:03:56.720> now<00:03:56.930> let's<00:03:57.560> try<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:57.950> get<00:03:58.040> close<00:03:58.310> oh

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
loaded in now let's try and get close oh

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.039 
loaded in now let's try and get close oh
it's<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.150> laggy<00:04:00.280> but<00:04:01.280> yeah<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:01.819> is<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:02.480> gasp

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
it's so laggy but yeah that is a gasp

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.569 
it's so laggy but yeah that is a gasp
fireball<00:04:03.709> with<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.130> explosive<00:04:04.730> power<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.120> 400

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
fireball with the explosive power of 400

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.490 
fireball with the explosive power of 400
completely<00:04:07.690> decimated<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:09.410> mountain<00:04:09.980> here

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
completely decimated this mountain here

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.670 
completely decimated this mountain here
so<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.950> pretty<00:04:13.400> insane<00:04:14.000> also<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.410> fire

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
so that is pretty insane also the fire

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.330 
so that is pretty insane also the fire
goes<00:04:15.980> out<00:04:16.160> for<00:04:16.370> quite<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.729> distance<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:19.070> can't

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
goes out for quite a distance you can't

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.240 
goes out for quite a distance you can't
really<00:04:19.489> see<00:04:19.789> it<00:04:19.820> from<00:04:20.120> here<00:04:20.570> but<00:04:21.139> if<00:04:21.500> we<00:04:21.859> fly

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
really see it from here but if we fly

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.750 
really see it from here but if we fly
around<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.729> bit<00:04:22.910> we<00:04:23.120> may<00:04:23.360> see<00:04:23.660> some<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.760> the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
around a bit we may see some of the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.430 
around a bit we may see some of the
shockwave<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.720> yeah<00:04:26.960> oh<00:04:27.200> yeah

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
shockwave so yeah oh yeah

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.080 
shockwave so yeah oh yeah
so<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.560> shockwaves<00:04:31.010> go<00:04:31.220> pretty<00:04:31.490> far<00:04:31.790> it

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
so the shockwaves go pretty far it

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.900 
so the shockwaves go pretty far it
actually<00:04:32.510> it's<00:04:32.990> taken<00:04:33.770> out<00:04:33.860> this<00:04:34.070> forest<00:04:34.550> here

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
actually it's taken out this forest here

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.100 
actually it's taken out this forest here
or<00:04:35.090> jungle<00:04:35.810> sorry<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:38.090> these<00:04:38.450> are<00:04:38.660> pretty

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
or jungle sorry so these are pretty

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.710 
or jungle sorry so these are pretty
devastating<00:04:40.010> so<00:04:40.880> now<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.090> we<00:04:41.270> know<00:04:41.420> how<00:04:41.570> this

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
devastating so now that we know how this

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.600 
devastating so now that we know how this
works<00:04:41.930> let's<00:04:42.650> blow<00:04:42.920> up<00:04:43.040> something<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.370> little

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
works let's blow up something a little

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.410 
works let's blow up something a little
more<00:04:43.760> unique<00:04:45.370> okay<00:04:46.370> everyone<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.270> is<00:04:47.390> a

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
more unique okay everyone so this is a

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.170 
more unique okay everyone so this is a
city<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:47.870> made<00:04:48.230> in<00:04:48.410> Minecraft<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:49.400> made<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.760> quite

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
city I made in Minecraft I made it quite

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.360 
city I made in Minecraft I made it quite
a<00:04:50.240> while<00:04:50.480> ago<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:51.200> just<00:04:51.410> got<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.800> map<00:04:52.040> file

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
a while ago and I just got the map file

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.710 
a while ago and I just got the map file
so<00:04:53.360> it's<00:04:53.780> easily<00:04:54.320> replaceable<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:56.510> looks

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
so it's easily replaceable and it looks

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.260 
so it's easily replaceable and it looks
