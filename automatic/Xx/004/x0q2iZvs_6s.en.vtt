open it up and I'm going to continue the
video<00:02:47.880> after<00:02:48.210> that<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> right<00:02:50.250> now<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.760> it

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
video after that so right now I have it

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.350 
video after that so right now I have it
taken<00:02:51.600> apart<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:53.520> housing<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:53.940> taken<00:02:54.240> apart

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
taken apart the housing is taken apart

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.220 
taken apart the housing is taken apart
and<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.410> how<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:57.120> looks<00:02:57.390> inside<00:02:57.570> it's<00:02:58.110> a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
and this is how it looks inside it's a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.050 
and this is how it looks inside it's a
filter<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.950> think<00:02:59.400> right<00:03:00.360> here<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.940> let<00:03:02.940> me<00:03:02.970> see

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
filter I think right here and let me see

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.770 
filter I think right here and let me see
if<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.300> can<00:03:03.480> find<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.780> leak

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
if I can find a leak

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:15.850 
if I can find a leak
yeah<00:03:06.780> see<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:08.340> link<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.640> right<00:03:08.670> there<00:03:09.290> crack

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
put this housing back to the water

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.300 
put this housing back to the water
filtration<00:03:54.720> system<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.560> whole<00:03:55.830> house<00:03:56.069> water

filtration I still have the main wall

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.440 
filtration I still have the main wall
turn<00:03:59.340> off<00:03:59.489> so<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.880> water's<00:04:00.239> coming<00:04:00.569> in<00:04:01.160> okay

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
turn off so the water's coming in okay

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.110 
turn off so the water's coming in okay
let's<00:04:03.450> do<00:04:03.599> it<00:04:04.190> it's<00:04:05.190> gonna<00:04:05.370> be<00:04:05.579> pretty<00:04:05.790> easy

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
let's do it it's gonna be pretty easy

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.140 
let's do it it's gonna be pretty easy
you<00:04:06.959> just<00:04:06.989> tuck<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:07.920> back<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.370> it's<00:04:08.970> pretty

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
you just tuck this back in it's pretty

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.500 
you just tuck this back in it's pretty
heavy<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.519> there's<00:04:11.519> some<00:04:11.819> support<00:04:12.299> down<00:04:12.450> here

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
heavy so there's some support down here

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.380 
heavy so there's some support down here
so<00:04:12.870> I'm<00:04:12.930> using<00:04:13.170> my<00:04:13.380> knee<00:04:13.849> so<00:04:14.849> I'm<00:04:14.940> going<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.120> put

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
so I'm using my knee so I'm going to put

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:36.379 
so I'm using my knee so I'm going to put
this<00:04:15.510> right<00:04:15.720> back<00:04:16.310> turn<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.489> on<00:04:17.609> turn

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:46.780 

right

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.170 

-<00:04:47.600> it's<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.930> end<00:04:48.790> we're<00:04:49.790> going<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:49.940> use<00:04:50.150> a

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
- it's the end we're going to use a

00:04:50.180 --> 00:05:05.869 
- it's the end we're going to use a
special<00:04:50.540> wrench<00:04:50.900> again<00:04:51.080> to<00:04:51.440> tighten<00:04:51.860> it

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.829 

so<00:05:06.449> it<00:05:06.629> should<00:05:06.809> be<00:05:06.839> okay<00:05:07.169> by<00:05:07.319> now<00:05:07.349> we'll<00:05:08.839> have

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:09.839 
so it should be okay by now we'll have

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.129 
so it should be okay by now we'll have
the<00:05:10.050> rain<00:05:10.499> walk<00:05:10.800> turn<00:05:11.069> on<00:05:11.449> and<00:05:12.449> see<00:05:12.749> how<00:05:12.929> it<00:05:13.080> is

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
the rain walk turn on and see how it is

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.549 
the rain walk turn on and see how it is
okay<00:05:13.939> you<00:05:14.939> can<00:05:15.419> see<00:05:15.599> that<00:05:15.629> a<00:05:15.779> lot<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.229> Sun

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:16.559 
okay you can see that a lot of Sun

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.329 
okay you can see that a lot of Sun
that's<00:05:16.800> hitting<00:05:17.129> on<00:05:17.279> this<00:05:17.599> housing<00:05:18.599> so<00:05:19.439> what

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:20.339 
that's hitting on this housing so what

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.529 
that's hitting on this housing so what
the<00:05:20.789> time<00:05:21.779> from<00:05:22.379> ISIL<00:05:23.129> pure<00:05:23.459> water<00:05:23.879> say<00:05:24.209> that

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
the time from ISIL pure water say that

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.839 
the time from ISIL pure water say that
we<00:05:25.439> should<00:05:25.649> have<00:05:25.800> probably<00:05:26.099> a<00:05:26.339> layer<00:05:26.580> of

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
we should have probably a layer of

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.909 
we should have probably a layer of
insulation<00:05:27.449> around<00:05:27.749> to<00:05:28.259> protect<00:05:28.649> it<00:05:28.740> from<00:05:28.770> the

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
insulation around to protect it from the

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.049 
insulation around to protect it from the
Sun<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:30.330> leak<00:05:30.659> of<00:05:30.929> the<00:05:31.050> crack<00:05:31.619> actually<00:05:32.279> could

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:33.059 
Sun the leak of the crack actually could

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:37.040 
Sun the leak of the crack actually could
be<00:05:33.270> from<00:05:33.809> the<00:05:34.110> damage<00:05:34.740> of<00:05:34.979> the<00:05:35.009> UV<00:05:35.699> light<00:05:36.689> from

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
be from the damage of the UV light from

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.820 
be from the damage of the UV light from
the<00:05:37.229> Sun<00:05:37.439> so<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:38.240> will<00:05:39.240> take<00:05:39.419> up<00:05:39.569> a<00:05:39.659> way<00:05:39.869> probably

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
the Sun so I will take up a way probably

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.320 
the Sun so I will take up a way probably
make<00:05:41.399> one<00:05:41.610> I'll<00:05:41.849> probably<00:05:41.999> buy<00:05:42.300> some

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
make one I'll probably buy some

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.019 
make one I'll probably buy some
insulation<00:05:42.990> from<00:05:43.409> Home<00:05:43.769> Depot<00:05:43.800> just<00:05:44.550> to

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
insulation from Home Depot just to

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.459 
insulation from Home Depot just to
protect<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:45.569> you<00:05:45.599> can<00:05:45.779> see<00:05:45.990> right<00:05:46.199> now<00:05:46.319> it's
