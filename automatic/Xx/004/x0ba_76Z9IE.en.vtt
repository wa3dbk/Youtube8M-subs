00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:02.569
 We are invading the signal of the globe network at this very moment, to communicate to the whole population 

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:03.949
 national, that we are not vandals as the manipulative media asserts, we are the 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:04.949
 people, lawyers, doctors, student workers at last. 

00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:05.949
 And we have a single ideal, to build a nation without corruption or at least to diminish 

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:19.039
 very much as possible, we are the black bloc group, our ideal is just to react to 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:41.870
 repression of the state against the heroes, the demonstrators, we never attack without motives. 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:01:04.390
 Our goal is only to defend the protesters and curb practices of looting, we are the elite, 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.820
 we are the front line in the protests, when the population is repressed, we 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 we come in to intervene. 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.230
 We only stop when Brazil is a fair country with less social inequalities, we have to 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:30.340
 take corrupt politicians out of power, to get an idea we pay the highest taxes 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:49.490
 with the worst services in the world, as is the case with the auto-mobilization industry that 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.310
 riding on top of the Brazilians with real wagons. 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.360
 Let's attack politicians because we are the resistance of society, sometimes for 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 To have peace requires war. 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.470
 We want a fairer world for us and our children. 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.470
 Rede Globo mass manipulating press and corrupt. 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.470
 Come and join us. 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.473
