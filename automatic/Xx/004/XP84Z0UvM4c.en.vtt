00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.840
 today more or less seems to want to quit it 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.050
 soon it is noise that makes water on 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.210
 I hate the black mood more or less 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.910
 as the sky is one of those keys the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.980
 pilot the only thought sometimes bench 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.480
 until everyone understands you leave yourself 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.120
 behind historical acts behind that 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.809
 they hit and they go wrong you're down by 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.730
 moral 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.940
 the mind is sucked into a sad one 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.739
 I feel it spiraling today, one of those days 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.440
 on that emptiness that is inside is 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.839
 unacceptable too large that you don't think about it 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.059
 for me paradoxes do not compromise me 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.400
 same that I would never have removed it e 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.470
 yet another one of those days 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.370
 passed to rethink every moment every 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.200
 Now 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.420
 but when 15-year-olds were played at 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.380
 calcetto until the last message and from 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.380
 that damn day 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.070
 but he knows it well 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.149
 today you live it days see you find you 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.490
 only for sighted people just to talk to you 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.159
 maybe together with the others joking about 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.820
 sofa with you that make coffee bitter him 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.590
 we know 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.020
 one of those days also makes of 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.689
 questions you abandon all certainty 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.060
 indeed attempts because without you and not 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.179
 will be more the same is the life from now on 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.520
 then it will have a different taste or those 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.590
 days and it's a mess and if I write this 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.200
 piece and to feel closer to you is 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.209
 the only reason forces the attempt to 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.729
 feel a little like I miss you was a 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.040
 sedative one of those days than ever 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.200
 would like to have referred to as in a movie 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.530
 I see all the scenes and think about the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.330
 laughter made when we were together 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.870
 I still feel like I read a song of 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.870
 sirens 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:45.239
 she today one of those games no longer 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.549
 they can think of you where I'd like to come back 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.620
 just to say good- bye to you 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.599
 every sentence about our every picture in 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.150
 which revisits your smile while staring 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.280
 the void one of those days that seem 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.780
 endless that you remember not remaining 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.700
 they remain as debris 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.280
 because to what was there can no longer 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.420
 come back and what remains will not be able to me 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.790
 never enough 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.739
 today I spend one of those days alone 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.079
 because he hates having people around when 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.660
 it excites you because there are too many stories 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.060
 too many situations to coletto and cigarettes 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.459
 I with one of those fixations 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.959
 days made of memories of a tour 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.770
 together with the others to do the nights 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.690
 sleepless and the bone as you speak why 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.890
 in those days when I would like to go back 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.890
 just one of those days
