00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi to all users of spaceshames are 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 Doctor wise we are here today with a new one 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.059
 episode of m 2 k 14 our career 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.219
 with magic 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.530
 we had left with our turn 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.809
 of draft selection 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.940
 I must say you guessed the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.359
 player I chose to call 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.250
 number 5 was quite predictable 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.779
 young parker joins ours 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.590
 company and then we go to get a 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 top player 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.800
 I seriously doubt that it could come down 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.300
 up to 5 in the royal trot since 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520
 however the first two positions appear 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.649
 quite discounted with wiggins e 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 partners that will be chosen as one and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.280
 as number two 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.239
 unless someone falls in love with 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.789
 anfield 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.920
 I honestly doubt it probably 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.559
 could end up in the top three 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.700
 although it will be a nice risk to go 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.930
 I did not see yesterday there are doubts about 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.989
 his physical strength 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.550
 in any case I have already chosen bari parker e 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.800
 soon after I had a lot of luck 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.410
 because why the orlando magic have 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.799
 decided to accept my offer that 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.670
 foresaw marco bellinelli gigi datome is 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.650
 our second choice of turn 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 then at number 30 on the second lap 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.700
 therefore a prudent choice in a profit 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.369
 in the field there is a date even 16 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.500
 at the first he will then see how I already had it 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.810
 said I managed to get back the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.140
 choice number 16 which you will see I will take a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.000
 another player really really 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 interesting in any case then orlando mi 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.409
 try calling back to offer me one 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.570
 quite poor choice because 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.579
 number 10 in exchange for my number 6 is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.430
 a player however was not functional 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.340
 to my team with the choice number 6 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.439
 I went pretty much for granted 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 I was tempted to take Dante 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.549
 xoom that seems oriented to go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.619
 towards the orlando magic will be 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.750
 probably their choice in this 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.549
 line or marcus smart manco smart 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.439
 yet another point guard decided to 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.689
 don't take it right away because why I had it 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.159
 john wall pd wants my play maker 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.140
 owner did not make sense to take a 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.600
 rookie like play so I went 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.540
 obviously on beat that will become the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.869
 center holder on which to lay the foundations 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.480
 for the future so for now we have 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.750
 interesting java with parker and derby 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.790
 in more choice number 16 so there 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.620
 they have ridiculous offers and look 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.720
 who had not yet been chosen 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.799
 to the choice in the 1 16 one thing that not 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.799
 it will never happen 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.540
 even marco smart is available 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.459
 to the choice number 16 that I go 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.040
 definitely treat it because why 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.470
 we can use it either as a guard or anyway 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.379
 as before and falls reserve to see then 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.629
 how three players evolve 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.060
 absurd all with more than 80 of 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.730
 evaluation so I laid the foundations for 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.790
 the future of the franchise and then there is the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.459
 faith the player we have to bet is 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.950
 obviously lebron james served me here 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.599
 have a wage space practically 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.940
 infinite because why can I go 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.879
 offer more than 20 million dollars 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.060
 the year in lebron james for four years 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.590
 so decided to bet everything on this 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.989
 player there were so many qualities and 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.859
 interesting as kobe ​​as carmelo 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.690
 anthony 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.730
 but surely what brings you to 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.109
 turn the excess on the project 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.030
 I could even have thought of not 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.459
 go get no friedrich's 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.069
 leave sacral space free and seek 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.840
 to invest in 2016 to improve 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.329
 however, it seemed like a deadline too 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.889
 too long so I'm determined to 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.870
 go on lebron james that without a little 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.269
 surprise because it usually ends up in los 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.120
 angeles decides to accept mine 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.819
 offer then reconfirm favers also 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.780
 as he had anticipated and I can stop 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.609
 lebron james 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.750
 so we have a crazy team 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:46.609
 against wall bradley parker james and denny 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.639
 commented titling the child yes 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.530
 alzano smart faverani tobias herre fini 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.389
 deep bench and the goal 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.669
 this year is winning the title 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.859
 probably fraud in maneuvers bears la 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.329
 deadline for dealing with harry why 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.069
 because I will not have salary space for 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.449
 reconfirming maybe we'll take another one 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.699
 choice to the next art 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.199
 in any case we have finished with oil since 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.000
 next episodes we will start playing myself 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.599
 I look forward to using these 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.980
 players 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.840
 so if you liked left a 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.160
 lay a comment 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.629
 subscribe to the channel and we are there 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.629
 hello to everyone soon
