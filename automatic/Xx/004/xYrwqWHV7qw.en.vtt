00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the end of the year but earlier in the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.410 
the end of the year but earlier in the
year<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:08.760> were<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:09.090> strong

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
year you know they were very strong

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.940 
year you know they were very strong
defensive<00:01:09.900> team<00:01:10.080> maybe<00:01:10.500> they'll<00:01:10.680> revert<00:01:10.920> back

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950

to<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.390> first<00:01:12.570> thought<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
to that a bit so my first thought is the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.510 
to that a bit so my first thought is the
under<00:01:13.320> forty<00:01:13.590> six<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> half<00:01:13.979> Troy<00:01:14.310> West

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

under forty six and a half Troy West
what<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.119> yeah<00:01:15.990> no<00:01:16.259> I'm

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
what do you like here yeah no I'm

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.840 
what do you like here yeah no I'm
actually<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> go<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.189> Kansas<00:01:17.640> City

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
actually going to go with Kansas City

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.490 
actually going to go with Kansas City
Opera<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.600> game<00:01:18.810> I'll<00:01:18.960> take<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> two<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
Opera on this game I'll take the two a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.109 
Opera on this game I'll take the two a
nap<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.979> think<00:01:20.189> Kansas<00:01:20.430> City<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.880> don't

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
nap but I think Kansas City I don't

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
nap but I think Kansas City I don't
think<00:01:21.299> their<00:01:21.450> season<00:01:21.840> ends<00:01:22.170> against<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
think their season ends against the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
think their season ends against the
Indianapolis<00:01:23.430> Colts<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.939> cold<00:01:24.210> team<00:01:24.479> has

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
Indianapolis Colts this cold team has

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.840

been<00:01:24.840> such<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.310> stopping<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> run<00:01:26.549> all

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
been such that stopping the run all

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
been such that stopping the run all
season<00:01:27.180> long<00:01:27.509> their<00:01:27.780> defense<00:01:28.200> has<00:01:28.290> been<00:01:28.530> very

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
season long their defense has been very

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.100 
season long their defense has been very
inconsistent<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.390> typically<00:01:30.810> do

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110

they<00:02:04.110> could<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.350> able<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> run<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.710> ball<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
they could be able to run the ball and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.980 
they could be able to run the ball and
move<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> ball<00:02:05.579> will<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.030> offense<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.659> like

Kansas City is really built for the
unders<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.500> think<00:03:44.799> their<00:03:44.949> defense<00:03:45.370> is

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
unders and I think their defense is

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.030 
unders and I think their defense is
going<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:45.970> return<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.989> form<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.709> fact<00:03:47.949> that

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
going to return to form the fact that

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.740 
going to return to form the fact that
they're<00:03:48.280> off<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:48.819> bye<00:03:49.090> week<00:03:49.120> as<00:03:49.480> far<00:03:49.660> as

they're off of a bye week as far as

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.210 
they're off of a bye week as far as
their<00:03:49.900> starters<00:03:50.109> are<00:03:50.470> concerned<00:03:50.829> all<00:03:51.040> right

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
their starters are concerned all right

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
in the middle of the year you think it's

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.789 
in the middle of the year you think it's
completely<00:03:58.120> attributable<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.470> defense

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
completely attributable to the defense

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:00.960 
completely attributable to the defense

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
big injuries that and those guys are

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.599 
big injuries that and those guys are
still<00:04:02.680> going<00:04:02.829> to<00:04:02.889> be<00:04:02.980> out<00:04:03.069> go<00:04:03.220> out<00:04:03.250> for<00:04:03.579> the

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
that they wore down I'm not going to lie

that they wore down I'm not going to lie
to<00:04:11.079> you<00:04:11.319> I<00:04:11.410> do<00:04:11.590> think<00:04:12.069> that<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.760> was<00:04:13.000> an

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
to you I do think that it was an

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.180 
to you I do think that it was an
aberration<00:04:13.510> their<00:04:14.019> early<00:04:14.470> numbers<00:04:14.650> they<00:04:15.010> had

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
aberration their early numbers they had

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.610 
aberration their early numbers they had
a<00:04:15.220> fairly<00:04:15.849> easy<00:04:16.000> schedule<00:04:16.720> but<00:04:17.079> their<00:04:17.260> defense

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
a fairly easy schedule but their defense

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.009 
a fairly easy schedule but their defense
really<00:04:17.919> is<00:04:18.130> somewhere<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:19.269> middle<00:04:19.599> and<00:04:19.750> I

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
really is somewhere in the middle and I

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.930 
really is somewhere in the middle and I
just<00:04:20.229> don't<00:04:20.440> think<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:20.769> Indianapolis<00:04:21.549> minus

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
just don't think that Indianapolis minus
