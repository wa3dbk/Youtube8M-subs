coaster<00:00:21.300> since<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> boy<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.410> fell<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.189> love

coaster since I was a boy I fell in love

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.000 
coaster since I was a boy I fell in love
with<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> idea<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.060> designing<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:27.769> goes<00:00:28.769> from

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
with the idea of designing it goes from

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
with the idea of designing it goes from
taking<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> available<00:00:30.090> land<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.630> figuring

taking the available land and figuring

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.830 
taking the available land and figuring
out where<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.250> land<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.840> from

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
out where to go on that land and from

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380 
out where to go on that land and from
there<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.290> add<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> hills<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:36.180> start

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
there we add in the hills and we start

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
there we add in the hills and we start
calculating<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.140> speeds<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> forces

calculating the speeds and the forces

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.310 
calculating the speeds and the forces
and<00:00:38.460> part<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> process<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.840> looking<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
and part of the process is looking at a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.770 
and part of the process is looking at a
long<00:00:40.559> string<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.040> numbers<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.610> being<00:00:42.510> able<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
long string of numbers and being able to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.330 
long string of numbers and being able to
convert<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.379> my<00:00:43.559> mind<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> feeling<00:00:46.340> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
convert that in my mind to a feeling is
