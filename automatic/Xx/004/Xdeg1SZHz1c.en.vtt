00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 hello the main characteristics of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.510
 a trial bike in difference with the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.510
 field bikes 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.320
 that is to say on a trial bike the 80th 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.860
 one hundred of its use is in first speed 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 second 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.370
 because what it's about is going up 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.010
 obstacles trying to put at least 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.040
 possible feet on the floor that are 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.330
 the penalties 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.420
 the approximate weight of a classic motorcycle or 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.540
 classic modern we are talking to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.010
 from complementing to 110 and 2 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.270
 from 70 kilos 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.270
 in my mind 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.270
 the main difference right now in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.780
 the competition with classic that already 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.520
 we have a few years then not a little 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:36.150
 enjoy out of friends beer that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.860
 we do now it made the difference of 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.230
 modern and classic hello good 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.360
 and I 'm going to show you the 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.720
 what it refers to regarding 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.700
 technique of a modern and a classical 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.890
 because to compete in modern you have to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.890
 have on disc brakes 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.670
 the tortillas in front 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:09.450
 that is the main characteristic that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:13.620
 a classic is different from one of the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.740
 hairpins and had fernando as I 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.510
 made my father look for them too 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.600
 they differentiate the weights the technology 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.000
 many many modern motorcycles now 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.460
 lately these years are pulling in 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.280
 instead of dedicating carburation 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.210
 and carburetor manual carry injection 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.680
 electronics 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.380
 when it comes to riding a trial 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.690
 modern classic with a modern can 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.050
 perform all kinds of movements in the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.450
 zone for from left to right but 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.580
 backwards not without backing were the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.400
 steps can not, on the other hand, 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.540
 classic if you make movements you have 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.910
 that having done those in motion 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.620
 with the back wheel in motion if 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.430
 they do not penalize you and they make you the worst 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.310
 can application of a 5 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.120
 Well, I started in this world 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.220
 thanks to my father Juan Carlos with 11 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.230
 I bought an account 49 years ago 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.020
 and it was my first good bike I still follow 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.819
 having and I liked a little 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:22.519
 then I had some 80's 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:27.580
 and with that start competing and then already 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:30.550
 I had one and another previous 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.030
 and there already since I was 16 years old 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.750
 competing and then already with 16 years old I 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.110
 He ran a race in Robregordo that 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.560
 is 50 minutes like this the seventh with 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.770
 my father 's classic and I already said 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.390
 so far I devoted myself to studies 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.480
 I was four years without competing 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.190
 my father's backpacker and good and I 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.840
 they left the classic motorbike you have there 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.569
 I left a partner 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.370
 and I encouraged myself to compete good the year 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.890
 past was competing against 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.720
 Spain that every quarter and in the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.430
 championship of madrid is third and 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.370
 good 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.370
 at the end with the vice 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.620
 until I sign this year again 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.380
 so modern because my sister has 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.840
 returned to put in in modern so I 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.639
 Come on, I'll sign up and see what it looks like 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.460
 in the trial competition is 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.090
 completely from climbing obstacles that 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.580
 they put 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.849
 according to you go to the competitions usually 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.339
 be of earth and of iu with stones 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.639
 there are not a few that are artificial to 

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:44.649
 the best in a trial there is an area that is 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.259
 artificial that you mount it with trunks 

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:49.509
 or some cement block but they tend to 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.719
 be all in the bush that differ 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.520
 also in terms of modern and classic 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:57.759
 it is offered that the path of modern 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.719
 it's shorter than this one area is a lot 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:06.009
 shorter they are usually 8 kilometers like that 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:08.379
 and the classic ones are more than 8 meters 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.889
 we have come to have in robregordo of 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:14.589
 40 kilometers and two tracks in modern 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.409
 are usually one day too I think that 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:19.209
 in classics all that is not 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.849
 we have to be up every day 

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:25.139
 of a motorcycle but to pass better because you see 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:29.009
 more monte happens 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.590
 to compete but to enjoy and modern 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.259
 you have to be very on top of the bike 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.029
 this failure this has to correct everything 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.639
 while there are many competitions 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:41.449
 modern and if you want to have fun 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.449
 I recommend the classic
