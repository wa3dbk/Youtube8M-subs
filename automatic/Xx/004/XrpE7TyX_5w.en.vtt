00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 this 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.100
 therefore we are with 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.640
 antonio hidalgo director of marketing of beijing 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.190
 and they are presenting something good is that their main course is the 3d cinema 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.689
 very convinced and lillo do not know vickie from the 3d the 3d to me I still do not 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.429
 if national technology will not close I will claim oppositely that if the priests 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.769
 but I think the gentleman is convincing 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.699
 then started a little more or use them we go to the people who 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.800
 are seeing why choose 3d cinema and not other technologies in third 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.810
 dimension 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.360
 good first of all, a hundred very much everyone and welcome to this 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.080
 genoa launch event 13 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.400
 It gives me great pleasure to hear that you are even starting to convince yourself because in reality 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.210
 The launch objective of the cti sinema 3d is to revolutionize the Mexican market 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.999
 on televisions 3d 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.770
 We are launching the first fli technology that he was or free of dizziness 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.050
 100% certified by a couple of North American institutions 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.430
 thanks to the technology of our ftr off impact lenses is vital 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.030
 the lenses do not really work as they used to work 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.700
 level open and close what generated the dizziness occupied today 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.939
 our lenses 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.359
 they will no longer make them dizzy and will make the 3D television experience 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.110
 infinitely better 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.390
 another comfort argument trying to convince you 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.780
 and many of the viewers who see us 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.940
 is the fact of the weight in the lenses last year the old technology 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.270
 conventional had lenses of almost 40 grams after a couple of hours 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.670
 it bothered the nose 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.390
 It bothered the vision 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.220
 nowadays the 3d cti cinema lenses weigh only 14 grams are the lenses 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 lighter than there are in the Mexican market 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.440
 p with its electronics on Enzo Simpson 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.690
 passive is not right the conventional 3d TV worked as I said 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.380
 a while ago 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.939
 Through the 'tugas' of the lenses the lenses had elements 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.160
 electronic inside is that it makes it very heavy the 3d cinema elqui lenses are 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.410
 composed basically of housing 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.560
 and of the vital patron pine what it is that together with television 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.699
 generate 13 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:18.039
 on average the 3d televisions of last year generated 80 mix or candela nico 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:23.699
 candela is the luminosity factor kiss inem a 3d doubles that brightness 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.549
 taking it up to 150 mix making 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.199
 the best 3d image a chevy 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.809
 with the best brightness 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:35.129
 all this accompanied by a fundamental factor that is that we are innovating 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.619
 also in the conversion of images from 2d to 3d 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:42.739
 some of the complaints that existed is that there were not enough content in 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:43.490
 3d 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.890
 the one that developed a new technology that converts contents from 12 to 13 that 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.359
 already existed last year 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.709
 but the improvement 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.349
 and the improvement through the depth fields the conversion of the cti is the 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.260
 unique that gives twenty fields of 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.069
 depth of conversion 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.620
 and ten fields of popotla in the images which makes 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.740
 that the image of three days is much more attractive I have a just 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.489
 last year's television 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.259
 of this same brand 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:15.939
 and I say tuna they cost me now these glasses that are launching between 70 and 90 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.529
 pesos instead of one thousand 502 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:22.959
 duato all bought me these lenses and that I have a screen 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.699
 as he the user knows 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.699
 what screen is compatible with these new lenses 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.849
 and it is important to mention first to avoid confusion with all 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:33.669
 your 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.909
 that are different technology last year's technology 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.489
 both mine and other competitors is a technology that we call activated 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.359
 of soto of classes that necessarily needs for the generation of 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.079
 3d images that kind of lenses 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.340
 with the new generation of 3d televisions in you but more 3d also 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.589
 we specifically need the lenses we're talking about the way 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.439
 know what is compatible with an expo looking for it on the internet where we 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.540
 we have focused 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.769
 to give the Mexican consumer a lot of information 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.099
 listening to their favorite store where they surely found a consultant from 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.980
 tri in the sales floor that can guide them better would seem to invite 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.160
 to your friends to see the football in your bel canto house imagine 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.870
 my house all your friends from the work of the high school you get expensive to give us spear 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.870
 each one and these will cost less than 100 pesos 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.990
 and if your friends and you are very affectionate and want to celebrate the goals 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.629
 embraced by the whole party 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.169
 then they can do it because if they do it like that they keep seeing in 3d what 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.759
 which is quite comfortable 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.930
 Well it does not bother you but this time cost us and creating 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.479
 the time I did like it but can be seeing any angle ilves he 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.349
 the 3d this view some animations and continued are 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.360
 committing the time that if you insist father appointment of this this 3 of it seems to me 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.800
 as cogobierno you say that it is a technology that solved 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.710
 Much of the problems that consumers had before 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.210
 and well, I hope you can convince yourself and also all the people that we 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.020
 they are watching because really 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.810
 the cis and 3d slogan is the new generation in 3d in egypt many are not good no 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.210
 we will be very soon to you, thank you very much for being with us and 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.600
