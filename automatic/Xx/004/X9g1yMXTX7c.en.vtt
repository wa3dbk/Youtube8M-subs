00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.790
 Brazilian market 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.280

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.990
 presented on the market already French 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.029
 this case is already in circulation is already 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 being sold already feel satisfied 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.859
 I hope the person did not commit the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.769
 error 208 and committed 17 the person in 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.740
 truth has launched 207 in brazil that is the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.529
 owner was stayed 206 and mail not 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.780
 reached 207 207 another platform in the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.480
 France was a more spacious car more 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.399
 beautiful and 207 did not have the slightest success in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.559
 the Brazilian market because people 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.710
 bought from 1 260 but I'm winning 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.360
 so little for a new car now this 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.600
 I already change completely safe here. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.309
 I have a frame for ismar want time 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.730
 so do not even know how to make a scene that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.420
 actually entered here a screen one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.000
 sound system is a screen a screen 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.530
 which is not only important is not only 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.470
 important is a screen that has the smallest 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.540
 You with you, you sail. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.700
 of buttons is not a car 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.740
 also high sophistication for the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.100
 European market is a car of wide 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.350
 beautiful accessibility inside really 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.400
 have great taste, followed in the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 black piano 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.100
 You did not invent the wheel, you see. 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 which is a speed of up to 210 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.170
 kilometers here have 1.6 engines here in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.079
 European market has 1.6 engine and engine 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.590
 1.4 in several engine versions with 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.939
 cavalry average 126 hp is 140 hps 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.710
 You are seeing here the the tellers. 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.020
 water temperature and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.250
 gasoline all very visible here the good 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.110
 in view at the driver's angle of vision 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.720
 good internal finish and if you have a ceiling 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.159
 and I also liked that I hope that 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.560
 the person doing it as the frame 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.549
 now show the outside lines of the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 car 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.200
 we are there showing a white pixar 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.409
 who had a broader view of the rooster 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.819
 for you and that harmony one 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.790
 great harmony on the lines 206 206 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.550
 French is being presented in 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.190
 Geneva 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.810
 this car made by pj france and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.910
 you see you are really the face of a 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.280
 design pretty much a car of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.010
 soft lines with the personality a 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.780
 little more traditional still the shame and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.730
 Let's have here what language I am. 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 meeting here childhood, we will see here the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:39.700
 fans is exposed model 208 from 16 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.750
 thousand Swiss francs that will go around 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.040
 15 thousand euros or so or the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.820
 options here have many good options here 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.070
 not knowing, it's not giving 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.590
 1.6 with 115 hp almost I got it right 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.260
 In the cavalry I spoke 120mm I doubted 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.460
 this 1.6 engine is the same engine 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.890
 of the person is that it is also 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.690
 models out there in Brazil as the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.000
 own 207 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.450
 Like I said the person who needs it. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.620
 urgently of a success 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.989
 in the Brazilian market 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.330
 the person will not survive in Brazil if 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.650
 do not have carlos successful for 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.720
 while she has no successful cases 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.170
 She has Carlos who has a good acceptance. 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.989
 she has a trustworthy png color a design 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.280
 Beautiful 305 306 is a beautiful car now 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.230
 here you are seeing badly as the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.950
 French, a lecture, right? 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.989
 a variety of models 208 all 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.780
 very inaccurate design 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.870
 the design is one of the attraction points years 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.820
 the person's sensual now if that 208 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.680
 successful Brazilian market and if it is 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.709
 kept at least a bit of character 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.720
 it from the character of the French car to 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.630
 person can really have a success . 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.709
 sales and the suffocation that she 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.709
 is in the Brazilian market
