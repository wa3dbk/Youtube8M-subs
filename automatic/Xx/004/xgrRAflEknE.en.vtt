00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.490
 hello to everyone in this new video the 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.400
 pupa in the academy we talk about one 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.679
 nail filings before seeing 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.360
 just like the right procedure for 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:20.289
 file your nails, I'll show you quickly 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.570
 what are the lim in pupa range then 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.179
 the lines that we propose funny start 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.890
 from the first which is the Levitan soul who 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.950
 so this one but it's like it 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.230
 let's say the buffer just for those who don't 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.120
 he knows the smoothing brick 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.430
 precisely how long is the buffer used in 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.210
 this way then to smooth the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.280
 nail surface behind it 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.649
 there the same there but back to the part 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.989
 of the West that this is used as 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.090
 how to use the note the part of 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.340
 peter always on the surface 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.580
 of the nail after it has been polished 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:10.290
 polish it to make it exactly 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.970
 homogeneous this file is very very good 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.340
 even for men not only for the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.850
 women because in fact in the manicure yes 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.560
 tents after making the sleeve for the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.360
 women obviously to put enamel for 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 men do not and therefore tend to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.619
 smooth the nail and polish it and then 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.010
 this very good also for this purpose 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.770
 then we have the classic cardboard 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.110
 which in any case has enough grain 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.740
 fine and therefore not aggressive for 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.899
 the natural pearls behind we have precisely 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.180
 the defining phase with a longer grain 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:51.930
 light serving to finish the la 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.860
 filings and finally we have the line in 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.910
 glass that is what I prefer 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.350
 be careful not to drop it 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.810
 because it has already happened 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.890
 and indeed it is very delicate it could 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.450
 break 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.040
 however what it is anyway 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.220
 I prefer because it has a race really 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.260
 very fine that results precisely for 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.959
 nothing aggressive on the nails 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.910
 then obviously if I used it a lot 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.600
 this can also be worth the tiring 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.270
 the enamel is serious but swipes though 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.010
 then once he leaves the shares 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.810
 go over the nails as if it were 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.760
 just bought 15 has a duration 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.130
 higher than the classic remaining 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.440
 cardboard however being the one 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.360
 I prefer I will show you now the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.360
 filings precisely with this soul 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:47.980
 let's see how it's done exactly like it 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:51.920
 file your nails then what I want 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.790
 tell you what you should not do or when 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.230
 you file your nails let's say it 's the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.790
 most people who siri 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.310
 hand nails nails in this way 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.900
 here is very wrong I tell you 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.030
 precisely because of experience because I have it 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.440
 studied I do it from work than this 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.510
 it is a wrong method for filing 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.290
 make the long nails you in Limano 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.060
 this way or in a single verse 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.920
 that's because if we file nails 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.319
 back and forth this way there 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.269
 we ask for warmth with rubbing and 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.629
 long will wait to fall apart if instead 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.879
 in this way we file the 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.310
 movement and fast in a single sense that 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.459
 you don't create this heat so it's a lot 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.120
 less aggressive taste way filings 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.190
 therefore another is called in this sense 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.379
 what to see if your nails 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.000
 that is, I already have them already 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.639
 practically file your nails though 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.019
 I want to show you how to file 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.599
 fingernails so are the errors that do not 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.489
 therefore you must commit after having 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.639
 file your nails in this way 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.609
 so you always have one verse 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.829
 file straight you look at them second 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.049
 these a tip here is why 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.780
 confirm to see if they are 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.970
 really straight you have to turn them and 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.639
 look at them you have to put it there 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.379
 hand straight in front of you and look at me 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.690
 nor do you think he looks at it from above 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.970
 so as if you had that front and 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.880
 check whether the row of nails and 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.010
 all straight if you don't 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.930
 I should file them a little in this sense 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.760
 match them because that's how we do 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.760
 let's see if the nails really are 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.060
 straight for example looking at me 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.070
 I see that here this nail from this 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:42.520
 slightly higher part then what 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:44.830
 I make the draw this way ok 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.199
 after that after filing then 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.110
 we could have done the form 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.930
 we wished we had nails 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.690
 straight we can dedicate ourselves to the side 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.449
 when cutting your nails a little bit 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.449
 when the nails grow, they could 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.699
 repeat a little then a scoop 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.470
 bit wider in the tip to prevent it 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.180
 this happens 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:15.069
 we must file a little and side in 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:17.919
 this way we position ourselves at a 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:20.470
 moment so a little as you see oblique 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.289
 not straight this way if we launch 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:30.550
 long after having done just that 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:32.770
 which nails we can suitable go to 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.340
 we will wait for angles in the corners 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.340
 this way 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.480
 ok so these are correct 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.430
 passages but filings of India 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.200
 I hope my advice is right 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.390
 may be useful to you than the 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.980
 any procedure was clear 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.990
 question you have you can do it 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.070
 quietly under the video I will 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.810
 I will definitely answer then I send 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.170
 a kiss and I'll wait for the next one 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.170
 Hello
