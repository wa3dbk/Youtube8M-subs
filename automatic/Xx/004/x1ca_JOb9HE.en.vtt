00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello welcome to hardware advice this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.340
 video the update it 1400 euro gaming 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.969
 computers july 2014 as cpu of the intel 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.000
 core i7 4097 came with 4 times 3 5 gigahertz 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.920
 he has a death of 4 4 8 ghz and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 80 watt tdp an integrated 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.210
 graphics unit has a bald took the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 is called airline free multiplier so 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.810
 free overclocking and hyperthreading that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.970
 means everyone can on 22 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.890
 he came as a theoretical eight 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.050
 very good for overclocking and is currently 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.520
 one of the best gaming processors and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 should be for gamer the next three to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.440
 five years thick enough because still too 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.980
 weak you can overclock him yes 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.559
 student of the thermalright 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 It is a very big one 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.340
 cooler for a very good price and with 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.469
 operate quietly or overclock the ass 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.070
 possible and that's going to be the gigabyte 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.629
 ghz 97 xo 3 h with the intel since 97 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.899
 chipset sp 3 s ata 343 ram brinke one 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.629
 2 connection pci express 3.0 a 10.1 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.690
 sound chip and the euro panel twice pace 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.990
 to vga dvi and hdmi for the integrated 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.439
 graphics unit four times usb 3 4 x usb 2 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.689
 a lan socket and 5 35 mm latches 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.580
 as well as that sounds for the sound chip as 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.240
 RAM eight gigabytes of cuddly 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.189
 ballistics sports ddr3 1600 and 10 19 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.450
 It is a fast afloat through it 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.180
 means one can in the dual channel mode 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.720
 operate and 8gb in time for gamers 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.270
 more than enough then ssd the 256 gb 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 cuddly mx 100 it 's a number 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.579
 fast ssd a little faster than that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.320
 cuddly m 500 and 256 gigabyte rich it 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.240
 for the operating system all programs 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.759
 and a few games then as a hard drive 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 the one terabyte winner desktop hdd it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.700
 is an above-average fast 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.380
 hard drive and a terabyte pay for 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.390
 most of you are enough 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 then as a graphics card the three gigabytes 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.240
 msi geforce gtx 580 gaming she became 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.119
 However, one overclocked one is strongly overclocked 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 the softest 87 de and with it you should 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.540
 all current games to the highest 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 Settings can play fluently 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.340
 There are also free watch talks 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.829
 in addition as power supply the 85 watt peak kwp 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.319
 Straight Power E9 It has 80 plus gold 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.490
 what does it mean is energy efficient it is 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.780
 modular what will 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.510
 The cables do not take off anymore 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.700
 needs and 480 watts 10 for the pc more 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.550
 as enough then a dvd burner of 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.390
 samsung and as housing the corsa kbc it 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.040
 200 m 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.990
 it is a little worse size with 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.670
 A lot of space in drinking but of course likely 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.290
 decide for yourself which one you take 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.240
 I want to thank you for watching 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.800
 I have however, failed when 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.360
 The video is older than two months 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.650
 ask the description schorndorf already 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.000
 in the respective link click 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.980
 this always leads to the newest 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.980
 version then until the next video
