00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
any cuts on there so unlikely they'll

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.110 
any cuts on there so unlikely they'll
get<00:00:58.920> 90<00:00:59.250> punctures<00:00:59.640> that'd<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> pretty

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120

impressive bit of kit but the closer you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.630 
impressive bit of kit but the closer you
look<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:31.380> impressive<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.979> gets<00:01:32.189> there

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
look the more impressive it gets there

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.109 
look the more impressive it gets there
is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> stem<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.960> every<00:01:34.409> millimeter

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
is a stem in here for every millimeter

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
is a stem in here for every millimeter
123<00:01:36.119> 122<00:01:36.990> 124<00:01:37.970> 126<00:01:38.970> car<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.079> under<00:01:40.200> 125<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
123 122 124 126 car for under 125 the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
123 122 124 126 car for under 125 the
guys<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.909> know<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> millimeter<00:01:43.170> about

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
guys here know to the millimeter about

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.990 
guys here know to the millimeter about
their<00:01:43.829> stem<00:01:44.040> length<00:01:44.220> I've<00:01:44.430> never<00:01:44.729> seen<00:01:44.909> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
their stem length I've never seen that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.179 
their stem length I've never seen that
before<00:01:45.290> I'm<00:01:46.290> seriously<00:01:46.649> impressed

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
before I'm seriously impressed

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.100 
before I'm seriously impressed
so<00:01:47.729> there's<00:01:47.909> 27<00:01:48.390> bite<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:48.930> that's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
so there's 27 bite in here that's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.109 
so there's 27 bite in here that's
obviously<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.860> race<00:01:50.070> bike<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.579> two<00:01:50.759> spares

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
obviously one race bike and two spares

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
obviously one race bike and two spares
for<00:01:51.360> each<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> riders<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:53.250> are<00:01:53.369> no

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
for each of the riders but there are no

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.069 
for each of the riders but there are no
TT<00:01:53.820> bikes<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.210> there<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.420> you've<00:01:54.509> noticed<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
TT bikes in there as you've noticed and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780 
TT bikes in there as you've noticed and
there's<00:01:55.200> nothing<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> cobbled<00:01:56.310> stages

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
there's nothing for the cobbled stages

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.120 
there's nothing for the cobbled stages
so<00:01:57.090> there's<00:01:57.360> another<00:01:57.509> 18<00:01:57.990> TT<00:01:58.469> bikes<00:01:58.710> waiting

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
so there's another 18 TT bikes waiting

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.530 
so there's another 18 TT bikes waiting
back<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> service<00:01:59.850> course<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.390> can

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
back at the service course and they can

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.190 
back at the service course and they can
be<00:02:00.600> delivered

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
be delivered

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.929 
be delivered
purely<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.159> stage<00:02:02.460> then<00:02:02.700> it'd<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
purely for that stage then it'd have to

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.359 
purely for that stage then it'd have to
be<00:02:03.119> carried<00:02:03.719> around<00:02:03.780> France<00:02:04.200> equally<00:02:05.130> there

specifically now the other thing you

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.699 
specifically now the other thing you
might<00:02:12.810> notice<00:02:13.020> about<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.349> here

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
might notice about in here

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.440 
might notice about in here
it's<00:02:13.859> quite<00:02:14.010> cramped<00:02:14.280> right<00:02:14.489> now<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:15.090> us<00:02:15.239> in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
it's quite cramped right now with us in

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.360 
it's quite cramped right now with us in
here<00:02:15.629> as<00:02:15.719> well<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.530> actually<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.189> is<00:02:17.340> a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
here as well is that actually this is a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.099 
here as well is that actually this is a
really<00:02:17.609> spacious<00:02:17.909> truck<00:02:18.390> there<00:02:18.689> are<00:02:18.780> no<00:02:18.959> other

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
really spacious truck there are no other

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.050 
really spacious truck there are no other
teams<00:02:19.439> really<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.189> to<00:02:20.430> work<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.969> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
teams really that get to work on the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.550 
teams really that get to work on the
bikes<00:02:21.269> inside<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.989> truck<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.439> that's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
bikes inside the truck and that's

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.809 
bikes inside the truck and that's
because<00:02:22.829> there's<00:02:23.219> a<00:02:23.280> seriously<00:02:23.760> cool

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
because there's a seriously cool

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.300 
because there's a seriously cool
space-saving<00:02:24.599> measure<00:02:24.959> where<00:02:25.439> both<00:02:25.650> sides<00:02:25.950> of

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
space-saving measure where both sides of

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.740 
space-saving measure where both sides of
the<00:02:26.459> truck<00:02:26.670> actually<00:02:26.849> move<00:02:27.299> outwards

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the truck actually move outwards

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.110 
the truck actually move outwards
allowing<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.620> mechanics<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.129> work<00:02:29.250> inside<00:02:29.730> in

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
allowing the mechanics to work inside in

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.839 
allowing the mechanics to work inside in
the<00:02:30.420> dry<00:02:30.659> no<00:02:31.290> matter<00:02:31.469> what<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:32.069> weather<00:02:32.219> so

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
the dry no matter what the weather so

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.399 
the dry no matter what the weather so
they<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.299> either<00:02:33.389> have<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.629> heater<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.959> or<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
they can either have a heater on or the

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.009 
they can either have a heater on or the
aircon<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.549> potentially<00:02:36.239> these<00:02:36.510> guys<00:02:36.719> were

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
aircon on so potentially these guys were

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.929 
aircon on so potentially these guys were
out<00:02:37.319> here<00:02:37.349> for<00:02:37.709> much<00:02:37.889> longer<00:02:38.099> taking<00:02:38.819> their

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
out here for much longer taking their

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.059 
out here for much longer taking their
time<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.540> comfort<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.769> back<00:02:40.889> here

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
time and in comfort now just back here

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.830 
time and in comfort now just back here
in<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.219> final<00:02:41.670> corner<00:02:41.969> one<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.659> things

in the final corner one of the things

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.209 
in the final corner one of the things
caught<00:02:42.989> our<00:02:43.109> attention<00:02:43.139> is<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.769> stack<00:02:44.040> of

selection for any eventualities finally
as<00:02:49.079> well<00:02:49.200> we've<00:02:49.439> got<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> air<00:02:49.769> compressor<00:02:50.400> so

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
as well we've got the air compressor so

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.729 
as well we've got the air compressor so
that<00:02:51.480> there's<00:02:51.659> 90<00:02:51.989> tubulars<00:02:52.409> they<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
that there's 90 tubulars they have to

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.379 
that there's 90 tubulars they have to
get<00:02:52.829> pumped<00:02:53.010> up<00:02:53.159> by<00:02:53.310> hand<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:53.879> that<00:02:53.939> is<00:02:54.209> only

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
get pumped up by hand but that is only

get pumped up by hand but that is only
part<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.019> come<00:02:55.859> on<00:02:55.950> around<00:02:56.069> follow<00:02:56.459> me<00:02:56.639> now

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
part of it come on around follow me now

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.640 
part of it come on around follow me now
it<00:02:57.120> never<00:02:57.239> escapes<00:02:57.659> our<00:02:57.810> attention<00:02:58.260> that

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
it never escapes our attention that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.319 
it never escapes our attention that
cleanliness<00:02:58.889> seems<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.549> be<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.639> big<00:02:59.879> thing<00:03:00.150> with

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
cleanliness seems to be a big thing with
