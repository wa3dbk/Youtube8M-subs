annoying i think that you know the
longer<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.720> takes<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.990> kill<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.409> takes<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
longer it takes to kill it takes a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.990 
longer it takes to kill it takes a
little<00:01:52.740> bit<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:53.009> skill<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:53.850> time

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
little bit more skill you have more time

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.130 
little bit more skill you have more time
to<00:01:54.149> turn<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.420> people<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.720> stuff<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.079> that

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to turn on people and stuff like that

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.539 
to turn on people and stuff like that
because<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.369> being

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
because you know it's kind of being

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.709 
because you know it's kind of being
really<00:01:56.700> new<00:01:56.909> friendly<00:01:57.299> when<00:01:57.390> you're<00:01:57.509> able<00:01:57.570> to

way<00:02:02.549> easier<00:02:02.880> i<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> weird<00:02:03.479> way<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
way easier i know it's a weird way of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.030

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
noses but either way i do think that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.630 
noses but either way i do think that
