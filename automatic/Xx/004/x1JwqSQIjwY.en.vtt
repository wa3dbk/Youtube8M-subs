00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 I would suggest switched times 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:11.550
 our brains on now almost comes 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.929
 every proven alternative and 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.680
 Welcome to a study that became 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.880
 Today's topic is our heaters 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.109
 and I know that sounds like the one or the other 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.710
 others hypocritical because mine 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.060
 but by advertising revenue lives but 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 I could say more about that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.519
 purchase 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 There are also creative applications 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.059
 still if someone still rarely me 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.739
 is a good example who entertains and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.600
 The technique of sa tours even if he 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.020
 me to a very specific but man 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.040
 on youtube I could say as apropos 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.820
 maybe finally for the slogan 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.910
 decide 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.989
 stinginess is cool, we hate tor as expensive 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.370
 Go to gate 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.649
 another example of entertaining 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.879
 Promotion of japanese woman there are so few 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.870
 Japanese advertising in this way 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.829
 I asked again 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.829
 entertainment is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.430
 you are yours or will say that now 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.960
 is over the top but so are some 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.990
 really then there would be the residential 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.979
 dogs demon babies and demons what also 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 with outlets should 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.060
 new york but on the other side like 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 already said that is so strange that we 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.300
 on the other hand it is cool on ours 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.890
 tv advertising in germany always that 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.840
 same scheme once there would be the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.700
 so-called happy family art of advertising 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.440
 I believe the danger among others of 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 and valleys and various other products 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.930
 after tearing off 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:44.220
 I'm sorry but I have to go hear 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:47.430
 allowed me the young was always this 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.560
 Put on Berlin I understand that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.149
 sympathetic to come over but in the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.710
 Sometimes it seems easy 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.210
 just put then there is also one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.369
 some kind of advertising where someone is direct 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.240
 to the audience speaks and his products 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.979
 wants to bring 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.250
 yes, that is what prevents most 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.229
 Hello, you know that too 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.300
 Her head is so chosen that she 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.060
 completely freaking out and her wife 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.660
 airport so you buy right 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.240
 our pillow for 3,999 euros 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.640
 It does not contain Ornithological Lions 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.830
 cat house diamonds copper and that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.480
 main rainbow matter 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.459
 with these prerequisites, they are 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.840
 never wake up or need humor 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.490
 nobody from me of his own 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200
 Product convinces the only thing you can 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.150
 can be trusted nowadays are customer 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 reception and yes they come naturally 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.569
 Also capable of the product have tested it 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.040
 and suddenly stood 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.780
 but that we are still in front of me 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.730
 I also feel more confident when one 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.540
 General intelligence diverse customers 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.150
 must doubt 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.879
 how could I be should with 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.790
 white forehead of 3ds power switch 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.590
 is below right 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.790
 which was just what you say mine 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.439
 believe in the humanity nothing 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.840
 special and what else this kind of 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.840
 Everybody knows this picture 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.000
 only I have that so we there 100 pieces 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.560
 that it is fresh and damp 3d 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.690
 We can still do without a product with one 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.610
 but wiping away on the other 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.200
 I can understand side because somehow 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.250
 the product has to be presented here 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.100
 or just want it like that 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.020
 Japan determined that really well 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.090
 sell and that was not there at all 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.380
 boxy with another very specific 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.390
 I have a kind of advertising personally 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.100
 he does not even care about the glasses 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.840
 you could say my life changed 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.480
 similar could see and have in full hd 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.590
 I realized my wife is she has become 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.459
 disconnect that now since I am 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:45.140
 deeply unhappy okay it is good 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.610
 or yes, but I would if you 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.170
 says the own product would be cool then 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.430
 that is not clear but when you get up 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.200
 to approach other people and them for that 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.180
 asks then suddenly stands proudly 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.400
 The idea does not react anymore 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.280
 no one on it hey you already know one 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.550
 sheet singing well said that he was good 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.050
 runner company a lot of woman but the with 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.630
 distance the important the worst kind 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.299
 Application is more worth the food 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.250
 nist schistegal fast food goes away non 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.840
 food or other kind of food it always 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.489
 the same value the food in the 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.780
 Advertising makes you want to rainbow 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.269
 switch comes out with 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.820
 the reality looks a bit different 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.470
 out there is a really cool side 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.240
 called bruno 3,000 points 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.200
 the time so many products on the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.700
 a page is in the advertising 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.919
 spend some more time on the other side 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.240
 Reality looks the link to peace 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.860
 in the video description it looks you 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.180
 it is really crass on 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.560
 Finally, I want to say I have 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.419
 nothing against advertising provided you 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.800
 at least a little bit creative and 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.480
 me completely a wrong picture 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.919
 mediates so now would me 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.960
 interested in how you feel about the topic 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.780
 even a goal is there and for me 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.340

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.780
