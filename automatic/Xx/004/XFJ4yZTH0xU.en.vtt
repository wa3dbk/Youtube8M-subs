00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.779
 Good morning, youtube and facebook friend. 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.090
 dear students, everything good 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.310
 today we are going to talk about the issue of 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.770
 water crisis affecting the southeastern region 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.529
 mainly state of são paulo 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.690
 Good, how does this crisis work? 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.690
 rain for a year almost a year and 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.820
 we are living the worst 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.610
 history of the state of são paulo 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.739
 same as the possible net solutions 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.280
 some scientists some climatologists 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.559
 put the first is to play chloride salt 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.500
 sodium in the cloud is so that a 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.040
 cloud joins the other and forms rain 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.710
 this would be ideal but only works if the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.170
 clouds and aquino the cloud have no formation 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.339
 clouds in the process said act 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.430
 mainly in the region of 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.260
 until the coast to the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.000
 near coast of são paulo we still 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.460
 we have there is a concentration of clouds 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.690
 but they can not get past the barrier 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.420
 from the sea 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.830
 they are actually in the region of saints 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.020
 on the coast of São Paulo 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.090
 what would be a second alternative to take 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.829
 the world's largest aquifer 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.439
 Guarani aquifer is a reservoir 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.530
 groundwater below groundwater 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.899
 But this is not possible here in 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.880
 for example the aquifer 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.920
 Guarani if you can not put a pipe 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.740
 there and pull water in the middle of the rocks 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.960
 because it is porous it is like a sponge 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.479
 water when you take a sponge 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.999
 You squeeze it, it does not come out enough. 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.189
 the Guarani aquifer here in the 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:50.770
 region is the same process is 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.469
 is a sponge of water full of water but 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.299
 with restricted access in black stream 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.520
 where the Guaraní aquifer is more 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.399
 near the ground then there is how to put a 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.619
 pipe and get the water 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.630
 In fact the best beer in Brazil is the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.030
 mall that sits on black river 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.399
 because because the draft delai draft 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.380
 with the water of the Guarani aquifer is 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.790
 second city filled with water from the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.220
 aquifer in Paraguayan capital assumption 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.200
 are then targets of excellent 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.930
 quality that does not even require treatment 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.880
 so good that she 's okay, what's the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.560
 process that causes rain on 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.959
 regional 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.430
 in the south of Brazil and this rain is not 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:35.940
 pass to são paulo 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:38.280
 let's explain with maps follow in time 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.360
 in which the dinosaurs inhabited the earth 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.470
 and the sandy deserts of the Mesozoic era 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.440
 covered the region 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.640
 at the time when South America formed 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:55.130
 with africa one continent to america 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.130
 from the south separates from africa 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.960
 one through the cracks of the floor under the lava 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.990
 basaltic surpassing the sandy layers 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.170
 the lava hardens and forms rocks 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.170
 basaltic 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.890
 the climate changes and a strong class 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.470
 occurs in the region 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.290
 there is a thaw that causes erosion 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.010
 of the rocks and the outcropping of the layers 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.140
 the water becomes infiltrated and accumulates 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.170
 under the assault 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.420
 millions of years have passed in the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.190
 set of sandy layers and rocks 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.610
 fractured assault 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.500
 water is renewed forming the system 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.610
 guarani aquifer 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.830
 simply one of the largest 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.400
 reservoirs of underground water 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.770
 planet is a phenomenon that some 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.930
 climatologist who sells this year 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.290
 we are in 2014 entering the period 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.600
 of linen little boy personal is the increase 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.650
 given the temperature of the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.390
 pacific're 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.120
 that is all this region where the mouse 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.430
 travels and brings a lot of 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.980
 rain is passing through this region 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.310
 here where you 're barely going through ok 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.100
 or part of bolivia part of chile 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.050
 from argentina do paraguay of brazil 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.630
 The southern region of Brazil is being very 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.880
 affected how dry mass of air works 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.269
 the mass of dry air this red spine 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.840
 here it is very strong and prevents the 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.750
 mass of cold air with rain through the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.910
 mass of dry air ok the whole mass of air 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.620
 Cold, she comes from Argentina. 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.240
 Uruguay comes by the great southern river and goes 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.430
 going up to get to são paulo 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.710
 but here in Sao Paulo has this mass of 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.650
 dry and hot air that prevents the formation 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.810
 of rain clouds 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.979
 we are on the paraná river on top of 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.260
 friendship bridge 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.990
 on this side to the Paraguayan city in this 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.210
 on this other side the mouth of the iguaçu brazil 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.590
 I'm here on the lumbar hill and 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.229
 county of asunción 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.270
 It's hard to get people here but a place. 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.460
 very beautiful with a privileged view 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.270
 it's worth this is the river flood 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.220
 Paraguay 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.220
 see only the neighborhoods all enchanted 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.710
 the role of all that counts is only and 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.580
 not the Paraguayan river action as the 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.910
 waters are high and whole districts are not 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.730
 were engaged underwater 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.470
 the man who was explaining that this 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.540
 is the paraguay river in the middle has an island 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.880
 which is also submerged mostly 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:34.280
 her or that side here the river 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:38.830
 Paraguayan side also the Paraguayan in 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.830
 he is fast 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.600
 hence why it took a day and egypt 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.580
 more time but Argentina already hit her 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.400
 the antenna of harmony 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.400
 I talked about pomegranate in Andean victory 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.510
 the river full 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.990
 now is good time 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.489
 in this step 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.060
 we are here inside the riverbed 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.460
 piracicaba even just turned around followed a 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.810
 run Run 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:08.670
 here it is impossible for a partner to walk 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.670
 by boat at this time 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.900
 of a large river that passed here in 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.330
 2012 beginning of 2013 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.289
 turned only a trickle of water now into 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.289
 2014 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:46.580
 these are pictures of piracicaba sorocaba 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.580
 Where's the 2014 Cup? 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:53.340
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:57.350
 and explanatory and thank you very much more 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.350
 once and until the next opportunity
