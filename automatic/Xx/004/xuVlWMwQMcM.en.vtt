00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
languages which is very interesting I

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.860 
languages which is very interesting I
think<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.520> this<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:35.209> well<00:03:35.660> executed

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
think that this is a well executed

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.990 
think that this is a well executed
keyboard<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.860> think<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.640> something<00:03:37.970> that

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
keyboard I think this is something that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.490 
keyboard I think this is something that
people<00:03:38.270> are<00:03:38.420> really<00:03:38.630> gonna<00:03:38.780> enjoy<00:03:38.989> using<00:03:39.410> on

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
people are really gonna enjoy using on

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.370 
people are really gonna enjoy using on
their<00:03:39.620> devices<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.100> since<00:03:40.989> now<00:03:41.989> if<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.260> guys

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
their devices and since now if you guys

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.820

think this is gonna be really great for

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.430 
think this is gonna be really great for
you<00:03:47.060> because<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:47.390> can<00:03:47.540> still<00:03:47.750> one-hand<00:03:48.290> it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
you because you can still one-hand it

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.290 
you because you can still one-hand it
now<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.190> don't<00:03:49.459> know<00:03:49.700> how<00:03:49.820> well<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.180> gonna

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
now I don't know how well this is gonna

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.150 
now I don't know how well this is gonna
work<00:03:50.450> on<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.690> iPhone<00:03:50.989> 6<00:03:51.260> or<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.440> 6<00:03:51.709> plus<00:03:51.860> since

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
work on the iPhone 6 or the 6 plus since

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.890 
work on the iPhone 6 or the 6 plus since
I<00:03:52.280> don't<00:03:52.340> have<00:03:52.520> them<00:03:52.820> but<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.030> do<00:03:53.120> presume<00:03:53.600> since

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
I don't have them but I do presume since

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.510 
I don't have them but I do presume since
people<00:03:54.170> have<00:03:54.380> been<00:03:54.530> using<00:03:54.680> them<00:03:54.950> on<00:03:54.980> larger

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
people have been using them on larger

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.070 
people have been using them on larger
screen<00:03:55.790> Android<00:03:56.239> phones<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.690> quite<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.870> while

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
screen Android phones for quite a while

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.949 
screen Android phones for quite a while
and<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.860> did<00:03:58.040> use<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.430> my<00:03:58.610> 4.7<00:03:59.450> inch<00:03:59.600> Google

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
and I did use it on my 4.7 inch Google

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.530 
and I did use it on my 4.7 inch Google
Nexus<00:04:00.140> 4<00:04:00.590> just<00:04:01.190> fine<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.610> one<00:04:01.730> hand<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.300> did

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
Nexus 4 just fine in one hand and I did

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.420 
Nexus 4 just fine in one hand and I did
really<00:04:02.720> enjoy<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.230> experience<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.920> can

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
really enjoy the experience I can

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.920 
really enjoy the experience I can
understand<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.150> iPhone<00:04:05.270> 6<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.870> would

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
understand that on the iPhone 6 it would

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.380 
understand that on the iPhone 6 it would
probably<00:04:06.440> be<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.830> similar<00:04:07.550> experience<00:04:08.030> I'm<00:04:08.360> not

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
probably be a similar experience I'm not

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.150 
probably be a similar experience I'm not
entirely<00:04:08.780> sure<00:04:09.050> about<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.410> 6<00:04:09.620> plus<00:04:09.830> because<00:04:10.130> I

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
entirely sure about the 6 plus because I

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.190 
entirely sure about the 6 plus because I
haven't<00:04:10.489> tested<00:04:10.760> out<00:04:11.060> on<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.330> Galaxy<00:04:11.780> Note<00:04:11.959> or<00:04:12.140> a

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
haven't tested out on a Galaxy Note or a

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.920 
haven't tested out on a Galaxy Note or a
phone<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.680> size<00:04:13.239> previously<00:04:14.239> but<00:04:14.870> it

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
phone of that size previously but it

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.840 
phone of that size previously but it
really<00:04:15.170> does<00:04:15.410> depend<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.830> how<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.430> progresses

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
really does depend on how it progresses

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.020 
really does depend on how it progresses
and<00:04:17.120> how<00:04:17.209> people<00:04:17.480> decide<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.810> use<00:04:18.080> it

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
and how people decide to use it

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.879 
and how people decide to use it
I'm<00:04:19.420> a<00:04:19.540> really<00:04:19.750> big<00:04:19.870> fan<00:04:19.900> of<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:20.290> keyboard<00:04:20.500> I

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
I'm a really big fan of this keyboard I

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.000 
I'm a really big fan of this keyboard I
genuinely<00:04:21.600> do<00:04:22.600> enjoy<00:04:22.900> using<00:04:23.230> it<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.530> think<00:04:23.860> it's

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
genuinely do enjoy using it I think it's

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.629 
genuinely do enjoy using it I think it's
probably<00:04:24.780> one<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.990> nicest<00:04:26.380> things<00:04:26.740> that

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
probably one of the nicest things that

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.930 
probably one of the nicest things that
Apple<00:04:27.880> could<00:04:28.000> have<00:04:28.120> added<00:04:29.040> in<00:04:30.040> iOS<00:04:30.430> 8<00:04:30.610> there's

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
Apple could have added in iOS 8 there's

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.490 
Apple could have added in iOS 8 there's
a<00:04:31.000> lot<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.270> different<00:04:31.630> features<00:04:31.840> but<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.260> think

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
a lot of different features but I think

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.050 
a lot of different features but I think
this<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.740> one<00:04:32.980> of<00:04:33.100> those<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.280> revolutionary

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
this is one of those a revolutionary

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.250 
this is one of those a revolutionary
ones<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.450> is<00:04:34.540> really<00:04:34.750> going<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.930> allow<00:04:35.080> you

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
ones that is really going to allow you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.500 
ones that is really going to allow you
