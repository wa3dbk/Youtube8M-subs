00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.680 
is going to be very very good very
accurate<00:02:15.990> now<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.250> do<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:18.120> 30

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
accurate now I can do this with a 30

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.510 
accurate now I can do this with a 30
degree<00:02:18.840> angle<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.380> here<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> 22<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.459> half

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
degree angle on here or a 22 and a half

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.770 
degree angle on here or a 22 and a half
degree<00:02:20.940> angle<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.360> here

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
degree angle on here

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.570 
degree angle on here
I<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:22.260> make<00:02:22.380> one<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.800> these<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.069> whatever

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
I can make one of these with whatever

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.949 
I can make one of these with whatever
size<00:02:24.000> or<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.930> angle<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.470> want<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.510> what<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.540> use

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
size or or angle I want and what I use

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.010 
size or or angle I want and what I use
is<00:02:28.350> micro<00:02:29.220> jigs<00:02:29.520> zero<00:02:30.209> play<00:02:30.480> miter<00:02:30.750> bar

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
is micro jigs zero play miter bar

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.449 
is micro jigs zero play miter bar
mounted<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> backside

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
mounted to the backside

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.479 
mounted to the backside
I<00:02:32.489> like<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.270> zero<00:02:33.510> play<00:02:33.810> because<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.980> short

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
I like the zero play because it's short

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.420 
I like the zero play because it's short
enough<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.480> fits<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> small<00:02:38.160> jig

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
enough that it fits on on a small jig

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.720 
enough that it fits on on a small jig
like<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:39.020> it's<00:02:40.020> two<00:02:40.290> pieces<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:41.040> move<00:02:41.370> in

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
like this it's two pieces that move in

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.059 
like this it's two pieces that move in
opposition<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.840> each<00:02:42.870> other<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:43.860> it

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
opposition to each other so that it

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.920 
opposition to each other so that it
going<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.340> adjusted<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.910> exactly<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
going to be adjusted to exactly the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.870 
going to be adjusted to exactly the
width<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.230> my<00:02:46.290> miter<00:02:46.590> slot<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.489> when<00:02:47.760> it's

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
width of my miter slot so when it's

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.080 
width of my miter slot so when it's
adjusted<00:02:48.360> properly<00:02:48.709> there's<00:02:49.910> absolutely<00:02:50.910> no

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
adjusted properly there's absolutely no

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.420 
adjusted properly there's absolutely no
side-to-side<00:02:51.510> play<00:02:52.019> here<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:53.160> always

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
side-to-side play here so it's always

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.220 
side-to-side play here so it's always
going<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:53.970> very<00:02:54.090> very<00:02:54.510> accurate

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
going to be very very accurate

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.160 
going to be very very accurate
I've<00:02:55.320> got<00:02:56.010> about<00:02:56.269> five<00:02:57.269> inches<00:02:57.720> five<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.140> a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
I've got about five inches five and a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.470 
I've got about five inches five and a
quarter<00:02:58.440> inches<00:02:58.709> from<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.370> disc<00:02:59.670> to<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
quarter inches from the disc to the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.170 
quarter inches from the disc to the
center<00:03:00.840> line<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.050> my<00:03:01.350> miter<00:03:01.590> slot<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.760> I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
center line of my miter slot so I

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.120 
center line of my miter slot so I
allowed<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.200> about<00:03:04.530> an<00:03:04.680> eighth<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.950> an<00:03:05.040> inch

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
allowed for about an eighth of an inch

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.190 
allowed for about an eighth of an inch
so<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.580> don't<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:05.880> any<00:03:05.940> rubbing<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.630> then

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
so that I don't get any rubbing and then

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140 
so that I don't get any rubbing and then
it's<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.590> three<00:03:07.830> holes<00:03:08.069> drilled<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.850> counter

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
it's just three holes drilled in counter

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.770 
it's just three holes drilled in counter
board<00:03:09.360> through<00:03:10.340> four<00:03:11.340> inches<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:11.819> center<00:03:12.239> now

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
board through four inches on center now

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.290
