00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.079
 all good 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.849
 friends welcome to berto blogs his productions my name because no 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.849
 thing and you can locate the addresses that appear on your screens 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.490
 then 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.890
 I'm going to talk about this issue 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.689
 sa alto saxophonist and maja 23 is the famous 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.180
 other than 23 that are recommended to students in so many forums 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.520
 well in 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.310
 different languages ​​in various parts of the world this instrument is what the 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.030
 subject is spoken as to level u students 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.880
 this copy is courtesy of money not 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.450
 this veto that we send greetings 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.329
 this instrument 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.929
 it is in conservation conditions because quite acceptable that some 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.230
 stallone ciic web and things because of the fuzzy time that tufo got 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.440
 already second-hand 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.760
 here you can see them I show them 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.110
 its an instrument 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.360
 that despite being 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.150
 this a basic model of low range of the company maja 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
 they have put many features 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.420
 in an instrument quite good enough to start playing 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.290
 this the saxophone 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 It is characterized by two things mainly 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.620
 one for having a perfect tuning the second 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.870
 for having a ring with a very similar day accepted to put high-end 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.170
 how are the warehouses 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.720
 if you have seen the other windy videos where we talk about kind of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.090
 Nozzles with both these celebrities and others are linked with a 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.680
 saxophone selman xix 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.950
 of 1935 can say about whether this supposes 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.580
 so they can see that it is a high-end instrument 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.490
 in the case of edesur saxophone this one would not like some examples with him 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.010
 to see how you can do enough of the effects that this is 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.650
 they manage to make with an expensive instrument 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.020
 because with this call we can go practicing 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.420
 we clarify that we have an end nozzle in this case is a 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.390
 Pickler brand nozzle 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.549
 number 7 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.510
 what is this vogue number that I use and the mouthpiece I also passed 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.760
 quite a lot of work is what I have been telling you as long as you are like 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.239
 we with low-range should try to bring a mouthpiece 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.290
 well china 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.739
 so that some focus some way we can elevate 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.760
 this the city founded from the instrument when playing 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.469
 see for example percent in issues of harmonics like this 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.469
 Flame goes beyond being a student model responds to perfection 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 even notes as high as the 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.569
 in reality e4 student who has access to a mass 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.799
 is quite lucky because they are instruments that 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.339
 despite not disbursing so much money when they buy second-hand 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.079
 Well, and to whom the security of which they are touching 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.479
 in a team that will serve them later to give the jump a 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:05.749
 finest instrument 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:11.219
 in essence that is the one of maja model 23 that they can also buy like this the 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.189
 maja 21 its acronyms are and came to that 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.179
 what does yamaha lack saxophone 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.340
 and the model 23 21 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.299
 this to the models 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.299
 d of this same principle of design already discontinued from yamasá but continues 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.060
 manufacturing 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.790
 and that saxophone since they get most of the stores with requests for 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.239
 the pestle whether they buy it on request or they are on display 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.690
 I clarify that I am saxophones in the United States can be more expensive than 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:39.579
 What are they 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.200
 percent in Latin American countries since like these they are also united 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.039
 manufactures his own acts you put then 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.999
 they raise the tariff a little 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:48.809
 Now this 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:53.519
 will oscillate approximately new between the thousand 500 dollars and one thousand 600 dollars 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.729
 in United States 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.699
 ekáizer smothered and stores where you can and the saxophone up 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.939
 haim prices of 8 thousand nine thousand pesos and if they buy them used they can run with 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.110
 lucky to buy it up to about three thousand 4 thousand pesos or even less 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.670
 it depends on who sells them and how lucky we are to acquire 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.559
 instruments 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:15.619
 I wish him the best is of the luck I repeat, it was located and he stopped me 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.359
 copies in the direction that looks like their screens 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.210
 we recommend you to continue reading the virtuoso blog there are always things 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.349
 important and interesting to learn 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.529
