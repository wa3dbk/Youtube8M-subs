I<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> push<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.830> thing<00:02:19.980> and

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
I you know I push the thing and

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.430 
I you know I push the thing and
everything<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.270> like<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.540> stand<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
everything and so like I stand up and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.820 
everything and so like I stand up and
like<00:02:22.940> I'm<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.000> ouch<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.020> hurts<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.590> badly

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.010 
like I'm like ouch this hurts so badly
and<00:02:26.250> then<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.879> figure<00:02:27.180> out<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:27.810> wasn't

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
and then I figure out that it wasn't

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.930 
and then I figure out that it wasn't
fully<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.920> like<00:02:29.069> part<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.459> tampon<00:02:29.790> was

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
fully in so like part of the tampon was

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.059 
fully in so like part of the tampon was
sticking<00:02:30.150> out<00:02:30.360> that's<00:02:30.629> why<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.780> hurt<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.069> take

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
sticking out that's why it hurt so take

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.559 
sticking out that's why it hurt so take
it<00:02:32.190> out<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.580> try<00:02:32.760> again<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.510> time

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
it out and I try again and this time

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.259 
it out and I try again and this time
like<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.080> doesn't<00:02:34.349> hurt<00:02:34.440> going<00:02:34.769> in<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:36.000> it

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
like it doesn't hurt going in but it

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.910 
like it doesn't hurt going in but it
feels<00:02:36.480> uncomfortable<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.410> stand<00:02:37.739> up

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
feels uncomfortable like when I stand up

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.330 
feels uncomfortable like when I stand up
and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:39.060> discovered<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.440> know<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.890> didn't

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
and I discovered that you know I didn't

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.360 
and I discovered that you know I didn't
really<00:02:41.750> do<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.900> right<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.260> also<00:02:43.739> when<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.069> like

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
really do it right and also when I like

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.890 
really do it right and also when I like
push<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.209> kind<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.450> feels<00:02:45.660> like<00:02:45.690> I'm

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
push it in it kind of feels like I'm

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.940 
push it in it kind of feels like I'm
getting<00:02:46.050> cramps<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.099> kinda<00:02:47.340> hurts<00:02:47.840> like

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
getting cramps like it kinda hurts like

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.040 
getting cramps like it kinda hurts like
it<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.190> feels<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.580> I'm<00:02:50.760> getting<00:02:50.849> cramps<00:02:51.239> so

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
it just feels like I'm getting cramps so

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.839 
it just feels like I'm getting cramps so
I<00:02:52.500> guess<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:52.920> wasn't<00:02:53.129> doing<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.430> right<00:02:53.700> either

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
I guess I wasn't doing that right either

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.850 
I guess I wasn't doing that right either
and<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.720> I'm<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.110> should<00:02:55.319> Google<00:02:55.709> this
