00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.540
 project where you try to link what 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.280
 it's the passion for soccer with my other 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.040

 the visits every so often of some 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.950
 equipment but thought through 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.330
 this that effectively becomes 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.060
 a sort of stadium inside 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.890
 coyhaique like to see football from afar 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.250
