00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
we are ok this is from last weekend when

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.360 
we are ok this is from last weekend when
give<00:00:58.960> me<00:00:59.050> three<00:00:59.260> times<00:00:59.440> when<00:00:59.680> we<00:00:59.770> were<00:00:59.920> working

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
give me three times when we were working

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.730 
give me three times when we were working
on<00:01:00.580> changing<00:01:00.640> out<00:01:01.240> the<00:01:01.270> airlock<00:01:02.110> hatch<00:01:02.410> window

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
on changing out the airlock hatch window

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.920 
on changing out the airlock hatch window
we<00:01:03.400> had<00:01:03.520> time<00:01:03.700> to<00:01:03.850> do<00:01:03.970> a<00:01:04.000> little<00:01:04.210> saturday

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
we had time to do a little saturday

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.840 
we had time to do a little saturday
morning<00:01:05.230> science<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.980> i<00:01:06.280> thought<00:01:06.460> i'd<00:01:06.640> share

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
morning science and i thought i'd share

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.730 
morning science and i thought i'd share
that<00:01:07.060> with<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:07.330> folks<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:09.130> subject<00:01:09.940> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that with you folks and this subject is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.710 
that with you folks and this subject is
working<00:01:11.740> with<00:01:11.920> stretched<00:01:12.700> thin<00:01:13.030> films<00:01:13.479> of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
working with stretched thin films of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.010 
working with stretched thin films of
water<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:16.270> we<00:01:16.420> have<00:01:16.660> here<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:18.220> baggie

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
water and what we have here is a baggie

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.810 
water and what we have here is a baggie
which<00:01:20.020> makes<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.410> nice<00:01:20.590> two<00:01:21.220> dimensional

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
which makes a nice two dimensional

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.719 
which makes a nice two dimensional
beeper<00:01:22.060> for<00:01:22.479> use<00:01:22.690> in<00:01:22.960> zero<00:01:23.320> gravity<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.520> here

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
beeper for use in zero gravity and here

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.230 
beeper for use in zero gravity and here
i'm<00:01:24.850> filling<00:01:25.750> up<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:26.110> small<00:01:26.650> Ziploc<00:01:27.550> up<00:01:27.850> with

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
i'm filling up a small Ziploc up with

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.640 
i'm filling up a small Ziploc up with
water<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.740> makes<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:30.040> real<00:01:30.220> handy<00:01:30.910> way<00:01:31.479> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
water and it makes a real handy way to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.980 
water and it makes a real handy way to
handle<00:01:32.650> an<00:01:33.070> open<00:01:33.400> container<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.970> water<00:01:34.240> and

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
handle an open container of water and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.590 
handle an open container of water and
it's<00:01:35.110> basically<00:01:35.470> two<00:01:35.770> dimensional<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:37.420> there

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
it's basically two dimensional and there

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.240 
it's basically two dimensional and there
you<00:01:37.720> see<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.930> little<00:01:38.170> wire<00:01:38.320> loop<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:39.009> i<00:01:39.040> made

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
you see a little wire loop that i made

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.920 
you see a little wire loop that i made
from<00:01:39.460> stainless<00:01:39.670> steel<00:01:40.060> safety<00:01:40.330> wire<00:01:40.660> from

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
from stainless steel safety wire from

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.880 
from stainless steel safety wire from
the<00:01:40.990> carpet<00:01:41.440> back<00:01:41.590> yet<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:43.230> and<00:01:44.230> that's<00:01:44.650> just

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the carpet back yet and and that's just

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.190 
the carpet back yet and and that's just
our<00:01:45.210> deionized<00:01:46.210> water<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.750> comes<00:01:46.900> from<00:01:47.110> the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
our deionized water that comes from the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.610 
our deionized water that comes from the
SF<00:01:47.560> back<00:01:47.800> off<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.810> i'm<00:01:49.930> going<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.170> stick

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
SF back off and so i'm going to stick

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.220 
SF back off and so i'm going to stick
this<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:51.340> wire<00:01:51.610> loop<00:01:51.970> in<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.570> baggie<00:01:52.810> and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
this a wire loop in the baggie and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.720 
this a wire loop in the baggie and
there's<00:01:53.440> no<00:01:53.620> soap<00:01:53.920> already<00:01:54.220> made<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.610> that

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
there's no soap already made in that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.300 
there's no soap already made in that
water<00:01:55.180> just<00:01:55.690> it's<00:01:56.050> just<00:01:56.170> our<00:01:56.440> peer<00:01:56.920> group<00:01:57.130> of

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
water just it's just our peer group of

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.649 
water just it's just our peer group of
water<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:59.200> pull<00:01:59.530> the<00:02:00.310> wire<00:02:01.180> loop<00:02:01.450> out

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
water and you pull the wire loop out

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.940 
water and you pull the wire loop out
from<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.990> baggie<00:02:02.200> which<00:02:02.560> makes<00:02:02.800> that

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
from the baggie which makes that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.980 
from the baggie which makes that
two-dimensional<00:02:03.250> deeper<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.510> lo<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:04.840> behold

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
two-dimensional deeper and lo and behold

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.310 
two-dimensional deeper and lo and behold
you<00:02:05.409> have<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.420> stretched<00:02:07.420> thin<00:02:07.750> film<00:02:08.080> of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
you have a stretched thin film of

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.290 
you have a stretched thin film of
nothing<00:02:08.679> but<00:02:08.830> water<00:02:09.100> hagan<00:02:09.700> onto<00:02:09.970> your<00:02:10.090> loop

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
nothing but water hagan onto your loop

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.560 
nothing but water hagan onto your loop
and<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:11.500> it's<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.860> soap<00:02:12.190> film<00:02:12.550> only<00:02:13.060> it's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
and so it's like a soap film only it's

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.960 
and so it's like a soap film only it's
just<00:02:13.840> water<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.890> we've<00:02:15.430> never<00:02:15.459> seen

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
just water and and we've never seen

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.110 
just water and and we've never seen
anything<00:02:16.300> like<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.900> before<00:02:17.170> where<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.940> can

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
anything like this before where you can

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.900 
anything like this before where you can
make<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.959> thin<00:02:20.950> film<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:22.440> pure<00:02:23.440> water<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.100> it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
make a a thin film of pure water and it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.570 
make a a thin film of pure water and it
has<00:02:25.060> some<00:02:25.269> rather<00:02:25.900> unusual<00:02:26.140> properties<00:02:27.040> which

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
has some rather unusual properties which

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.930 
has some rather unusual properties which
all<00:02:28.060> you'll<00:02:28.299> see<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:30.100> in<00:02:30.430> it's

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
all you'll see here it's it's in it's

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.460 
all you'll see here it's it's in it's
about<00:02:31.209> half<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.510> thickness<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> wire

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
about half the thickness of the wire

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.100 
about half the thickness of the wire
after<00:02:33.280> 25<00:02:33.670> thousands<00:02:34.150> wires<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.780> puts

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
after 25 thousands wires so that puts

it's thick enough that it doesn't enter

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.460 
it's thick enough that it doesn't enter
it<00:02:42.030> doesn't<00:02:42.360> exhibit<00:02:42.689> the<00:02:42.900> interference

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
it doesn't exhibit the interference
