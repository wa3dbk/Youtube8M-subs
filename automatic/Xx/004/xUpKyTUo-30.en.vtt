00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.620
 2 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.030
 before stopping on this question 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:39.430
 tell how to dress up be chic and 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:42.070
 glamor it will be there anyway 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.730
 some cases that report in atipault 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.949
 lodge these lines usually when we 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.449
 wants to get dressed 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.510
 they do not always think about what 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:58.199
 we are going to thing that is normally 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.199
 either we do not know or we not neglect 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.020
 the tall and thin silhouette 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.680
 generally it's the ideal because it 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.680
 is tall 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.000
 if there is a balance between height and 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.000
 the width of the target 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.000
 when the silhouette is tall and strong 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.920
 we must refine the cuts 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.360
 when there are cutouts it is necessary that she 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.550
 either in length or diagonally 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.230
 the belts for example as 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.110
 accessory generally left in 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.450
 suggest belts 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.390
 in overtime like that finally to 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.520
 is not it the width of the size by 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.900
 relation to textures the tissues must 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.570
 to be average or too late not to do 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.580
 appear roundness neither too thick 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.950
 to not create a dictated control or 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.490
 well a righteousness at level 2 forms 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:03.320
 so means I will quote the sheets 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.659
 normally double- sided lace 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.920
 the pancakes so when there is a 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.970
 important size, it is important to avoid 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.660
 bright fabrics because it is a 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.660
 accentuate the effort 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.110
 when we say thin what she is 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.770
 really very fine so here the problem 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.140
 arises in the stature that is 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.040
 normally small that will have to be enlarged 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:40.000
 and thinness so it will fill 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.800
 cuts in general diagonally the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.210
 dad in relation to the fabric because she 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.920
 is thin so we can afford 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.690
 thick fabrics to give a little bit of 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.600
 volume 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.670
 the grounds so as I said if he has 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.380
 stripes of diagonal stripes 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.770
 because it's this I'm allowing the 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.870
 more balanced between width and the 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.970
 thicknesses then at the waist 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.680
 because small so usually 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.590
 people small detail it takes 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.170
 avoid contrasting belts 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.790
 that is to say of different color from 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.580
 that of the outfit because they cut 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.700
 the silhouette of so usually a 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.700
 girl and pension belt 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.470
 the third case is the case of the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.410
 little effort silhouette here again he 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.090
 have to balance between the size that is 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.780
 small and width that is important 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.970
 basically the couples they 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.380
 must be vertical in the direction of 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.190
 the length when there are scratches 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.440
 it's even better 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.150
 but behind girl because it's over 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.150
 and that lengthens the tissues must be 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.730
 medium or late so no brilliants at 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.489
 level of textures usually of 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.920
 matte fabrics not to expand to no 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.190
 not come out the roundnesses belt so much 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.510
 on obligatory time me is finished and he 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.680
 there's just a little tip that I 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.770
 would like to give women at the level of 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.290
 it's called repairing a fault when 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.790
 I have a thinness or a thickness 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.970
 somewhere you have to try to 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.260
 divert the view to a detail by 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.109
 example if I have small shoulders 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.889
 I try to work at the bottom 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.439
 they beaded belts 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.400
 embroider in a way that the eye by 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:32.099
 to the detail and goes away from the detail that 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.599
 is a tenth 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:39.189
 that's the basic rule for 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:42.629
 normally repaired defects in the 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:46.060
 typology and to be classy chic so 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:48.219
 you have to define the defect is thought to the 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.139
 solution because if we do not define 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.139
 the defect we will never thought of you
