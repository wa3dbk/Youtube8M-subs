here myself so as you say there's some

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.679 
here myself so as you say there's some
similarity<00:00:30.640> 15<00:00:30.939> American<00:00:31.300> football<00:00:31.509> and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
similarity 15 American football and

similarity 15 American football and
rugby<00:00:32.110> let's<00:00:32.739> just<00:00:33.040> check<00:00:33.250> your

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
rugby let's just check your

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.580 
rugby let's just check your
understanding<00:00:33.640> at<00:00:33.969> a<00:00:34.030> couple<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.360> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
understanding at a couple of the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.450 
understanding at a couple of the
terminology<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:37.120> first<00:00:37.450> off<00:00:37.660> handoff<00:00:38.650> what

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
terminology so first off handoff what

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.000 
terminology so first off handoff what
that<00:00:39.670> means

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that means

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.060 
that means
handoff<00:00:43.000> I'm<00:00:43.780> just<00:00:44.020> gonna<00:00:44.170> go<00:00:44.740> out<00:00:44.860> on<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.010> limb

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
handoff I'm just gonna go out on a limb

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.860 
handoff I'm just gonna go out on a limb
and<00:00:45.370> say<00:00:45.430> when<00:00:45.880> there's<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.180> scrum<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.750> they

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
and say when there's a scrum and they

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.420 
and say when there's a scrum and they
throw<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.530> behind<00:00:47.590> themselves<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:48.190> think<00:00:48.370> a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
throw it behind themselves I think a

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.190 
throw it behind themselves I think a
handoff<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:48.940> I<00:00:51.300> suppose<00:00:52.300> is<00:00:52.720> that<00:00:52.900> one<00:00:53.020> you're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
handoff is I suppose is that one you're

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.569 
handoff is I suppose is that one you're
a<00:00:53.230> scrum<00:00:53.740> and<00:00:53.950> you<00:00:54.040> get<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.280> ball<00:00:54.430> between

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
a scrum and you get the ball between

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.540 
a scrum and you get the ball between
what<00:00:55.000> does<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.180> handoff<00:00:55.620> stifling<00:00:56.620> that's<00:00:57.489> a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
what does the handoff stifling that's a

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.440 
what does the handoff stifling that's a
handoff<00:00:57.850> yeah
