here<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.990> because<00:03:46.320> i'm<00:03:46.440> using<00:03:46.470> a

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
here this is this because i'm using a

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.700 
here this is this because i'm using a
tempered<00:03:47.460> glass<00:03:47.490> screen<00:03:47.850> protector<00:03:48.630> which<00:03:49.560> is

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
ones so i would recommend when using

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.020 
ones so i would recommend when using
this<00:03:55.650> case<00:03:55.920> don't<00:03:56.340> use<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.550> screen<00:03:56.850> protector
