00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
ok today we're going to transplant some

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.749 
ok today we're going to transplant some
garlic's<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.820> left<00:00:12.000> garlic's<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> bed

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
garlic's we left garlic's in the bed

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.150 
garlic's we left garlic's in the bed
over<00:00:14.759> winter<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.500> didn't<00:00:16.740> pull<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.039> up

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
