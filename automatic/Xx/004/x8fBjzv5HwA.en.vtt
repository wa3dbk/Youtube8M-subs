00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
lay join those in the corners to make

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.230 
lay join those in the corners to make
red<00:01:16.660> tail<00:01:16.870> let's<00:01:17.740> go<00:01:17.950> use<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.580> rectangle<00:01:19.060> to

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
red tail let's go use the rectangle to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.310 
red tail let's go use the rectangle to
make<00:01:19.390> sure<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.630> angles<00:01:19.900> are<00:01:20.020> precise<00:01:25.320> now

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
make sure the angles are precise now

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.140 
make sure the angles are precise now
I'll<00:01:26.470> demonstrate<00:01:26.620> how<00:01:27.370> to<00:01:27.400> correctly<00:01:27.820> buy<00:01:28.030> in

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
I'll demonstrate how to correctly buy in

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:47.480 
I'll demonstrate how to correctly buy in
a<00:01:28.210> corner

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.570 

now<00:01:48.490> on<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.850> next<00:01:49.120> corner<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:51.460> you're

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
now on to the next corner when you're

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.100 
now on to the next corner when you're
finished<00:01:51.850> with<00:01:51.910> all<00:01:52.120> four<00:01:52.300> corners<00:01:52.570> you're

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
finished with all four corners you're

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.060 
finished with all four corners you're
going<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.320> end<00:01:53.440> up<00:01:53.530> with<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.710> frame<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.040> looks

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
going to end up with a frame that looks

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.960 
going to end up with a frame that looks
a<00:01:54.250> lot<00:01:54.369> like<00:01:54.520> this
