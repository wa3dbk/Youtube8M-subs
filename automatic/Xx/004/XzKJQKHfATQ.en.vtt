00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hey today again a little very short 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.649
 video to the competition there is inter 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.240
 specific competitor tram 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:17.130
 specific components the word internally 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:21.869
 means between and intra means 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 within biology there are two 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.920
 terms that are used 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 express competitive behavior once 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.980
 specific between hard winter and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.899
 once intra specific within one 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 kind 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.000
 as an example of inter-specific 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.260
 For example, competition would be werewolf 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.170
 against the fox this both hare on 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.090
 Apart from that, they both want to hare 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.649
 hunt but they stand as 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.960
 competitors different types 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.780
 opposite on the other side 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 we the intra specific competition that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.210
 would be for example wolf against well that means we 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.310
 have a way where the individuals 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.909
 or subspecies could do this 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.760
 also be 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.530
 in competition with each other 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.979
 could be snowy winter , for example 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.720
 gray wolf perhaps in some areas 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.090
 compete with each other then that would be 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.939
 something between inter specific and in 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 specific competition because that is 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.229
 we may entertain a kind 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.180
 but they are already 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.920
 differently adapted one of a white 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.610
 so well done in the snow the other 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.409
 not so good 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.210
 that means one person can do better in the snow 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.560
 That's why it's the same again 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.390
 similar to interspecific 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 competition and intra specific 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.649
 really do it within a competition 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.720
 art became really much in the video 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.040
 but they are similar in competition 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.290
 standing together 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.909
 I hope that this has become clear 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.369
 inter-specific coherence between 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.649
 species between individuals they very much 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.610
 different are those wolf and fox 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.159
 those around food then compete intra 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.340
 specific competition within one 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.979
 Kind of individuals that are very similar 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.819
 but nevertheless have been different 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.349
 are and themselves 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.239
 one-sided chasing away the food 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.489
 so this wolf can be a lot better 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.859
 adapted to ensure that has the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.719
 another wolf takes the food away in 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.549
 thank you for that 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.859
 Attention to further inquiries 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.019
 please watch the detailed video 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.620
 Here it was only a little faster 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.620
 Started
