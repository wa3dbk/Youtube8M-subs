well<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.480> was<00:00:03.689> interested<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.440> technology

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
well I was interested in this technology

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.460 
well I was interested in this technology
in<00:00:05.069> astronomy<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.790> general<00:00:05.819> one<00:00:06.330> since<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.200> was

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
in astronomy in general one since I was

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.730 
in astronomy in general one since I was
a<00:00:07.500> child<00:00:07.820> since<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.660> growing<00:00:10.019> up<00:00:10.170> during

if<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.259> vehicle<00:01:37.409> ahead<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.009> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
if the vehicle ahead of you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.920 
if the vehicle ahead of you
encounter<00:01:39.790> some<00:01:39.970> kind<00:01:40.180> of<00:01:40.240> obstacle<00:01:40.870> or

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
encounter some kind of obstacle or

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.830 
encounter some kind of obstacle or
accident<00:01:41.650> yeah<00:01:42.160> you<00:01:42.760> can<00:01:42.940> get<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.240> signal<00:01:43.630> of

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
accident yeah you can get the signal of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.080 
accident yeah you can get the signal of
this<00:01:44.110> type<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.350> break<00:01:44.740> even<00:01:45.220> like<00:01:45.520> mile<00:01:45.850> ahead

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
this type of break even like mile ahead

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.030 
this type of break even like mile ahead
of<00:01:46.330> you<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.110> can<00:01:47.230> prepare<00:01:47.620> and<00:01:47.800> slow<00:01:48.010> down

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
of you so you can prepare and slow down

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.600 
of you so you can prepare and slow down
rather<00:01:48.790> than<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:50.350> an<00:01:50.440> accident<00:01:50.950> well<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.490> think

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
rather than get an accident well I think

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.080 
rather than get an accident well I think
this<00:01:51.970> technology<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:52.930> not<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.560> far<00:01:53.620> as<00:01:54.190> one

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
this technology is not that far as one

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.450 
this technology is not that far as one
might<00:01:55.300> think<00:01:55.360> we<00:01:56.020> have<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.229> lot<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.530> interesting

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
might think we have a lot of interesting

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.690 
might think we have a lot of interesting
things<00:01:57.490> ahead<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.420> us
