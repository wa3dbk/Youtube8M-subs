00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.770 
pissed off some ps4 fans they think that
because<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> ps4<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.820> quote-unquote<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
because the ps4 is quote-unquote so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.880 
because the ps4 is quote-unquote so
powerful<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.369> 50%<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.509> powers<00:01:06.960> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
powerful with the 50% more powers that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.359 
powerful with the 50% more powers that
we<00:01:08.009> haven't<00:01:08.250> seen<00:01:09.020> that<00:01:10.100> they<00:01:11.100> should<00:01:11.280> be

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
we haven't seen that they should be

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.279 
we haven't seen that they should be
getting<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:12.240> extra<00:01:12.479> bells<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.929> whistles

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
so yeah but now that the game looks

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.360 
so yeah but now that the game looks
equal<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.750> both<00:02:23.780> platforms<00:02:24.170> you're<00:02:25.130> seeing

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
equal on both platforms you're seeing

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.310 
equal on both platforms you're seeing
people<00:02:25.610> go<00:02:25.760> oh<00:02:25.940> well<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.510> looked<00:02:26.690> ugly<00:02:26.840> on<00:02:27.080> ps4

-<00:02:27.710> it's<00:02:28.280> not<00:02:28.460> graphically<00:02:30.430> great<00:02:31.430> anyway<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.000> I

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
- it's not graphically great anyway so I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.910 
- it's not graphically great anyway so I
can<00:02:32.510> see<00:02:32.690> why<00:02:32.840> they<00:02:33.020> achieve<00:02:33.320> parity

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
can see why they achieve parity

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.550 
can see why they achieve parity
I<00:02:33.950> mean<00:02:34.310> seriously<00:02:34.970> get<00:02:35.240> over<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.290> game

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560
