00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello how about how good are you let me 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.259

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.890
 a job at school and about 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.890
 make a collage 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.430
 is to make a collage about what you have 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.430
 now 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.920
 about what you would like to have in 10 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.500
 years 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.410
 and what I would do to achieve what 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.360
 would be the dividing line very well then 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.390
 I began to reflect and although they are few 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.340
 images I thought it very well I said the one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.830

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.600
 taste with what I have thanks to life 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.550
 I have a house I have friends that I 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.770
 they support my father to give me advice 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.420
 I have a pet 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.480

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.899
 I was little when I was 3 years old, he told me 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.789
 mom who grabbed on the empty boats and 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.229
 I started playing as a drummer and before 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.619
 there were some microphones that had 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:03.769
 in as it is marine then that is 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:06.259

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.789
 put to sing with two microphones I have 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.770
 my brother although sometimes it's usually a 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:12.170
 little sarcastic and mocking but I want it 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.610
 I love him quite as much as my father because 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.990
 their advices 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.590
 I go to school 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.170
 in total scratch 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.899
 which I learned a lot from the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.700
 teachers of the things that are there 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.530
 I also learned a lot 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.820
 but what I want to achieve in 10 years and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.040
 it made me think a lot 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.720
 I can not think seriously and I 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.159
 I want to specialize in laugh therapy 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.180
 would like to work with people 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.940
 oncological 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.740
 I would like that through the laughter of 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.930
 people will cure their discomforts 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.210
 I got married also for the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.119
 church 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.149
 married I come as a speaker as 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.600
 tallerista me as a great psychologist 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.479
 like to have a house 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.009
 with pets I would like to have a mini 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.009
 cooper I love those little cars 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.250
 It is also what I would like to have is 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.470
 a psychological clinic and little by little 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.770
 I'm getting there and every year since 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.070
 small I really like the music band 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.140
 the Sinaloan band and then one of 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.290
 my dreams is to be a singer of the band 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.290
 the bend 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.950
 I'm 22 years old so I can do it and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.900
 I know I can achieve it at 32 years old 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.240
 I think a little earlier I know that what 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.420
 I can achieve but what do I need to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.090
 to be able to achieve, I think it's love 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.320
 love the spiritual family social love 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.990
 and sentimental to be balanced 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.420
 I need to have health because although 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.310
 as long as I continue to live there is a lot because 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.050
 fight but I believe that health is 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.240
 You must also take care of yourself 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.650
 any physical or mental discomfort there 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.650
 that go to the psychologist to the doctor 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.780
 respectively 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.790
 I have to study a lot 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.340
 since it's enough to be able to achieve 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.810
 clear without neglecting social life and there 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.280
 that also be balanced in that 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.930
 point 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.090
 I need money because 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.290
 unfortunately in this world what 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.150
 move is the money 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.350
 for all the money for everything and that 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.140
 buy for everything you have to pay 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.070
 I know that I can not accomplish alone 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.470
 I need teamwork that 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.620
 symbolize in this image the work in 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.290
 team more people and well I think that 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.660
 the main thing is not psychology what 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.370
 I have now and what I want to have 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.920
 later because that is going to take us 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.440
 have a good job and if not get it 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.460
 but myself creating by bringing my own 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.980
 work 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.970
 I would like to leave enough to know my 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.980
 beautiful polola 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.930
 I know that for time for money I have not 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.130
 but I would like to know 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.740
 totally 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.130
 I would like to know my country Mexico and 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.500
 there to break off to know more places 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.900
 biologically life and a lot 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.209
 biologically clear is 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.069
 I, I want you to stay with this 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.380
 reflection of why not also do your 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.330
 make your own collage 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.360
 maybe not in 10 years 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.160
 maybe in a year that what you have 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.330
 now that what you would like to achieve in 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.980
 a year after that year you see your tails 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.670
 you stick it in your room once in a place 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.790
 visible and gas that I have achieved and has 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.130
 lack achieved and accomplished and that you 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.260
 I have done to achieve this and I 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.880
 What is missing in order to achieve what is not 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.080
 I have achieved 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.160
 paradoxically or as a tongue twister 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.750
 it seems to be but not 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.880
 and after that year you do it again 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.280
 another and that what you want to achieve fix 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.430
 you set goals to set goals for you 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.560
 you can achieve while you're still living 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.360
 while still dreaming you can can 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.280
 achieve while it's time is in 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.440
 your hands and is in your hands is in 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.330
 everyone center is in your context 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.730
 what has not been done before does not want 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.289
 to say that you can never do it 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.479
 I invite you to do it 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.460

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:17.819

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.460
 when they start criticizing you 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.580
 Portugal on the good road 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.250
 they are always going to talk about you 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.830
 but well I think that if you start it 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:28.219
 achieve from this point of view and if you 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.650
 makes happy that's the good is the good 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.849
 that makes you happy that people talk to 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.900
 end you can see there will always be people 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.900
 who will be by your side
