we<00:00:00.780> are<00:00:00.900> now<00:00:00.989> looking<00:00:01.199> at<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.469> ideas<00:00:01.920> used<00:00:02.190> on

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
we are now looking at the ideas used on

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.039 
we are now looking at the ideas used on
the<00:00:02.429> abacus<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:03.030> order<00:00:03.480> numbers<00:00:03.840> without

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
the abacus to order numbers without

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.330 
the abacus to order numbers without
having<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.589> use<00:00:04.740> an<00:00:04.830> abacus<00:00:07.069> we're<00:00:08.069> going<00:00:08.220> to

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
having to use an abacus we're going to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.009 
having to use an abacus we're going to
arrange<00:00:08.610> these<00:00:08.880> numbers<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.450> ascending<00:00:09.719> order

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
arrange these numbers in ascending order

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.160 
arrange these numbers in ascending order
that<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.769> from<00:00:11.010> smallest<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.429> largest<00:00:12.170> we're

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
that is from smallest to largest we're

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.540 
that is from smallest to largest we're
going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.469> use<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> table<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.160> delist<00:00:16.550> each

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
going to use a table to delist each

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.370 
going to use a table to delist each
spike<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> abacus<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.840> replaced<00:00:19.170> by<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
spike in the abacus is replaced by a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.460 
spike in the abacus is replaced by a
column<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> table<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:21.779> first<00:00:21.960> number<00:00:22.380> in

column in the table the first number in

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.029 
column in the table the first number in
our<00:00:22.590> list<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.100> 480<00:00:23.850> T<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:25.140> move<00:00:25.320> each<00:00:25.529> digit

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
our list is 480 T and we move each digit

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.540 
our list is 480 T and we move each digit
of<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.189> number<00:00:26.279> into<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> correct<00:00:27.240> column

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
of the number into the correct column

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.120 
of the number into the correct column
480<00:00:29.550> T<00:00:29.929> we<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> rest<00:00:31.980> of

480 T we can now do this for the rest of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:52.189 
480 T we can now do this for the rest of
the<00:00:32.219> numbers<00:00:34.250> 368<00:00:38.000> 386<00:00:41.899> 87<00:00:46.190> 444<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:49.640> 428<00:00:51.199> we've

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the numbers 368 386 87 444 and 428 we've

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.779 
the numbers 368 386 87 444 and 428 we've
now<00:00:52.379> placed<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.219> numbers<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
now placed all of the numbers in the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.779 
now placed all of the numbers in the
table<00:00:54.410> we<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.620> look<00:00:55.860> at<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.219> largest<00:00:56.610> place

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
table we then look at the largest place

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.619 
table we then look at the largest place
value<00:00:56.820> column<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.719> hundreds<00:00:58.140> first<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:59.629> we

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
value column the hundreds first as we

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.000 
value column the hundreds first as we
are<00:01:00.750> arranging<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.350> ascending<00:01:01.620> order

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
are arranging in ascending order

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.399 
are arranging in ascending order
we<00:01:02.460> select<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> smallest<00:01:03.180> number<00:01:03.629> which<00:01:04.229> in

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
we select the smallest number which in

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.910 
we select the smallest number which in
this<00:01:04.500> case<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.010> 0<00:01:05.930> this<00:01:06.930> number<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.590> moves<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
this case is 0 this number then moves to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.050 
this case is 0 this number then moves to
the<00:01:08.010> top<00:01:08.720> we<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.869> forget<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
the top we can forget about it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.660 
the top we can forget about it
the<00:01:12.060> smallest<00:01:12.330> number<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.020> 3<00:01:13.490> these<00:01:14.490> now

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the smallest number is now 3 these now

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.020 
the smallest number is now 3 these now
need<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> move<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:16.310> for<00:01:17.310> these<00:01:17.400> two<00:01:17.640> numbers

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
need to move up for these two numbers

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.370 
need to move up for these two numbers
now<00:01:18.390> let's<00:01:18.659> look<00:01:18.780> at<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> tens<00:01:19.229> column<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:22.350> can

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
now let's look at the tens column we can

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.399 
now let's look at the tens column we can
see<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> smallest<00:01:23.220> number<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.729> 6<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
see that the smallest number is 6 and so

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.990 
see that the smallest number is 6 and so
these<00:01:25.409> numbers<00:01:25.710> are<00:01:25.920> already<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> correct

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
these numbers are already in the correct

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.100 
these numbers are already in the correct
order<00:01:28.549> now<00:01:29.549> let's<00:01:30.299> look<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> numbers<00:01:30.930> with

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
order now let's look at the numbers with

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.770 
order now let's look at the numbers with
4<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> hundreds<00:01:31.890> column<00:01:32.479> let's<00:01:33.479> look<00:01:33.689> at

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
4 in the hundreds column let's look at

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.770 
4 in the hundreds column let's look at
the<00:01:33.840> tens<00:01:34.079> column<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:35.040> numbers

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the tens column for all of these numbers

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
the tens column for all of these numbers
if<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.650> these<00:01:37.740> three<00:01:37.920> numbers<00:01:38.130> they

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
if we look at these three numbers they

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.230 
if we look at these three numbers they
should<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> order<00:01:39.689> T<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.590> 8<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
should be in the order T for 8 so the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.030 
should be in the order T for 8 so the
numbers<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.840> rearranged<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.350> give<00:01:43.560> this

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.249 

we<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.790> six<00:01:51.119> numbers<00:01:51.210> arranged<00:01:52.140> in

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
we now have all six numbers arranged in

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.560 
we now have all six numbers arranged in
ascending<00:01:52.409> order

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
ascending order

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.510 
ascending order
hence<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.020> correct<00:01:55.320> order<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:56.149> 87<00:01:57.829> 368<00:01:59.659> 386

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
hence the correct order is 87 368 386

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.010 
hence the correct order is 87 368 386
428<00:02:03.350> 444<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.759> 480<00:02:05.759> T

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.830 

this<00:02:10.710> time<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.250> are<00:02:11.370> arranging<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:12.210> descending

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
this time we are arranging in descending

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.880 
this time we are arranging in descending
order<00:02:12.930> or<00:02:13.320> from<00:02:14.250> largest<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.700> smallest<00:02:15.890> once

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
order or from largest to smallest once

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.530 
order or from largest to smallest once
again<00:02:17.190> let's<00:02:17.580> put<00:02:17.790> these<00:02:17.910> numbers<00:02:18.120> into<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
again let's put these numbers into a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.230 
again let's put these numbers into a
table<00:02:21.680> one<00:02:22.680> thousand<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:25.820> ten<00:02:26.820> thousand

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
table one thousand and one ten thousand

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.760 
table one thousand and one ten thousand
and<00:02:27.330> ten<00:02:29.960> eleven<00:02:30.960> thousand<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.800> one<00:02:33.770> one

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
and ten eleven thousand and one one

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.140 
and ten eleven thousand and one one
thousand<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.340> hundred<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:37.610> eleven<00:02:38.610> thousand

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
thousand one hundred and eleven thousand

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.290 
thousand one hundred and eleven thousand
and<00:02:39.300> ten<00:02:40.670> because<00:02:41.670> we're<00:02:41.880> looking<00:02:42.150> at<00:02:42.210> the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
and ten because we're looking at the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.420 
and ten because we're looking at the
largest<00:02:42.600> number<00:02:42.990> first<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.830> look<00:02:44.010> at<00:02:44.130> ten

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
largest number first we look at ten

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.900 
largest number first we look at ten
thousands<00:02:44.910> column<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:46.250> we<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.370> see<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
thousands column and we can see that the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.630 
thousands column and we can see that the
largest<00:02:48.030> number<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.600> one<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:50.160> select<00:02:50.490> these

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
largest number is one so we select these

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.060 
largest number is one so we select these
first<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.360> put<00:02:52.230> them<00:02:52.410> at<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.710> top<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
first and put them at the top of the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.540 
first and put them at the top of the
table<00:02:54.380> for<00:02:55.380> these<00:02:55.500> numbers<00:02:55.710> we<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:56.310> need<00:02:56.520> to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
table for these numbers we now need to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.480 
table for these numbers we now need to
look<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.970> thousands<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.980> numbers<00:02:59.340> were

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
look at the thousands the numbers were

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.510 
look at the thousands the numbers were
the<00:02:59.520> one<00:02:59.850> in<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.300> thousands<00:03:00.780> are<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.020> largest

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
the one in the thousands are the largest

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.250 
the one in the thousands are the largest
so<00:03:02.520> they<00:03:02.640> need<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.850> move<00:03:03.060> up<00:03:05.960> both<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:07.140> these

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
so they need to move up both of these

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.350 
so they need to move up both of these
numbers<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.830> zero<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.550> hundreds

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
numbers have zero in the hundreds

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.620 
numbers have zero in the hundreds
say<00:03:09.780> we<00:03:10.200> move<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.770> tens<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:12.270> largest

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
say we move on to the tens the largest

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.620 
say we move on to the tens the largest
number<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:12.990> time<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.410> 1<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:15.030> number<00:03:15.420> moves

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
number this time is 1 that number moves

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.030 
number this time is 1 that number moves
into<00:03:15.900> first<00:03:16.110> position<00:03:18.350> now<00:03:19.350> we<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.770> need<00:03:19.950> to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
into first position now we just need to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.010 
into first position now we just need to
deal<00:03:20.220> with<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.670> bottom<00:03:21.000> two<00:03:21.209> numbers<00:03:24.020> the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
deal with the bottom two numbers the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.690 
deal with the bottom two numbers the
thousand<00:03:25.410> columns<00:03:25.680> shows<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.520> they<00:03:26.670> are

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
thousand columns shows that they are

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.680 
thousand columns shows that they are
both<00:03:26.970> 1<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.650> move<00:03:28.800> on<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.160> hundreds

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
both 1 and so we move on to the hundreds

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.890 
both 1 and so we move on to the hundreds
one<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.110> largest<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.100> moves<00:03:32.310> up<00:03:32.900> this

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
one is the largest so that moves up this

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.040 
one is the largest so that moves up this
gives<00:03:34.200> us<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.590> final<00:03:34.770> positions<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.900> we<00:03:36.900> can

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
gives us the final positions and we can

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.350 
gives us the final positions and we can
list<00:03:37.260> these<00:03:37.410> numbers<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.700> order<00:03:38.910> given<00:03:39.270> in

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
list these numbers in the order given in

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.980 
list these numbers in the order given in
the<00:03:39.450> table<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:44.060> descending<00:03:45.060> order<00:03:45.209> we<00:03:45.480> have

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
the table so descending order we have

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.290 
the table so descending order we have
eleven<00:03:46.380> thousand<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.830> ten<00:03:47.000> eleven<00:03:48.000> thousand

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
eleven thousand and ten eleven thousand

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.140 
eleven thousand and ten eleven thousand
and<00:03:48.450> one<00:03:48.630> ten<00:03:49.590> thousand<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.100> ten<00:03:50.280> one

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
and one ten thousand and ten one

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.210 
and one ten thousand and ten one
thousand<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:51.630> hundred<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.140> one<00:03:52.230> thousand

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
thousand one hundred and one thousand

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.370
