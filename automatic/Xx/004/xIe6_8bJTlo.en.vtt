00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.609
 6 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.309
 duel for teams very good kids is 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.360
 what are you waiting for I'm great 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.450
 perfectly welcome to a new 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.840
 video of my channel we are starting the 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.029
 snipe series with the 4 in black 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.489
 ops 2 was waiting for me to have the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.599
 unlocked diamond camouflages 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.050
 to make this series is not that it 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:35.079
 I forgot nothing and you see that the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.640
 camouflage of that diamond last digit 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.500
 of the camouflage comments more cani 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.450
 that there is truth in everyone that does 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.489
 I imagined it so I imagined it 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.890
 more a way like crystalline everything 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.500
 homogeneous so bright and transparent 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.750
 me but it's not like I wanted but good 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.579
 the case for those who do not know this is 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.839
 series starting with the 4 consists of 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.760
 that I'm going to play with the four 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.039
 snipers and stay as it is in the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.269
 game I will upload the voucher in fact 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.820
 I'm playing in life even though I do not know 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.410
 look alike 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.450
 being there to my ball but I'm 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.970
 commenting live and that I stayed 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.190
 and left the game because the game 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.930
 had climbed are playing in slums a 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.850
 map that the truth is that 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.770
 many people say very much with many things 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.960
 good on this map that he loved 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.510
 who wants mobility and all that but 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.010
 I do not like this map, I do not like it 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.750
 because because I always go to frank 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.060
 operated and this sniper map then 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.930
 as it is so tiny so manijero 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 does not have space open spaces 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.540
 enough to go well with the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 sniper 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.659
 and we are with the sbs grapes that do not 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.090
 named still sees the francop in coma and 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.750
 I like we like to call him to compose 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.750
 by fasting betis 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.340
 dad dad 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.010
 and this was one of the snipers 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.350
 what more did it cost to get me the diamond 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.230
 because you have already seen that it does not kill 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.500
 shot you have to hit the head or do or 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.970
 makes hit markers and is quite complex 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.210
 to handle me they will make them pound 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 behind 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.509
 they are going to do to me is plan but that no longer 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.929
 Lying team is made here 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.929
 palante 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.220
 good good good good if out there the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.300
 head rest 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.780
 that grape and rich good attention v enemy 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.780
 of the road 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.700
 outside 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.260
 motivation 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.700
 now out without being touched 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.060
 betty 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.830
 today in the back 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.540
 watered 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.900
 and this lake series mainly the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.140
 I've been doing since 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.810
 I do not know what is this I started it I think what 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.670
 I started in the in modern warfare 2 and 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.250
 then I started this series and it's always been 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.989
 liking enough for you to see how the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.599
 playability that I have with each 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.480
 sniper how I usually play with each 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.980
 sniper 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.750
 because it is not the same to upload a gameplay 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.480
 30 but playing with the sniper not 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.310
 I know why a 30 to 0 play with the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.360
 sniper for example 30 0 play 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.400
 sniper 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.720
 all against all then we do 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.849
 counterpart had to be cast before 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.489
 to get out that 30 to 0 not then by 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.470
 that would be a little bit for you to see 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.720
 how I usually play with each time 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.260
 style that I usually wear with each each 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.260
 sniper 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.930
 not a bullet gives or is incredible 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.930
 amazing incredible 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.549
 the piracy mania I put it to invest 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.359
 in the other sniper classes 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.359
 centex 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.609
 I did not want to let go at the same time and 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.609
 enemy of your team 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.199
 the proto go around 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.780
 tomas alternating we go ahead 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.419
 is more capable 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.500
 now out there 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.210
 silveti 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.740
 change of adjustment in which you are 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.740
 finishing the game 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.200
 uy 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.780
 very complex to handle this 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.780
 sniper unless you want her 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.960
 per head very complex 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.909
 in fact the challenger that costs me the most 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.909
 handle the one that by far 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.810
 where are they leaving now 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.170

 I simply upload them so that 

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.629

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:02.109
 sniper more than is the clyfc 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:05.229
