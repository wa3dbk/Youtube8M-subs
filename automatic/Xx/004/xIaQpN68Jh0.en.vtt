00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:18.339 

this<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.600> rather<00:03:05.530> difficult<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.220> do<00:03:06.340> on<00:03:06.490> camera

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.459 

pull<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.069> tight<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.959> we've<00:03:20.959> got<00:03:21.140> our<00:03:21.260> first

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:21.469 
pull it tight and we've got our first

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.970 
pull it tight and we've got our first
stitch<00:03:22.659> and<00:03:23.659> now<00:03:23.870> it's<00:03:24.170> just<00:03:24.319> as<00:03:24.530> simple<00:03:24.890> as

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
stitch and now it's just as simple as

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.819 
stitch and now it's just as simple as
repeating<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.579> process<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:27.349> we're<00:03:27.620> all

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
repeating that process and we're all

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.750 
repeating that process and we're all
over<00:03:28.219> one<00:03:28.609> place<00:03:28.939> and<00:03:30.459> continue<00:03:31.459> stitching

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
over one place and continue stitching

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.429 
over one place and continue stitching
