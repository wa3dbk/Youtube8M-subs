too much communication too much wording

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.410 
too much communication too much wording
in<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.800> map<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.640> problem<00:02:35.910> with<00:02:36.000> shako<00:02:36.180> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
in the map and the problem with shako is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.720 
in the map and the problem with shako is
although<00:02:36.690> he's<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.130> complete<00:02:38.130> terror<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
although he's a complete terror for the

first ten minutes of the game by late
game<00:02:40.710> he<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.310> falls<00:02:41.550> off<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.880> he<00:02:41.970> can't<00:02:42.210> do

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
game he really falls off and he can't do

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.820 
game he really falls off and he can't do
much<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.510> anything<00:02:42.810> other<00:02:43.140> than<00:02:43.320> split<00:02:43.620> push

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
much of anything other than split push

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.350 
much of anything other than split push
and<00:02:44.070> indeed<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.730> proved<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.210> case

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and indeed that proved to be the case

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.760 
and indeed that proved to be the case
today<00:02:45.540> because<00:02:45.930> shaken<00:02:46.230> was<00:02:46.320> played<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.620> two

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
today because shaken was played in two

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.770 
today because shaken was played in two
games<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.280> both<00:02:47.520> games<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.030> team<00:02:48.210> lost<00:02:48.450> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
games and both games the team lost and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.240 
games and both games the team lost and
in<00:02:48.870> both<00:02:48.960> games<00:02:49.170> shako<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.710> not<00:02:49.950> very

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
in both games shako is not very

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.220 
in both games shako is not very
effective<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.910> think<00:02:51.330> he<00:02:51.420> got<00:02:51.570> one<00:02:51.960> or<00:02:52.080> two

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
effective I think he got one or two

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.230 
effective I think he got one or two
kills<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.770> each<00:02:52.980> game<00:02:53.220> with<00:02:53.460> early<00:02:53.790> ganks<00:02:53.970> but

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
kills in each game with early ganks but

organized<00:03:00.840> team<00:03:01.080> setting<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:02.010> been<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
organized team setting that's been the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.650 
organized team setting that's been the

the case again today the other thing
that<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:06.270> interesting<00:03:06.600> was<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.320> vein<00:03:07.710> Janice

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that was interesting was a vein Janice

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.710 
that was interesting was a vein Janice
still<00:03:08.490> terrible<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.300> mentioned<00:03:09.660> that

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
still terrible I know I mentioned that

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
still terrible I know I mentioned that
yesterday<00:03:09.900> vein<00:03:10.440> Jana<00:03:10.710> was<00:03:10.890> played<00:03:11.130> again

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
yesterday vein Jana was played again

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.280 
yesterday vein Jana was played again
today<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.090> got<00:03:12.240> stomped<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.110> fact

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
today and it got stomped and in fact

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.890 
today and it got stomped and in fact
Moscow<00:03:13.800> 5<00:03:14.010> actually<00:03:14.460> ran<00:03:14.580> an<00:03:14.730> ad<00:03:14.850> Kenan<00:03:15.690> lane

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
Moscow 5 actually ran an ad Kenan lane

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.449 
Moscow 5 actually ran an ad Kenan lane
yes<00:03:16.290> you're<00:03:16.500> not<00:03:16.650> miss<00:03:16.860> hearing<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.190> ad

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
yes you're not miss hearing that ad

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.060 
yes you're not miss hearing that ad
Kenan<00:03:18.000> they<00:03:18.390> actually<00:03:18.660> ran<00:03:18.750> 80<00:03:19.050> Kenan<00:03:19.560> against

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
Kenan they actually ran 80 Kenan against

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.830 
Kenan they actually ran 80 Kenan against
vein<00:03:20.310> Jana<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.790> they<00:03:20.910> won<00:03:21.120> with<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.630> won

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
vein Jana and they won with it and won

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.840 
vein Jana and they won with it and won
convincingly<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.670> is

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
convincingly so I think that that is

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.340 
convincingly so I think that that is
showing<00:03:24.030> more<00:03:24.390> than<00:03:24.570> anything<00:03:24.780> else<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.140> you

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
showing more than anything else that you

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.979 
showing more than anything else that you
really<00:03:25.709> can't<00:03:25.950> run<00:03:26.190> vain<00:03:26.430> Jana<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.540> vein<00:03:27.840> in

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
really can't run vain Jana that vein in

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.900 
really can't run vain Jana that vein in
particular<00:03:28.440> has<00:03:28.590> fared<00:03:28.920> very<00:03:29.010> poorly<00:03:29.550> in<00:03:29.790> this

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
particular has fared very poorly in this

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.949 
particular has fared very poorly in this
tournament<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.360> lot<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.630> teams<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.870> been

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
tournament a lot of teams have been

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.900 
tournament a lot of teams have been
picking<00:03:31.290> vein<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.739> she's<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.190> not<00:03:32.580> done

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
picking vein and she's just not done

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.180 
picking vein and she's just not done
well<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.630> real<00:03:33.900> stars<00:03:34.260> for<00:03:34.470> ad<00:03:34.650> have<00:03:35.010> been

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and has actually been very effective if

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.670 
and has actually been very effective if

people can keep him safe he stole a key

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.130 
people can keep him safe he stole a key
and<00:03:43.860> terror<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:44.400> Jaya<00:03:45.150> like<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.690> said<00:03:45.750> vane<00:03:46.110> has

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
and terror so Jaya like I said vane has

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.199 
and terror so Jaya like I said vane has
really<00:03:46.530> been<00:03:46.650> having<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.950> tough<00:03:47.130> go<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.730> in

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
really been having a tough go of it in

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.360 
really been having a tough go of it in
terms<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:49.050> support<00:03:49.470> play<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.250> something

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
terms of support play this is something

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.009 
terms of support play this is something
that<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.670> keep<00:03:51.000> an<00:03:51.090> eye<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.239> as<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.570> support

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
that I keep an eye on as a support

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.479 
that I keep an eye on as a support
player<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.470> because<00:03:52.920> there<00:03:53.040> really<00:03:53.190> aren't

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
player and because there really aren't

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.590 
player and because there really aren't
that<00:03:53.610> many<00:03:53.790> supports<00:03:54.239> was<00:03:54.420> pretty

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
that many supports was pretty

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.420 
that many supports was pretty
interesting<00:03:54.870> today<00:03:55.170> Soraka<00:03:55.680> not<00:03:56.040> picked<00:03:56.310> her

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
interesting today Soraka not picked her

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.040 
interesting today Soraka not picked her
band<00:03:56.640> in<00:03:56.880> any<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.269> matches<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.930> was

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
band in any of the matches so that was

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.990 
band in any of the matches so that was
quite<00:03:58.200> interesting<00:03:58.800> after<00:03:59.459> Soraka<00:03:59.730> being

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
quite interesting after Soraka being

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.699 
quite interesting after Soraka being
valued<00:04:00.269> so<00:04:00.480> highly<00:04:00.510> yesterday<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.230> nobody

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
valued so highly yesterday so nobody

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.949 
valued so highly yesterday so nobody
played<00:04:01.920> Soraka<00:04:02.310> Sona<00:04:03.000> did<00:04:03.269> get<00:04:03.420> played<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.900> in

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
played Soraka Sona did get played and in

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.479 
played Soraka Sona did get played and in
fact<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.290> believe<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:04.709> no<00:04:04.769> one<00:04:05.010> every<00:04:05.310> match

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
fact I believe so no one every match

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.220 
fact I believe so no one every match
that<00:04:05.519> she<00:04:05.880> was<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.120> again<00:04:06.330> today<00:04:06.600> so<00:04:06.660> Sona

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
that she was in again today so Sona

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.890 
that she was in again today so Sona
again<00:04:07.560> reinforcing<00:04:08.220> her<00:04:08.340> status<00:04:08.730> as<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:09.269> really

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
again reinforcing her status as a really

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.050 
again reinforcing her status as a really
strong<00:04:10.110> support<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:11.190> other<00:04:11.459> big<00:04:11.730> surprise

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
strong support the other big surprise

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.390 
strong support the other big surprise
though<00:04:12.269> was<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.690> support<00:04:13.140> nunu<00:04:13.500> getting<00:04:14.190> played

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400

though was a support nunu getting played
by<00:04:14.519> Moscow<00:04:14.940> five<00:04:15.180> maybe<00:04:15.510> it's<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.780> how<00:04:16.290> good

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
by Moscow five maybe it's just how good

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
to see there haven't really been that

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.719 
to see there haven't really been that
many<00:05:37.409> close<00:05:37.740> games<00:05:37.770> yet<00:05:38.250> we<00:05:38.339> haven't<00:05:38.490> really

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
many close games yet we haven't really

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.309 
many close games yet we haven't really
have<00:05:38.909> a<00:05:38.940> great<00:05:39.389> match<00:05:39.659> that<00:05:39.960> was<00:05:40.050> all<00:05:40.199> that

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
have a great match that was all that

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.950 
have a great match that was all that
close<00:05:40.500> they've<00:05:40.770> all<00:05:41.009> been<00:05:41.190> over<00:05:41.610> in<00:05:41.789> about<00:05:42.270> 35

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
close they've all been over in about 35

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.659 
close they've all been over in about 35
minutes<00:05:43.229> so<00:05:43.409> they've<00:05:43.529> all<00:05:43.650> been<00:05:43.800> medium

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
minutes so they've all been medium

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.369 
minutes so they've all been medium
length<00:05:44.849> and<00:05:45.150> they're<00:05:45.539> having<00:05:45.659> a<00:05:45.810> lot<00:05:46.080> of<00:05:46.110> stops

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
length and they're having a lot of stops

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.529 
length and they're having a lot of stops
so<00:05:46.650> far<00:05:46.889> but<00:05:47.099> what<00:05:47.490> we<00:05:47.669> should<00:05:47.909> see<00:05:48.150> hopefully

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
so far but what we should see hopefully

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:49.579 
so far but what we should see hopefully
we'll<00:05:48.690> see<00:05:48.719> a<00:05:48.839> little<00:05:49.050> bit<00:05:49.199> more<00:05:49.349> closer
