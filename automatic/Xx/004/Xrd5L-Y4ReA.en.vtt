00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.230
 hello friends and welcome and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.390
 welcome to home ideas the channel 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.400
 of decoration of house fÃ©bus I am meera 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.199
 ari freelance stylish and Christmas came 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
 that's why we're here visiting houses 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.760
 new because today we're going to learn to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.630
 make a bow or tie like this that is 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.520
 chimera 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 how beautiful a variety of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.880
 tapes that you can choose and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.980
 we will be working with one of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.960
 Our experts believe that we know 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 that will show us how we can 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 do it so let's start the gingham 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.890
 What are we going to do today? 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.899
 three different ribbons and a great look at 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 final and we will start with the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.379
 materials we have the three tapes that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.730
 They are rolls of 25 feet 8 yards scissors 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.859
 sweet wire and pliers and we started 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.229
 with the tape 1 which is the number that will 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.210
 in the center part this tape is going 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.909
 to use approximately 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 four yards in total to do the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.150
 two we grabbed the tape the first time 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.430
 let's use with our fingers 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.159
 we extend the tape we take it to the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.320
 center again we produce and it's fine 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.850
 important that we do the fold that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.310
 We will help keep that tape 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.350
 all the time right and we repeat another 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.250
 time to the other side we do again 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.409
 the look we again produce and make 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.770
 the fold and we keep repeating that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.229
 move until you have about 5 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.289
 lux on each side that's going to be 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.520
 using as I told them around 4 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.520
 yards of our rolls 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.340
 let's go to the next step that would be to add 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.750
 tape number 2 after we finish 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.030
 the 5 loops 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.830
 We are going to fix them with our wire 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.600
 sweet is very important that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.400
 let's keep our tapes firm 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.830
 hands so that then we can 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.420
 place the wire and use the pliers 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.420
 that helps us all elements 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.710
 we repeat the same movement extend 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.050
 the purse tape make the loop for three 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.150
 occasions on each side or we are going to 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.370
 do three clubs per side when 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.380
 let's have our three looks for each 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.230
 side let's go back to add the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.920
 sweet wire to grab and fix all 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.920
 that tape 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.480
 Y 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.700
 and that of the third tape that is 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.829
 what is going to be the back in the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.870
 what the body will give to that bond is 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.140
 love and let's repeat the same 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.319
 movement we grab the tape pegadita 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.750
 to the rest of the tie that we already have 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.879
 we produce the tape we extend 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.489
 double to keep it always right 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.940
 and then then we continue that 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.079
 We are going to make three looks 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.769
 ears as you want to call 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.769
 each side 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.940
 at the end we will grab our 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.130
 wire we're going to tie all that ribbon 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.130
 from the center with our pliers 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.790
 to finish we will make the great 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.610
 circular look that goes on the part of 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.340
 down our tie we are going to draw three 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.170
 pieces of ribbon one of each ribbon the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.330
 different edge that we are going to use it 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.160
 so decide it and then we will 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.740
 measure from the shortest to the most 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.410
 long knowing that the first tape that 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.330
 we are going to use is the one of the five the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.720
 or the tape that remains in the right in the 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.970
 center of our tie we have those those 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.420
 tapes and we are going to go forming that great 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.030
 look for the first one we squeeze in the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.340
 center of the tie we grab our other 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.210
 tape to the second we go back to do the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.490
 loop very large and finally the third 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.040
 and then there we hold firmly to 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.210
 then place the sweet wire and 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.210
 fix it well strong 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.860
 and I think that there is already a very 

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:37.889
 beautiful and spectacular that we can 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.860
 use on your tree in an ornament where 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.009
 you want and here we have our 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.289
 tie with three different types of ribbon and 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.839
 the great look in the end you can 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.059
 do with a full tape or use 

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:53.159
 Different tapes can adjust the 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:55.649
 sizes can repeat the same thing in a 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.210
 small size as you like but 

00:04:55.649 --> 00:05:00.729
 so it would be 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.380
