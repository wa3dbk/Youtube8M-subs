 D: What is Fish Tank People? FishTankTV.com dustinsfish tanks giving it to you from Steve's 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.920
 house on a sort of Sunday. Now with my normal camera because that freaking Codec froze on 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.300
 Kind of Sunday low quality stuff, but I'm going to bring you a high quality video. Here 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.260
 is what's going on. Steve, your 55 looks great, bro. But we are talking about it 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.690
 anything else, bro to speak. People have asked me, they must know - a fish that 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.960
 you have bred my friend. I want to talk about Discus today. Take it to me, dude 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 . If you are a beginner and have had some experience with some tanks, you have one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.000
 had some good fish and you want to get a Discus, put me in your seat, what you 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.059
 would you do, talk to me about some Discus, bro. 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.750
 S: If you are a beginner, I do not recommend Discus. 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.450
 D: I didn't do them people. I think I'll kill them, I don't even mess 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.570
 with them. S: I have a few thoughts about Discus 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.070
 and you can believe them. People have different opinions, but here is my mind 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.449
 the. First thing about Discus - Discus thrives at 84 degrees. So if you want to get the Discus 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.679
 To take, you are committed to at least 80 degrees, so you need a lot of your 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:12.119
 kind of to throw through out the window because many species can't even handle 80 degrees 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.670
 . The other thing is - Discus are heavy eaters, especially baby Discus. So, I would not recommend 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.369
 for planting with a baby Discus. My advice to you - father Discus in a bare 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.159
 soil tank or in a tank with no plants, do a lot of water changes, get to grow 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.409
 to the desired size, train on pellets a type of low-maintentance food. You can 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.889
 This do a blood worms, but if you have a lot of heavy beef heart, it won't work 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:42.369
 with planted container. You will have a ton of algae. So, I really think Discus minimum size too 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.159
 take absolute minimum as 55. 75 liters work really well with Discus, 125 is even better, how 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.909
 better, but you have to be willing to do the water change. I'm ready to set it up 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.909
 of a 72 liter. D: That's what we're trying to pin into the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.819
 corner people with † species of sunday. We are committed, bro. Now that you have to do is 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.459
 Discus 72 liters. S: So, the thing is that they like a lot of water 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.040
 change, you have to keep the temperature up to 80 degrees. You † must have high quality 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.729
 hold . RO water is not a must, especially if you have decent quality city water 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:24.019
 . If you have a really high mineral water, you are going to have to get a little RO or distilled 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.489
 water, it is just a must. As far as they feed, if they can take pellets 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.060
 , you are going to get a lot less waste, it is going to do a lot better. I suggest that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.739
 you as a 75-4 adult Discus or something really nice. You do not overstuck your tank! YOU 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.849
 simple easy to grow plants, I think Rotella does great with Discus 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.939
 D: What are some good plants for Discus? 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.879
 S: Cryptocorns go great with Discus, I love Anubius. As far as some of the 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.829
 more luxurious things like the Star grass, it is not from the heat. 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.410
 D: So the thing here is that there is a difference because many plants can handle low temperatures 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.340
 . Many people know that I don't run heaters at all on my tanks, I hold them 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.769
 at a low temp. So with Discus you are going the opposite direction. So that's something 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.359
 be careful. S: I think fast-growing stuff is real 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:20.090
 Well, because you usually go to feed them heavily. So, you are going to have a lot of waste. So 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.510
 if it grows fast it is better to compete against the algae. So you really 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.859
 a heavy planted tank if you can do Discus. 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.230
 D: And if I had to do it, I would fall a lot of jungle and a bunch of sage too 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.909
 do it and let them cruise in and out. Given tank partners because we are looking 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.219
 to some, what can you keep in mind with Discus? 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.920
 S: So corecats go great with Discus. 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.319
 D: Corecats can handle high temps, don't mind. 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.909
 S: Cardinal tetris, shrimp ... Bromino tetris are really hard to keep, though 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.829
 they work well at high temperatures. They are cool fish. People don't like them much, so me 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.700
 highly recommend this. You need good filtration, you need good heating, you need one 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.840
 good temperature control. They don't need a lot of light, you can have a lot of light 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.269
 And some of them will tolerate doing it, but as a species, they don't like much 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.499
 light . So the perfect tank is probably a little lower, just a few † fluorescent lamps 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:21.030
 , do something like Rotalla and Dwarf Sage and just let it grow at its own pace. 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.169
 I had done dirted tanks with Discus. It can work, I also have some of the 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.090
 Amano soil, good filtration is the key, good water change. 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.910
 D: And you bred them too? S: We will get an update when I get mine 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.830
 Discus. I would also recommend Discus from a good breeder. I love RockyMountainDiscus.com 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.250
 , I want MisterDiscus.com which is the Sunrise Tropical place. Those are the two that I do 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.360
 had best experience. I also want to scream to my son Rob in Hawaii with Hawaii Discus 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.620
 . He is a cool guy, so don't be afraid to order from him too. 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.280
 D: Nice. A final question for you to leave right now. I know it's unfair 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.250
 for me to ask because i have a project hanging over my head ... 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.520
 S: You cannot breed Discus in a planted aquarium. 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.300
 D: When do you think you were Discus tank, brother? People have asked, you are going to say 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.229
 when it's ready and we can leave it today. S: September. 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.129
 D: September? That is far away. Hey, we'll take September. 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.650
 S: Give me some time. D: Okay. Types of Sundays from another 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.229
 cam. I hope to upload this dork. Be gone.
