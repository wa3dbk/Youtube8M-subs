to<00:01:36.990> sprint<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> only<00:01:37.590> reason<00:01:37.829> i<00:01:37.890> would<00:01:38.009> really

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to sprint the only reason i would really

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.249 
to sprint the only reason i would really
ever<00:01:38.460> use<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.479> i<00:01:39.630> needed<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> bring<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
ever use this is if i needed to bring it

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.200 
ever use this is if i needed to bring it
back<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.500> sprint<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:40.920> any<00:01:41.070> reason<00:01:41.520> but

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
back to sprint for any reason but

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.270 
back to sprint for any reason but
honestly<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.530> honest<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:43.920> don't

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
honestly to be honest I really don't
