00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.719
 think sum of three and one eighth plus three 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.820
 rooms more in kin - two in one 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.210
 basket we have two positive numbers leaves 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:22.720
 draw a number line 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:26.419
 Let's start with 31 eighth 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:35.329
 this is zero and we have one two three and we have 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:39.379
 4 1 1 2 3 and 4 3 1 8 will be right here 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.449
 let me draw the absolute value 3 in 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.879
 eighth 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.699
 will be 3 in eighth 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.850
 to the right of zero but is exactly 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:54.710
 this distance from zero to the right 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.570
 the achievement of this arrow is 31 eighth 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.550
 when we have fractions with different 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.350
 illuminators like to deal with them 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.480
 such as improper fractions that make 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.780
 add subtraction multiplication and division 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.170
 much easier then 31 eighth is the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.710
 same thing as eight times three that is 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:18.440
 equal to 24 plus one of 25 eighths 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.570
 so this here is 25 out of 8 that the same 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.590
 thing that three in eighth another form of 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.990
 To do this is 33 and 24 on eight and you 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.940
 adds the eighth and has 25 out of eight 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.830
 so our starting point to this 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.130
 Let's add three rooms 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:38.000
 Let's add three rooms Let's move 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.680
 three more rooms drawing and stretching 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.590
 this arrows three more to the right 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.880
 this length is three quarters to the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.660
 right then this leads us to need 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.380
 added 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.260
 we have 25 octaves plus three quarters the mmc 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:04.520
 minimum common multiple of 4 and 8 is eight 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.920
 then both are positive in mmc and then 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 we can take them and make sure 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.930
 have the same denominators then 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.969
 we will then have three rooms which is equal to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.969
 6 eighths then that number right here at 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:19.540
 31 on eight then gets 25 eighths +6 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.379
 eighths equal 31 octaves 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.560
 we need to find a denominator 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:29.299
 shared a common denominator or at least 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.739
 something that is divisible by 4 and 8 which is 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:37.370
 eight 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:40.310
 this number right here is 31 eighths 31 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.829
 over eight this will give something about eight 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.450
 to get four out of eight 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.969
 we have to multiply by two and so 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.069
 we have to multiply three by four 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:55.519
 also makes sense because 32 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.379
 about eight would be 4 and that number should 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.220
 be a little smaller 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:04.310
 thirty-two eighths is equal to four 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.959
 thus 31 eighths 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:14.120
 is a little less than 4 compliance 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:17.799
 this arrow is 31 octaves to write 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.939
 as the mixed number 31 eighths is equal to 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.310
 37 eighths 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.810
 now we need to add - two in 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.940
 a basket then we have to add a 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.430
 negative number 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.720
 so let's think about it 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.530
 how is 6 6th as would be minus 2 in a 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.470
 basket 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:42.160
 let me do it in a new color 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:45.770
 Let's do this with pink. 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.470
 so let's add minus two and one 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:55.340
 sixth and over 12 positive and a sense and 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.099
 we can draw 21 6th so we can 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.019
 draw an arrow that looks like this 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.780
 we can think of two different ways 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.580
 when we add - two in a basket and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.800
 we can draw an arrow similar to 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.110
 This is when you raise this arrow. 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.180
 to the left and adds minus two in one 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.610
 basket is the same as adding 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.269
 two in a basket the same as 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:22.460
 add - two and one basket this value 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:25.820
 will be the difference between 31 octaves and 21 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.820
 6th of 38 years we subtract two in one 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.910
 basket and is the same as subtracting and 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.460
 Let's end with the number whose value 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.660
 absolute in absolute value 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:44.060
 it will be something like this an absolute number like this 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:51.620
 this value in orange 31 over 8 -2 and one 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:56.630
 sixth - two and one sixth then 21 6th 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.570
 equal to 13 baskets two and a basket is the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:05.960
 same thing six times two is 12 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:08.600
 plus a 13 - 13 on six and that is 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:18.020
 same but let me see the least multiple 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:23.990
 common here the 24th mmc of 8 and 6 is 2431 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:29.080
 eighth is equal to 93 over 24 and 13 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:32.560
 baskets equal to fifty-two on 24 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:38.660
 so let me clarify this 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:41.389
 this is the 31 on 8 on 24 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.510
 You have to multiply by three to 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:51.020
 arrive at 24 then we multiply by 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:52.610
 three the 31 and this gives 93 and there we go of the 6 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.350
 to 24 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.020
 you have to multiply by four to one 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.450
 do in another color and multiply by 4 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.120
 to 1 up also four times 10 and 40 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:08.160
 four times three is 1252 this is going to be 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:12.240
 equal to 93-52 for 24-52 is about 24 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:17.130
 equal to 41 over 24 and that is 3 - 2 is 19 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.020
 -5 4 then 4141 on 24 is positive and 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.360
 you can see this here in this numbered line 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.520
 this is 41 out of 24 this is a little 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.190
 less than two because two would be 48 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.550
 about 24 and this makes sense to be less than 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.550
 what 2
