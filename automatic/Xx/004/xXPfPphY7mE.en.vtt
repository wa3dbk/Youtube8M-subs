00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 i 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello guys how are you ramsar and here 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.969
 we are back in minecraft with my 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.309
 Christmas skeleton and this house 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.550
 fantastic that I just did a little while 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.290
 that is great, great, but not 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.250
 because it is a different house that already 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.470
 You see that the structure is a little 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.449
 different is to say the format but 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.670
 because with these two pressure plates 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 I'm going to open the two doors very well 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.090
 many will say with simple lines do not we 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.090
 will allow the boy only to compensate 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.640
 a plate I open the two doors as much 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.739
 logical is that everyone says very 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 easy as we put reston directly 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.239
 from that pressure plate to both 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.390
 doors but guys that way not 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.800
 open opens a yes and a not many of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.750
 you have asked me to do the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.010
 tutorial on how to do this many of 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.149
 you were telling me that what 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.860
 try to do the most 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.309
 simple and did not give island 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.989
 the combination so that it could be in 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.059
 around to do a tutorial I already had it 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.219
 in an old house is this this 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.960
 mechanism but I wanted to share it from the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.340
 easiest way I've adapted it a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.110
 little bit to the easiest and most 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.060
 simple to explain it since it is a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.440
 tutorial that will go very quickly now 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.670
 You see how everyone goes, they stay super 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.439
 happy with how it is done 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.930
 the first thing we have to do guys 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:17.110
 let's make a hole let's finish one 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.330
 depth of three depth three 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.240
 but they are seven in width by three of 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.509
 long sorry for 5 7 for 5 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.080
 here we already have 65 27 and here we go one 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.549
 depth of 3 is worth so far 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.740
 I want that simple stretch good me 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.320
 I adjusted the match Lazio 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.710
 depth that are three in the world of 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.000
 this one is flat and I did not know guys 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.950
 I know that many of you carry it 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.990
 asking for both private message and 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.700
 by messages in another one of the others in 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.140
 the videos and robert I was going back to 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.450
 do it the truth that it costs me nothing 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.090
 to explain it as I did in my 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.640
 world since it's a pretty way 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.530
 simple but at the same time complicated is 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.390
 say the mechanism seems so simple 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.490
 the of the 2 pressure plate with two 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.709
 doors then very simple is to say rest 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.959
 no palante but no guys it's not like that 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.179
 pay attention you see 7 by 5 by 3 of 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.979
 depth I'm going to place 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.170
 yago carollo with blue wool so you see 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.079
 the difference I will place two blocks 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.910
 here two others here and two others here 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.920
 you see with space in the middle vale has 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.410
 2 to one side and 3 to the other one 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.930
 where he has 3 I will place a block 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 more I'm going to place torch torch in 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.030
 medium and torch there we are not going to torch 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.090
 on this side of here perfect I'm going to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.130
 place redstone that an all for this 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.080
 zone here evaporates and neither does 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.420
 up here here here I will 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.860
 unite everything all everything all everything here 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.290
 around here around here around here 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.790
 here until here I'm going to join this and this 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.010
 then one is activated and another 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.360
 disabled that is the trick guys have 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.190
 that getting current to one and the other does not 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.930
 so that they open both at the same time if not 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.940
 it opens yes and no then 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.500
 place there just over wood here 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.420
 over just in wood that can be 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.950
 another thing and here wood and I 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.300
 I'm going to place the two doors you see 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.970
 that this is going super fast here I am going to 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.670
 place prota pressure and here plate to 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.230
 pressure to this and for the moment that stepped on 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.910
 let's see what there is this has 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.100
 fall you see that the two ropes come out 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.780
 and what fell on me , nothing happens 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.430
 well guys theoretically open the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.720
 two doors at a time and you see what happens 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.670
 that sometimes for a bit of the subject of 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.260
 the practice opens one before another but 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.330
 it does not open the two for that the guys 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.250
 because the current is continuous 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.060
 then you see that it is a super tutorial 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.510
 simple 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.910
 how to open two doors with forgiveness 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.709
 with pressure plates is a tutorial of the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.630
 rest the truth that I hope that I have 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.700
 liked that is the simple way that what 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.730
 I've done guys if you want more 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.870
 tutorials I already know that many of you 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.489
 you like many of you 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.170
 you identify my channel with tutorials from 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.670
 record neither of pistons for not having 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.440
 No problem tell me and I try 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.060
 clarify those doubts that you have good 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.760
 here I am finishing my house you see 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.260
 that the way I made it and come back 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.209
 to see again you see again the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.880
 better the derivation mechanism sme with 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.709
 but they are a mechanism of use 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.660
 that you see that pretty simple with 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.670
 a single pressure plate open the two 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.180
 doors and nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.459
 liked nothing I will tell you that nothing 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.290
 you give him alai if you want more tutorials and 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.690
 more minecraft and more rest or more 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.890
 Pistons share social networks 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.480
 to subscribe that you are not subscribed is 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.010
 very important not to subscribe because 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.470
 so you see my videos every time 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.109
 take out in the feed this add it to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.070
 favorites and other guys see you in 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.070
 Minecraft
