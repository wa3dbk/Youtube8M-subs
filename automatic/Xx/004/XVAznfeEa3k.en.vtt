really<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> fast<00:01:13.979> process<00:01:14.520> either<00:01:14.670> way<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
really is a fast process either way so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.109 
really is a fast process either way so
on<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.740> allow<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> choose<00:01:17.790> from

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
be created from so I'm going to just

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.289 
be created from so I'm going to just
choose<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.950> camera<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
choose my camera and then I'm going to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
choose my camera and then I'm going to
hit<00:01:24.390> create<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> create

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
hit create so now it's going to create

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
hit create so now it's going to create
the<00:01:26.189> mosaic<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> pictures<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> my

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the mosaic out of all the pictures of my

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
the mosaic out of all the pictures of my
camera<00:01:28.020> roll<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> repeat

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
camera roll and it is going to repeat

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.649 
camera roll and it is going to repeat
them<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> lot<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
them because I don't have a lot of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.499 
them because I don't have a lot of
pictures<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:32.000> let's<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.210> how<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.450> works

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
pictures but let's see how this works

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.600 
pictures but let's see how this works
it's<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.350> quick<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.860> then<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.520> go

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it's really quick and then you can go
