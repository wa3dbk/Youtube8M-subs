and all of that got shipped over to me

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.160 
and all of that got shipped over to me
and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.720> took<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.900> from<00:01:22.020> there<00:01:22.260> so<00:01:24.170> the

and I kind of took it from there so the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
and I kind of took it from there so the
first<00:01:25.320> stage<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.460> getting<00:01:26.940> stuck

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
into this car was to kind of figure out

into this car was to kind of figure out
you<00:01:29.940> know<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.240> good<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> shape<00:01:30.810> everything<00:01:31.320> was

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
you know how good a shape everything was

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.570 
you know how good a shape everything was
in<00:01:32.690> so<00:01:33.690> that<00:01:33.780> involved<00:01:34.350> taking<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.190> body<00:01:35.370> off

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
in so that involved taking the body off

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.180 
in so that involved taking the body off
the<00:01:35.610> chassis<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:37.020> inspecting<00:01:37.770> how<00:01:38.010> much

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
the chassis and then inspecting how much

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.980 
the chassis and then inspecting how much
damage<00:01:38.520> had<00:01:38.790> been<00:01:38.820> done<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.420> car<00:01:39.630> over<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
damage had been done to the car over the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.020 
damage had been done to the car over the
50<00:01:40.229> plus<00:01:40.410> years<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> its<00:01:40.979> life<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.490> quickly

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
50 plus years of its life and quickly

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.460 
50 plus years of its life and quickly
what<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> found<00:01:42.330> out<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.660> this<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
what I found out with this one is that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
what I found out with this one is that
it<00:01:43.979> probably<00:01:44.190> hit<00:01:44.580> every<00:01:45.030> other<00:01:45.119> car<00:01:45.450> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it probably hit every other car in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.380 
it probably hit every other car in
Atlanta<00:01:46.400> there<00:01:47.400> wasn't<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.670> corner<00:01:47.970> untouched

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
Atlanta there wasn't a corner untouched

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
Atlanta there wasn't a corner untouched
when<00:01:48.690> it<00:01:48.780> came<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.050> damage<00:01:49.410> so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.979> knew<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.369> had

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
when it came to damage so I knew I had

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.520 
when it came to damage so I knew I had
my<00:01:50.820> work<00:01:51.060> cut<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.900> is<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.080> fiberglass

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
my work cut out this is a fiberglass

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
my work cut out this is a fiberglass
body<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.940> as<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.750> kind<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
body it's not as if you can just kind of

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
body it's not as if you can just kind of
weld<00:01:55.200> panels<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.920> everything<00:01:56.430> bonded

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
weld panels on everything bonded

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
weld panels on everything bonded
together<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.200> bit<00:01:58.410> more

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
together so it's a little bit more

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.710 
together so it's a little bit more
tricky<00:01:58.890> I<00:02:01.759> knew<00:02:02.759> from<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.970> outset<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.479> this

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
tricky I knew from the outset that this

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.960 
tricky I knew from the outset that this
needed<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.259> modern<00:02:04.590> GM<00:02:04.860> motor<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.460> chose<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
needed a modern GM motor so I chose the

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.780 
needed a modern GM motor so I chose the
LS<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:06.720> into<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.080> car<00:02:07.700> there's<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
LS one to go into this car there's a

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.960 
LS one to go into this car there's a
large<00:02:09.060> v8<00:02:09.500> 5.7<00:02:10.500> liter<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.370> mountings<00:02:11.820> are

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
large v8 5.7 liter all the mountings are

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.729 
large v8 5.7 liter all the mountings are
going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.239> different<00:02:12.600> for<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.320> the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
going to be different for it so the

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.350 
going to be different for it so the
first<00:02:14.010> job<00:02:14.250> was<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.580> sort<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.820> see<00:02:15.120> whether

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
first job was to sort of see whether

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.699 
first job was to sort of see whether
that<00:02:15.570> engine<00:02:15.900> will<00:02:16.019> fit<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.410> where<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> was

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
that engine will fit and where it was

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.660 
that engine will fit and where it was
going<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.950> fit<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> car<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.590> LS<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.220> was

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
going to fit in the car the LS one was

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.030 
going to fit in the car the LS one was
350<00:02:21.390> brake<00:02:21.540> balls<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.739> valve<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
350 brake balls have to the valve the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.970 
350 brake balls have to the valve the
box<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.780> felt<00:02:24.780> for<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.200> sleeper<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.860> was

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
box I felt for a sleeper that was

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.310 
box I felt for a sleeper that was
probably<00:02:26.280> enough<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> more<00:02:27.780> horsepower

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
probably enough and the more horsepower

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.780 
probably enough and the more horsepower
you<00:02:28.680> put<00:02:28.860> into<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.610> to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you put into that then you have to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.790 
you put into that then you have to
consider<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.420> whole<00:02:30.450> Drive<00:02:30.840> chain<00:02:31.200> from<00:02:31.590> from

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
consider the whole Drive chain from from

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.650 
consider the whole Drive chain from from
there<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.310> which<00:02:32.670> means<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:33.180> bigger<00:02:33.480> bit

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
there on in which means a bigger bit

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.500 
there on in which means a bigger bit
brakes<00:02:33.930> bigger<00:02:34.290> tires<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.100> then<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.269> start

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
brakes bigger tires and then you start

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.090 
brakes bigger tires and then you start
compromising<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.590> don't<00:02:37.860> get<00:02:38.040> that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
compromising and you don't get that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.500 
compromising and you don't get that
stopper<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.910> want

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
stopper that I want

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.630 
stopper that I want
and<00:02:41.510> modify<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.020> rims<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.770> make<00:02:42.950> them<00:02:43.190> more

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
and modify the rims to make them more

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.520 
and modify the rims to make them more

more<00:02:45.680> power<00:02:46.450> I've<00:02:47.450> actually<00:02:47.630> moved

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
more power I've actually moved

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.560 
more power I've actually moved
everything<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.370> extended<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.880> rims<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.330> so

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
everything in so extended the rims in so

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.390 
everything in so extended the rims in so
they<00:02:50.660> don't<00:02:50.690> poke<00:02:51.080> out<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.530> then<00:02:51.650> fabricated

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
they don't poke out and then fabricated

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.260 
they don't poke out and then fabricated
them<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.730> could<00:02:52.910> actually<00:02:52.970> put<00:02:53.210> the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
them so I could actually put the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.010 
them so I could actually put the
original<00:02:53.540> hubcaps<00:02:53.690> back<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.410> there<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.960> know

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
original hubcaps back in there you know

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.110 
original hubcaps back in there you know
these<00:02:57.470> were<00:02:57.650> beautiful<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.340> didn't<00:02:58.910> want<00:02:59.030> to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
these were beautiful and didn't want to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.790 
these were beautiful and didn't want to
change<00:02:59.360> them<00:02:59.630> but<00:02:59.930> indicators<00:03:00.590> have<00:03:00.740> been

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
change them but indicators have been

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.670 
change them but indicators have been
amber<00:03:01.280> what<00:03:01.700> actually<00:03:02.000> did<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.680> incorporate

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
amber what actually did is I incorporate

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.010 
amber what actually did is I incorporate
an<00:03:04.160> extra<00:03:04.520> indicator<00:03:04.850> down<00:03:05.030> here<00:03:05.300> that's

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
an extra indicator down here that's

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.330 
an extra indicator down here that's
actually<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.410> motor<00:03:06.680> bike<00:03:06.830> one<00:03:07.160> off<00:03:07.250> a

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.930 

so<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.250> car<00:03:11.430> would<00:03:11.520> have<00:03:11.640> originally<00:03:11.760> come

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
so the car would have originally come

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.570 
so the car would have originally come
with<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> 17<00:03:12.660> inch<00:03:12.900> steering<00:03:13.380> wheel<00:03:13.580> the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
with a 17 inch steering wheel the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.950 
with a 17 inch steering wheel the
challenge<00:03:14.880> for<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.030> 17<00:03:15.390> year<00:03:15.480> steering<00:03:15.840> wheel

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
challenge for the 17 year steering wheel

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.630 
challenge for the 17 year steering wheel
is<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.380> imagine<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:17.070> sticking<00:03:17.490> out<00:03:17.610> a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
is you can imagine that sticking out a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.490 
is you can imagine that sticking out a
little<00:03:17.820> bit<00:03:18.060> further<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.900> then<00:03:19.050> every<00:03:19.260> time

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
little bit further and then every time

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.930 
little bit further and then every time
they<00:03:19.710> sort<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.040> turned<00:03:20.250> right<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.700> would<00:03:20.820> hit

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
they sort of turned right you would hit

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.880 
they sort of turned right you would hit
this<00:03:21.060> door<00:03:21.300> handle<00:03:21.630> with<00:03:22.020> your<00:03:22.050> arm<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.710> and

this door handle with your arm and and
invariably<00:03:23.490> open<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.820> door<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.210> went

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
invariably open the door as you went

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.000 
invariably open the door as you went
around<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> corner<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.470> what<00:03:25.620> I've<00:03:25.710> done<00:03:25.860> is

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
around the corner so what I've done is

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.980 
around the corner so what I've done is
put<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.190> 15-inch<00:03:26.730> steering<00:03:27.060> wheel<00:03:27.240> and<00:03:27.540> works

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
put a 15-inch steering wheel and works

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.240 
put a 15-inch steering wheel and works
well<00:03:28.140> when<00:03:28.260> you've<00:03:28.380> got<00:03:28.470> power<00:03:28.650> steering<00:03:28.800> so

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
well when you've got power steering so

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.500 
well when you've got power steering so
this<00:03:29.580> thing<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.210> turn<00:03:30.360> my<00:03:30.510> finger<00:03:30.870> I

this thing you can just turn my finger I

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.330 
this thing you can just turn my finger I
believe<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.690> key<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:33.990> actually<00:03:34.200> put<00:03:34.410> keyless

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
and I felt that if GM have had that

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.659 
and I felt that if GM have had that
technology<00:04:41.110> available<00:04:41.590> when<00:04:42.400> they<00:04:42.490> built

this car in 58 they would put it in the

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:58.400 
this car in 58 they would put it in the
car<00:04:44.350> so<00:04:44.710> yeah<00:04:45.130> why<00:04:45.370> not

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.410 

from<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.070> moment<00:04:59.310> I<00:04:59.550> got<00:04:59.730> in<00:04:59.790> it<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.030> drove<00:05:00.120> it

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420
