okay<00:00:05.870> okay<00:00:06.080> because<00:00:06.920> I<00:00:07.069> only<00:00:07.399> wanted<00:00:07.700> three

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
okay okay because I only wanted three

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.980 
okay okay because I only wanted three
levels<00:00:08.180> of<00:00:08.240> lakes<00:00:08.540> and<00:00:08.600> it's<00:00:08.780> only<00:00:08.900> about

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
levels of lakes and it's only about

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.450 
levels of lakes and it's only about
eleven

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
eleven

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.330 
eleven
between<00:00:10.300> brilliant<00:00:10.840> redheads<00:00:11.290> but<00:00:11.920> the<00:00:12.070> upper

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
between brilliant redheads but the upper

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.090 
between brilliant redheads but the upper
track<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.200> face<00:00:14.410> you<00:00:14.559> know<00:00:14.590> people<00:00:14.950> get

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
track and the face you know people get

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.680 
track and the face you know people get
hung<00:00:15.280> up<00:00:15.370> us<00:00:15.580> we're<00:00:15.760> gonna<00:00:15.850> have<00:00:15.969> exactly<00:00:16.390> two

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
hung up us we're gonna have exactly two

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.240 
hung up us we're gonna have exactly two
inches<00:00:16.720> between<00:00:17.110> all<00:00:17.440> parts<00:00:17.860> of<00:00:17.920> all<00:00:18.070> levels

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
inches between all parts of all levels

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.120 
inches between all parts of all levels
and<00:00:18.580> my<00:00:19.570> experience<00:00:20.050> after<00:00:20.230> having<00:00:21.040> this

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
and my experience after having this

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.470 
and my experience after having this
thing<00:00:21.310> for<00:00:21.430> from<00:00:21.610> five<00:00:26.189> well<00:00:27.189> it's<00:00:27.790> based<00:00:28.329> on

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
thing for from five well it's based on

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.370 
thing for from five well it's based on
the<00:00:28.630> appropriate<00:00:29.110> prototype<00:00:29.560> design

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the appropriate prototype design

00:00:31.380 --> 00:01:16.430 
the appropriate prototype design
solution

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.320 

six<00:01:17.440> times<00:01:17.619> just<00:01:17.800> long<00:01:18.039> when<00:01:18.940> this<00:01:19.090> thing<00:01:19.300> is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
six times just long when this thing is

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.420 
six times just long when this thing is
done<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.869> prototype<00:01:20.259> like<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.890> was<00:01:21.039> making

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
done to prototype like that was making

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.779 
done to prototype like that was making
yeah<00:01:21.850> that's<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.899> Walters<00:01:23.430> thing<00:01:24.430> over<00:01:24.670> there

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
yeah that's a Walters thing over there

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:33.330 
yeah that's a Walters thing over there
rocket<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.990> if<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:32.200> can<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.590> can<00:01:32.710> find<00:01:32.740> seven

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
rocket and if you can you can find seven

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.070 
rocket and if you can you can find seven
different<00:01:33.520> structures<00:01:34.179> your<00:01:34.750> model

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
different structures your model

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.490 
different structures your model
structures<00:01:35.440> over<00:01:35.679> Kip<00:01:35.860> fetch<00:01:36.070> for<00:01:36.310> this<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
structures over Kip fetch for this and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.200 
structures over Kip fetch for this and
the<00:01:38.500> moment<00:01:38.740> extracted<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:42.850> sliding

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
the moment extracted it's a sliding

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.460 
the moment extracted it's a sliding
board<00:01:43.600> slides<00:01:44.409> over<00:01:45.000> kind<00:01:46.000> yeah<00:01:46.900> sense<00:01:47.170> behind

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
board slides over kind yeah sense behind

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.060 
board slides over kind yeah sense behind
so<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:48.549> know<00:01:48.640> what<00:01:48.880> you're<00:01:49.030> looking<00:01:49.299> at<00:01:49.450> is

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
so you know what you're looking at is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.410 
so you know what you're looking at is
you<00:01:51.070> know<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.549> freestanding<00:01:52.479> right<00:01:52.780> here

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.679 

yeah

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
yeah

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:17.610 
yeah
yes<00:01:59.200> oh<00:02:00.479> yes<00:02:15.060> then<00:02:16.060> what<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.299> wasn't<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.870> you

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
yes oh yes then what it wasn't it you

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.259 
yes oh yes then what it wasn't it you
know<00:02:17.739> twisted<00:02:18.430> cross<00:02:18.610> elevation<00:02:19.150> right

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
know twisted cross elevation right

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.830 
know twisted cross elevation right
here's<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:21.640> would<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.820> call<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.720> not

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
here's what would you call it it's not

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:37.740 
here's what would you call it it's not
super<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:24.670> not<00:02:24.820> super<00:02:25.000> elevation

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.449 

no<00:02:38.750> there's<00:02:39.379> only<00:02:39.500> one<00:02:39.739> car<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.010> will<00:02:40.280> stay

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
no there's only one car that will stay

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.729 
no there's only one car that will stay
on<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.700> rail<00:02:40.970> room<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.599> we<00:02:42.200> can<00:02:42.290> avoid<00:02:42.560> it

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
on this rail room and we can avoid it

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.050 
on this rail room and we can avoid it
most<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> time<00:02:43.099> it'd<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:43.730> nice<00:02:43.849> if<00:02:43.879> you<00:02:44.030> showed

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
most the time it'd be nice if you showed

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.979 
most the time it'd be nice if you showed
up<00:02:44.239> at<00:02:44.390> least<00:02:44.480> once

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
up at least once

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.000 
up at least once

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
okay yes he does you know Rick's for

00:02:49.010 --> 00:03:03.280 
okay yes he does you know Rick's for
medicine<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:02.720> I'm<00:03:02.840> happy<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.260> answer

like yeah we stayed over saying it's a
clinic<00:03:17.030> went<00:03:17.209> on<00:03:17.299> till<00:03:17.480> 9:30<00:03:17.799> because<00:03:18.799> it<00:03:19.099> is

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
clinic went on till 9:30 because it is

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.069 
clinic went on till 9:30 because it is
stated<00:03:19.459> yeah<00:03:19.790> about<00:03:20.090> another<00:03:20.329> hour<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.840> Yanis

stated yeah about another hour and Yanis

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.130 
stated yeah about another hour and Yanis
make<00:03:21.260> sharp<00:03:21.530> lines<00:03:21.739> yes<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.700> really<00:03:23.690> seriously

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140

who came up to the esterday an amazing

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.120 
who came up to the esterday an amazing
device<00:03:35.780> that<00:03:36.049> is<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.440> should<00:03:36.470> think<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.950> should

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
device that is I should think I should

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.530 
device that is I should think I should
take<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.609> Des<00:03:37.819> Moines

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
take this to Des Moines

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.170 
take this to Des Moines
these<00:03:39.200> were<00:03:39.470> we<00:03:40.280> doing<00:03:40.430> whatever<00:03:40.760> they<00:03:40.970> said
