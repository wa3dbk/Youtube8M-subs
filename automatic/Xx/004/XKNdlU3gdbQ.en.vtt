00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
go and throw a semtex against the wall

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160 
go and throw a semtex against the wall
and<00:00:29.220> right<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.390> right<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:30.960> it

explodes you want to switch class now
you'll<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.570> did<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:34.020> views

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
you'll know you did this right views

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
you'll know you did this right views
will<00:00:34.380> bypass<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.550> time<00:00:35.760> delay<00:00:35.940> for

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
will bypass the the time delay for

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
will bypass the the time delay for
spawning<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:37.410> guys<00:00:37.500> will<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.800> put<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> five

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
spawning you guys will see I put a five

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400 
spawning you guys will see I put a five
second<00:00:38.730> time<00:00:38.879> delay<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.719> normal<00:00:40.050> ones<00:00:40.200> 10

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
second time delay at the normal ones 10

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
second time delay at the normal ones 10
but<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.649> put<00:00:40.829> five<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.340> i<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.579> wait<00:00:41.730> as

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
but I put five just so i have to wait as

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.520 
but I put five just so i have to wait as
long<00:00:41.940> because<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> tricky<00:00:43.260> Lidge

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
long because it is kind of tricky Lidge

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
long because it is kind of tricky Lidge
to<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> hang<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> can

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to get the hang of but I'm as you can

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
to get the hang of but I'm as you can
see<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.020> times<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.350> would<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> correctly

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
see as the times I would do it correctly

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
see as the times I would do it correctly
I<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.789> completely<00:00:48.120> bypassed<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> time<00:00:48.899> but

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I just completely bypassed the time but

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630 
I just completely bypassed the time but
for<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.500> reason<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.950> didn't<00:00:50.219> come<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.489> me

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
for some reason if I didn't come with me

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
for some reason if I didn't come with me
that's<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.800> works

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that's what I like get it like works

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.380 
that's what I like get it like works
half<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.280> time<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.300> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
half the time but there are time you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.029 
half the time but there are time you
just<00:00:54.510> spawn<00:00:54.750> right<00:00:54.870> away<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.710> still<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
just spawn right away which is still a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.729 
just spawn right away which is still a
good<00:00:56.219> glitch<00:00:56.460> inside<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.120> glitch<00:00:57.360> but

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
good glitch inside of this glitch but

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
good glitch inside of this glitch but
basically<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> main<00:00:59.010> glitch<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.579> grab

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
basically the main glitch is just grab

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750 
basically the main glitch is just grab
the<00:01:00.359> flag<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> wall

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the flag and you want to go up to a wall

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
the flag and you want to go up to a wall
or<00:01:02.789> car<00:01:03.120> something<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> will<00:01:04.019> make<00:01:04.049> sure

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
or car something that will make sure

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.260 
or car something that will make sure
that<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.500> die<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.060> blast

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that you die because I think with blast

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.670 
that you die because I think with blast
shield<00:01:06.570> wait<00:01:06.990> he's<00:01:07.080> black<00:01:07.290> she'll<00:01:07.470> even<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
shield wait he's black she'll even a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.410 
shield wait he's black she'll even a
perk<00:01:07.920> yeah<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> think<00:01:08.670> black<00:01:08.939> shield<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> perk

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
perk yeah I think black shield the perk

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.149 
perk yeah I think black shield the perk
but<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.200> black<00:01:10.380> shield<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> subtext

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
but if you have black shield the subtext

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.740 
but if you have black shield the subtext
won't<00:01:11.310> kill<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.600> up<00:01:12.659> to
