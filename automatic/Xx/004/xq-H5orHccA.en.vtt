give<00:01:38.180> rice<00:01:38.540> considerations<00:01:39.500> simply<00:01:39.860> because

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
give rice considerations simply because

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.550 
give rice considerations simply because
of<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.580> setting<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.380> people<00:01:42.380> that

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
academic setting what's different is of

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.450 
academic setting what's different is of

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
course the wonderful technology that's

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.990 
course the wonderful technology that's
available<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.300> rooms<00:02:02.510> its<00:02:02.840> reliability

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
available in the rooms its reliability

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.570 
available in the rooms its reliability
sometimes<00:02:05.000> what<00:02:05.270> effects<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.400> content<00:02:07.400> of<00:02:07.520> a

they bring with them to the workshop and
I<00:02:13.970> find<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:14.750> usually<00:02:15.019> it's<00:02:15.470> very<00:02:15.739> very

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
I find that here usually it's very very

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.730 
I find that here usually it's very very
good

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
good

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.310 
good
make<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.550> big<00:02:17.970> component<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.540> also<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.960> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
it's partly the fact that IV teachers

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.740 
it's partly the fact that IV teachers
are<00:03:54.120> special<00:03:54.570> people<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:55.940> are<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.600> very
