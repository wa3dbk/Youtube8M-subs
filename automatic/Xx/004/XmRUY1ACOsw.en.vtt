these if you hold it by the forend with
a<00:02:44.609> revolver<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.359> always<00:02:45.569> have<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> little<00:02:45.989> bit

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
a revolver you always have a little bit

that shave when that bullet goes through

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.559 
that shave when that bullet goes through
the<00:02:51.060> forcing<00:02:51.569> cones<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:53.150> you'd<00:02:54.150> hold<00:02:54.420> this

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
the forcing cones and so you'd hold this

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.559

braced against your shoulder like that

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.300 
braced against your shoulder like that
or<00:02:57.569> else<00:02:57.780> you'd<00:02:57.959> wear<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.200> very<00:02:58.439> heavy<00:02:58.739> gauntlet

and hope nothing big enough to penetrate
the<00:03:01.799> gauntlet<00:03:02.250> got<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.639> it<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.209> revolving

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
the gauntlet got to it but revolving

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.270 
the gauntlet got to it but revolving
