00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
players he also came up with a very

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.990 
players he also came up with a very
interesting<00:03:22.310> line<00:03:22.820> I<00:03:22.850> thought<00:03:23.270> that's<00:03:23.540> a

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
interesting line I thought that's a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.190 
interesting line I thought that's a
along<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> lines<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.360> wolves<00:03:26.900> players

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
along the lines that wolves players

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.890 
along the lines that wolves players
should<00:03:27.500> really<00:03:27.739> make<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.100> most<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.900> their

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
should really make the most of their

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.710 
should really make the most of their
environment<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.950> he<00:03:31.100> talked<00:03:31.760> about<00:03:31.880> working

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
environment and he talked about working

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.690 
environment and he talked about working
working<00:03:33.560> at<00:03:33.800> wolves<00:03:33.950> he's<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:34.340> working<00:03:34.670> for

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
working at wolves he's like working for

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.110 
working at wolves he's like working for
a<00:03:34.880> five-star<00:03:35.390> hotel<00:03:36.280> where<00:03:37.280> by<00:03:37.459> everything<00:03:37.880> is

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
a five-star hotel where by everything is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.780 
a five-star hotel where by everything is
there<00:03:38.360> for<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:39.260> squad<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.370> be<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.700> be

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
there for the squad to be to be

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.430 
there for the squad to be to be
successful<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.480> again<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.050> found<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.380> really

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
successful and again I found that really

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.759 
successful and again I found that really
interesting<00:03:43.160> because<00:03:44.120> really<00:03:44.810> walls<00:03:45.320> future

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
interesting because really walls future

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.550 
interesting because really walls future
is<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:45.950> these<00:03:46.250> players<00:03:46.760> hands<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.560> there's

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
is in these players hands and there's

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.070 
is in these players hands and there's
perhaps<00:03:48.680> an<00:03:48.890> inference<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:51.019> know

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
perhaps an inference that that you know

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.900 
perhaps an inference that that you know
there<00:03:51.620> can<00:03:51.709> be<00:03:51.769> no<00:03:51.920> excuses<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:52.580> them<00:03:52.700> not

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
there can be no excuses for them not

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.729 
there can be no excuses for them not
getting<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.420> very<00:03:53.510> best<00:03:53.660> out<00:03:54.110> of<00:03:54.140> them<00:03:54.440> their

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
getting the very best out of them their

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.940 
getting the very best out of them their
own<00:03:54.769> performances<00:03:55.630> because<00:03:56.630> they<00:03:57.049> can<00:03:57.260> make

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
own performances because they can make

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.949 
own performances because they can make
the<00:03:58.100> use<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:59.000> tremendous<00:03:59.180> facilities

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
the use of the tremendous facilities

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.470 
the use of the tremendous facilities
available<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.739> them<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.180> hopefully<00:04:02.180> lead

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
available to them and hopefully lead

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.400 
available to them and hopefully lead
lead<00:04:03.019> walls<00:04:03.230> 22<00:04:03.799> promotion<00:04:08.290> well<00:04:09.290> it's

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
lead walls 22 promotion well it's

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.229 
lead walls 22 promotion well it's
difficult<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:10.100> look<00:04:10.340> beyond<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.610> wolves<00:04:11.000> win

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
difficult to look beyond the wolves win

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.449 
difficult to look beyond the wolves win
because<00:04:12.140> they<00:04:12.470> they<00:04:12.769> just<00:04:12.980> look<00:04:13.160> unbeatable

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
because they they just look unbeatable

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.670 
because they they just look unbeatable
at<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:13.910> level<00:04:14.120> at<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.360> moment<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.810> mean<00:04:15.650> I
