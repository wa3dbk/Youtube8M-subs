out so we have that on both sides and
that's<00:03:15.859> basically<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.930> basic<00:03:17.930> oh<00:03:18.349> wait<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.889> have

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:19.009 
that's basically a basic oh wait we have

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.969 
that's basically a basic oh wait we have
one<00:03:19.220> more<00:03:19.400> thing<00:03:19.639> we<00:03:20.299> have<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.979> ventilation

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:21.979 
one more thing we have a ventilation
