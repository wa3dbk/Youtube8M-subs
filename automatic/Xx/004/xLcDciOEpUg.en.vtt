we wanted to do something with pirates
and<00:00:57.960> put<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> big<00:00:58.980> ride<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> big<00:00:59.789> splash

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and put a big ride with a big splash

and put a big ride with a big splash
sort<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> drop<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:03.589> we<00:01:04.589> came<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
sort of a drop here we came up with the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
sort of a drop here we came up with the
idea<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.729> having<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.479> shoot<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> shoot<00:01:07.200> ride

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
idea of having a shoot the shoot ride

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.609 
idea of having a shoot the shoot ride
which<00:01:07.710> creates<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.280> giant<00:01:08.700> splash<00:01:09.180> as<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:10.380> start

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
which creates a giant splash as we start

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.020 
which creates a giant splash as we start
to<00:01:10.740> talk<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.580> different<00:01:11.909> components

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
to talk about the different components

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.940 
to talk about the different components
of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> ride<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.229> start<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:13.830> about

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
of the ride we start to think about

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.550 
of the ride we start to think about
where<00:01:14.460> our<00:01:14.490> focal<00:01:15.119> point<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
where our focal point is going to be and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.429 
where our focal point is going to be and
in<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.280> case<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.850> wanted<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.540> Lego<00:01:18.840> pirate

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
in this case we wanted to Lego pirate

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.920 
in this case we wanted to Lego pirate
ships<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> key<00:01:20.790> point<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.570> people

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
ships to be the key point that people

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
ships to be the key point that people
would<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> attraction<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
would see in the attraction this is the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.090 
would see in the attraction this is the
passenger<00:01:24.570> vehicle<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.380> will<00:01:25.530> fit<00:01:25.740> 20

a big part of my job is not only

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.190 
a big part of my job is not only
building<00:02:02.030> with<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.270> Lego<00:02:02.570> bricks<00:02:02.870> but

in<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.720> ride<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.620> it<00:02:07.370> helps<00:02:07.700> us<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.119> create<00:02:08.450> a

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
in the ride and it helps us to create a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.110 
in the ride and it helps us to create a
way<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:09.220> determine<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:10.460> we<00:02:10.580> need<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.880> take<00:02:11.090> a

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
way to determine do we need to take a

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.970 
way to determine do we need to take a
new<00:02:11.360> direction<00:02:11.570> what<00:02:12.050> colors<00:02:12.470> are<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:12.800> going

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
new direction what colors are we going

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.980 
new direction what colors are we going
to<00:02:13.100> use<00:02:13.280> what<00:02:13.610> are<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.820> Lego<00:02:14.030> models<00:02:14.540> going<00:02:14.780> to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
to use what are the Lego models going to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.350 
to use what are the Lego models going to
be<00:02:15.170> as<00:02:15.980> we<00:02:16.160> were<00:02:16.250> thinking<00:02:16.610> about<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.000> pirate

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
be as we were thinking about the pirate

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.650 
be as we were thinking about the pirate
ship<00:02:17.570> design<00:02:17.960> we<00:02:18.140> actually<00:02:18.500> research<00:02:18.980> what

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
ship design we actually research what

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.050 
ship design we actually research what
European<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.230> Asian<00:02:21.590> pirate<00:02:22.340> ships<00:02:22.580> used<00:02:22.940> to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
European and Asian pirate ships used to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.560 
European and Asian pirate ships used to
look<00:02:23.240> like<00:02:23.270> throughout<00:02:23.780> history<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:26.360> other

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
look like throughout history the other

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.480 
look like throughout history the other
part<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.560> where<00:02:27.710> we<00:02:27.830> go<00:02:28.040> out<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
part of that is where we go out to the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.580 
part of that is where we go out to the
site<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.000> kind<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.690> figure<00:02:30.050> out<00:02:30.110> how

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
site and kind of figure out how

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.350 
site and kind of figure out how
everything<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.250> going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.550> layout<00:02:31.730> good

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
everything is going to layout good

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.720 
everything is going to layout good
landscaping<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.080> few<00:02:33.500> models<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.520> pathway

landscaping a few models on that pathway

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.790 
landscaping a few models on that pathway
and<00:02:35.330> where<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:35.810> want<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.110> angle<00:02:36.560> the
