plastic surgeons about a decade ago
found<00:00:11.970> that<00:00:12.360> our<00:00:12.840> patients<00:00:13.560> who<00:00:13.890> were

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
found that our patients who were

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.640 
found that our patients who were
receiving<00:00:14.610> Botox<00:00:15.570> therapy<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:16.529> even

would<00:00:19.980> come<00:00:20.220> back<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.730> say<00:00:20.940> gee<00:00:21.210> doc<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.860> know

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
would come back and say gee doc you know

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.710 
would come back and say gee doc you know
you<00:00:23.369> know<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.520> had<00:00:23.730> migraines<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.540> they're<00:00:24.690> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you know I had migraines and they're a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.490 
you know I had migraines and they're a
lot<00:00:24.840> better<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.370> this<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:27.030> really<00:00:27.630> led<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
lot better and so this this really led a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000 
lot better and so this this really led a
number<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.340> plastic<00:00:30.030> surgeons<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.110> think

number of plastic surgeons to think

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.250 
number of plastic surgeons to think
differently<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.489> migraines<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.840> and

differently about migraines and and and

differently about migraines and and and
as<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> group<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:34.949> really<00:00:35.129> started<00:00:35.730> exploring

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
as a group we really started exploring

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.460 
as a group we really started exploring
how<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.650> can<00:00:38.449> harness<00:00:39.449> this<00:00:39.930> newfound

predominantly in the front and we agreed

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.240 
predominantly in the front and we agreed
that<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.540> would<00:02:25.750> start<00:02:26.500> start<00:02:27.069> at<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.650 
these terrible migraines in the front
and<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.100> she's<00:02:39.310> seeking<00:02:39.670> more<00:02:39.930> relief

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.570 

just<00:02:48.660> make<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:49.290> small<00:02:49.920> incision<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:50.460> their

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
just make a small incision in their

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.880 
just make a small incision in their
scalp<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.290> through<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.740> incision

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
scalp and and through that incision

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.860 
scalp and and through that incision
we'll<00:02:53.310> go<00:02:53.490> right<00:02:53.700> down<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:54.090> those<00:02:54.240> nerves<00:02:54.540> and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
we'll go right down to those nerves and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.290 
we'll go right down to those nerves and
release<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.920> muscle<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.760> fashion<00:02:57.210> of

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
release the the muscle and fashion of

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300 
release the the muscle and fashion of
the<00:02:57.420> hands<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.930> suspect<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.740> we'll<00:02:58.920> find<00:02:59.130> some

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the hands I suspect that we'll find some

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.610 
the hands I suspect that we'll find some
blood<00:02:59.490> vessels<00:02:59.970> there<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:01.080> are<00:03:01.230> wrapped

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
blood vessels there that are wrapped

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.620 
blood vessels there that are wrapped
around<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.160> artery<00:03:02.670> which<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.150> think<00:03:03.360> often

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
around the artery which I think often

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.930 
around the artery which I think often
explains<00:03:04.020> why<00:03:04.170> these<00:03:04.230> patients<00:03:04.940> describe
