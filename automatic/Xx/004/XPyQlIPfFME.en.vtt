for<00:00:20.099> over<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.669> decade<00:00:20.909> Paul<00:00:21.329> you've<00:00:21.570> watched

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
for over a decade Paul you've watched

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.809 
for over a decade Paul you've watched
this<00:00:21.989> evolved<00:00:22.320> over<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.890> last<00:00:22.949> decade<00:00:23.489> or<00:00:23.609> so

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:23.819 
this evolved over the last decade or so

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.729 
this evolved over the last decade or so
where<00:00:24.419> do<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.599> see<00:00:24.839> this<00:00:24.989> padding<00:00:25.409> out<00:00:25.499> and

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:25.739 
where do you see this padding out and

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.769 
where do you see this padding out and
how<00:00:25.829> do<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> feel<00:00:26.189> even<00:00:26.939> think<00:00:27.149> that<00:00:27.179> the<00:00:27.329> 250f

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
how do you feel even think that the 250f

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.689 
how do you feel even think that the 250f
is<00:00:27.899> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> stand<00:00:28.259> a<00:00:28.349> chance<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.399> do<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
is going to stand a chance I really do I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
is going to stand a chance I really do I
think<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.479> is<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> unique<00:00:30.929> experience<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
think this is a unique experience a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.590 
think this is a unique experience a
chance<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.460> live<00:00:32.610> nation<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.030> taking<00:00:33.450> with

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
chance that live nation is taking with

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
chance that live nation is taking with
the<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:34.020> Supercross<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.920> think<00:00:35.220> it's

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the with Supercross and I think it's

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.440 
the with Supercross and I think it's
something<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.790> could<00:00:35.880> eventually<00:00:36.120> see

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
something that we could eventually see

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.820 
something that we could eventually see
at<00:00:36.540> some<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.810> big<00:00:36.930> races<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.440> Anaheim

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
at some of the big races like Anaheim

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.130 
at some of the big races like Anaheim
next<00:00:38.130> year<00:00:38.310> or<00:00:38.520> maybe<00:00:39.180> down<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.450> road<00:00:39.600> i<00:00:39.720> think

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
next year or maybe down the road i think

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
next year or maybe down the road i think
that<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.820> evolution<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> four<00:00:42.360> strokes

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that the evolution with the four strokes

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.020 
that the evolution with the four strokes
the<00:00:42.840> 250<00:00:43.320> apps<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> lot<00:00:43.860> closer<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.490> the<00:00:44.580> 450

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the 250 apps are a lot closer to the 450

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.360 
the 250 apps are a lot closer to the 450
FS<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.450> opposed<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:46.650> 125<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> used

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
FS as opposed to the way the 125 is used

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.070 
FS as opposed to the way the 125 is used
to<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> 250s<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.600> completely

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
to be with the 250s it's completely

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.540 
to be with the 250s it's completely
different<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> small<00:00:49.830> track<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.310> this<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
different on a small track like this a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
different on a small track like this a
250<00:00:51.090> f<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.510> run<00:00:51.720> with<00:00:51.900> a<00:00:51.930> 450<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.740> all<00:00:52.890> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
250 f can run with a 450 and it's all in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.370

the<00:00:53.190> start<00:00:53.490> and<00:00:53.660> throw<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> whole<00:00:54.870> horsepower

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
the start and throw the whole horsepower

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.720 
the start and throw the whole horsepower
theory<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> window<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
theory out the window it's all in

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
theory out the window it's all in
reflexes<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.420> reaction<00:00:57.810> time<00:00:57.840> even<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.410> even

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
reflexes and reaction time even it even

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
reflexes and reaction time even it even
have<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:58.890> bigger<00:00:59.100> track<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.640> Anaheim<00:01:00.420> or

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
have a bigger track like Anaheim or

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.780 
have a bigger track like Anaheim or
vegas<00:01:00.990> or<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.290> those<00:01:01.470> it's<00:01:02.400> still<00:01:02.640> in

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
vegas or one of those it's still in

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.310 
vegas or one of those it's still in
reaction-time<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.630> isn't<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.900> horse<00:01:04.019> power

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
reaction-time this isn't a horse power

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
reaction-time this isn't a horse power
thing<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.860> once<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.579> and<00:01:05.759> get<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> good

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
thing so once you get out and get a good

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.450 
thing so once you get out and get a good
start<00:01:06.329> or<00:01:06.540> 250f<00:01:07.020> should<00:01:07.259> with<00:01:07.829> it<00:01:08.009> right<00:01:08.189> rider

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
start or 250f should with it right rider

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.279 
start or 250f should with it right rider
at<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.759> helm<00:01:08.939> should<00:01:09.179> be<00:01:09.329> able<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.719> compete

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
at the helm should be able to compete

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.649 
at the helm should be able to compete
with<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> 450<00:01:11.039> so<00:01:11.249> I<00:01:11.460> think<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.240> great<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
with the 450 so I think it's great and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.910 
with the 450 so I think it's great and
it's<00:01:12.780> experimenting<00:01:13.469> we'll<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.859> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's experimenting we'll see where it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.889 
it's experimenting we'll see where it
takes<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.249> sport<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:14.969> over<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> decade<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
takes the sport now over a decade you

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.020 
takes the sport now over a decade you
have<00:01:16.079> been<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.649> manager<00:01:16.979> now<00:01:17.609> you're<00:01:17.789> in<00:01:17.909> an

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
have been a manager now you're in an

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.330 
have been a manager now you're in an
agent<00:01:18.299> position<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:18.840> different<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.289> that

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
agent position how different is that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.069 
agent position how different is that
well<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.999> me<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.569> different<00:01:21.840> but

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
well for me it's really different but

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.749 
well for me it's really different but
similar<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.829> a<00:01:22.859> lot<00:01:22.889> of<00:01:23.039> ways<00:01:23.249> I<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.639> know<00:01:23.729> I

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
similar in a lot of ways I you know I

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.550 
similar in a lot of ways I you know I
was<00:01:23.939> managing<00:01:24.149> a<00:01:24.509> team<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.380> i'm

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
was managing a team and and now i'm

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
was managing a team and and now i'm
managing<00:01:25.799> individual<00:01:26.490> clients<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.060> this

managing individual clients and this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.569
