00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:06.920
 hello very good to all and all how are you 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.950
 how are you coming back with a new 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.669
 gameplay on this occasion a new 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.289
 Adventure in a zombie gateway game 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.539
 and as always as you all know 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.660
 we'll have to go out and crush the 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.939
 zombies with our car and as we 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.199
 we advance more meters we get money 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:30.470
 with which we can improve our 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.530
 car so that it is not easier to crush 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.390
 kill the zombies we will go 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.060
 let's check the engine so that I run more 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.670
 have more acceleration 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:49.460
 and we modify it perfect we can vary 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 multiple parts of the car plus that 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.899
 we have 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.350
 with a little zombie detonator is 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.170
 very useful when we are in trouble 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.000
 but what matters is to go for the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.960
 zombies there we see if we complete 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.780
 objectives give us experience to climb 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.180
 of level that give us more facilities 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.159
 plus money for improvements like this 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.979
 that we go there 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.429
 as you see above in the side we are 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.679
 they indicate that to make good score 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.869
 we have to follow the indications of 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.799
 the arrows and to take away the zombies 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.840
 above we have to hit against 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.109
 these walls that we see here 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.030
 because they are jumping and they can 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.109
 balance the car and when we turn over 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.109
 goodbye very good 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.689
 they are falling 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.140
 perfect now comes the slalom 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.640
 the fat ones are the problematic weigh 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.770
 plus 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.770
 some can tear down more easily 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.350
 we have removed that from the thin 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.660
 if they do not fall in one fell swoop they are 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.500
 multiple 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.780
 if we hit against 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.780
 the concrete blocks we also want 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.140
 we can crush this, we make the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.470
 bloody the perfect game we tie 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.140
 Fat 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.530
 the more we crush more combos of 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.530
 points 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.730
 Y 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.730
 again the slalom 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.939
 as I tell you that comes fat there 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.939
 multiple types of zombies 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.880
 and there is a red one that is the problematic 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.060
 which is very strong we can not let put 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.430
 easily and we are forced to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.410
 use the detonator as we now have 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.500
 as they jump and we've jumped from 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.260
 slalom 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.440
 the detonator blows his head and he 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.260
 use clicking anywhere two or 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.780
 above the screen and fly the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.450
 heads we have a total of four 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.810
 loads right now we see that it's all a 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.770
 three we're going for there you were doing 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.360
 a very good score 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.390
 we have improved the car before and 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.830
 that shows how many more improvements more 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.780
 easy 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.350
 and serve for the zombies 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.350
 we go 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.050
 form jump to see if we find the 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.310
 red have no signal 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.850
 and we see it has not seen us is very 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.040
 excited sacred and we see it if what 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.340
 we can fly 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.150
 with perfect detonator 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.080
 x as you see now we will fly with this 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.250
 fire that is here in this column 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.940
 let's complete the missions 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.620
 this puts us the difficult thing detonation 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.710
 as we move forward in the 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.520
 miles give us more points as you see 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:20.260
 top to the left a point to overturn 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.760
 there we overturn we have overturned the red be 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.889
 stronger 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.659
 and we see comment on the level 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:32.020
 and they give us more bonuses for the combos for 6 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:34.750
 perfect 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.020
 we have completed a mission a goal 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.420
 they give us money 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.920
 as you see 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.750
 we add the amount as is the game is 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.760
 very entertaining who likes the 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.300
