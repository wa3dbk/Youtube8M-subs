00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
late and unfortunately the one that I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
late and unfortunately the one that I

more<00:00:58.109> complicated<00:00:58.530> than<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.129> thought<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.699> would

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
more complicated than I thought it would

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
actually quite easy there's there's a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
actually quite easy there's there's a
couple<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.850> ways<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
couple of ways to do it and the one that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.550 
couple of ways to do it and the one that
I<00:01:28.290> recommend<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.460> use<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
I recommend is to just use the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.830 
I recommend is to just use the
right-click<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.829> shot<00:01:32.189> say<00:01:32.640> edit<00:01:32.909> clip<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.659> say

map<00:02:45.880> scale<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.390> probably<00:02:46.900> your<00:02:47.560> answer

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
map scale is probably your answer

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.640 
map scale is probably your answer
because<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.760> lower<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.750> goes<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.260> darker<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
because the lower it goes the darker the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.840 
because the lower it goes the darker the
shot<00:02:50.830> gets<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.250> higher<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.610> goes<00:02:51.790> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
shot gets the higher it goes the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.510 
shot gets the higher it goes the
brighter<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> shot<00:02:52.810> gets<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:54.340> is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
brighter the shot gets so that is

brighter the shot gets so that is
