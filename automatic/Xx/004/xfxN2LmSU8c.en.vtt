this<00:00:10.590> will<00:00:10.740> look<00:00:10.889> like<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.340> loop<00:00:11.550> version<00:00:12.030> two

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
this will look like the loop version two

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.810 
this will look like the loop version two
you<00:00:12.960> wouldn't<00:00:13.170> be<00:00:13.259> wrong<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.639> loop

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
you wouldn't be wrong but it's a loop

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.689 
you wouldn't be wrong but it's a loop

save us here in the UK they have done a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.429 
save us here in the UK they have done a
fantastic<00:00:23.189> job<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.119> same<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.320> can

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
fantastic job on the same as you can

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.890 
fantastic job on the same as you can
probably<00:00:25.650> see<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.359> concept<00:00:27.359> behind<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.750> was

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
probably see the concept behind it was

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.429 
probably see the concept behind it was
to<00:00:27.930> take<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.560> loop<00:00:29.130> version<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.900> saber<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to take the loop version to saber and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.370 
to take the loop version to saber and
instead<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.520> having<00:00:32.700> yet<00:00:32.940> rugged<00:00:33.719> clean

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
instead of having yet rugged clean

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.310 
instead of having yet rugged clean
that's<00:00:34.710> obvious<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.840> furthermore<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.200> give

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that's obvious and furthermore to give

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.530 
that's obvious and furthermore to give
it<00:00:37.440> prequel<00:00:37.950> styling<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.910> newer<00:00:39.149> movies

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it prequel styling like the newer movies

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.700 
it prequel styling like the newer movies
so<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.530> involved<00:00:40.890> adding<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.309> quartet<00:00:41.790> clip

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
so this involved adding a quartet clip

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.459 
so this involved adding a quartet clip
modern<00:00:43.710> activation<00:00:44.579> boxes<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.469> cleaning

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
modern activation boxes and cleaning

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.700 
modern activation boxes and cleaning
some<00:00:46.649> things<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
some things up here in there so if I

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
some things up here in there so if I
give<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.890> bit<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.489> preview<00:00:50.969> through<00:00:51.420> this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
give you a bit of a preview through this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.279 
give you a bit of a preview through this
on<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.890> original<00:00:53.820> version<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> little

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
on the original version to get a little

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
on the original version to get a little
silver<00:00:55.590> knob<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.149> that<00:00:57.149> has<00:00:57.329> been<00:00:57.510> replaced

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
silver knob here that has been replaced

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.689 
silver knob here that has been replaced

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
by the cover tech wheel because I didn't

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.979 
by the cover tech wheel because I didn't
want<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.000> rid<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> any<00:01:00.480> details

who<00:01:33.810> design<00:01:34.280> we're<00:01:35.280> thinking<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.759> Anakin's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
who design we're thinking of Anakin's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.710 
who design we're thinking of Anakin's
and<00:01:36.659> OB<00:01:36.900> ones<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.549> case<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.540> initially

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and OB ones in this case I was initially

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.230 
and OB ones in this case I was initially
thinking<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.290> OB<00:01:40.530> ones<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.009> put<00:01:41.220> onto<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
thinking of OB ones to put onto this

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.060 
thinking of OB ones to put onto this
saber<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.930> thought<00:01:43.079> well<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> rest<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
saber and I thought well the rest of the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.680 
saber and I thought well the rest of the
saber<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.880> dedication<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
saber was a dedication to

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.500 
saber was a dedication to
from<00:01:46.870> Luke<00:01:47.050> so<00:01:47.770> why<00:01:47.980> not<00:01:48.160> use<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.940> activation

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
from Luke so why not use the activation

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.330 
from Luke so why not use the activation
box<00:01:49.720> from<00:01:49.870> Luke's<00:01:50.110> father<00:01:50.290> use<00:01:50.860> betas

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
box from Luke's father use betas

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.890 
box from Luke's father use betas
activation<00:01:51.850> box<00:01:52.060> which<00:01:52.300> we<00:01:52.480> haven't<00:01:52.660> seen

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
activation box which we haven't seen

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.990 
activation box which we haven't seen
much<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.320> movies<00:01:53.620> but<00:01:54.190> in<00:01:54.250> my<00:01:54.460> opinion<00:01:54.580> is

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
much in the movies but in my opinion is

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.780 
much in the movies but in my opinion is
is<00:01:55.300> one<00:01:55.750> of<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.900> nicest<00:01:56.140> looking<00:01:56.470> designs<00:01:57.460> on

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
is one of the nicest looking designs on

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.270 
is one of the nicest looking designs on
the<00:01:57.940> activation<00:01:58.450> boxes<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.620> decided<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.250> use

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the activation boxes so I decided to use

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.370 
the activation boxes so I decided to use
that<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.820> think<00:02:01.270> it's<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.450> nice<00:02:01.630> touch<00:02:01.930> will<00:02:02.230> look

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
that I think it's a nice touch will look

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.370 
that I think it's a nice touch will look
to<00:02:02.530> give<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.920> tribute<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.910> his<00:02:04.150> father<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
that's in there and it really picks up

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.400 
that's in there and it really picks up
the<00:02:07.150> rest<00:02:07.300> of<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.540> saber<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.930> looks<00:02:08.080> great

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410

which<00:02:47.050> in<00:02:47.350> my<00:02:47.530> opinion<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.980> still<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.280> best

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
which in my opinion is still the best

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.520 
which in my opinion is still the best
even<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:48.820> it's<00:02:49.000> slightly<00:02:49.180> long<00:02:49.540> was<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.230> it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
even if it's slightly long was that it

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.010 
even if it's slightly long was that it
was<00:02:50.709> long<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> talked<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.209> Darren<00:02:52.570> s<00:02:52.690> oh<00:02:52.810> look

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
in the hand it's got the exact rate is

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.320 
in the hand it's got the exact rate is
