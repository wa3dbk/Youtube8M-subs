 transport manager in the

 Municipality of Lima in Christian Jaén 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.420

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.140

 solutions and the way to fix the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.120
 everyone's anxiety is very many from the 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.970
 media to them 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.970
 drivers in my family home 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.540
 I imagine you are in the sights of everyone as 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.210
 you handle that good pressure I'm very 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.330
 focused on what we are doing 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.490
 in the municipality is what you have 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.550
 what to do for the city to make a 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.520
 best city and the lives 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.380
 usually undertake titanic tasks 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.060
 let's say in your personal life there are landmarks 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.299
 that you yourself traces you 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.280
 with example no doubt for example I 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.799
 I was very clear since I was a girl that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.549
 I wanted to be a lawyer and I had to 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.409
 open my way alone and I had to look 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.899
 excellence even in training 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.270
 academic to be able to have the best 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.610
 tools and that's why in a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.470
 moment of my life a little complicated 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.210
 when my parents separated and the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.329
 economic situation was incredible 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.340
 incredibly bad and I decided to change 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.030
 university I entered the university 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.069
 Catholic where I ended up and it was one of the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.229
 happiest days of my life the truth 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.299
 have donated to the university and have 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.640
 entered the Catholic in a context 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.009
 for me this my personal life so 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.599
 complicated where I studied long before 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.459
 studied at san martín university 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.680
 of porres and there you had to change 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.590
 you had to emigrate he also taught you 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.110
 let's say you if you had to remember 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.870
 a scene of your passage through the university 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.230
 what would 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.290
 the long hours of reading in the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.530
 campus that seemed wonderful to me 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.209
 have time and tranquility and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.299
 have abundant availability 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.000
 material to be able to have an opinion 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.760
 with a whole foundation behind and with 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.549
 different opinions democracy the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.440
 participation that seems essential to me 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.190
 the life of a person let's say that the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.790
 reading gave you freedom totally 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.170
 I fully believe that reading and 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.760
 independently the trips are 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.790
 issues that allow you to grow 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.579
 very much as a person and for me a 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.430
 The norm of life is to search every day 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.519
 to be a better person is this normal for me 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.790
 yes for me yes I believe that in this life 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.250
 we have the obligation to be happy and 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.069
 look for that happiness through 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.760
 enjoyment and the fullness of the others 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.720
 well that people's true 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.720
 and you are happy 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.590
 and people say good sometimes I've had 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.010
 Happy moments like happiness 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.440
 is a word then and denied but not 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.800
 we want to take them from her no no I think 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.739
 that happiness is a choice of life 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.810
 you will always have difficulties of all 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.450
 of all kinds since the departure of a 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.420
 family very dear for example I do not 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.209
 I already have my father with me physically 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.370
 but in my heart and in my moments 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.010
 difficult he is with me hugging me 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.079
 forever and ever I'm with him despite 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.269
 of the separation they had a relationship 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.900
 close yes we had a pretty relationship 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.299
 complicated actually for me when he 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.100
 he left was the most important person 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.670
 of my life at that time 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.200
 but when he left they were also paid 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.860
 many of the accounts that we 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.750
 we had and I do not judge it for me those 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.090
 nations some time yes sure when 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.090
 I was a teenager and when my way was 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.640
 It is incredibly difficult for me 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.220
 about I had to work mine 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.740
 get things to be able to scale go 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.500
 is getting to study but 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.200
 survive like this is book now I am what 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.360
 I'm thanks to that too and do it 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.630
 it's with my old man enormously the best 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.970
 I stopped judging your parents 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.940
 when I started to become a woman when 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.360
 I began to realize that love makes 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.830
 that many times people have 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.900
 answers that apparently are 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.150
 wrong but they are obviously 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.180
 conditioned by emotions and by 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.540
 faith and for that kind of thing that sometimes 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.610
 they make us do this some awkwardness 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:15.290
 specials to everyone and nobody has 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.230
 the right to judge for evil and when 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.969
 I say to judge this I do not mean that 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.749
 one somehow I do not know 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:28.279
 a value judgment and suddenly it 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:30.769
 tell a friend and this one if I go 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.569
 to be with you even though I am 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:34.909
 wrong but you do not want to be the judge 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.489
 of a person not because you do not want that 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.919
 judge you no I do not have any 

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:42.439
 problem this with judging me or that I 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:46.249
 I believe that in my life he has received judgments 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:48.679
 everywhere many many many and 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.169
 it ends I would now have finished 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:53.569
 the five minutes I'm not going to you and not that 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.499
 the judgments have been positive I think that 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:59.469
 yes 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:59.469
 thanks doctor jara no thanks miracle 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:11.289
 we have something to tell sometimes 5 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:11.289
 minutes sometimes without more 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:19.780
 tell me something about your life what you dream 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:23.160
