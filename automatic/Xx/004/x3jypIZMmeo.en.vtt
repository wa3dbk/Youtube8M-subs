this<00:00:08.860> is<00:00:09.070> a<00:00:09.099> sextant<00:00:10.090> which<00:00:10.330> is<00:00:10.540> kind<00:00:11.320> of<00:00:11.379> the

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
this is a sextant which is kind of the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.990 
this is a sextant which is kind of the
end<00:00:13.070> of<00:00:13.310> the<00:00:13.400> evolution<00:00:14.060> of<00:00:14.270> a<00:00:14.540> lot<00:00:14.750> of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
end of the evolution of a lot of

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.670 
end of the evolution of a lot of
instruments<00:00:17.000> that<00:00:17.030> were<00:00:17.270> used<00:00:17.570> to<00:00:17.750> cite<00:00:18.529> the

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
instruments that were used to cite the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.530 
instruments that were used to cite the
altitude<00:00:19.190> of<00:00:19.369> stars<00:00:19.670> in<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:19.940> sky<00:00:20.029> you

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
altitude of stars in the sky you

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.500 
altitude of stars in the sky you
typically<00:00:21.349> use<00:00:21.500> them<00:00:22.070> for<00:00:22.400> water<00:00:22.610> navigation

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
typically use them for water navigation

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.900 
typically use them for water navigation
because<00:00:23.869> you're<00:00:24.080> seeing<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.770> physical<00:00:25.070> horizon

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
because you're seeing a physical horizon

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.050 
because you're seeing a physical horizon
the<00:00:26.450> sky<00:00:26.720> is<00:00:26.779> kind<00:00:27.200> of<00:00:27.230> like<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.410> dome<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.130> you

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
the sky is kind of like a dome and you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.540 
the sky is kind of like a dome and you
have<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.510> altitude<00:00:30.080> of<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.830> celestial<00:00:31.340> object

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
have the altitude of a celestial object

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.260 
have the altitude of a celestial object
which<00:00:32.090> is<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.419> angle<00:00:33.260> from<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.710> horizontal

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
which is the angle from the horizontal

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.630 
which is the angle from the horizontal
to<00:00:35.270> however<00:00:35.840> high<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.230> is<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.830> then<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.460> other

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
to however high it is and then the other

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.729 
to however high it is and then the other
angle<00:00:38.090> is<00:00:38.180> called<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.600> azimuth<00:00:39.110> which<00:00:39.530> is

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
angle is called the azimuth which is

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.939 
angle is called the azimuth which is
basically<00:00:40.519> dividing<00:00:41.000> up<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.239> horizon<00:00:41.750> into

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
basically dividing up the horizon into

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.189 
basically dividing up the horizon into
360<00:00:42.949> degrees<00:00:43.280> we<00:00:43.970> use<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.360> information<00:00:44.690> about

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
360 degrees we use the information about

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.869 
360 degrees we use the information about
this<00:00:45.320> altitude<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.040> it's<00:00:46.129> asking<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:46.610> to

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
this altitude and it's asking you to

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.100 
this altitude and it's asking you to
estimate<00:00:47.780> location<00:00:49.269> what<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.449> sextant<00:00:50.930> does

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
estimate location what the sextant does

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.619 
estimate location what the sextant does
is<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.470> measures<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.799> altitude<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.629> celestial

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
is it measures the altitude of celestial

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.439 
is it measures the altitude of celestial
object<00:00:54.049> like<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:54.350> Sun<00:00:54.549> so<00:00:55.549> you<00:00:56.000> get<00:00:56.210> two

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
object like the Sun so you get two

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.960 
object like the Sun so you get two
images<00:00:56.979> this<00:00:57.979> is<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.190> half-silvered<00:00:58.820> mirror

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
images this is a half-silvered mirror

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.689 
images this is a half-silvered mirror
and<00:00:59.600> you<00:01:00.379> look<00:01:00.559> through<00:01:00.739> this<00:01:00.860> telescope<00:01:00.920> and

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
and you look through this telescope and

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.090 
and you look through this telescope and
what<00:01:01.820> you'll<00:01:02.120> see<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.809> horizon<00:01:03.100> number

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
what you'll see is the horizon number

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.660 
what you'll see is the horizon number
one<00:01:04.299> but<00:01:05.299> number<00:01:05.510> two<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:06.260> this<00:01:06.740> mirror<00:01:07.190> here

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
one but number two is this mirror here

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.690 
one but number two is this mirror here
is<00:01:07.880> on<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.270> movable<00:01:09.790> arm<00:01:10.790> which<00:01:11.600> changes<00:01:12.080> angle

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
is on a movable arm which changes angle

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.580 
is on a movable arm which changes angle
the<00:01:13.700> light<00:01:13.940> from<00:01:14.479> let's<00:01:14.810> say<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:14.960> Sun<00:01:15.290> in<00:01:15.470> this

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
the light from let's say the Sun in this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.310 
the light from let's say the Sun in this
case<00:01:15.830> will<00:01:16.159> reflect<00:01:16.909> off<00:01:17.299> of<00:01:17.329> this<00:01:17.659> mirror<00:01:18.109> and

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
case will reflect off of this mirror and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.499 
case will reflect off of this mirror and
I<00:01:18.439> can<00:01:18.619> put<00:01:18.829> a<00:01:18.859> filter<00:01:19.549> in<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.969> way<00:01:20.149> so<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.450> don't

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
I can put a filter in the way so I don't

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.959 
I can put a filter in the way so I don't
have<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.899> stare<00:01:21.109> directly<00:01:21.259> into<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:22.009> naked

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
have to stare directly into the naked

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.480 
have to stare directly into the naked
sunlight<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.630> then<00:01:24.259> that<00:01:24.619> image<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.280> Sun

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
sunlight and then that image of the Sun

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.130 
sunlight and then that image of the Sun
will<00:01:25.670> then<00:01:25.820> reflect<00:01:26.149> off<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.539> this<00:01:26.630> partially

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
will then reflect off of this partially

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.260 
will then reflect off of this partially
silvered<00:01:27.530> mirror<00:01:27.859> and<00:01:28.070> I'll<00:01:28.640> see<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.850> image

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
silvered mirror and I'll see the image

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.819 
silvered mirror and I'll see the image
of<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.539> Sun<00:01:29.750> brought<00:01:30.079> down<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.679> horizon

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
of the Sun brought down to the horizon

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.139 
of the Sun brought down to the horizon
and<00:01:31.420> then<00:01:32.420> by<00:01:32.719> manipulating<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:34.070> lever<00:01:34.789> arm

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
and then by manipulating this lever arm

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.279 
and then by manipulating this lever arm
in<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:35.539> little<00:01:36.579> veneer<00:01:37.579> screw<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:38.929> can

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
in this little veneer screw what I can

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.120 
in this little veneer screw what I can
do<00:01:39.469> is<00:01:39.799> get<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:41.380> altitude<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.499> the<00:01:42.619> Sun<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:43.100> a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
do is get the altitude of the Sun to a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.539 
do is get the altitude of the Sun to a
precision<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:44.030> about<00:01:44.780> an<00:01:45.289> arc<00:01:45.859> minute<00:01:45.950> which

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
precision of about an arc minute which

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.340 
precision of about an arc minute which
is<00:01:46.670> one<00:01:46.820> sixtieth<00:01:47.329> of<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.659> degree<00:01:48.020> which

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
is one sixtieth of a degree which

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.950 
is one sixtieth of a degree which
represents<00:01:48.979> one<00:01:49.219> nautical<00:01:50.119> mile<00:01:50.570> of

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
represents one nautical mile of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.660 
represents one nautical mile of
uncertainty<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:51.829> that's<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.310> kind<00:01:52.549> of

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
uncertainty so that's the kind of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.880 
uncertainty so that's the kind of
precision<00:01:52.999> with<00:01:53.390> good<00:01:53.630> practice<00:01:54.109> you<00:01:54.770> could

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
precision with good practice you could

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.289 
precision with good practice you could
get<00:01:55.159> with<00:01:55.579> a<00:01:55.999> Sun<00:01:56.359> sighting

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.789 

so<00:02:02.299> what<00:02:02.450> I'm<00:02:02.570> doing<00:02:02.840> now<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.049> I'm<00:02:03.350> sliding<00:02:03.710> the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
so what I'm doing now is I'm sliding the

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.760 
so what I'm doing now is I'm sliding the
Sun<00:02:04.119> which<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.299> up<00:02:05.659> in<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:05.990> sky<00:02:06.200> put<00:02:06.229> down<00:02:06.740> a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
Sun which is up in the sky put down a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.040 
Sun which is up in the sky put down a
little<00:02:07.070> shade<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:07.790> I<00:02:07.820> don't<00:02:08.030> burn<00:02:08.270> my<00:02:08.539> eyes<00:02:08.569> out

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
little shade so I don't burn my eyes out

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.170 
little shade so I don't burn my eyes out
and<00:02:09.289> then<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:10.540> try<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.989> find<00:02:12.380> its<00:02:13.000> location<00:02:14.000> by

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and then I try to find its location by

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.460 
and then I try to find its location by
roughly<00:02:14.720> scanning<00:02:15.470> back<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.860> forth<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:17.470> adjust

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
roughly scanning back and forth I adjust

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.949 
roughly scanning back and forth I adjust
it<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.819> lower<00:02:20.060> limb<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.840> Sun

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
it so that the lower limb of the Sun

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.009 
it so that the lower limb of the Sun
that<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.010> say<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.580> lower<00:02:23.390> part<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
that is to say the lower part of the

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.650 
that is to say the lower part of the
image<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.560> Sun<00:02:24.849> is<00:02:25.849> just<00:02:26.239> touching<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
image of the Sun is just touching the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.630 
image of the Sun is just touching the
horizon<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:28.069> look<00:02:28.280> at<00:02:28.400> my<00:02:28.519> watch<00:02:30.489> 8:30<00:02:32.080> 7:45

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
horizon and I look at my watch 8:30 7:45

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.460 
horizon and I look at my watch 8:30 7:45
Eastern<00:02:34.640> Daylight<00:02:34.880> Time<00:02:35.120> which<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.110> can<00:02:36.290> then

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
Eastern Daylight Time which I can then

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.720 
Eastern Daylight Time which I can then
turn<00:02:37.430> into<00:02:37.700> Greenwich<00:02:38.120> Mean<00:02:38.390> Time<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.670> a

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
turn into Greenwich Mean Time this is a

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.229 
turn into Greenwich Mean Time this is a
course<00:02:41.799> reading<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:42.980> degrees<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.090> can

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
course reading and degrees so you can

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.220 
course reading and degrees so you can
see<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.750> we<00:02:44.870> ended<00:02:45.200> up<00:02:45.349> with<00:02:45.410> about<00:02:46.750> 36<00:02:47.750> some

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
see that we ended up with about 36 some

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.860 
see that we ended up with about 36 some
odd<00:02:48.410> degrees<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.160> then<00:02:49.849> this<00:02:50.120> little<00:02:50.420> drum

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
odd degrees and then this little drum

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.380 
odd degrees and then this little drum
here<00:02:51.200> tells<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.769> how<00:02:52.010> many<00:02:52.069> arc<00:02:52.880> minutes<00:02:53.269> an

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
here tells you how many arc minutes an

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.199 
here tells you how many arc minutes an
argument<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.870> one<00:02:54.110> sixtieth<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:54.890> degree<00:02:55.250> so

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
argument is one sixtieth of a degree so

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.440 
argument is one sixtieth of a degree so
I<00:02:56.750> read<00:02:57.170> off<00:02:57.349> here<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.250> got<00:02:58.430> 23<00:02:59.060> degrees

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
I read off here that I got 23 degrees

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.770 
I read off here that I got 23 degrees
and<00:02:59.870> then<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.650> little<00:03:01.209> set<00:03:02.209> of<00:03:02.239> lines<00:03:02.569> here

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
and then this little set of lines here

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.220 
and then this little set of lines here
called<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.470> vernier<00:03:04.540> allows<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.900> then<00:03:06.049> get

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
called a vernier allows you to then get

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.610 
called a vernier allows you to then get
tenths<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.370> an<00:03:07.940> arc<00:03:08.090> minute<00:03:08.150> what<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.170> now<00:03:09.380> can

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
tenths of an arc minute what I now can

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.880 
tenths of an arc minute what I now can
do<00:03:09.859> is<00:03:10.359> do<00:03:11.359> a<00:03:11.390> few<00:03:11.660> Corrections<00:03:12.230> one<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.650> for

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
do is do a few Corrections one is for

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.039 
do is do a few Corrections one is for
the<00:03:13.040> refraction<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.880> atmosphere<00:03:14.570> one<00:03:14.900> is

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
the refraction of the atmosphere one is

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.630 
the refraction of the atmosphere one is
for<00:03:15.260> my<00:03:15.410> height<00:03:15.650> above<00:03:16.040> sea<00:03:16.310> level<00:03:17.170> and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
for my height above sea level and

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.069 
for my height above sea level and
something<00:03:19.640> called<00:03:19.819> an<00:03:19.940> index<00:03:20.269> correction<00:03:20.840> for

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
something called an index correction for

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.160 
something called an index correction for
my<00:03:21.170> instrument<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:22.000> then<00:03:23.000> once<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.420> get<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
my instrument and then once I get the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.990 
my instrument and then once I get the
true<00:03:24.440> altitude<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.160> Sun<00:03:25.370> by<00:03:25.549> making<00:03:25.880> these

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
true altitude of the Sun by making these

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.690 
true altitude of the Sun by making these
Corrections<00:03:26.569> I<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:26.900> then<00:03:27.049> go<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> set<00:03:28.670> of

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
Corrections I can then go to a set of

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.990 
Corrections I can then go to a set of
tables<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:30.139> can<00:03:30.829> use<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:31.670> basically

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
tables that I can use to just basically

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.090 
tables that I can use to just basically
add<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.600> subtract<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.139> set<00:03:33.319> of<00:03:33.440> numbers<00:03:33.829> and

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
add and subtract a set of numbers and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.629 
add and subtract a set of numbers and
give<00:03:35.060> me<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.299> prediction<00:03:35.810> for<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.980> altitude<00:03:37.459> of

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
give me a prediction for the altitude of

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.979 
give me a prediction for the altitude of
the<00:03:37.730> Sun<00:03:37.970> for<00:03:38.930> this<00:03:39.859> moment<00:03:40.730> if<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.510> like<00:03:41.720> and

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
the Sun for this moment if you like and

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.979 
the Sun for this moment if you like and
then<00:03:42.260> for<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> limb<00:03:43.910> latitude<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:44.510> longitude

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
then for a limb latitude and longitude

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.449 
then for a limb latitude and longitude
and<00:03:45.170> then<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:45.350> can<00:03:45.500> basically<00:03:45.650> do<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.160> little

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
and then I can basically do a little

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.610 
and then I can basically do a little
correction<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.209> figure<00:03:47.480> out<00:03:47.510> where<00:03:47.810> my<00:03:48.410> line

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
correction and figure out where my line

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.340 
correction and figure out where my line
of<00:03:48.650> position<00:03:49.160> is
