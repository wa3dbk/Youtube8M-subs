00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 do not 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.069
 hello friends today I'll show you how 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.120
 used the lead lead for fishing 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.250
 of surf casting 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.250
 I'm going to show you how the amounts I 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.019
 personally that is a system that 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.200
 gives very good result it would not be 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.570
 practically does not entangle the drawer of 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.649
 hook and gives many results already 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.200
 that the one given does not offer resistance 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:31.460
 when he's eating the fish so 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.640
 so much is very good , you know 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.469
 the normal system that is happening the blog 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.980
 the pearlite the big pearl and the 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.359
 You already know a system already 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.700
 who knows everyone but good and 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:51.530
 I'll be different with a variant 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.530
 that would be using a carabiner 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.900
 and a yellow 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.750
 and the two pearls clear then let's go 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.790
 to cut me to make this a rig 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.750
 that can be removed and then put 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.750
 what are we going to do is 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.899
 cut about two meters per 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.090
 example here I have a little less to 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:17.850
 good that is simply to show 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.770
 how would it look then is a very system 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 simple very economical to use and that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.290
 gives very good results the truth to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.810
 me at least 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.820
 gives me very good results for the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.470
 seabream fishing along the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.170
 Bass 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.410
 and also that his system that this one is very 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.760
 difficult that task of the bed of 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.790
 hook then therefore it is a 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.550
 system that used a lot especially 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.640
 had to animate in the background and quite the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.940
 trip anyway let's start first what 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.400
 what are we going to do 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.510
 we are going to go to the extreme and how to do 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.970
 a mobile rig we're going to put the 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.030
 yellow 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.970
 here we have a yellow 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.800
 let's put it here 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.780
 then we passed personally 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.819
 I use the new rap to which I gave very 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.050
 good results 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:20.560
 let's give it a little run 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.940
 167 laps as this signals not 060 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.080
 It takes a lot of return because 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.220
 happen is very very resistant 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.010
 we passed it 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.350
 we search a little with saliva 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.390
 and they are closing 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:40.050
 I'm closing closing there 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.050
 we throw we will not cut the excess 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 we will not cut through here more or less 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.190
 I like to leave a millimeter so 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.410
 this would be what would acquire the mother line 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.500
 of the good reel now let's give the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.970
 back and let's start first that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.870
 nothing to me personally I like 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.170
 use a pearl of 6 under pressure 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.720
 some pearls to protect the knot 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.300
 so let's put first one 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.100
 perlite 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:17.420
 and another and another pearl we are going to put 2 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.400
 before putting what would be the pearlite 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.410
 bigger than this would be so that to 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.550
 butt with the mosquito then 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.550
 first we passed 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.430
 a large pearl 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.239
 the carabiner 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.239
 we kiss 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.440
 and again the pearl the big one in this 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.460
 case 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.460
 we had it 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.500
 there 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.500
 let's see how it looks like this would move 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.950
 now here at the end 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.909
 we are going to put a measurement 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.220
 resistant that where will you go hooked 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.730
 the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.740
 the line of the hook then we do 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.360
 no process we knot a knot 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.360
 fast rapala cash 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.289
 good laps 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.300
 We remember always had wet is 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.379
 very important so that they do not touch fishing line 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.689
 do not weaken and squeeze we will cut the 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:40.020
 surplus 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:44.510
 stay here 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.920
 and here we have the rig ready 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.110
 mounted 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.470
 with lead by check 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.810
 here the variant is that the lead is not 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.260
 directly mounted the line we're going to 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.230
 put here 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.630
 we open 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:08.240
 I for example here I have a plumb 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:11.560
 with rod south karting and we're going 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.560
 let's put the west 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.880
 there it would be 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:23.689
 You see, you have to give 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.840
 mounted the fish would eat well 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.150
 the fish would throw 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.400
 would not meet the resistance of 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.130
 what is a rig mounted with a 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.930
 fixed soil then I would eat much better 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.300
 and we do not have much better also the 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.980
 chopped word of the chopped then 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.700
 this would be like that 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.700
 and here 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.819
 let's set the hook 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.689
 when it is very short to show them 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.099
 how would it also be with the rapala knot 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:56.099
 we have it here 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.009
 we will give a few laps 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.250
 it's just like that so they can see just 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.250
 as 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.259
 how would it look 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.630
 we cut the leftovers and that would be 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.630
 mounted this couple 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.440
 come 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.810
 the lead would be like that 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.729
 and this would be 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.830
 how would the fish then look 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.889
 employment cost the water the fish goes to 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.449
 pull and no resistance is found 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.510
 no type then what does that go 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:49.090
 to be eating much better 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:52.630
 the fish will eat much better and 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:56.430
 let's also be in the chop goes going 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.860
 to mark the bite more clearly 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.050
 and death is the rig that I use 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.020
 very much that it is simple fast to be 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.280
 easy 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:10.080
 and I hope you like it 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.080
 and see you next tutorial
