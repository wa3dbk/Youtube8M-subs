00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.330 
is going to give you three inches height
now<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:40.020> don't<00:02:40.200> want<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.440> mount<00:02:40.680> your<00:02:40.800> new<00:02:41.070> rod

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
now you don't want to mount your new rod

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.630 
now you don't want to mount your new rod
in<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.209> identical<00:02:42.840> spot<00:02:43.290> because<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.980> it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
in the identical spot because it it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.760 
in the identical spot because it it
actually<00:02:44.970> makes<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.360> stick<00:02:45.720> out<00:02:45.840> too<00:02:46.170> far<00:02:46.470> when

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
actually makes it stick out too far when

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.400 
actually makes it stick out too far when
that<00:02:47.160> curb<00:02:47.430> dip<00:02:47.670> items<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> curved<00:02:49.140> part

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
that curb dip items or the curved part

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.860 
that curb dip items or the curved part
of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.590> rod<00:02:49.770> would<00:02:50.010> be<00:02:50.190> way<00:02:50.430> too<00:02:50.489> far<00:02:50.940> out<00:02:51.000> so

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
of the rod would be way too far out so

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.600 
of the rod would be way too far out so
you<00:02:51.930> actually<00:02:52.110> want<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.470> come<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:52.950> about<00:02:53.100> four

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
you actually want to come in about four

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.060 
you actually want to come in about four
inches<00:02:53.970> four<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> half<00:02:54.360> inches<00:02:55.070> from

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
inches four and a half inches from

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.890 
inches four and a half inches from
previous<00:02:56.489> jobs<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.970> I've<00:02:57.090> done<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.360> realized

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
previous jobs that I've done I realized

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.350 
previous jobs that I've done I realized
that<00:02:58.140> from<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> corner<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.070> tub<00:02:59.340> out<00:02:59.550> 28

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
that from the corner of the tub out 28

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.930 
that from the corner of the tub out 28
inches<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.989> an<00:03:01.290> ideal<00:03:01.830> situation<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
inches is an ideal situation and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.990 
inches is an ideal situation and
position<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.140> new<00:03:04.260> rod<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.610> go<00:03:05.820> ahead

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
position for the new rod so I go ahead

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
position for the new rod so I go ahead
and<00:03:06.180> mark<00:03:06.450> out<00:03:06.660> where<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.110> new<00:03:07.350> brackets<00:03:08.310> are

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.190 
and mark out where the new brackets are
going<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.640> go<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.480> we'll<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:09.989> those

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
going to go and we'll get those

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.860 
going to go and we'll get those
installed<00:03:14.000> all<00:03:15.000> right<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.750> be

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
installed all right this is going to be

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.300 
installed all right this is going to be
the<00:03:16.140> new<00:03:16.260> bracket<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.950> we're<00:03:17.100> going<00:03:17.250> to

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the new bracket that we're going to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.080 
the new bracket that we're going to

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.900 
install and as you can see it's
considerably<00:03:21.090> less<00:03:21.450> than<00:03:22.640> then<00:03:23.640> what<00:03:23.790> the

considerably less than then what the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.030 
considerably less than then what the
round<00:03:24.150> pieces<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.810> held<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.230> original<00:03:25.920> rod

in but we're going to be using some wall

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.290 
in but we're going to be using some wall
anchors<00:03:28.320> on<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.950> secure<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.670> walls<00:03:29.970> so

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
anchors on this to secure to walls so

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.479 
anchors on this to secure to walls so
it's<00:03:30.450> really<00:03:30.750> not<00:03:30.870> going<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.110> go<00:03:31.230> anywhere<00:03:31.590> so
