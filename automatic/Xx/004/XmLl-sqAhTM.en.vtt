00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.170 
happened with cloak and dagger that
they're<00:02:11.819> out<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:11.940> about

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
they're out and about

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.080 
they're out and about
and<00:02:13.299> how<00:02:14.109> certain<00:02:14.439> individuals<00:02:15.069> have<00:02:15.849> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
and how certain individuals have the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.349 
and how certain individuals have the
list<00:02:16.329> of<00:02:16.540> other<00:02:17.200> experiments<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.219> they<00:02:19.150> have

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
list of other experiments that they have

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.750 
list of other experiments that they have
and<00:02:19.769> that<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:21.040> know<00:02:21.099> cloak-and-dagger<00:02:21.340> are

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
and that you know cloak-and-dagger are

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.740 
and that you know cloak-and-dagger are
going<00:02:22.000> after<00:02:22.269> those<00:02:22.750> specific<00:02:23.200> individuals

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
going after those specific individuals

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.550 
going after those specific individuals
so<00:02:25.750> how<00:02:25.989> are<00:02:26.079> they<00:02:26.170> going<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.379> get<00:02:26.500> their

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
so how are they going to get their

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.380 
so how are they going to get their
experiments<00:02:27.340> their<00:02:27.519> guinea<00:02:27.790> pigs<00:02:28.090> back

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
experiments their guinea pigs back

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.420 
experiments their guinea pigs back
they're<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.379> to<00:02:29.469> send<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.739> hunter<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.370> that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
they're going to send a hunter and that

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.839 
they're going to send a hunter and that
hunter<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:30.819> none<00:02:31.629> other<00:02:31.659> than<00:02:32.189> taskmaster<00:02:33.189> so

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
hunter is none other than taskmaster so

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.800 
hunter is none other than taskmaster so
taskmasters<00:02:34.750> sent<00:02:35.170> after<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:37.000> essentially

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
taskmasters sent after the essentially

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.740 
taskmasters sent after the essentially
you<00:02:38.079> know<00:02:38.200> bombshell<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.239> I'm<00:02:40.239> assuming<00:02:40.540> in

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
you know bombshell and I'm assuming in

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.270 
you know bombshell and I'm assuming in
the<00:02:40.780> later<00:02:40.989> comics<00:02:41.469> they're<00:02:41.980> going<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.189> do

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the later comics they're going to do

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.050 
the later comics they're going to do
he's<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:42.879> to<00:02:42.969> go<00:02:43.030> after<00:02:43.060> cloak<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:43.989> dagger

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
he's going to go after cloak and dagger

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.990 
he's going to go after cloak and dagger
so<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.269> cut<00:02:46.510> back<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.900> 15<00:02:47.319> years<00:02:47.349> later<00:02:48.000> Lana

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
so we cut back to 15 years later Lana

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.659 
so we cut back to 15 years later Lana
wakes<00:02:49.239> up<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.629> like<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> chair<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:50.980> she

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
wakes up in like a chair and she

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.569

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
discover she has the explosive powers

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.050

a<00:05:07.360> problem<00:05:07.740> going<00:05:08.740> further<00:05:09.340> down<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.699> issues

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
a problem going further down the issues

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.050 
a problem going further down the issues
is<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.380> we<00:05:11.380> still<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.070> spider-man<00:05:12.789> no

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
is that we still have the spider-man no

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.430 
is that we still have the spider-man no
more<00:05:13.330> banner<00:05:13.780> on<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.280> left<00:05:15.280> side<00:05:16.440> which

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
more banner on the left side which

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.350 
more banner on the left side which
really<00:05:17.770> doesn't<00:05:18.190> make<00:05:18.430> any<00:05:18.610> sense<00:05:18.940> in<00:05:19.210> this

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
really doesn't make any sense in this

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.180 
really doesn't make any sense in this
context<00:05:19.960> because<00:05:20.229> he<00:05:20.350> did<00:05:20.560> put<00:05:20.740> back<00:05:20.949> on<00:05:21.160> the

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
context because he did put back on the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.010 
context because he did put back on the
suit<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:23.500> fact<00:05:23.919> that<00:05:24.039> it<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.310> released

suit and the fact that it is released

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.460 
suit and the fact that it is released
like<00:05:26.020> this<00:05:26.199> issue<00:05:26.699> didn't<00:05:27.699> really<00:05:28.139> focus<00:05:29.139> on

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
like this issue didn't really focus on

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.010 
like this issue didn't really focus on
the<00:05:29.620> struggles<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.340> interpersonal<00:05:31.020> anguish

the struggles the interpersonal anguish

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.170 
the struggles the interpersonal anguish
that<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:33.039> character<00:05:33.400> Miles<00:05:33.610> Morales<00:05:34.090> is

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
that the character Miles Morales is

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.350 
that the character Miles Morales is
going<00:05:34.510> through<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:36.010> almost<00:05:36.340> seems<00:05:36.669> kind<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.120> I

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
going through it almost seems kind of I

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.120 
going through it almost seems kind of I
