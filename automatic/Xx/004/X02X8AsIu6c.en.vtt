00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.720
 The regular PSV reporters will get a know about it on Tuesday 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.990
 new season 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.930
 The couple was only on it when they got there a lot clearer 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.129
 says both for months 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.559
 express their confidence in Fred Rutten 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.079
 Fred stays like it 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.310
 is also fixed in the contract for the season 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.169
 also the trainer of psv 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.449
 numerous most important news 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.130
 surprise 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.479
 neither 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.979
 you know i think that fat 2 itself is patient about the question of 

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:35.980
 then I have to go through or not 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.580
 the church nevertheless experienced sufficient confidence with both the management and the players 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.649
 if she 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.520
 like his own people around him 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.200
 Because the hijacker pull the club has now clearly stated that they do 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.660
 are not doing the tenth 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.850
 according to tiny sanders, more important pillars are more experience, his commitment passion 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.970
 and 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.640
 more scoring power 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.490
 So if it is true that is very clear from the evaluation of conversations with 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.820
 The supporters is linked to a great need more at PSV 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.850
 it is a release because there is to bring 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.840
 we're leaving the players 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.980
 come a new people 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.360
 both of them I think the two hour time is clear for a kind of industry 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.840
 that we will recover in the rush hour or actually two Dutch Frisians 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.700
 except 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.500
 Dekker Koevermans in April again not in the picture that he certainly in the coming months 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.940
 they might come 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.240
 In addition, it has clearly indicated that something needs to be added in midfield such as 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.930
 that it's so beautiful to have finished the book 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.480
 and that a keeper is wanted that he can compete with love 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.500
 isaksson 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.070
 so I certainly do not rule out that without leaving we would do that again 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.870
 Released Tianjin giving has the handling systems at least 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.609
 that is what his agent Rob arjen give and that is that this is also open to 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.460
 are expensive guys who work a lot of salary 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.369
 and but that still needs to be found on the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.060
 budget to new 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.840
 attract fresh players 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.510
 already talked about the financial situation at that was on the penultimate day that 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.760
 all issue af barker top 10 is different from no questions about sponsorship 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.300
 and finances coming soon 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.390
 if that could be put on the table soon, probability says 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.399
 from then we need a little maybe at the end of the week 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.839
 So 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.999
 so yes it is of course essential because I mean he said that beautifully 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.249
 story and 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.709
 good all probably that it is fifty years 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.629
 that must already be realized 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.489
 yes that is 8 two fish 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.119
