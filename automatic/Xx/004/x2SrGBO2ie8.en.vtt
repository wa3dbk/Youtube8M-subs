guys<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.480> channel<00:00:13.130> the<00:00:14.130> first<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
guys on this channel the first was a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.160 
guys on this channel the first was a
bunker<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:16.160> a<00:00:17.160> support<00:00:18.119> /<00:00:18.570> bunker

bunker and this is a support / bunker

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.279 
bunker and this is a support / bunker
kind<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.500> build<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:20.630> you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.779> see<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
kind of build as you can see it's the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.070 
kind of build as you can see it's the
same<00:00:22.500> trade<00:00:22.800> lines<00:00:23.070> as<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.970> last<00:00:24.180> bill<00:00:24.750> but

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
same trade lines as the last bill but

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.460 
same trade lines as the last bill but
we've<00:00:25.230> changed<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.949> couple<00:00:26.369> skills

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
we've changed it up a couple skills

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
we've changed it up a couple skills
we're<00:00:28.470> keeping<00:00:28.980> losing<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.090> condition

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
we're keeping losing in a condition

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.900 
we're keeping losing in a condition
every<00:00:30.869> 10<00:00:31.050> seconds<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.710> well<00:00:32.340> as<00:00:32.520> night

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
every 10 seconds as well as night

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.440 
every 10 seconds as well as night
toughness<00:00:33.390> whenever<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.870> wield<00:00:34.380> our<00:00:34.739> shield

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
toughness whenever we wield our shield

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.900 
toughness whenever we wield our shield
but<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:36.630> we're<00:00:36.930> using<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.530> 30<00:00:38.280> toughness<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
but now we're using this 30 toughness to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.709 
but now we're using this 30 toughness to
all<00:00:39.030> allies<00:00:39.559> because<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.070> old<00:00:41.280> heal<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.540> not

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
all allies because the old heal was not

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.069 
all allies because the old heal was not
working<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.110> well<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:44.550> there's<00:00:45.149> show

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
working that well then there's show

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.479 
working that well then there's show
through<00:00:46.440> charge<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> twenty<00:00:46.950> percent<00:00:47.190> faster

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
through charge of twenty percent faster

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.020 
through charge of twenty percent faster
and<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:49.140> same<00:00:49.350> old<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.920> hand<00:00:50.129> weapon<00:00:50.760> skills

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and the same old to hand weapon skills

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.709 
and the same old to hand weapon skills
research<00:00:51.390> twenty<00:00:51.629> percent<00:00:51.840> faster<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
research twenty percent faster this is a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.830 
research twenty percent faster this is a
new<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.850> concentration<00:00:56.850> skills<00:00:57.149> lasting

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
new one concentration skills lasting

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
new one concentration skills lasting
twenty<00:00:58.109> percent<00:00:58.410> longer<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.010> recharging

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
twenty percent longer and recharging

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.049 
twenty percent longer and recharging
twenty<00:01:00.210> percent<00:01:00.420> faster<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> very

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
twenty percent faster that is a very

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.030 
twenty percent faster that is a very
important<00:01:03.780> skill<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:04.920> using

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
important skill because now I'm using

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
important skill because now I'm using
two<00:01:05.369> concentrations<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.330> reasons<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.960> will

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
two concentrations for reasons I will

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
two concentrations for reasons I will
mention<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.250> few<00:01:09.090> seconds<00:01:10.549> activating<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
mention in a few seconds activating the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
mention in a few seconds activating the
virtue<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> resolve<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:13.530> remove<00:01:13.920> three

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
virtue of resolve will remove three

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.920 
virtue of resolve will remove three
conditions<00:01:14.670> still<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> very

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
conditions still this is a very

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.600 
conditions still this is a very
important<00:01:16.439> part<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> build<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
important part of the build because it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.999 
important part of the build because it
does<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.350> conditioner

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
does not have that much conditioner

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.380 
does not have that much conditioner
removal<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.460> other<00:01:20.610> places<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:23.030> terms<00:01:24.030> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
removal in other places in terms of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.550 
removal in other places in terms of
equipment<00:01:25.850> we're<00:01:26.850> using<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.600> suggested<00:01:28.530> by

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
equipment we're using as suggested by

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
equipment we're using as suggested by
some<00:01:30.140> 15<00:01:31.140> runes<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> soldier<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.850> will

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
some 15 runes of the soldier which will

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.359 
some 15 runes of the soldier which will
give<00:01:33.270> us<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.409> extra<00:01:34.770> toughness<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
give us a lot of extra toughness and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
give us a lot of extra toughness and
vitality<00:01:35.670> making<00:01:36.390> us<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:37.170> more<00:01:37.200> tanky<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
vitality making us a lot more tanky and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.710 
vitality making us a lot more tanky and
then<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:40.200> 1<00:01:41.009> ruin<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> dewana<00:01:41.939> which<00:01:42.299> will<00:01:42.540> just

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
then a 1 ruin of dewana which will just

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.789 
then a 1 ruin of dewana which will just
increase<00:01:42.869> healing<00:01:43.619> by<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:45.799> then

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
increase healing by a little bit then

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.460 
increase healing by a little bit then
instead<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> using<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> great<00:01:48.899> sword<00:01:49.200> which

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
instead of using the great sword which

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.330 
instead of using the great sword which
was<00:01:49.649> working<00:01:49.979> okay<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.570> great<00:01:51.899> i'm

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
was working okay but not that great i'm

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.630 
was working okay but not that great i'm
using<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> hammer<00:01:53.700> which<00:01:54.000> has<00:01:54.149> more<00:01:54.450> CC<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
using the hammer which has more CC and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.080 
using the hammer which has more CC and
is<00:01:57.170> better<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.469> keeping<00:01:58.770> people<00:01:59.340> off<00:01:59.369> points

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
is better for keeping people off points

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
is better for keeping people off points
when<00:02:00.240> i<00:02:00.270> need<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.770> is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
when i need to do that because it is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590 
when i need to do that because it is
kind<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> hybrid<00:02:02.520> bill<00:02:02.880> between<00:02:03.270> being<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
kind of a hybrid bill between being a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.410 
kind of a hybrid bill between being a
bunker<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.290> being<00:02:05.930> supportive<00:02:06.930> class<00:02:08.420> i'm

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
bunker and being supportive class i'm

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.660 
bunker and being supportive class i'm
still<00:02:09.720> using<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.319> mace<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.979> shield<00:02:11.009> because

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
still using the mace and shield because

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.420 
still using the mace and shield because
it's<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.090> very

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
it's a very

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.369 
it's a very
a good<00:02:12.609> defensive<00:02:12.969> weapon<00:02:13.329> for<00:02:13.959> both<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
a good defensive weapon for both the

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.069 
a good defensive weapon for both the
roles<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.359> finally<00:02:16.359> I'm<00:02:16.510> sticking<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.770 
roles and finally I'm sticking to the
soldiers<00:02:17.469> amulet<00:02:17.950> because<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:18.969> solid<00:02:19.329> and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
soldiers amulet because it is solid and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.839 
soldiers amulet because it is solid and
brings<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.739> lot<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:20.980> strong<00:02:21.280> ability<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:23.230> terms

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
brings a lot of strong ability in terms

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.979 
brings a lot of strong ability in terms
of<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:26.200> skill<00:02:26.590> choice<00:02:26.859> I<00:02:27.359> am<00:02:28.359> back<00:02:28.659> to<00:02:28.689> using

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
of the skill choice I am back to using

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.110 
of the skill choice I am back to using
the<00:02:29.200> book<00:02:30.329> because<00:02:31.439> it<00:02:32.439> is<00:02:32.889> a<00:02:32.920> very<00:02:33.430> good<00:02:33.549> spell

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
the book because it is a very good spell

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.879 
the book because it is a very good spell
but<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:35.019> do<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:36.000> brought<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.650> hallowed<00:02:38.650> ground

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
but to do it I brought a hallowed ground

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.399 
but to do it I brought a hallowed ground
hallowed<00:02:39.849> ground<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> constant<00:02:40.989> creation

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
hallowed ground is a constant creation

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.089 
hallowed ground is a constant creation
that<00:02:41.620> gives<00:02:41.769> 12<00:02:42.189> seconds<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.939> stability<00:02:43.389> and

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
that gives 12 seconds of stability and

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.190 
that gives 12 seconds of stability and
that<00:02:45.099> is<00:02:45.459> very<00:02:46.060> important<00:02:46.599> because<00:02:47.409> it<00:02:48.280> allows

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
that is very important because it allows

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.539 
that is very important because it allows
you<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.379> pop<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.799> off<00:02:51.010> without<00:02:51.189> too<00:02:51.459> much

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
you to pop this off without too much

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.670 
you to pop this off without too much
trouble<00:02:51.730> what<00:02:52.510> they<00:02:52.629> did<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.079> spell<00:02:53.409> is

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
trouble what they did to the spell is

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.490 
trouble what they did to the spell is
remove<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.250> stability<00:02:54.849> that<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.629> gives<00:02:56.489> so

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
remove the stability that it gives so

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.050 
remove the stability that it gives so
what<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.620> means<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.340> people<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:00.969> just

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
what this means is that people can just

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.789 
what this means is that people can just
