 yes we know today the current leader TuS Kleefeld percent 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.949
 So a very attractive opponent but of course a tough game for 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.230
 no question to us 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.990
 TTT has five wins and one percent in the first six games 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.720
 Draw a draw 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.739
 and will accordingly table with 16 points 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.230
 he has a very experienced team also with higher-class players of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.240
 Therefore, it is already the end of the task for my team 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.660
 Percent despite the strong opponent, of course, we want the first home threesome 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.420
 retract this season 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.370
 it is also important to us who of the table situation for us 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.870
 win this game torrents percent and he was the easy of mine 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.790
 Team that they pass over 90 minutes of passion fight and use 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.900
 with our funds is trying percent in plus Krefeld India knee too 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.610
 to force 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.519
 but if we wish that succeeds 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.659
 when stolen the first dangerous situation to have Prussia 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.109
 mr 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.109
 he has 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.880
 power 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.670
 was 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.860
 4 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.719
 also the guests were very dangerous in the first half 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.719
 we by a free kick 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.470
 in the 21 minute very big limelight July it will be serious to mine 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.470
 announced 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.130
 but the opponents also remained very dangerous 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.690
 in the 39 minutes, people got the wood 05 points 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 clear 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.190
 more 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.500
 in the second half, the guests from Krefeld were out of the result 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 improve and now put pressure 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.629
 Horns 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.629
 the logical consequence was 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.279
 in the 78 minutes, the first goal for 2 2 used 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.879

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.519
 here Parma 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.549

 more 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.299
 in the 78 minute had to be at that time 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.729
 hopefully you can get 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.109
 out 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.919
