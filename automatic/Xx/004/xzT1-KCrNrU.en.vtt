00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.690
 hello friends how are we good them 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 I bring the comparison superficially 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 of the iphone5 black and the white iphone5 ok 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.420
 why superficially because both 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.220
 they are identical on the inside the only thing that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.410
 change is the color ok 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.869
 what will change is the color of your 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.759
 two devices I no longer bring them the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.140
 unboxing of iphone 5 in black then 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.329
 because it's the same as the iphone 5 in 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.379
 white ok the only thing I want to focus on 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.570
 this time is how I could tell them 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.670
 nothing more so that they see the details in 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.100
 color black and white we are going to 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.180
 start with the white one that 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:51.370
 phone I loved because of the fact 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:54.790
 that here this line is polished and shines 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.870
 as they have no idea the truth that shines 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.949
 very pretty 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.120
 we can check it on the sides 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.010
 we only found the button 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.050
 vibrated volume 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:15.480
 down headset 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:17.930
 lightning connector microphone and speaker 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.050
 slot sim 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.880
 button off and on though 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.000
 we can see that both backwards and for 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.430
 ahead looks very elegant here we can 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.680
 see that it has the lines in color of 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.620
 phone the antennas in white color 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.710
 we can see and back what 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:42.650
 we found is the blank glass 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.140
 iphone this is the ipod toch material 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.090
 good from previous generations that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.940
 it means that if we do not take care of it as 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.280
 should we are going to scratch horribly the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.540
 apple I already put a protector on them 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.820
 I just removed nothing else so that 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.190
 look good on the video and camera 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.070
 microphone and flash here is also 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.259
 good aluminum forgiveness of glass ok now 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.700
 let's go to the iphone without going to leave this 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.250
 now we compare the two at the same 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.380
 time goes out 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.290
 now let's put the iphone5 january 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.080
 I also loved this one 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.450
 very good this compared to the iphone 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.820
 blank the lines you have to the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.000
 sides are being a matte black 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.020
 Brilliant that's what made me fall in love 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.870
 of the black phone 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.120
 these lines in black and good too 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.910
 that everything everything has been black 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.800
 and graphite we can see the same with this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.500
 connector was going to say vibrated button 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.000
 Volume button 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.150
 this is going to be earphone horn sorry 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.860
 voice microphone and this lightning connector 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.660
 and horn ok 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.420
 here, what we found would come 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.080
 being the slot for the sim 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.630
 and lock button ok absolutely nothing 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.940
 more that is the bad thing about this phone or 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.360
 What is it that I did not like that 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.980
 being black you hit everything or everything 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.140
 everything all sticks any garbage 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.209
 what you see already scares you if you think that 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.680
 is scratched why because how do they 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.540
 black because usually the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.810
 dust particles are being so 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.209
 white and sticks super easy but it comes 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.420
 being exactly the same as the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.790
 iphone 5 blank of this glass 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.700
 aluminum but if it's a painted aluminum 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.019
 an anodized aluminum come to the apple 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.819
 apple iphone iphone and glass ok the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.560
 true that the two are very good 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.019
 color options whatever you want 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.760
 buy the truth I recommend it 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.350
 we can pretty see here are coming 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.720
 identical there is no comparison look now 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.299
 you both want to choose what is 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.000
 bad of this that the prints are stuck 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.950
 terribly like the ipad mini lp's 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.049
 mini black the truth that is has it 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.940
 touch load confuse it if you do not want 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.140
 that your fingerprints are completely 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.690
 well here I finish it 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.090
 and you can already see here the traces of seeing that 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.100
 this is the bad thing of the phone in black in 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.319
 white does not happen that the truth we have 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.380
 that being honest does not happen but good 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:13.130
 is your decision which one you want which one 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.660
 like me more personally is that the 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.820
 two are very nice taking the ones in the 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.540
 hand you can not choose, I fall 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.200
 serious 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.840
 I would stay of the two in good and 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.240
 all I think I would stay I do not know 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.980
 but the truth is that you have the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.530
 theme word already in question of likes already 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.540
 It's a matter of your liking and then 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.690
 you choose boys not what they 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.260
 like more iphone 5 in black or 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.699
 iPhone 5 in white color comes out to the best 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.639
 these comparatives already tired of 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.850
 see them in color but for Latin America 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.590
 the truth that it is very very very scarce 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.960
 the iphone 5 still despite the fact that 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.460
 has enough already goes for already has 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.040
 more than the month that came out in Mexico 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.510
 example in Colombia it seems to me that it came out 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.729
 the twenty-second of November does not have 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.590
 a lot of time and it's very hard to get 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.850
 phones so good friends then 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.500
 that's all I wish you liked this 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.270
 short video which you would you choose your there 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.710
 25 in black or iphone 5 in the communions 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.389
 we can the friends videos and see you in 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.389
 the next bye bye
