cool<00:00:58.620> thing<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.219> nitrocharge<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.969> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
cool thing about the nitrocharge is that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.650 
cool thing about the nitrocharge is that
it<00:01:00.390> provides<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.460> protective<00:01:02.460> fuel<00:01:03.210> will

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
it provides a very protective fuel will

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.990 
it provides a very protective fuel will
get<00:01:03.899> down<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.430> what<00:01:05.430> i<00:01:05.460> mean<00:01:05.670> by<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
get down to the what i mean by that a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
get down to the what i mean by that a
little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.390> later<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.869> still<00:01:07.439> being<00:01:07.680> fairly

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
little bit later all still being fairly

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.920 
little bit later all still being fairly
lightweight<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.670> weighs<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.090> 8.4<00:01:09.630> ounces

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
lightweight it weighs in at 8.4 ounces

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.800 
lightweight it weighs in at 8.4 ounces
oats<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.040> bulky<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.700> which<00:01:11.939> i<00:01:12.390> would

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
oats it's not bulky at all which i would

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
oats it's not bulky at all which i would
kind<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> expect<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.520> boot<00:01:14.880> that's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
kind of expect from a boot that's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.140 
kind of expect from a boot that's
supposed<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> offer<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:16.110> protection<00:01:16.140> i

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
supposed to offer more protection i

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.460 
supposed to offer more protection i
would<00:01:18.150> expect<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.350> bit

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
would expect it to be a little bit

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.760 
would expect it to be a little bit
heavier<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> primarily<00:01:22.650> black

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
heavier so you get a primarily black

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.590 
heavier so you get a primarily black
upper<00:01:24.740> with<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.340> metallic<00:01:27.119> silver<00:01:27.950> stripes

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
right there in right there metallic

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.569 
right there in right there metallic
silver<00:01:32.549> studs<00:01:33.170> some<00:01:34.170> translucent<00:01:34.799> studs<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
silver studs some translucent studs and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.880 
silver studs some translucent studs and
then<00:01:36.770> electricity<00:01:38.090> energy<00:01:39.259> sling

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.180 

that's<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.450> point<00:01:45.659> out<00:01:45.870> there<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.680> laces<00:01:47.070> if

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
that's one point out there the laces if

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.020 
that's one point out there the laces if
you<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.520> put<00:01:47.760> those<00:01:47.940> on<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.250> heel<00:01:50.490> liner<00:01:50.760> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
you just put those on the heel liner and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.170 
you just put those on the heel liner and
also<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.720> insole<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> nitrocharge<00:01:54.930> 1.0

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
also the insole so the nitrocharge 1.0

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.149 
also the insole so the nitrocharge 1.0
features<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.510> few<00:01:58.290> different<00:01:58.590> materials<00:01:59.010> so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
features a few different materials so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
features a few different materials so
you<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.520> hyper<00:01:59.700> touch<00:02:00.030> synthetic<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you get the hyper touch synthetic in the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.249 
you get the hyper touch synthetic in the
forefoot<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:03.630> protective<00:02:04.170> mesh<00:02:05.869> back<00:02:06.869> here

forefoot the protective mesh back here

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.090 
forefoot the protective mesh back here
and<00:02:08.240> then<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.690> energy<00:02:10.170> sling<00:02:10.500> right<00:02:10.709> there<00:02:10.860> so

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
and then the energy sling right there so

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.850 
and then the energy sling right there so
in<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.720> forefoot<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> heel

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
in the forefoot and then the heel

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.250 
in the forefoot and then the heel
there's<00:02:14.280> these<00:02:14.580> pre-molded<00:02:15.209> pads<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.989> offer<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
there's these pre-molded pads to offer a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.440 
there's these pre-molded pads to offer a
little<00:02:16.470> bit<00:02:16.739> more<00:02:16.860> protection<00:02:17.270> which<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
little bit more protection which is a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.890 
little bit more protection which is a
cool<00:02:18.720> idea<00:02:18.840> by<00:02:19.260> ideas<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.270> just<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
cool idea by ideas so it's just like a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.170 
cool idea by ideas so it's just like a
little<00:02:22.200> bit<00:02:22.380> extra<00:02:22.790> material<00:02:23.790> there<00:02:23.970> like

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
kind of like a foam it feels like under

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.840 
kind of like a foam it feels like under
and<00:02:26.390> also<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> heel<00:02:28.489> there's<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
and also in the heel there's the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.900 
and also in the heel there's the
pre-molded<00:02:30.720> Pat's<00:02:31.110> also<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.920> offer<00:02:32.130> more

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
cleated in the heel as I said there's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.840 
cleated in the heel as I said there's
the<00:02:39.660> energy<00:02:40.080> sling<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> forefoot<00:02:40.980> which

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
the energy sling in the forefoot which

give a cleaner striking surface and then

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.340 
give a cleaner striking surface and then
he<00:03:26.100> can<00:03:26.250> tell<00:03:26.549> here<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:28.019> get<00:03:28.170> the

he can tell here you do get the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.020 
he can tell here you do get the

electricity he'll enter as I said and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.640 
electricity he'll enter as I said and
it's<00:03:30.630> kind<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.230> new<00:03:31.440> book<00:03:31.620> material

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
it's kind of like a new book material

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.259 
it's kind of like a new book material
and<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:34.799> pretty<00:03:35.040> soft<00:03:35.280> offers<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> good

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
and it's pretty soft offers a good

amount of padding and then the insole as

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.349 
amount of padding and then the insole as
kind<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.350> okay<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.650> guess<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.850> new<00:03:45.150> book

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359
