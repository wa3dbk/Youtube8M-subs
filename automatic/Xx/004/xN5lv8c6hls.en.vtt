jungle that I've tested so I don't think

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.350 
jungle that I've tested so I don't think
this<00:03:27.450> guy's<00:03:27.630> particularly<00:03:28.470> going<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.430> be<00:03:30.060> good

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
this guy's particularly going to be good

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.780 
this guy's particularly going to be good
in<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.630> jungle<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.350> never<00:03:31.740> thought<00:03:31.860> he<00:03:32.280> was<00:03:32.459> but

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
in the jungle I never thought he was but

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.340 
in the jungle I never thought he was but
you<00:03:32.910> know<00:03:32.940> he<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.240> clear<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.540> as<00:03:33.990> you<00:03:34.080> can<00:03:34.200> see

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
you know he can clear it as you can see

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.960 
you know he can clear it as you can see
he's<00:03:34.470> quite<00:03:34.680> healthy<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.190> building<00:03:35.580> tanky

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
he's quite healthy and building tanky

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.970 
he's quite healthy and building tanky
tends<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.720> be<00:03:36.810> good<00:03:36.959> in<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.110> jungle<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.830> I

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
tends to be good in the jungle and I

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.920 
tends to be good in the jungle and I
mean<00:03:38.100> he<00:03:38.160> wants<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.459> tanky<00:03:38.760> anyway<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.120> if

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
mean he wants to be tanky anyway so if

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.370 
mean he wants to be tanky anyway so if
you<00:03:40.320> have<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.770> I<00:03:40.830> guess<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.340> could<00:03:41.370> do<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.850> um

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
you have to I guess you could do it um

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.050 
you have to I guess you could do it um
I'm<00:03:43.380> going<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:43.920> assume<00:03:44.160> as<00:03:44.310> ganks<00:03:44.670> wouldn't<00:03:44.970> be

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
I'm going to assume as ganks wouldn't be

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.790 
I'm going to assume as ganks wouldn't be
that<00:03:45.330> great<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:45.840> he<00:03:45.930> does<00:03:46.080> have<00:03:46.230> some<00:03:46.470> form<00:03:46.740> of

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
that great but he does have some form of

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.920 
that great but he does have some form of
CC<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.400> he<00:03:47.459> can<00:03:47.610> like<00:03:47.730> jump<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.300> allies<00:03:48.690> and
