00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.700 

hello<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.660> boy<00:00:10.110> do<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.349> have<00:00:10.500> something

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
hello and boy do I have something

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.419 
hello and boy do I have something
exciting<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.760> today<00:00:12.230> now<00:00:13.250> you<00:00:14.250> may<00:00:14.370> be

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
exciting for you today now you may be

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.820 
exciting for you today now you may be
aware<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.090> concept<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:16.080> piston

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
aware of the concept of a piston

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.630 
aware of the concept of a piston
caterpillar<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:18.420> idea<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.890> get<00:00:20.279> two

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
caterpillar the idea is that you get two

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.580 
caterpillar the idea is that you get two
pistons<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.210> they<00:00:21.779> push<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> pull<00:00:22.470> each

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
pistons and they push and pull each

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.840 
pistons and they push and pull each
other<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.160> then<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
other so you do that and then you do a

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.240 
other so you do that and then you do a
one<00:00:27.269> tick<00:00:27.510> pulse<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.670> it<00:00:29.670> would<00:00:29.789> put<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
one tick pulse and it would put the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.700 
one tick pulse and it would put the
piston<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.140> then<00:00:34.140> you'll<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
piston there and then you'll get the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.220 
piston there and then you'll get the
next<00:00:34.739> person<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.340> pull<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:37.079> another

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
next person to pull it and then another

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.940 
next person to pull it and then another
one<00:00:37.530> tick<00:00:37.800> pulse<00:00:39.020> would<00:00:40.020> pull<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> back<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
one tick pulse would pull it back and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.160 
one tick pulse would pull it back and
the<00:00:41.640> piston<00:00:43.129> caterpillar<00:00:44.390> with<00:00:45.390> inch<00:00:45.629> its<00:00:45.930> way

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the piston caterpillar with inch its way

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.150 
the piston caterpillar with inch its way
along<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.710> track<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:48.469> that's<00:00:49.469> exactly<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:50.039> we

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
along a track and that's exactly what we

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.150 
along a track and that's exactly what we
have<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:50.550> today<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:55.920> it's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
have here today so you can see it's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.479 
have here today so you can see it's
really<00:00:57.090> quite<00:00:57.420> small<00:00:58.129> it's<00:00:59.129> pretty<00:00:59.340> much

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
really quite small it's pretty much

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700 
really quite small it's pretty much
points<00:00:59.879> device<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.260> looks<00:01:01.440> pretty<00:01:01.559> cool

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
points device but it looks pretty cool

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.389 
points device but it looks pretty cool
and<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.640> fun<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.449> bit<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.840> logic

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
and it's just a fun little bit of logic

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.850 
and it's just a fun little bit of logic
now<00:01:05.399> this<00:01:05.850> thing<00:01:05.910> works<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> most<00:01:07.110> absurd

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
now this thing works in the most absurd

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
now this thing works in the most absurd
way<00:01:08.299> that<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.360> could<00:01:09.510> ever<00:01:09.600> possibly<00:01:09.750> think

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
way that you could ever possibly think

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.289 
way that you could ever possibly think
of<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:11.040> uses<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.000> bud<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:13.860> cascade<00:01:14.549> other<00:01:14.850> buds

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
of it uses a bud to cascade other buds

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.690 
of it uses a bud to cascade other buds
in<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:16.799> soft<00:01:17.430> pattern<00:01:18.439> which<00:01:19.439> creates<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
in a soft pattern which creates the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.010 
in a soft pattern which creates the
pattern<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.780> require<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.830> pattern<00:01:23.220> that

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
pattern that we require the pattern that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.399 
pattern that we require the pattern that
moves<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.380> Pistons<00:01:25.799> along<00:01:26.600> however<00:01:27.600> it's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
moves the Pistons along however it's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.830 
moves the Pistons along however it's
pretty<00:01:28.740> awesome<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.400> once<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.509> gets<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
pretty awesome because once it gets to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.960 
pretty awesome because once it gets to
the<00:01:30.960> end<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> will<00:01:31.860> automatically<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the end it will automatically go all the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.200 
the end it will automatically go all the
way<00:01:33.000> back<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> beginning<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.900> restart

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
way back to the beginning and restart

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.219 
way back to the beginning and restart
which<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.450> don't<00:01:36.659> know<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.930> sounds

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
which I don't know if that sounds

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.810 
which I don't know if that sounds
impressive<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.250> you've<00:01:38.400> tried<00:01:38.579> building

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
impressive but if you've tried building

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.359 
impressive but if you've tried building
one<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.180> before<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:41.220> one

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
one of these before you know for one

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.859 
one of these before you know for one
they<00:01:41.700> usually<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.180> big<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
they usually get really big and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.910 
they usually get really big and
complicated<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.970> too<00:01:45.470> they<00:01:46.470> only<00:01:46.619> use<00:01:46.890> your

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
complicated and too they only use your

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.789 
complicated and too they only use your
go<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.369> direction<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> reset

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
go in one direction so that's the reset

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
go in one direction so that's the reset
switch<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.720> how<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.350> switch

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
switch there but this is how you switch

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.039 
switch there but this is how you switch
it<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.640> place<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.000> block<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
it on you just place a block at the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.480 
it on you just place a block at the
beginning<00:01:55.579> as<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.530> Pistons<00:01:59.189> are

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
beginning as you can see the Pistons are

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.139 
beginning as you can see the Pistons are
going<00:01:59.969> absolutely<00:02:00.210> insane<00:02:01.159> as<00:02:02.159> saw<00:02:02.520> jiggling

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
going absolutely insane as saw jiggling

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.420 
going absolutely insane as saw jiggling
around<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.140> piston<00:02:04.439> tape<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> piston

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
around and the piston tape or the piston

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.910 
around and the piston tape or the piston
caterpillar<00:02:05.880> has<00:02:06.420> moved<00:02:06.719> across<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.380> then<00:02:07.799> as

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
caterpillar has moved across and then as

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.940 
caterpillar has moved across and then as
you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.250> goes<00:02:09.149> all<00:02:09.299> the<00:02:09.329> way<00:02:09.450> back<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.830> its

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you can see goes all the way back to its

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.400 
you can see goes all the way back to its
original<00:02:11.009> position<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.989> basically<00:02:12.989> starts

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
original position and basically starts

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.270 
original position and basically starts
again

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
again

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.910 
again
so<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.270> button<00:02:15.630> here<00:02:15.660> switches<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.620> all<00:02:16.740> off

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so this button here switches it all off

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.030 
so this button here switches it all off
and<00:02:18.860> yeah<00:02:19.860> pretty<00:02:20.850> damn<00:02:21.060> awesome<00:02:21.770> now<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.830> can

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
and yeah pretty damn awesome now you can

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.930 
and yeah pretty damn awesome now you can
also<00:02:23.310> go<00:02:24.209> from<00:02:24.450> whichever<00:02:24.750> side<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.260> want

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
also go from whichever side you want

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.160 
also go from whichever side you want
simply<00:02:26.940> by<00:02:27.060> placing<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.540> block<00:02:27.810> at<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.050> other

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
simply by placing the block at the other

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.940 
simply by placing the block at the other
end<00:02:29.180> as<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.330> can<00:02:30.390> see<00:02:30.600> now<00:02:31.110> it's<00:02:31.319> going<00:02:31.560> slower

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
end as you can see now it's going slower

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.010 
end as you can see now it's going slower
this<00:02:32.190> way<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:33.060> will<00:02:33.180> go<00:02:33.300> quicker<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
this way and it will go quicker on the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.160 
this way and it will go quicker on the
way<00:02:34.319> back<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.810> let's<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.050> let<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.319> do<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
way back so let's just let that do it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.110 
way back so let's just let that do it
gets<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.410> end<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.870> goes<00:02:42.870> back

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
gets to the end there and goes back

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.670 
gets to the end there and goes back
admittedly<00:02:45.120> sometimes<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.870> decides<00:02:46.440> this

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
admittedly sometimes it decides this

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.570 
admittedly sometimes it decides this
gonna<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.340> know<00:02:47.510> stop<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.890> usually<00:02:50.130> it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
gonna you know stop but it usually it

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.080 
gonna you know stop but it usually it
will<00:02:50.730> find<00:02:50.940> its<00:02:51.090> way<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.670> think<00:02:53.700> that's

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
will find its way and I think that's

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.440 
will find its way and I think that's
pretty<00:02:54.450> damn<00:02:54.720> awesome<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.580> also<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.120> love<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
pretty damn awesome and also I love the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.320 
pretty damn awesome and also I love the
way<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.720> looks<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:58.890> these<00:02:59.220> dancing<00:02:59.880> Pistons

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
way it looks this these dancing Pistons

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.809 
way it looks this these dancing Pistons
everywhere<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.900> am<00:03:01.769> surprised<00:03:02.190> my<00:03:02.340> computer<00:03:02.730> is

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
everywhere I am surprised my computer is

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.559 
everywhere I am surprised my computer is
managing<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.360> record<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.989> at<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.590> same<00:03:04.769> time

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
managing to record this at the same time

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.540 
managing to record this at the same time
anyway<00:03:06.569> hit<00:03:07.230> reset<00:03:07.640> resets<00:03:08.640> everything<00:03:08.910> and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
anyway hit reset resets everything and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.860 
anyway hit reset resets everything and
yeah<00:03:11.750> fairly<00:03:12.750> straightforward<00:03:13.550> this<00:03:14.870> block

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
yeah fairly straightforward this block

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.479 
yeah fairly straightforward this block
here<00:03:16.310> it's<00:03:17.310> powering<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.510> piston<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:22.489> when

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
here it's powering this piston and when

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.729 
here it's powering this piston and when
this<00:03:23.670> piston<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.450> given<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.019> block<00:03:25.200> update<00:03:25.500> it

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
understand but it gives a pretty neat

understand but it gives a pretty neat
little<00:03:54.180> effect<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:56.130> that's<00:03:56.579> about<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.790> for

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
little effect so that's about it for

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.610 
little effect so that's about it for

background noise no much can be done for

background noise no much can be done for
that<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.989> believe<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.799> someone<00:04:11.340> outside<00:04:11.519> is

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
that I believe that someone outside is

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.710 
that I believe that someone outside is
making<00:04:12.420> quite<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.660> racket<00:04:13.370> anyway<00:04:14.370> anyway<00:04:14.579> as<00:04:14.850> a

making quite a racket anyway anyway as a

making quite a racket anyway anyway as a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
final thing to sign off this video I'm

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.890 
final thing to sign off this video I'm
going<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.700> what<00:04:17.820> happens<00:04:17.940> if<00:04:18.209> we<00:04:18.390> start

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
going to see what happens if we start

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.750 
going to see what happens if we start
the<00:04:19.019> bud<00:04:19.260> at<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.979> different<00:04:20.280> location<00:04:20.370> I

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
the bud at a different location I

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.250 
the bud at a different location I
haven't<00:04:21.000> done<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.209> before<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.930> have<00:04:22.019> no

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
haven't done this before so I have no

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.870 
haven't done this before so I have no
idea<00:04:22.470> what's<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> happen

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
idea what's going to happen

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.670 
idea what's going to happen
looks<00:04:25.540> like<00:04:25.720> it's<00:04:25.870> just<00:04:25.930> doing<00:04:26.230> exactly<00:04:26.470> the

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
looks like it's just doing exactly the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.550 
looks like it's just doing exactly the
same<00:04:26.740> thing<00:04:27.240> p.m.<00:04:28.240> even<00:04:28.450> I<00:04:28.540> could<00:04:29.320> end<00:04:29.470> up

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
same thing p.m. even I could end up

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.750 
same thing p.m. even I could end up
doing<00:04:29.740> something<00:04:29.890> dif<00:04:30.220> let's<00:04:30.430> give<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.640> a

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
doing something dif let's give it a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.560 
doing something dif let's give it a
little<00:04:30.910> bit<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.930> watch<00:04:36.450> well<00:04:37.450> that's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
little bit of a watch well that's

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.570 
little bit of a watch well that's
interesting<00:04:37.800> seems<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.980> point<00:04:39.220> in<00:04:39.340> which<00:04:39.370> you

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
interesting seems the point in which you

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.280 
interesting seems the point in which you
start<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.150> is<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.510> point<00:04:40.720> in<00:04:40.900> which<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:41.170> goes

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
start it is the point in which it goes

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.550 
start it is the point in which it goes
to<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:42.570> suppose<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.720> could<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:43.930> declared<00:04:44.440> as

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
to I suppose that could be declared as

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.330 
to I suppose that could be declared as
another<00:04:44.860> feature<00:04:45.130> how<00:04:45.880> interesting<00:04:46.200> anyway

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
another feature how interesting anyway

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.470 
another feature how interesting anyway
let's<00:04:48.340> switch<00:04:48.640> that<00:04:48.820> off<00:04:48.880> and<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:50.800> course<00:04:51.480> you

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
let's switch that off and of course you

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.140 
let's switch that off and of course you
can<00:04:52.630> extend<00:04:52.930> this<00:04:53.050> as<00:04:53.290> far<00:04:53.500> as<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:53.710> want<00:04:53.920> so<00:04:54.850> if

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
can extend this as far as you want so if
