00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 ae 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.380
 Hey, people, beauty, I'm here today. 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.480
 along with Edson is being another video 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.030
 ip for you even every day has 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.010
 no fuck here bringing you a 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:44.180
 program called laser are closing 17.1 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.269
 do not just call it that's not it 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.010
 The internet is there and I'm going to have that one. 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.040
 problem here for you who loves to play 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.260
 so in high style let's say you 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.019
 likes to play with graphics at most 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.420
 suddenly only noticed on May 30 also 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.739
 they care about the audio quality of the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.810
 your game you already thought then 187 one 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.000
 7.1 headphone jack 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.179
 In case you have not thought how it should be 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 cool then the recipe doing this 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:15.320
 possibility for all to organize 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.979
 develop a program of free 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.009
 grace looks only one of grace that promises and 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.789
 can actually regulate 17.11 and 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.770
 leaves his red perfectly 7 7 with 11 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.750
 what does he carli for all 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.200
 sides you have to carry all the sides 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.810
 of the 77 and south coast is 7 in 7.1 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.880
 The only thing I know is just to be your 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.930
 heard in stereo and generally all 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.540
 are 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.090
 and there it presents a very 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.670
 You can not see anything beautiful. 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.130
 complicated very easy to move super 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.750
 quiet and I'll put the deficit alone 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.020
 you noticed the difference between a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.289
 normal sound and 17 for you to have a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.289
 idea 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.629
 it's a place in the face 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.470
 ae 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.510
 equal pant 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.700
 now 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.890
 simple only really you should have 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.770
 perceived is that the last one actually changes 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.930
 more very same goes for those that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.590
 likes to play really great religions 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.080
 who have 7.1 or 51 you using and feeling 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.740
 the emotion looking like local processing 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.840
 huh 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.880
 you hear the sound from all directions 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.280
 so that's basically how the album 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.220
 the song area so lack of water should 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.470
 be negative free robot version good but 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.970
 continuous works right 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.800
 I'll take that call this 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.450
 information I'll take advantage of 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.940
 show more negative maybe from here it 's 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.190
 super cool, I saw a booster come get 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.680
 everybody already knows he's not laughing 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.370
 specifically only one version came out 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.570
 It's been a while since the game 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.000
 improved by risi 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.410
 and so it becomes more beautiful both in the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.300
 interface as smoke plays 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.290
 because it works best when 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.570
 the game booster 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.550
 never I will also leave in the description 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.110
 download it it really helps 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.340
 enough to improve the performance of 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.979
 your games normally you should already 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.479
 know if you know what it is to suffer with 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.260
 legging or anything like yours 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.690
 games, right? 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.220
 We've been looking for a way to get the 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.020
 game fan a thing and that 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.760
 indicative really helps a lot and 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.300
 I'll leave the application 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.280
 the download along with the other nÃ© the audio 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.720
