00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.899
 that's for sure who has the compressor 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.870
 many they use it all 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.429
 the functionality that is here I have 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:19.140
 named mower 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:22.230
 and last here if we can see here it is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.710
 I have this broken thing standing here 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.529
 key 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.439
 and that's when I raid on a knife 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 a bunch of sand and important to me 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:38.730
 knife n scroll pinches the screw then 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.399
 there is this bolt and unscrew it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.000
 practically 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.000
 I'll show you 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.719
 unscrewing it with a key is not only 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.340
 difficult it is impossible firstly pretty 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.340
 inconvenient to do this whole thing 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:30.390
 that's where my effort i do this 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:35.990
 I canâ€™t fail so we 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.990
 come here to this tool 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.289
 such a retreat anyway someone him 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.560
 it will be useful for someone 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:52.640
 because now i need a rag i 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.640
 I can hold even with one hand 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:02:03.599
 5 seconds of work and bolt unscrewed when 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.599
 working with this bolt keys I tried 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:10.679
 already began to face here if you can see 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:14.910
 the cutter began so if there is 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:21.540
 compressor does not press on the headstock from 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:25.950
 feel sorry for the wrench, he will help you 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.389
 he bailed out so many times I never 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.940
 smoldering regretted that bought it, I advise 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:36.329
 unscrew such bolts that no 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.840
 pincers would not get out even rusty 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.760
 bolts that are twisted 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.810
 when installing here it is freedom 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.410
 we put here on one lungs 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.220
 blows 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.220
 she unscrews how to get out 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.709
 light blows on unscrew very 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.630
 gently bolts which are in principle either 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:07.680
 curl up or twist here 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.989
 such a baida here I have here 7 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.739
 blades I hit probably will be seen 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:22.920
 got to it need me bent now 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:28.170
 I don't need to straighten it 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:31.350
 the most simple very useful thing and having 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.920
 compressor already bought it already regret 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.930
 these 40 bucks 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.930
