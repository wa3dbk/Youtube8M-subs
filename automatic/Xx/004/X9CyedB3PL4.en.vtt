00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:10.690
 and roasted tomato soup is our 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.389
 recipe for today is ready in 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.960
 only 20 minutes and can accompany 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.680
 any food let's see the ingredients 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.859
 a kilo of well-ripened chonto tomato 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.189
 half a kilo of white big onion 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.400
 thyme oregano fresh to taste salt and 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.309
 pepper also to taste a liter of 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.640
 chicken background a small can of puree 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:41.230
 of tomato 2 cloves of garlic a spoonful 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.230
 of sugar and 250 grams of bacon 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.760
 what we are doing is simply 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.079
 We need the bacon 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.480
 help make it like a crown one 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.629
 crispy to have the texture in the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.579
 soup and I do not use more fat just the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.129
 grace of the bacon that will let me go 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.109
 a lot of flavor and with that after I go to 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.600
 sauté the onions and with that same 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.760
 fat is going to get grilled for 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.860
 brown the tomatoes well 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.580
 I'll put the tomatoes first by the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.580
 side of the skin 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.909
 Y 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.909
 the fat is not coming out now 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.870
 here what I 'm going to start doing is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.240
 add a little the bacon so that 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.380
 I'm dehydrating here as you see 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.380
 is burning the tomato already 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.360
 I will be putting some of here 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.520
 and there we go crushing the tomato 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.110
 As you are already browning, I am going to lower 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.110
 the fire 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.490
 because what I need is that the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.560
 Tomato starts to sweat 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.540
 I'm going to take this great date to go 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 putting the onion to brown too 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.430
 if they do not have a clamp here also 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:26.540
 it works very well a have seen that there 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.540
 some pisa puree that are like a web tea 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.110
 because you would make a puree with the tomato 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.660
 between the tomato is more red the soup goes 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.660
 to be more sweet to this is 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.400
 and we're going to have to correct the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.319
 taste generally tomato soup 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.660
 you have to add a little sugar to the 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.330
 final because because if the tomato is a 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.720
 little acid with heat is acidity is going 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.500
 to notice more the chicken background is 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.510
 optional 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.550
 if the tomatoes have good juice there 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.550
 we need chicken background 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.580
 and I will go putting the onions 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.430
 Here we have some dried oregano 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.989
 and thyme more or less how much 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.250
 whole teaspoon of each and we have 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.480
 some garlic that will last in that 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.780
 same fat that I have there with the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.780
 bacon 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.400
 to enhance the taste a little 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.450
 once this is already known we are going 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.450
 to process it 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.360
 always when we are going to liquefy let's put 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.410
 the heavy stuff down and we're going to 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.410
 hydrating with liquid 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
 Y 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:31.790
 sift the filter pass it through a 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:34.850
 strainer as they see basically what 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.590
 you see here that are left is like the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.980
 remains of the verses of shell of 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.980
 tomato 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.270
 or 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:30.999
 and a splash of olive oil 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:33.550
 I have enough this soup is ideal 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:36.819
 for a light lunch you can accompany 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.710
 a delicious sandwich or a salad and 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.909
 for many other recipes we'll see you in 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.909
