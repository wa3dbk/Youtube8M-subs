rocks that you want to take advantage of
in<00:02:03.130> town<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:04.149> first<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.869> money<00:02:05.110> rock<00:02:05.349> and

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
in town the first is the money rock and

in town the first is the money rock and
every<00:02:05.890> single<00:02:06.250> day<00:02:06.459> there's<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.789> rock<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.360> if

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
every single day there's a rock that if

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.150 
every single day there's a rock that if
you<00:02:07.630> hit<00:02:07.869> with<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.140> shovel<00:02:08.440> over<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.099> over

you hit with a shovel over and over

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.680 
you hit with a shovel over and over
again<00:02:09.429> you'll<00:02:10.149> get<00:02:10.300> up<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:12.120> 16,000<00:02:13.120> bells<00:02:13.360> I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
again you'll get up to 16,000 bells I

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.480 
again you'll get up to 16,000 bells I
think<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.200> is

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
think that is

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.040 
think that is
the<00:02:14.580> max<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.090> pretty<00:02:15.330> hard<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:15.870> that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the max it's pretty hard to get that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.150 
the max it's pretty hard to get that
usually<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.860> about<00:02:18.530> let<00:02:19.530> me<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:19.920> I

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
usually I get about let me think I

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.400 
usually I get about let me think I
probably<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.880> around<00:02:21.360> eight<00:02:21.660> thousand<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.380> day

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
probably get around eight thousand a day

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.270 
probably get around eight thousand a day
from<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.370> rock<00:02:23.580> spits<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.240> about<00:02:24.810> a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
palm trees in your town island is your

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.190 
palm trees in your town island is your

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
best bet and I personally like to go to

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.540 
best bet and I personally like to go to
the<00:04:33.260> island<00:04:33.560> anyway<00:04:33.890> just<00:04:34.100> because<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.430> think

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
the island anyway just because I think

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.570 
the island anyway just because I think
it's<00:04:34.790> easier<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.210> navigate<00:04:35.360> around<00:04:36.190> since<00:04:37.190> all

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
it's easier to navigate around since all

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.400 
it's easier to navigate around since all
the<00:04:37.790> trees<00:04:38.000> are<00:04:38.120> kind<00:04:38.300> in<00:04:38.420> one<00:04:38.600> area<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.260> it's

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
the trees are kind in one area and it's

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.960 
the trees are kind in one area and it's
just<00:04:39.620> like<00:04:39.680> little<00:04:39.920> circle<00:04:40.490> I<00:04:40.610> think<00:04:40.850> it's

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
just like little circle I think it's

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.970 
just like little circle I think it's
much<00:04:41.090> easier<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.690> navigate<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.740> take

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
much easier to navigate and to take

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.250 
much easier to navigate and to take
advantage<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:43.970> I<00:04:44.000> want<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.390> show<00:04:44.840> off<00:04:45.050> cuz
