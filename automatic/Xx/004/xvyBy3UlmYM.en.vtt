Beyblade launcher well if you like mod
it<00:02:27.180> modify<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.290> keeps<00:02:28.410> spinning

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
it modify it so that it keeps spinning

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.720 
it modify it so that it keeps spinning
after<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.730> actually<00:02:30.090> keeps<00:02:30.210> spinning<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.810> I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
after it actually keeps spinning and I

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.340 
after it actually keeps spinning and I
don't<00:02:32.730> want<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.150> test<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.450> first<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.290> is

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
don't want to test it first and this is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.780 
don't want to test it first and this is
like<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> light<00:02:35.640> launcher<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.120> record<00:02:36.600> oh

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
beyblades all right I'll try to figure

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.420 
beyblades all right I'll try to figure
it<00:03:00.780> out<00:03:00.840> later

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
it out later

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.620 
it out later
I'm<00:03:02.430> trying<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:02.970> without<00:03:03.120> reading

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
I'm trying to do this without reading

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.690 
I'm trying to do this without reading
directions<00:03:03.930> looks<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.800> got<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.670> I

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
directions looks like I got it so I

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.670 
directions looks like I got it so I
don't<00:03:05.820> know<00:03:05.970> what<00:03:06.090> part<00:03:06.300> this<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.530> but<00:03:07.530> this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
don't know what part this is but this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.290 
don't know what part this is but this
would<00:03:07.800> be<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> face<00:03:08.340> bolt<00:03:08.580> energy<00:03:09.090> ring

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
would be like the face bolt energy ring

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.750 
would be like the face bolt energy ring
maybe<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.260> spin<00:03:10.590> track<00:03:10.890> but

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
maybe this is like the spin track but

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.250 
maybe this is like the spin track but
Bay<00:03:11.910> will<00:03:12.120> there's<00:03:12.330> gonna<00:03:12.540> be<00:03:12.630> fun<00:03:12.900> because<00:03:13.110> I

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.570 

all<00:03:56.380> right<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.770> assembly<00:03:57.280> is<00:03:57.340> kind<00:03:57.520> of

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
all right so the assembly is kind of

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.780 
all right so the assembly is kind of
interesting<00:03:58.140> um<00:03:59.140> after<00:03:59.560> through<00:04:00.190> like<00:04:00.310> every

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
interesting um after through like every

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.190 
interesting um after through like every
single<00:04:00.970> unboxing<00:04:01.570> that<00:04:01.600> I've<00:04:01.810> seen<00:04:02.020> it

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
single unboxing that I've seen it

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.040 
single unboxing that I've seen it
actually<00:04:02.440> seems<00:04:03.010> like<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:03.310> been<00:04:03.430> pretty

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
actually seems like it's been pretty

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.530 
actually seems like it's been pretty
like<00:04:05.050> hard<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.770> hardcore<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.000> people

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
like hard and hardcore and people

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.440 
like hard and hardcore and people
haven't<00:04:07.810> been<00:04:07.990> really<00:04:08.530> able<00:04:08.860> to<00:04:09.150> unbox<00:04:10.150> them

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
haven't been really able to unbox them

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.490 
haven't been really able to unbox them
or<00:04:10.900> build<00:04:11.709> them<00:04:11.950> pretty<00:04:12.190> easily<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.410> now<00:04:14.410> I'm

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
or build them pretty easily so now I'm

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.720 
or build them pretty easily so now I'm
kind<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.709> afraid<00:04:14.920> that<00:04:15.040> I'm<00:04:15.340> not<00:04:15.490> gonna<00:04:15.670> be

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
kind of afraid that I'm not gonna be

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.330 
kind of afraid that I'm not gonna be
able<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.940> queue<00:04:16.180> there<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.890> looks<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.190> you're

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
able to queue there it looks like you're

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.460 
able to queue there it looks like you're
supposed<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.580> do<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:19.230> like<00:04:20.230> in<00:04:20.380> the

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
supposed to do that like in the

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.310 
supposed to do that like in the
directions<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.640> then<00:04:22.510> this<00:04:22.750> goes<00:04:23.050> on<00:04:23.230> the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
directions and then this goes on the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.900 
directions and then this goes on the
back<00:04:23.530> like<00:04:23.890> so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
back like so

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.450 
back like so
I<00:04:28.530> don't<00:04:29.530> think<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:29.830> gonna<00:04:30.070> go<00:04:30.280> together

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
I don't think this is gonna go together

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.000 
I don't think this is gonna go together
very<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:31.270> look<00:04:31.750> at<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:31.990> it's<00:04:32.140> all<00:04:32.290> weird

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.570 

this<00:04:36.010> goes<00:04:36.220> on<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.460> back<00:04:37.590> back<00:04:40.680> what<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:42.340> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
this goes on the back back what and the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.580 
this goes on the back back what and the
on<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.450> thing<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.780> said<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.050> was<00:04:44.169> white<00:04:44.350> it

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
on the thing it said it was white it

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.930 
on the thing it said it was white it
goes<00:04:44.770> right<00:04:44.950> here<00:04:47.340> okay<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.370> think<00:04:48.669> of<00:04:48.760> this

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
goes right here okay I think of this

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.530 
goes right here okay I think of this
right<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:50.940> think<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.000> do<00:04:52.060> this<00:04:52.120> for<00:04:52.270> time<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.660> sure

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
right I think I do this for time I sure
