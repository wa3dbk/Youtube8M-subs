gone<00:00:13.139> bad<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.710> would<00:00:14.219> see<00:00:14.490> here<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.910> there's

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
gone bad I would see here that there's

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.410 
gone bad I would see here that there's
all<00:00:15.630> kinds<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.049> rock<00:00:16.289> here<00:00:16.650> we've<00:00:17.190> got<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.850> large

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
all kinds of rock here we've got a large

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.300 
all kinds of rock here we've got a large
amount<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.930> weed<00:00:19.050> population<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> weeds<00:00:20.160> are

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
amount of weed population the weeds are

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.890 
amount of weed population the weeds are
growing<00:00:20.340> everywhere<00:00:20.939> through<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.330> bed<00:00:21.630> you

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
growing everywhere through this bed you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.929 
growing everywhere through this bed you
can<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.590> there<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:22.859> landscape<00:00:23.369> fabric<00:00:23.580> was

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
can see there was landscape fabric was

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.240 
can see there was landscape fabric was
applied<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.720> don't<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> very<00:00:25.830> even

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
applied I don't think it's a very even

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.050 
applied I don't think it's a very even
application<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:29.250> excavated<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
application but I actually excavated a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.429 
application but I actually excavated a
few<00:00:30.269> spots<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.869> bed<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.289> there's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
few spots in this bed and there's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.950 
few spots in this bed and there's
actually<00:00:31.830> solid<00:00:32.099> concrete<00:00:32.790> under<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:33.210> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
actually solid concrete under there so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.139 
actually solid concrete under there so
you<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.649> don't<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.969> don't

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you know we don't really have we don't

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
you know we don't really have we don't
only<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.450> landscape<00:00:37.110> fabric<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.710> have

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
only have landscape fabric but we have

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.430 
only have landscape fabric but we have
solid<00:00:38.250> concrete<00:00:38.540> in<00:00:39.540> some<00:00:39.840> areas<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
solid concrete in some areas and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.240 
solid concrete in some areas and
pavement<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:42.230> we<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.559> rocks<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.070> there

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
pavement and we just have rocks in there

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.459 
pavement and we just have rocks in there
so<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.789> thing<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.120> happens<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.289> this

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
so the one thing that happens is in this

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.380 
so the one thing that happens is in this
case<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.980> parking<00:00:47.370> lot<00:00:47.430> when<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:47.879> sweep<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
case this parking lot when they sweep it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
case this parking lot when they sweep it
off<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.780> shovel<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> wintertime<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
off or shovel it in the wintertime the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.000 
off or shovel it in the wintertime the
sand<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> gravel<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.360> dirt<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.320> material

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
sand and gravel and dirt and material

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
sand and gravel and dirt and material
gets<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> rock<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.329> contaminates

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
gets into the rock and it contaminates

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
gets into the rock and it contaminates
the<00:00:55.020> rock<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.100> course<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> weeds

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the rock so then of course the weeds

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.160 
the rock so then of course the weeds
have<00:00:56.940> soil<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.539> they're<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> grow

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
have soil and they're just going to grow

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.459 
have soil and they're just going to grow
so<00:00:59.070> whatever<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.020> far<00:01:01.050> as

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so whatever is going on here as far as

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.549 
so whatever is going on here as far as
the<00:01:02.190> technique<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> try<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> prevent<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the technique to try to prevent the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.990 
the technique to try to prevent the
weeds<00:01:04.739> from<00:01:04.830> growing<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.580> working

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
weeds from growing is just not working

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
weeds from growing is just not working
so<00:01:06.270> again<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.380> very<00:01:07.439> difficult<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.640> any

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
so again it's very difficult to with any

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
so again it's very difficult to with any
type<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> mulch<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:10.020> Rock<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> mulch<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
type of mulch like Rock is a mulch you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.700 
type of mulch like Rock is a mulch you
know<00:01:11.520> bark<00:01:11.790> mulch<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> mulch

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
know bark mulch is a mulch

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.679 
know bark mulch is a mulch
even<00:01:13.710> lawn<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> living<00:01:14.760> mulch<00:01:15.060> ground

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
even lawn can be a living mulch ground

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.990 
even lawn can be a living mulch ground
covers<00:01:16.110> their<00:01:16.320> living<00:01:16.710> mulches<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> mulch

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
covers their living mulches so the mulch

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
covers their living mulches so the mulch
is<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.360> covers<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> ground<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> help

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
is what covers the ground to help

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.770 
is what covers the ground to help
suppress<00:01:19.860> weeds<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.090> long<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.570> have

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
suppress weeds but as long as we have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.179 
suppress weeds but as long as we have
incoming<00:01:22.530> debris<00:01:23.400> organic<00:01:24.000> matter<00:01:24.210> leaves

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
incoming debris organic matter leaves

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.109 
incoming debris organic matter leaves
composting<00:01:26.189> into<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.549> surface<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> just

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
composting into that surface it just

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.020 
composting into that surface it just
becomes<00:01:27.540> soil<00:01:27.840> eventually

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
becomes soil eventually

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.609 
becomes soil eventually
the<00:01:29.090> weeds<00:01:29.270> are<00:01:29.420> just<00:01:29.600> going<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.840> grow<00:01:29.990> so

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
the weeds are just going to grow so

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.140 
the weeds are just going to grow so
that's<00:01:30.830> what<00:01:31.070> that's<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.460> big<00:01:31.610> problem<00:01:31.880> with

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
that's what that's a big problem with

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.940 
that's what that's a big problem with
with<00:01:32.600> rocks<00:01:32.900> is<00:01:33.229> that<00:01:33.380> you're<00:01:33.500> always<00:01:33.650> stuck

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
with rocks is that you're always stuck

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.620 
with rocks is that you're always stuck
with<00:01:33.979> rocks<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.549> can't<00:01:34.790> garden<00:01:35.270> with<00:01:35.450> them

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
with rocks you can't garden with them

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.870 
with rocks you can't garden with them
there<00:01:36.260> they<00:01:36.500> are<00:01:36.530> nice<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:37.010> some<00:01:37.220> instances<00:01:37.700> if

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
there they are nice in some instances if

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.550 
there they are nice in some instances if
you<00:01:37.970> can<00:01:38.090> keep<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.450> clean<00:01:38.750> keep<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.170> looking<00:01:39.320> in

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
you can keep it clean keep it looking in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.620 
you can keep it clean keep it looking in
the<00:01:39.650> pristine<00:01:40.190> it's<00:01:40.700> quite<00:01:41.030> quite<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.420> nice

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
the pristine it's quite quite a nice

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.359 
the pristine it's quite quite a nice
finish<00:01:42.080> I<00:01:42.259> actually<00:01:42.440> like<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.920> look<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.250> the

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
finish I actually like the look of the
