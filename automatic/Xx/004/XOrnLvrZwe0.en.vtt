this<00:00:10.690> is<00:00:10.840> a<00:00:10.870> prototype<00:00:11.350> of

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
this is a prototype of

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.490 
this is a prototype of
degrees<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.100> freedom<00:00:14.460> robot

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
degrees of freedom robot

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.900 
degrees of freedom robot
it<00:00:16.280> has<00:00:16.430> one<00:00:17.390> two<00:00:18.520> three<00:00:19.869> four<00:00:20.869> five<00:00:21.910> degrees

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
it has one two three four five degrees

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.890 
it has one two three four five degrees
of<00:00:23.029> freedom<00:00:23.330> with<00:00:23.540> a<00:00:23.570> grab<00:00:23.869> us<00:00:25.660> okay<00:00:26.660> it's<00:00:26.810> all

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
of freedom with a grab us okay it's all

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.249 
of freedom with a grab us okay it's all
powered<00:00:27.110> by<00:00:27.259> Arduino<00:00:28.210> which<00:00:29.210> uses<00:00:29.540> a<00:00:29.570> little

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
powered by Arduino which uses a little

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.810 
powered by Arduino which uses a little
simple<00:00:30.590> shield<00:00:30.830> to<00:00:31.070> break<00:00:31.310> out<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.520> some

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
simple shield to break out to some

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.490 
simple shield to break out to some
servos<00:00:36.879> okay<00:00:37.879> it's<00:00:38.090> controlled<00:00:38.480> by<00:00:38.570> their

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
servos okay it's controlled by their

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.280 
servos okay it's controlled by their
application<00:00:40.100> here<00:00:40.570> when<00:00:41.570> you<00:00:41.629> have<00:00:41.870> sliders

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
application here when you have sliders

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.189 
application here when you have sliders
anybody<00:00:43.040> to<00:00:43.250> record<00:00:43.970> and<00:00:44.150> playback<00:00:44.449> movements

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
anybody to record and playback movements

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.530 
anybody to record and playback movements
it's<00:00:45.680> all<00:00:45.830> coded<00:00:46.040> in<00:00:46.280> VB<00:00:47.829> so<00:00:48.829> it's<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.760> switch<00:00:50.329> on

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
it's all coded in VB so it's a switch on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:59.490 
it's all coded in VB so it's a switch on
and<00:00:50.719> see<00:00:51.020> what<00:00:51.050> it<00:00:51.320> does<00:00:54.370> let's<00:00:55.370> connect<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.329> it

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:24.940 

okay<00:01:00.500> now<00:01:01.420> by<00:01:02.420> move<00:01:02.690> some<00:01:02.930> sliders

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.399 

ok<00:01:26.299> say<00:01:28.490> okay<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.729> want<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> record<00:01:30.750> some

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
ok say okay I want to record some

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.510 
ok say okay I want to record some
movements<00:01:33.830> record<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:36.619> every<00:01:37.619> time<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.220> move

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
movements record and every time I move

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.080 
movements record and every time I move
the<00:01:38.670> slider<00:01:40.070> it's<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.490> record<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the slider it's going to record that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.840 
the slider it's going to record that
movement

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.160 

yes

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.430 

Oh

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.630 

nice<00:01:55.070> play<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.760> fat

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.050 

just<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> reset<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.360> default<00:02:00.780> position

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
just going to reset to default position

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.290 
just going to reset to default position
and<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.360> go<00:02:03.510> done<00:02:06.980> okay<00:02:07.980> now<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.970> did

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and there we go done okay now I did

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:18.640 
and there we go done okay now I did
record<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:10.020> earlier<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.880> like<00:02:12.060> that

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.259 

okay<00:02:19.549> those<00:02:19.909> are<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.090> movements<00:02:22.269> so

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
okay those are the movements so

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.479 
okay those are the movements so
hopefully<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.379> bot<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.799> arms<00:02:25.010> going<00:02:25.159> to<00:02:25.250> pick

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
hopefully the bot the arms going to pick

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:45.140 
hopefully the bot the arms going to pick
his<00:02:26.450> super<00:02:26.840> glue<00:02:26.989> up<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:28.879> if<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.239> doesn't

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.150 

he<00:02:46.150> pretty<00:02:46.480> sweet<00:02:48.090> done<00:02:49.090> right<00:02:49.810> now<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.950> can

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
he pretty sweet done right now you can

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.119 
he pretty sweet done right now you can
also<00:02:52.110> control<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.170> speed<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:56.010> get<00:02:57.010> it

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
also control the speed so so get it

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:22.670 
also control the speed so so get it
going<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.430> little<00:02:57.580> bit<00:02:57.730> slower

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.000 

also

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
also

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.080 
also
now<00:03:25.970> position<00:03:26.390> uses<00:03:26.830> high<00:03:27.830> talk<00:03:28.189> servos<00:03:28.730> it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
now position uses high talk servos it

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.369 
now position uses high talk servos it
can<00:03:29.420> get<00:03:29.540> quite<00:03:29.720> violent<00:03:30.019> we<00:03:30.769> go<00:03:30.980> for<00:03:32.379> swipes

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
can get quite violent we go for swipes

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:50.080 
can get quite violent we go for swipes
us<00:03:33.680> apart

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.479 

alright<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.870> there<00:03:50.989> we<00:03:51.050> have<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.489> prototype

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
alright and there we have it prototype

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.160 
alright and there we have it prototype
robotic<00:03:53.209> arm<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:55.580> see<00:03:55.910> something<00:03:56.569> else<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:57.019> can

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
robotic arm and see something else I can

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:06.530 
robotic arm and see something else I can
show<00:03:57.530> you

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.110 

the<00:04:07.540> house<00:04:07.690> constructed

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
the house constructed

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.259 
the house constructed
choosing<00:04:10.870> three<00:04:11.170> male<00:04:11.700> credit<00:04:12.700> prospects

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
choosing three male credit prospects

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:31.990 
choosing three male credit prospects
with<00:04:16.680> steel<00:04:17.680> struts

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.470 

okay<00:04:32.660> that's<00:04:33.260> it
