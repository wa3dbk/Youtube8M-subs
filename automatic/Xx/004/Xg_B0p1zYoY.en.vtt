00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.420
 as a girl and then in this equation with a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.210
 totally new news relevant and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.549
 cool for all of you well 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.720
 microsoft launches its new system 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.000
 operative and windows 9 is not called the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.580
 name that Microsoft has chosen for its 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.619
 new operating system is windows 10 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 according to today's own confirmation 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.029
 company in a presentation that in the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.719
 that has offered in addition to new 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.300
 details of how will this be windows 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.760
 10 will be the only microsoft windows 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.790
 a product line a platform 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.550
 a store that's the slogan that microsoft 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.680
 has defended this afternoon for 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 explain a major change in the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.969
 vision of the operating systems of the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.340
 company and also to the applications 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.800
 that will work on them since the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.020
 developers can program apps 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.420
 universal that can be used from 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.120
 any device curiously 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.880
 during the presentation in several 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 occasions the executives of microsoft 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.799
 in reference to windows users 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.229
 7 how they wanted windows 10 to 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.500
 will encourage you to take the leap and update your 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.750
 operating system without the need to spend 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.000
 for a period of adaptation what 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.390
 compared with a car 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.240
 Knowing how to drive you can adapt to a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.899
 better car than you have undone 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.539
 big changes regarding this too 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.149
 clarified that it offers elements with 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.390
 that users of windows 7 are already 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.569
 familiarized with an example of all this 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.179
 is the new start menu that is very 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:49.349
 similar to the one that had already leaked 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.319
 on the left below it is a new and 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:55.730
 completely redesigned start menu 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.280
 Well, in this start menu 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.490
 has elements of windows 7 and of 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.650
 windows 8 and that they keep the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.410
 programs and other elements of the system 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.290
 in ready format while those of 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.420
 the right appears a small mosaic 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.550
 then as they say they joined the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.850
 start menus of windows 7 and of 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.860
 windows 8 already see that some users do not 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.510
 they liked the windows 8 start menu 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.630
 that's why they do not have it installed because 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.150
 any other reason but then in this 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.250
 new operating system because it is already 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.220
 will adapt very easy to this start menu 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 so it would be more comfortable to 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.450
 each and every one of the users that what 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.670
 they will use good on their own 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.640
 words want to build a system 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.220
 operative cool but stable that serves 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.010
 both for advanced users who 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.140
 they risk installing their beta as for 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.750
 the computers that work in the area 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.610
 emergency department of a hospital next to the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.800
 back of the start menu have also 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.350
 announced the arrival of desks 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.290
 multiple with only a single 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.260
 screen according to microsoft windows 10 sera 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.170
 collaborative operating system giving that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.510
 it will be shaped between all 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.390
 who want to participate for that purpose 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.609
 tomorrow the windows inside will be launched 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.340
 program and users who sign up 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.859
 You can download a technique to preview 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.709
 that will work on laptops and 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.720
 desktop computers the rest of 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.950
 devices will have to wait 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:34.370
 then that is the information of the new 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:38.930
 windows 10 and how they will realize they are 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.629
 just two two or three 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.439
 of designs that have given this 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:49.359
 operating system but well as they said 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:52.700
 it's going to be very light it's going to be totally 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.769
 functional is going to be something new for 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.280
 users who had already tried windows 8 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:01.950
 the change on touch screens 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.170
 let's say that multiple desktops to 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.390
 do not have as many monitors as it gives you the 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.220
 option to save a desktop another 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.860
 desk or your desk and other 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.430
 desk they also give you the option of 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.500
 new start menu and they are just these 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.780
 let's say that these images filtered today 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.090
 and what has presented microsoft 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.090
 so they have not presented everything to us 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.620
 not yet done in the meat to the rotisserie 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.680
 so then we have to wait for the 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.450
 new news to new designs to 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.120
 the new things that bring this new 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:38.090
 well then hopefully and it's a 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.100
 windows totally new for all and 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.430
 each one of the users that we use this 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.260
 operating system and then the truth to the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.000
 that are encouraged in the description I leave 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.280
 the technical preview that will be 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.350
 available during this week since 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.810
 you can are uploading it just if they are 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.290
 seeing then some re designs of all 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.960
 that then then more information in my 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.540
 website where I will leave you all a 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.900
 summary or a review of all this 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.539
 So then, of course, to the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.490
 presentation has been a content 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.650
 concrete and it is that I course has been 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.260
 focused rather on conveying his idea 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.530
 and focus collaborative environments or 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.110
 corporate also windows 10 still 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.270
 is far from finished and it 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.780
 He hopes that it will reach the market of the 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.169
 consumers in mid-2015 as 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.760
 microsoft traditionally meets with 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.039
 developers present this system 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.650
 operative in detail regarding the price 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:39.860
 or the rumor of the update will be 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.550
 free as it was said a few days ago but 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.850
 do not be 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.570
 very well all this then well since 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:50.200
 they know date does not have yet is it is 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.200
 implicit 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.920
 it's going to be an operating system that 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.770
 also work with touch screens 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.800
 like windows 8 but this one would already keep 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.130
 some application elements of 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.800
 windows 8 or those shortcuts that 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.620
 appear to say that the party 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.700
 right of the screen and also 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.740
 we would have the option of the start menu 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.900
 combined windows 7 windows 8 and 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.670
 There are a lot of topics that are going to 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.770
 bring this new windows 10 then you 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.630
 I recommend that you check my website and 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.910
 be very attentive to the channel that out there 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.920
 I will be uploading more news about this 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.140
 new operating system then then 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.320
 good windows 10 is already a reality already 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.080
 is totally a no longer if it was a 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.540
 mystery is no longer so good then I 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.340
