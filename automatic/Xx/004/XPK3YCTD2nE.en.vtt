00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
okay this is so quality all protein is

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.730 
okay this is so quality all protein is
not<00:04:56.220> are<00:04:56.400> not<00:04:56.430> created<00:04:56.970> equal<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.620> salmon<00:04:58.620> is

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
is a quality source of protein I mean an

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.190 
is a quality source of protein I mean an
actual<00:05:01.380> salmon<00:05:01.950> fish<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:03.150> like<00:05:03.419> pound<00:05:03.990> for

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
actual salmon fish is like pound for

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.870 
actual salmon fish is like pound for
pound<00:05:04.290> hundred<00:05:04.620> or<00:05:04.710> strong<00:05:04.950> as<00:05:05.130> animals<00:05:05.520> there

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
pound hundred or strong as animals there

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.200 
pound hundred or strong as animals there
is<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:07.500> are<00:05:07.530> what<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.950> eat<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.580> I'd<00:05:09.030> rather

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
is so you are what you eat so I'd rather

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.500 
is so you are what you eat so I'd rather
get<00:05:09.419> a<00:05:09.479> muscular<00:05:09.960> fish<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:11.280> I'd<00:05:12.120> become<00:05:12.330> a

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
get a muscular fish and I'd become a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:21.529 
get a muscular fish and I'd become a
muscular<00:05:12.960> fish<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:17.520> was<00:05:19.130> five<00:05:20.130> minutes<00:05:20.539> and

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
muscular fish that was five minutes and

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.810 
muscular fish that was five minutes and
it's<00:05:21.780> easy<00:05:22.110> there's<00:05:22.680> no<00:05:22.979> big<00:05:23.370> mess

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.850 

so<00:05:27.360> now<00:05:27.780> what<00:05:28.020> we're<00:05:28.229> doing<00:05:28.260> is<00:05:28.440> we're<00:05:28.680> just

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
so now what we're doing is we're just

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.790 
so now what we're doing is we're just
gonna<00:05:28.979> pop<00:05:29.310> this<00:05:29.610> bad<00:05:29.850> boy<00:05:30.090> in<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.750> oven<00:05:31.110> we're

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
gonna pop this bad boy in the oven we're

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.490 
gonna pop this bad boy in the oven we're
gonna<00:05:31.919> let<00:05:32.340> it<00:05:32.490> bake<00:05:32.789> from<00:05:33.240> anywhere<00:05:33.600> from<00:05:33.840> 15

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
gonna let it bake from anywhere from 15

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.610 
gonna let it bake from anywhere from 15
to<00:05:35.310> 20<00:05:35.729> minutes

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
to 20 minutes

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.580 
to 20 minutes
five<00:05:37.250> minutes<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:38.600> really<00:05:38.840> just<00:05:38.990> depends<00:05:39.410> on

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
five minutes it really just depends on

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.870 
five minutes it really just depends on
the<00:05:39.680> thickness<00:05:39.860> of<00:05:40.130> your<00:05:40.190> salmon

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
the thickness of your salmon

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.790 
the thickness of your salmon
so<00:05:41.060> I<00:05:41.330> usually<00:05:41.870> like<00:05:42.139> to<00:05:42.229> watch<00:05:42.440> it<00:05:42.620> we're

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
so I usually like to watch it we're

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.090 
so I usually like to watch it we're
gonna<00:05:42.889> bake<00:05:43.310> for<00:05:43.610> at<00:05:44.150> least<00:05:44.419> 12<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.530> 15<00:05:45.830> minutes

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
gonna bake for at least 12 to 15 minutes

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.170 
gonna bake for at least 12 to 15 minutes
and<00:05:46.160> then<00:05:46.250> we're<00:05:46.370> gonna<00:05:46.460> keep<00:05:46.610> our<00:05:46.760> eye<00:05:46.790> on<00:05:46.910> it

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
and then we're gonna keep our eye on it

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.719 
and then we're gonna keep our eye on it
also<00:05:48.169> it<00:05:48.620> depends<00:05:48.919> on<00:05:49.040> how<00:05:49.280> you<00:05:49.340> like<00:05:49.699> your

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
also it depends on how you like your

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.270 
also it depends on how you like your
cinnamon<00:05:50.110> if<00:05:51.110> you<00:05:51.290> like<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.650> little<00:05:51.770> medium

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
cinnamon if you like it a little medium

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.100 
cinnamon if you like it a little medium
rare<00:05:52.490> medium<00:05:52.880> like<00:05:53.419> well-done

rare medium like well-done

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.280

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
so all of those will account into how

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.990 
so all of those will account into how
long<00:05:57.500> we're<00:05:57.680> gonna<00:05:57.800> leave<00:05:58.100> this<00:05:58.310> salmon<00:05:58.760> filet
