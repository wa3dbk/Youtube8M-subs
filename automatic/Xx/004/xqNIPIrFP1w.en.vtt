sideswipes the iceberg Murdock ports
around<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.990> iceberg<00:00:19.410> try<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> keep<00:00:19.980> from

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
around the iceberg try to keep from

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.380 
around the iceberg try to keep from
hitting<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> propellers<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.939> looks<00:00:21.240> pretty

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
hitting the propellers that looks pretty

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.690 
hitting the propellers that looks pretty
good

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.400 

okay<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.480> now<00:00:24.720> we're<00:00:24.900> watching<00:00:25.080> an

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
okay so now we're watching an

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.010 
okay so now we're watching an
accelerated<00:00:26.010> time<00:00:26.280> we<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.480> first<00:00:27.690> five

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
accelerated time we see the first five

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.170 
accelerated time we see the first five
compartments<00:00:28.440> blood<00:00:28.950> they<00:00:29.130> equalize<00:00:29.700> pretty

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
compartments blood they equalize pretty

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.369 
compartments blood they equalize pretty
quickly<00:00:30.450> vows<00:00:31.290> pulled<00:00:31.740> down

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.229 

we<00:00:36.379> see<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.680> port<00:00:36.920> list<00:00:37.160> port<00:00:37.850> list<00:00:38.030> looks

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
we see the port list port list looks

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.610 
we see the port list port list looks
right<00:00:38.420> now<00:00:38.600> looks<00:00:38.780> like<00:00:38.809> about<00:00:38.960> nine<00:00:39.260> degrees

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
right now looks like about nine degrees

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.490 
right now looks like about nine degrees
or<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:40.399> can<00:00:40.520> really<00:00:40.670> see<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.290> effect<00:00:42.290> of<00:00:42.440> that

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
or you can really see the effect of that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.840 
or you can really see the effect of that
that<00:00:42.949> list<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.489> them<00:00:43.640> on<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.940> flooding

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.549 

so<00:00:52.850> yeah<00:00:53.239> superstructure<00:00:53.870> starts<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.469> get

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
so yeah superstructure starts to get

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:02.440 
so yeah superstructure starts to get
pulled<00:00:54.739> under

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.580 

funnels<00:01:03.450> collapse<00:01:03.810> at<00:01:04.050> their<00:01:04.230> base<00:01:06.530> now<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
funnels collapse at their base now the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.220 
funnels collapse at their base now the
bow<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> accelerating<00:01:09.000> downward<00:01:09.480> that<00:01:09.720> looks

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
bow is accelerating downward that looks

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.990 
bow is accelerating downward that looks
good<00:01:10.440> we're<00:01:11.190> starting<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.640> stern

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
good we're starting to see the stern

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
good we're starting to see the stern
come<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:13.440> got<00:01:13.560> our<00:01:13.680> maximum<00:01:14.040> peak<00:01:14.370> stress

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
come up we got our maximum peak stress

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.630 
come up we got our maximum peak stress
and<00:01:15.060> yeah<00:01:15.390> boom<00:01:15.660> brought<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.620> brakes<00:01:16.890> okay

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and yeah boom brought the brakes okay

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.690 
and yeah boom brought the brakes okay
bow<00:01:17.850> swinging<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.260> good<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
bow swinging down that was good the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.600 
bow swinging down that was good the
double<00:01:21.000> kill<00:01:21.180> hang<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.460> they

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
double kill hang on and then they

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.900 
double kill hang on and then they
separate<00:01:24.090> Val<00:01:24.840> plunges<00:01:25.350> straight<00:01:25.619> down<00:01:25.910> all

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
separate Val plunges straight down all

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.750 
separate Val plunges straight down all
right<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.390> mass<00:01:27.630> snapping<00:01:28.140> back<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.860> funnels

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
right got mass snapping back the funnels

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.280 
right got mass snapping back the funnels
are<00:01:29.850> ripping<00:01:30.150> backward<00:01:30.570> pulling<00:01:30.869> off<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
are ripping backward pulling off all the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.010 
are ripping backward pulling off all the
davits

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
davits

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.859 
davits
bouse<00:01:33.680> going<00:01:34.009> down<00:01:34.159> like<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.399> torpedo<00:01:34.869> here's

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
bouse going down like a torpedo here's

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.510 
bouse going down like a torpedo here's
the<00:01:35.960> angle<00:01:36.170> when<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.619> falls<00:01:36.859> when<00:01:37.219> it<00:01:37.340> falls

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
the angle when it falls when it falls

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.760 
the angle when it falls when it falls
through<00:01:37.789> into<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.030> stable<00:01:38.329> position<00:01:38.689> let's<00:01:39.619> see

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
through into a stable position let's see

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.640 
through into a stable position let's see
the<00:01:39.859> start

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
the start

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.010 
the start
ealing<00:01:42.460> way<00:01:42.640> over<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.180> port<00:01:43.480> that<00:01:43.660> looks<00:01:43.840> right

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
ealing way over to port that looks right

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.350 
ealing way over to port that looks right
and<00:01:44.590> she<00:01:45.130> goes<00:01:45.310> up<00:01:45.610> that's<00:01:45.850> right<00:01:46.000> she<00:01:46.240> goes

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
and she goes up that's right she goes

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.820 
and she goes up that's right she goes
almost<00:01:46.540> vertical<00:01:47.050> just<00:01:47.290> when<00:01:47.440> she<00:01:47.560> goes<00:01:47.680> on

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
almost vertical just when she goes on

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.730 
almost vertical just when she goes on
during<00:01:47.980> that<00:01:48.190> boom<00:01:48.400> implodes<00:01:49.620> now<00:01:50.620> she

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
during that boom implodes now she

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.860 
during that boom implodes now she
accelerates<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:52.060> all<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.270> stuff<00:01:52.480> starts<00:01:52.780> to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
accelerates and all the stuff starts to

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.170 
accelerates and all the stuff starts to
rip<00:01:53.020> off<00:01:53.200> she<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.250> shell<00:01:54.460> plating<00:01:54.730> going

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
rip off she the shell plating going

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.850 
rip off she the shell plating going
there<00:01:55.330> goes<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.600> double<00:01:55.870> bottom<00:01:56.020> little

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
there goes the double bottom little

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.220 
there goes the double bottom little
bottom<00:01:57.130> frisbeeing<00:01:57.610> off

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
bottom frisbeeing off

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.970 
bottom frisbeeing off
and<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.860> strands<00:02:00.130> falling<00:02:00.460> through

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
and the strands falling through

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.370 
and the strands falling through
so<00:02:02.520> now<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.790> turns<00:02:03.030> falling<00:02:03.510> aft<00:02:04.500> end<00:02:04.800> down

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
so now this turns falling aft end down

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.020 
so now this turns falling aft end down
and<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:07.130> see<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> spiraling<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:10.640> comes<00:02:10.880> the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
and we see the spiraling it comes the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.150 
and we see the spiraling it comes the
bow<00:02:11.209> bow<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.050> falling<00:02:12.410> at<00:02:12.470> stable<00:02:12.920> position

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
bow bow is falling at stable position

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.449 
bow bow is falling at stable position
and<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.420> hits<00:02:14.690> ya<00:02:15.230> boom<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:16.040> kind<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.280> breaks

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
and it hits ya boom it kind of breaks

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.460 
and it hits ya boom it kind of breaks
his<00:02:16.640> back<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.599> we<00:02:17.750> see<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.050> hydraulic

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
his back and we see the hydraulic

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.470 
his back and we see the hydraulic
outburst<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.099> Down<00:02:19.280> blast<00:02:19.550> effect<00:02:19.940> let's

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
outburst and a Down blast effect let's

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.250 
outburst and a Down blast effect let's
see<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> start
