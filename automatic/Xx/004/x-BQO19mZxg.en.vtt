 curasept for OltrepÃ² Pavese wines the timeline of a new rose trend 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.580
 technically it is a word macedonia formed by the fusion between with the selection 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.209
 eros e 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.410
 with the interposition of a junction from which 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.300
 the path to get to the name of the new product symbol of the Oltrepo 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.850
 pavese urus and natural of or cg down we pinot nero obtained through the method 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.880
 classic gave way to regain possession of an important piece of local history 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.340
 rua was the ancient name of the wine grape par excellence produced in overseas 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.730
 Pavese at the turn of the 1700s the consortium moved from a legacy 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 almost forgotten outside the Lombard borders, reactivate to dictate one 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.589
 trend on the Italian and foreign market 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.830
 the ancient name of the main grape variety of the OltrepÃ² Pavese easy to remember 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.720
 and it sounds sweet a name to resume modifying and relaunching 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.740
 the right idea to do so came while the consortium was working on the 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.710
 concept naturally red 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 never expressed in Italy, let alone in the world of bubbles where you always have 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.979
 pivoted on curves from white grapes, reds from musts or wines 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.300
 combining the two expressions with eggs as it runs but also as a better expression 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.690
 historical relationship between wine, territory and eros and little valued wine in Italy 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.670
 but with enormous potential 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.040

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.570
