00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.870
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.130
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAA 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.020
 Ah ah ah 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:17.570
 I will tell you about the doctrine of caldo beginning from today 1 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.570
 Culdcept is thank you 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.850
 The first episode is how to play 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.800
 Do you know a game that everyone's says Culdcept 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.470
 There is an early story with Culdcept 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.470
 It is easy 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.470
 Then please see here a 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.710
 Players play one by one in turn 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.560
 When the game starts, I will not draw a card from the deck first 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.250
 This is it 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:58.200
 It is luck what cards come with you 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:02.720
 Move your eyes next time you say dice 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.720
 Of course the eyes of the dice are also lucky 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:12.640
 And goal saving money up to the target amount of money with this way round and round around the map 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 And victory 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.240
 Penang N 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.670
 So how did you think you would save money? 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.330
 So there is a way to make money 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.990
 The first is a lap bonus 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.990
 ur It is said that we go around the bag once 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.550
 Orasu is ish 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.430
 The second is to get a toll 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.700
 The squares that are vacant 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.180
 Place a big star from a popping card 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.520
 Make it your territory 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.870
 Furthermore, if someone stops there, the toll fee 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 Sukaori 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:06.380
 There are other ways to save money, but five things are important to do anything 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:12.800
 But this game can not be won by luck alone 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:16.319
 Culdcept has over 480 cards to draw luck 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.810
 You can approach victory by yourself 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.370
 Well, for example, this card is 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.240
 pane 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:31.790
 There are two dice 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.790
 It helps to quickly around the lap in the travel distance increases 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:42.430
 Also, this card can be the eyes of the dice to 3 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.430
 It is useful when you want to stay in the target square 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 In fact, this card alone can be used for the other party 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 Then yeah 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.530
 Is poly 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:10.800
 We were able to take its toll guiding the party to his territory 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:16.070
 In this way, Culdocept is not influenced by luck by using cards well. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.070
 It's you can also proceed while controlling 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.370
 It is the point of today 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:28.280
 Good luck draws in cards 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:33.430
 Next time I want to send you for the use of such card type and card 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.430
 Board game cardo fight with cards
