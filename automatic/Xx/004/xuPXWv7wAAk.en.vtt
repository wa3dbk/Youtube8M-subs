00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.860
 yes hello then we are here for 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.840
 Sectional Academic Championships 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.000
 athletes who take themselves years old who 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.220
 name championship excellence of football 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.640
 with our young cadets the finality 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.980
 of this championship today allows 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 to access the interacademic finals 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.210
 which will take place next week 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.950
 against the relief team so everything 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.970
 interest today to figure well for 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:10.580
 able to continue this championship and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.580
 eventually finish on each sentence 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 for 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.380
 today we will meet under 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.880
 form of a tournament three other teams 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.690
 the team of beziers that we 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.430
 welcome the cannes team and in 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.220
 the eastern pyrenees lunel team 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.080
 and to go to the point in common is the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.300
 first match will start from here a 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.600
 ten minutes against the team of 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.610
 canes and that seems to be on the paper 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 he is no longer there the most competent 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.920
 the best of all we have 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.780
 new loans 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.250
 and say 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.810
 the hurts 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.360
 m 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.290
 we are going 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.430
 here 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.540
 but it was a difficult match 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.810
 all because we took a box and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.550
 then there was thirty dominated there was the 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.220
 square 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:21.010
 and we know that many teams that 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.930
 what did that make them want to 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.090
 win the second mac as well as the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.420
 third or they have the morale to 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.140
 zero 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.370
 but hey this team I think they 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.400
 do not have morale to zero 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.420
 look there down there behind he we 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:45.430
 presents this manifesto 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:46.660
 I did not say it's because you 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.130
 conan is surely it's a 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.350
 brush will be worth a small mistake 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:58.000
 he had passed apparently he was 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:04:00.190
 passed very well wants to win 3 0 against 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.450
 lunel it was easy enough to arbitrate 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.940
 because kiss was really above so 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.459
 statistical level is just above 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.579
 this year it went very well 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.180
 to do little respectful nothing to say 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.639
 it's a nice match 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.650
 with me I complicated but with so much at 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.650
 taste of his son hidden credit 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.560
 me 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.560
 the ibex 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:37.289
 it's difficult it was physical they 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:40.319
 were present everywhere the atomic m 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:43.259
 the first half after after the pen 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:52.559
 we were destabilized took aim 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:57.959
 we could have largely 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:59.449
 clear frankly the first game the 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:03.059
 red embryos from the first half time 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.799
 as you lead the dominate the 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.939
 final they take a goal and lose on 

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:08.789
 the score of 1 0 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.439
 it's a pity I said this match 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.969
 was within their reach because here there is a 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:13.490
 good team month there but it's not 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.919
 normal I do not know 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.880
 we had the potential to do something 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.740
 to qualify 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.539
 unfortunately not even so here we go 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.770
 our captain he has me for example 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:29.660
 after the saga then the team of 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.599
 castelnaudary from lycÃ©e jean durand is 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.900
 composed entirely of students from the 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:39.050
 section roughly for two-thirds 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.669
 they are first class students who already 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.830
 was at home last year have 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.780
 participated brilliantly in the championships 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.720
 of France that took place there is 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:51.380
 unfolded in the aisne last year 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:55.009
 and the new ones arrive about 6 7 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.919
 who are students of second general 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.380
 or professional who come 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.440
 feeding quite so 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.040
 brilliant us 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.040
 we team 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:24.009
 yeah 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
 no
