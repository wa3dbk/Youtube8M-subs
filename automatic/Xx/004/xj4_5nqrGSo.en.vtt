00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.340
 all hello guys my name is mike 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.230
 starting this week i will do 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.080
 interesting reviews of the most interesting 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.810
 events of the last football week so 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.660
 let's start the other day was a great football 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.210
 football match between clubs al arabi 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.220
 and al nasser of the kuwait championship and so 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.540
 let's see the most interesting 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.540
 cut from this match 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.690
 leather 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.930
 which one 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.670
 only 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.220
 but 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.409
 here at this moment it may seem that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.659
 all the players run to calm their 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.659
 partner so God forbid not removed 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.470
 but dick shank you in my opinion 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.870
 one of those cases when football players 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.560
 clearly understand that they are more than their fuck 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.740
 the rule 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.960
 who is her community and thought them up 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.210
 attention to the player at number 13 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.640
 here he stands quietly but only worth 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.410
 court show red card like him 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.979
 Immediately begins to sphere drink right on 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.080
 eyes can have such a disease 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.540
 Well, some bull that is when 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.010
 a person starts a sphere singing only from 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.010
 of what I saw red 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.820
 let's imagine the wife comes home and 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.970
 says min and i bought myself 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.370
 wonderful dress red beautiful 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.370
 colors like you and he at this moment 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.680
 Well, in the end the judge just started 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.990
 delete everybody even sheikhs who 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.090
 somewhere near well i'm not sure what it is 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.590
 coach actually but let's 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.550
 imagine what if valery 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.550
 Karpin also walked 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.450
 most recently by with the most unknown 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.040
 way hit the opponent's gate 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.930
 a team called hoffenheim 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.090
 let's get a look 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.599
 electronic scoreboard on our graphics not 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.849
 immediately switched 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.209
 here the second goal and nevertheless he 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.209
 happened and how cool got oh well 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.890
 even with the replay it seems that the ball 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.890
 gate enters the outside 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.640
 wait a second 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.050
 the ball came in from the outside and the gate at 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.870
 of course there was no goal but when 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.060
 still it turned out or saw you 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.300
 already understood no voice here 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.250
 the judge sees everything i have only one 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:04:00.860
 the explanation may be he was afraid 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:02.690
 this at the same time I put all Like
