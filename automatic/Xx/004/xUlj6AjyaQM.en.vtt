00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.260
 and so hello everyone today we will see 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 So 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.960
 he is the son of excel about him the problem of standing is not 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.940
 the power button works 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.210
 the client has already said that they once 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.119
 wore a workshop something and we did there 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.119
 then it stopped working again 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:35.010
 judging by the views it turned out look 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.160
 connecting neatly she goes on 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.330
 plume and loop non-removable cut out 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.330
 right inside the board 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.750
 magicians that very litter splat connection is not 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.059
 break down somewhere here 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 directly eat and get by 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.650
 the fact of either changing the whole board 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 because everybody either look for him where 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.699
 peres generalize this power button and this 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.850
 button on the buttons there's plenty of it 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.130
 there is not enough contact for inclusion means 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 what was done so once and immediately the process 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.960
 I didn’t remove my rations because it was very 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.270
 uncomfortably afraid she would solder 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.740
 back of the board 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.730
 I do n't see well 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.940
 there is a little penny which 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:31.250
 this button is duplicated 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.800
 to choke here he shows here now seen 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.480
 You soldered a wire here 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:45.270
 naturally easily took the headphones there 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:46.890
 what was at hand and brought him here he 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.659
 hard to see 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.460
 and soldered to one and back 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.369
 Now I'll show you now again soldered 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.650
 and show where you need everything and soldered oh 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.130
 when it is inconvenient for us to shoot the pattern there on 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.780
 quality read out of this carry here 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.770
 soldered the wire code to one of 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.660
 contacts all now threw batteries 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.410
 let's see it starts or not 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:21.350
 it starts up so here's the battery 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:31.400
 in it so far 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:31.400
 now I press the button a second 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.329
 We look at the phone lit up with him 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.180
 broken sansovino visited the water on to 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.200
 what do the spots say there is there also here 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:51.879
 the label has become red here start what he 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.150
 was in the water was flank basically phone 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.689
 everything works okay all right 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:03.280
 Here I repeat the wire I took from 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:05.139
 I have a lot of headphones there 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.879
 it was at hand the club could immediately 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.579
 do neatly but time is very 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.139
 tucks so here he goes so right 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.269
 doc laid neatly his for and 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.799
 froze so that he does not interfere here we are 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.250
 necessarily the right to follow, too, and the fact that 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.870
 he was an isolator did not close prada 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.209
 which dates are the headphones they give you 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.269
 painted something Shreds there is nail them 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.409
 and cover this blue current does not hold 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.159
 moment to sleep and they need to be cleaned 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:32.859
 preliminary shadrinsk only left 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.319
 phone collect how to disassemble think and 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.440
 so you can find where a man is about this 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.510
 information because say 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.000
 sign up waiting for a lot of different 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.849
 interesting videos did not forget all the same 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.909
 made a video make free internet 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.940
 wi-fi get everything all right just no 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.909
 time while this is all here will be very 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.909
 repair and tablet phones 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.590
 laptop as a child would not 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.500
 try all the more so accurate 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.579
 in a simple way, it’s not in the course 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.079
 to hack but it's not difficult for our all 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.079
 while waiting for a new video
