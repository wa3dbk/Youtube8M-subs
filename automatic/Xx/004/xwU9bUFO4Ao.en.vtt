00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.809
 good evening to all then I think maybe 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.509
 more like saying the choreography more lively 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.750
 of the living room of one's home 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.210
 rai study of the pre- post game 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.010
 juve napoli I would not like to say 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 these things but clearly I don't go to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 touching colleagues I go to block 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.640
 those that should invest 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.590
 RAI studies and let us pay the fee 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.920
 also for these services as we ask 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.510
 what speech all this premised thing of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.840
 I have already had less than this game 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.280
 anticipated with here that I sent little 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.329
 before registering abbot on 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 field 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.399
 whoever fails the least wins I never have 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.820
 seen in such a balanced challenge as 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.890
 this between juve and naples where 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 practically all or almost all goals 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.719
 that were seen in the 120 minutes 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 regulations and additional provisions have been created 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.239
 from errors of the defenses or however I was in 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.129
 phase of defensive phase and then penalties 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.650
 and gori obviously always wins who 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.240
 he is less wrong and therefore he is right who 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.159
 he made less mistakes than he was right about 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 naples the naples deserved 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.560
 clearly this victory we analyze 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.240
 briefly the game no the first goal 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.619
 of juve leaves after five minutes goals 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.659
 of tevez from a resounding error of the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.600
 defense of naples are measured in two 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.659
 practically Steve had the field 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.579
 free that there was nothing to do 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.560
 we analyze the balance of Naples on 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.110
 first draw of trouble arises from a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.780
 vidal a wrong disengagement 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.659
 midfield trying an unlikely 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.180
 heel with this success sometimes of 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.939
 security that then leads to superficiality 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.229
 which often affects serious players 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.390
 especially when they are in 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.430
 advantage in a game and then it was 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.340
 napoli is very good to share hole in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.560
 half higuain's header and the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.000
 great goal from higuain after buffon 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.950
 the revolt was already on the cake 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.170
 situation after Naples had 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.820
 hit two such that the piles are errors 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.860
 on mistakes naples he was wrong 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.379
 in those circumstances juve had 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.020
 his opportunities even before 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.650
 draw of naples two pitches of demetz e 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.200
 two parades of afa and if I'm not wrong 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.580
 in short, a shot out of opportunities 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.560
 have been from one side to the other 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.050
 perfectly balanced game 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.900
 juve back in the lead at the beginning of 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.489
 second extra time is 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.099
 actually more than a mistake of the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.470
 defense of naples was very good you 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.840
 makes Naples make that movement 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.239
 draws deservedly because so how 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.519
 after the first advantage the juve is pulled 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.550
 back and not to mini ie he just wants to 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.480
 administer substantially by giving the field 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.610
 then 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.170
 and so it happens in the second half 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.890
 extra when the Naples that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.099
 he seemed on his legs and he had spent 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.659
 at this point it has been revitalized 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.370
 from the attitude of juve thanks 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.930
 to the attitude of the juve who has 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.420
 set back its center of gravity 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.980
 on the action of the goal before from the cross of 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.049
 dal is cut off from the capital 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.849
 sorry disturb cut off one 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.569
 triangulation and it can also be there 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.069
 separate outside but you ca n't walk 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.269
 going to those who will cross and 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.250
 consider the fact that there was so much and 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.510
 he goes there you do n't have to go too 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.150
 when it is said that certain players 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.480
 must mine improve in some 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.299
 details here in particular on which 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.489
 will have to work there with probable 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.640
 very often it happens very often 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.680
 time have these breaks and then 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.629
 caracollando go to the ball without 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.079
 going to close down substantially 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.120
 the man was about to send a cross higuain 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.010
 marks in the fray but is very good because 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.060
 he catches the flicker and then we come to the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.190
 chapter of penalties 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.139
 It seemed like a done deal in place a 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.780
 certain point because naples is wrong 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.760
 wrong then all indicate whether 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.590
 he went with the sign Juve starts over again 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.810
 wrong naples is wrong in chiellini 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.709
 which I think should be used for this purpose 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.630
 rigor for probably frenzy in 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.419
 this case maybe the legs go more 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.400
 quick of thought but vice versa is 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.139
 so right with the left foot walter 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.209
 oil and maybe I could have pulled of 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.289
 sinister but this what it means that in 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.049
 that topical moment 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.940
 there is something wrong you are missing 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.620
 necessary coldness can happen to 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.889
 all 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.560
 marks another mistake is the Naples 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.749
 and to be mistaken pereira that it seems 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.759
 just have a pending account with 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:33.110
 door opponent because in short, wrong 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.830
 during the games 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.719
 He also makes a mistake in stopping only 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.219
 before pulling anywhere slowing down the 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:43.189
 race as such in my opinion is gone 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:45.169
 understood nothing is turned high then marks of 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.789
 in short, Naples is also wrong because 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.219
 otherwise he would have gone on to 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:53.389
 pietro then we repeat my opinion of the 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:54.800
 all staff deserved repeats 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.719
 naples because he was wrong less 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.909
 so then in Naples already won this 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.129
 Italian Super Cup with which one 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.680
 archive the season will now start again 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.449
 already feel criticism towards 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.590
 cheerful of the echo as if I had 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.960
 wrong who knows what 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.819
 happy what the finals are wrong 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.169
 they win or lose they are very close 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.029
 the episodes have not wrong 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.469
 applied high pirlo before he had 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.879
 wrong I already had three steps that 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.650
 they had made that Naples will start if 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.629
 we want to say you have done things 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.490
 definitely on the net but it seems a bit 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.539
 too trapped at that moment there 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.729
 thus shifting the say in the center 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.889
 of thought and European mark ives was 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.689
 he wanted to give the league more offensive thrust 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.529
 at that moment he was going then 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.569
 he could stay there 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.000
 this situation then combination 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.360
 the draw comes immediately from Naples but 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.639
 these are factors that belong 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.810
 to unpredictability clearly not 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.270
 can say now that he looks at her 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.189
 guilt that came out film we do not say 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.409
 pirlate in this sense 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:53.750
 substantially however it closes 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.389
 this year closes the year e 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.189
 we repeat the concept and naples won 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.439
 deservedly because he missed the least 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.409
 of the juve il napoli takes home the 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.689
 Super Cup 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.939
 it will start its season again from the commitment 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.739
 against the inter on January 6 and 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.999
 then definitely down to the 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:11.519
 Scudetto 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:13.319
 here I am already too much dwelling I wanted 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.689
 healthy francesco di poe who has it 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.089
 remembered two or three times bar lang che 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:21.360
 he wrote to me from sanremo 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:23.729
 survived of twitter friends how much 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.039
 but perhaps Italian Spanish that we are 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.319
 somewhat and in the end of course it is 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.539
 necessary love hello to me that bye to 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.769
 we all resent ourselves with the beginning 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.039
 of marine naples 

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:34.039
 Hello
