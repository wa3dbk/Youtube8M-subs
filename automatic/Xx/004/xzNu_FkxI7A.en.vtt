00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.019
 hi guys and girls from youtube told me 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.699
 to do a quick tutorial 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.039
 of the construction table for 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.270
 Minecraft version 1.7 point 2 and good 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.710
 what is this mode for everyone 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.750
 those who do not know well, it is 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.579
 a way that adds us a new table of 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.110
 character but in this case what is going to 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.090
 do not it will be character but 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.699
 escape as its name indicates in the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.379
 good title basically what is going to 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.570
 doing is going to be giving us back those 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.739
 materials that by mistake or because the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.360
 we need 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.300
 we want to recover from our weapons 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.790
 Armor and objects is also worth this mod 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.290
 It is fully compatible with other mods 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.600
 It is worth what will help us because 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.070
 example in machines that we have 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 wrong when making a craft eo that 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.339
 we have created more objects of the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.890
 necessary, it is therefore possible to recover 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.809
 those diamonds or that iron that 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.879
 we need to do more good things 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.010
 What do we have to do for it? 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.080
 easy we have to make this craft eo 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.020
 ok we have to take two ingots of 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.140
 iron a diamond tables and a table 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.790
 craft eo and give us the table from es craft 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.909
 eo good if you look here in the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.409
 construction vale we have 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.940
 automatically, we have this going 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.740
 to be where we are going to put the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.090
 weapon 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.710
 whatever it is worth the object that we 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.470
 we want 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.479
 take the materials is worth and we will 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.090
 take out the fretting here as it would be and here 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.440
 we will be able to collect 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.729
 objects that give us back how it's going to 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.159
 work this good well very easy 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.409
 let's catch a couple of little things we're going to 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.210
 catch a sword we are going to catch good 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.700
 nothing of diamond not good yes one of 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.520
 diamond let's take one of these 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.479
 let's take a helmet we're going to catch myself 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.040
 I know we're going to take a shovel and a pick 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.710
 ok I'm going to take it from wood because 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.330
 I want you to see that you see it well 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.810
 let's also take a compass or what 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.840
 one let's take a compass and I 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.170
 like ok we're going to catch attraction and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.190
 We're going to catch a peak of 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:11.350
 these are worth it and I need 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.350
 lack of value 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.700
 there is perfect, we are going to put the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.880
 anvil and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.500
 to be charming this peak is worth 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.550
 3 attraction and and breakage 3 worth 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.890
 we are going to have a pretty curious peak and 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.500
 we are going to take, for example, a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.209
 oven and a good record player to 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.360
 from now on let's take off game 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.620
 boat vale, let's play badly and 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.080
 what I'm going to do now for example goes 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.360
 to be getting some land worth if you 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.910
 you fix, so my tool is going 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.130
 wearing out ok you see it going 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.989
 wearing little by little it's logical I'm going 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.989
 to put the helmet is logical 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.379
 good and we have it more or less by the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.180
 perfect half good well now we 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.519
 let's go to our des craft table 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.129
 ok let's put the shovel first 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.709
 wood up here and fix it just gives me 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.870
 a stick because because it only gives us a 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.580
 stick because he does not give us all 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.310
 materials because logically this shovel 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.709
 it's a little worn it's worth then 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.750
 it only lets us recover a suit 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.980
 ball but what happens if I put a 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.080
 wooden sword in perfect 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.750
 conditions then that gives us the stick and 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.269
 the two oak tables are worth plum nos what 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.220
 gives automatically what would happen if I put 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.610
 the anvil because it gives us everything it takes 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.470
 already 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.480
 what happens if I put the diamond sword 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.780
 so they give us the two diamonds and that 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.770
 it happens well let's put the turntable 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.560
 and the oven today is going 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:45.150
 my mother who comes as cool good what 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.670
 happens if I put an object in which there is 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.470
 an enchantment so if I do not put a 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.290
 book here below is worth what it is that 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.580
 we have to make a book 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.440
 automatically when I give it here yes 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.240
 what deconstruction is going to do to me 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.800
 of the peak but it will not give me the 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.870
 then clear enchantment to me 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.170
 I would like that since it has cost me so much 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.700
 in singing I'm worth it for the reason that 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.580
 I have had to 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.110
 I had to recover these 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.660
 three diamonds 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.950
 for whatever reason we do not want to break 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.320
 this peak because we have 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.530
 wrong or whatever and we want to 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.730
 this enchantment to recover it is worth 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.030
 you just have to put a book 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.900
 now when I bring it to me in the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.790
 book that would give attraction worth this is 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.560
 a bug that has this mod is worth I have 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.229
 posted the book is worth because in 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.000
 principle when we put attraction and 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.100
 we put unbreakable and dady just happens with 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.290
 these two enchantments are worth the 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.450
 attraction and breakage does not matter 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.220
 order in which they are eaten and 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.960
 profitability and it only leaves us traction 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.270
 It is worth saying if for example you come and 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.880
 I broke skill and Indian appearance by 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.260
 example for telling you it is worth it yes that we 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.970
 I would keep the two in the book of 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.460
 enchantment but for whatever reason 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.500
 it does not happen and the truth is that it 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.460
 quite and nothing guys this is all 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.070
 that brings the motorcycle I hope that you have 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.430
 I'm going to stay here 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.800

 you but have to have forums 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.220
 installed I always recommend the last 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.480
 version however you have a 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.670
 videotutorial up here that tells you 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.380

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.710
 installed please go through the video 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.570
 install first force and then come 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.030
 here good once installed vale 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.800
 your minecraft has to be a 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.750
 kind of carpetillas so it's worth 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.070
 let's go to our minecraft point and what 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.290
 let's do is going to be create the folder 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.910
 mods as simple as this we are going to 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.440
 take the construction table we're going 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.600
 to copy to the mods folder and that's it 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.290
 installed now just run and 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.290
 We love our launcher 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.469
 it is very important that here in profile 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:08.999
 ok if you notice, I put a record 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.830
 you will put the username that 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:12.210
 you have chosen well to me gives me the 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.039
 possibility of being able to change force 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.110
 because I have the latest version of force 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.210
 installed if it were not like that if it does not give you the 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.759
 possibility to change you are going to go to 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.249
 give a new profile voucher we will create 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:24.539
 a new profile because in this case mods and 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:26.819
 here where it puts use version 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.499
 172 will be released automatically 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:30.930
 good what you have to look for is the 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:32.729
 version is worth to go looking for the 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.009
 version was up or down 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:37.620
 better it is applied strong by 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:39.930
 example release 172 force and the version 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.089
 de force that we have installed the 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.370
 selection eyes you give to save profile 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:46.770
 and automatically if you change here
