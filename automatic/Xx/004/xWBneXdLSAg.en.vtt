00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.000
 two tractors a driver sounds like 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.400
 magic but quite honest it is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.590
 doing earthly development services 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 as to supernatural magic and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.910
 just when an unmanned tractor 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.640
 a manned tractor on tread and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.039
 occurs following are valid connect is called 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.130
 the system with the quasi two tractors 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.640
 to act as a single entity 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 a tractor with paint and one without that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 is the principle of capturing guide connect 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 another innovation from home 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.690
 fendt the two vehicles are one 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.780
 unit connected so the unmanned 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.850
 vehicle exactly the same 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.350
 can do the work process 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.570
 the system already has it now 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.190
 convinced that it was at the agritechnica 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.760
 awarded a gold medal 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.620
 will be dr herbert rider of his 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.079
 sign fendt managing research 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 And development also characterizes fendt 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.000
 guide collect the responsible 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.380
 main goals was ultimately the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.350
 increase economy 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.640
 Ultimately, the size of vehicles 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.500
 and machines limited by the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 Infrastructure that is length of width 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.210
 height is no longer ascendable in the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.159
 form and there we are based 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.479
 taken from the 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.520
 machine tool industry where to go then 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.439
 So more machines condition does that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.090
 he a one worker serves more 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.189
 machines smaller machines so 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.630
 concatenation of machines and the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.680
 In the end, you can do the same here 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.869
 that means I can do that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.670
 Increase working width by simply 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.220
 more identical vehicles in a row 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.460
 drive but only one operator 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.460
 have 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.440
 with guide connect follows 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.120
 unmanned tug the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.760
 executive vehicle in the same 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.550
 Working process at the turning process and man 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.500
 avoiding obstacles derailed 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.780
 connect enables on one side 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.020
 great working widths and on the other hand 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.210
 very flexible use of the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.670
 farmer can use it with his power 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.380
 optimally adjust the tractors 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.190
 at any time also as separate 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.869
 autonomous vehicles can use 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.910
 the driver stops at the vario terminal 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.070
 comfortable in the necessary parameters 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.290
 So which tractor leads in which 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.750
 is led for example in consequence 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.240
 distance and from the time interval 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.190
 during operation, the driver gets 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.320
 also from unmanned tractor data 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.130
 communicates the fuel level 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.780
 engine speed is the speed 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.030
 communication between both vehicles 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.100
 is done via radio that means that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.360
 first vehicle controlled via gps and 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.790
 via radio is ultimately controlled 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.830
 the distance of the second vehicle there 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.930
 controlled accordingly entered 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.510
 measured and so on and then makes im 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.090
 principle the second vehicle exactly that 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.970
 same at the same position as that 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.739
 The vehicle before the execution 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.420
 decisive role at fendt guide 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.060
 Of course, connect plays security 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.680
 the responsibility for both parties 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.750
 is basically the driver of 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.090
 guide vehicle if for example 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.190
 the satellite location is no longer possible 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.470
 is the radio connection broken or 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.690
 but the distance between the tractors 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.270
 is too small or too large effect immediately 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.340
 the emergency stop in force that is the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.590
 guided tractor will immediately in one 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.550
 safe condition and the engine 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.290
 off 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.300
 also the bike at the following 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.489
 Tug at any time by means of a 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.989
 switch off single button press and in 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.989
 to bring a safe state 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.380
 about three years have the developer to 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.480
 guide connect worked that up 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.610
 agritechnica in hanover now for the first time 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.490
 is publicly presented from the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.800
 fourth quarter of 2012 should begin guide 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.890
 connect then also available on the market 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.890
