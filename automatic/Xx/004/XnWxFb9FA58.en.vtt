ancient<00:00:27.390> Mayans<00:00:28.019> believed<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.710> planets<00:00:29.160> were

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
ancient Mayans believed the planets were

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669 
ancient Mayans believed the planets were
formed<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:30.029> moons<00:00:30.480> were<00:00:30.810> lonely<00:00:31.320> just

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
formed because moons were lonely just

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.870 
formed because moons were lonely just
like<00:00:31.800> needed<00:00:32.279> Powell's<00:00:33.410> Mayans<00:00:34.820> they<00:00:35.820> were

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
like needed Powell's Mayans they were

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.440 
like needed Powell's Mayans they were
right<00:00:36.290> I'm<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:38.010> Mars<00:00:38.489> which<00:00:39.239> looks

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
right I'm here on Mars which looks

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.119 
right I'm here on Mars which looks
literally<00:00:39.809> exactly<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.590> Earth<00:00:40.620> did

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
literally exactly like Earth did

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.549 
literally exactly like Earth did
hundreds<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> millions<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.239> years<00:00:42.360> ago<00:00:42.660> now<00:00:43.410> as

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
hundreds of millions of years ago now as

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.410 
hundreds of millions of years ago now as
you<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.520> these<00:00:44.610> bits<00:00:45.180> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you can see there are these bits of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 
you can see there are these bits of
aluminium<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> air<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.590> gives

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
aluminium in the air which gives

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.069 
aluminium in the air which gives
everything<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.340> sort<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> reddish<00:00:47.940> eye<00:00:48.450> colour

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
everything a sort of reddish eye colour

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
everything a sort of reddish eye colour
and<00:00:49.410> after<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> aluminium<00:00:50.219> creates<00:00:51.030> red

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and after the aluminium creates red

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.080 
and after the aluminium creates red
other<00:00:51.840> atoms<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.800> appear<00:00:53.129> creating<00:00:53.940> other

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
other atoms will appear creating other

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
other atoms will appear creating other
colors<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.129> discovered<00:00:56.129> by<00:00:56.250> Einstein's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
buddy Josh in 1953 the law of planets
tells<00:01:00.090> us<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.320> many<00:01:01.469> things

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
tells us like so many things

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
tells us like so many things

and thanks to a different guy named Josh
we<00:01:04.979> also<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.180> planets<00:01:06.510> made

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
we also know that there are planets made

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.719 
we also know that there are planets made
of<00:01:06.810> gas<00:01:07.049> called<00:01:07.500> through<00:01:07.860> planets<00:01:08.340> because

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
of gas called through planets because

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640 
of gas called through planets because
you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.150> right<00:01:09.360> through<00:01:09.600> them<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.049> there

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you can go right through them and there

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
you can go right through them and there
are<00:01:10.740> planets<00:01:10.950> made<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> rock<00:01:11.549> called<00:01:12.000> nope

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
are planets made of rock called nope

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.270 
are planets made of rock called nope
planets<00:01:12.930> cuz<00:01:13.229> nope<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.710> can't<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.010> through<00:01:14.250> a
