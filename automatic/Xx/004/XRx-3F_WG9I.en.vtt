00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of the comb I cut my bangs just a bit

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.569 
of the comb I cut my bangs just a bit
short<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:56.969> side<00:00:57.420> swept<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.039> start<00:00:59.460> from

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
short so that side swept so I start from

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.880
