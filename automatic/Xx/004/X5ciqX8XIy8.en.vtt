like<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> love<00:01:25.500> discussing<00:01:26.220> things

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
like that like I love discussing things

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
like that like I love discussing things
like<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.509> comes<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
like that and I think that it comes to a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
like that and I think that it comes to a
point<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.470> exhausted<00:01:28.710> by<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.159> but

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
point when I get exhausted by that but

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.859 
point when I get exhausted by that but
if<00:01:29.759> someone<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:30.780> all

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
if someone just is like not at all

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.210 
if someone just is like not at all
interested<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> they're<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.070> oh

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
interested in that they're just like oh

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
interested in that they're just like oh
I<00:01:32.340> can't<00:01:32.850> understand<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> don't<00:01:33.659> care<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
I can't understand it so I don't care so

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.899 
I can't understand it so I don't care so
let's<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.799> even<00:01:34.920> waste<00:01:35.159> time<00:01:35.340> discussing<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
let's not even waste time discussing it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.700 
let's not even waste time discussing it
that<00:01:36.360> would<00:01:36.540> annoy<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:36.990> much<00:01:37.409> because

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that would annoy me so much because

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.230 
that would annoy me so much because
conversations<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.790> make<00:01:39.119> me<00:01:39.210> think

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
conversations like that make me think

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.390 
conversations like that make me think
about<00:01:39.479> God<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> different<00:01:40.170> way<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.829> they're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
about God in a different way and they're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
about God in a different way and they're
just<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.700> exciting<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.270> awesome<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.780> me<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
just so exciting and awesome for me and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
just so exciting and awesome for me and
of<00:01:43.200> course<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.860> can't<00:01:44.100> understand<00:01:44.520> God

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
of course like we can't understand God

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.730 
of course like we can't understand God
and<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.240> silly<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> try<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.649> an

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and it's like silly to try to to an

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.380 
and it's like silly to try to to an
extent<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.970> almost<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
extent but I think that it's a almost a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
extent but I think that it's a almost a
form<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.720> workshops<00:01:48.930> thinking<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:50.220> him<00:01:50.399> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
form of workshops thinking about him in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.819 
form of workshops thinking about him in
that<00:01:50.549> way<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:52.110> guy<00:01:52.229> was<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.500> like

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
that way and so if a guy was just like

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
that way and so if a guy was just like
nope<00:01:53.189> don't<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> talk<00:01:53.909> about<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.299> we

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
nope don't want to talk about it we

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.730 
nope don't want to talk about it we
can't<00:01:54.570> understand<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.439> make<00:01:55.590> me

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
can't understand that that would make me

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.340 
can't understand that that would make me
really<00:01:56.040> sad<00:01:56.219> someone<00:01:57.000> who<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.049> into

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
really sad someone who is really into

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.870 
really sad someone who is really into
sugarcoating<00:01:58.950> things<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.850> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
sugarcoating things so if they have a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.190 
sugarcoating things so if they have a
problem<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.570> instead<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.079> like

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
problem with you instead of just like

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800 
problem with you instead of just like
directly<00:02:02.070> stating<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.060> communicating

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
directly stating it and communicating

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.410 
directly stating it and communicating
that<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:03.960> they'll<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.950> sugarcoat<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.060> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
that way they'll like sugarcoat it and I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
that way they'll like sugarcoat it and I
think<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:06.689> goes<00:02:06.810> along<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.290> too<00:02:07.439> is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
think what goes along with this too is

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.869 
think what goes along with this too is
that<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.039> person<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.489> only<00:02:08.610> like

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
that this person not only like

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.320 
that this person not only like
sugarcoats<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.569> they<00:02:09.660> want<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.989> sugar

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
sugarcoats but they want to be sugar

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.240 
sugarcoats but they want to be sugar
-<00:02:10.660> like<00:02:10.869> they<00:02:10.960> just<00:02:11.110> cannot<00:02:11.410> handle<00:02:11.680> when<00:02:12.160> you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
- like they just cannot handle when you

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.160 
- like they just cannot handle when you
like<00:02:12.430> say<00:02:13.090> like<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.600> how<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:13.900> like

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
like say like this is how it is like

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.980 
like say like this is how it is like
this<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.590> problem<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.570> would<00:02:16.570> feel<00:02:16.720> so

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
this is the problem like I would feel so

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.160 
this is the problem like I would feel so
suffocated<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:18.160> with<00:02:18.820> I'd<00:02:19.180> say<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.810> 80%

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
suffocated because with I'd say like 80%

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.530 
suffocated because with I'd say like 80%
of<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.980> world<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.490> kind<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.700> feel<00:02:21.850> like<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.180> can't

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
of the world I kind of feel like I can't

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.620 
of the world I kind of feel like I can't
completely<00:02:23.050> be<00:02:23.260> myself<00:02:23.470> because<00:02:24.460> I'm<00:02:24.700> it's<00:02:25.360> so

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
completely be myself because I'm it's so

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.000 
completely be myself because I'm it's so
unnatural<00:02:26.200> for<00:02:26.680> me<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.860> communicate

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
unnatural for me to communicate

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580 
unnatural for me to communicate
indirectly<00:02:27.940> or<00:02:28.390> communicate<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.320> way<00:02:29.350> that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
indirectly or communicate in a way that

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.410 
indirectly or communicate in a way that
isn't<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.100> staying<00:02:30.640> what<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.120> and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
isn't just like staying what it is and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.180 
isn't just like staying what it is and
it<00:02:31.750> would<00:02:31.840> just<00:02:31.960> require<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.500> much<00:02:32.650> energy<00:02:32.890> to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
it would just require so much energy to

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.830 
it would just require so much energy to
change<00:02:33.460> my<00:02:33.640> communication<00:02:34.240> style<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.690> deal

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
change my communication style to deal

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.520 
change my communication style to deal
with<00:02:34.990> someone<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.260> that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
with someone like that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.580 
with someone like that
and<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.550> would<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:37.450> could<00:02:38.080> not<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
and it would just be I could not and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.960 
and it would just be I could not and
told<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.920> what<00:02:39.340> kind<00:02:39.520> of<00:02:39.580> goes<00:02:39.700> along<00:02:39.730> with

told it what kind of goes along with

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.930 
told it what kind of goes along with
sugarcoating<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.990> someone<00:02:41.770> who<00:02:42.070> can't<00:02:42.700> handle

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940
