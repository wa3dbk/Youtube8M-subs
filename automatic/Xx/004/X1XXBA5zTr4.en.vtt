two or three days with a a ps3
controller<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:27.650> as<00:00:28.650> close<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.130> I'll<00:00:29.250> get

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
controller because as close as I'll get

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.650 
controller because as close as I'll get
to<00:00:29.880> actual<00:00:31.489> transmitter<00:00:32.489> Freya<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.480> got

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
to actual transmitter Freya but got

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.250 
to actual transmitter Freya but got
there<00:00:33.809> until<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.850> any<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:35.969> fixed<00:00:36.300> fixed<00:00:36.989> pitch

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
there until my any be fixed fixed pitch

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.610 
there until my any be fixed fixed pitch
to<00:00:37.530> comes<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.390> overrun<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
to comes in so I overrun this for a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.299 
to comes in so I overrun this for a
minute<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.980> two<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.899> don't<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.309> my

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
minute or two so don't see what my

guess

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:02:03.420 

come<00:01:50.090> back<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:53.450> come<00:01:53.480> back<00:01:53.690> here<00:01:56.920> I<00:02:01.570> crash

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
come back you come back here I crash

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.180 
come back you come back here I crash
that's<00:02:04.430> why<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:05.390> learn<00:02:05.600> on<00:02:05.990> on<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:06.680> simulator

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
that's why you learn on on a simulator

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.160 
that's why you learn on on a simulator
first<00:02:07.730> so<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.390> don't<00:02:08.570> waste<00:02:08.930> a<00:02:10.990> lot<00:02:11.990> of<00:02:12.050> money

probably crash this thing by net tell
you<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.310> truth<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.150> little<00:03:16.390> bit

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
you the truth this is a little bit

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.430 
you the truth this is a little bit
harder<00:03:16.840> than<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.050> would<00:03:17.200> imagine<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.260> i<00:03:23.290> think

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
harder than you would imagine so i think

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.880 
harder than you would imagine so i think
but<00:03:23.890> who<00:03:24.190> knows<00:03:26.280> some<00:03:27.280> people<00:03:27.310> tell<00:03:28.000> me<00:03:28.030> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
but who knows some people tell me a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.630 
but who knows some people tell me a
simulator<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.520> served<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.940> real<00:03:31.150> thing<00:03:31.590> so

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
simulator it served in the real thing so

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.110 
simulator it served in the real thing so
we<00:03:33.640> will<00:03:34.240> see<00:03:34.420> how<00:03:34.450> that<00:03:34.720> goes<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:36.670> so<00:03:36.880> far

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
we will see how that goes but so far

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.620
