00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
review with tom vasel jambalaya is a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.229 
review with tom vasel jambalaya is a
word<00:00:21.800> game<00:00:21.829> and<00:00:22.429> I<00:00:22.759> guess<00:00:22.939> it<00:00:23.089> would<00:00:23.210> be

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:23.239 
word game and I guess it would be

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:24.939 
word game and I guess it would be
evidenced<00:00:23.810> by<00:00:23.929> the<00:00:23.989> fact<00:00:24.230> that<00:00:24.409> it<00:00:24.560> comes<00:00:24.769> with

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
evidenced by the fact that it comes with

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.450 
evidenced by the fact that it comes with
a<00:00:24.980> bag<00:00:25.249> and<00:00:25.849> then<00:00:25.999> that<00:00:26.179> bag<00:00:26.449> you<00:00:27.289> have<00:00:27.499> tiles

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
a bag and then that bag you have tiles

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.970 
a bag and then that bag you have tiles
with<00:00:29.029> letters<00:00:29.419> on<00:00:29.630> them<00:00:29.839> and<00:00:30.470> you're<00:00:30.769> placing

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
with letters on them and you're placing

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.950 
with letters on them and you're placing
them<00:00:31.249> on<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.460> board<00:00:31.699> well<00:00:32.419> that<00:00:32.540> may<00:00:32.689> sound

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
them on the board well that may sound

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.470 
them on the board well that may sound
like<00:00:33.200> something<00:00:33.440> that's<00:00:33.740> like<00:00:33.800> Scrabble<00:00:34.550> but

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
like something that's like Scrabble but

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.940 
like something that's like Scrabble but
it's<00:00:35.600> really<00:00:35.780> not<00:00:36.020> it's<00:00:36.320> it's<00:00:36.500> own<00:00:36.620> thing<00:00:36.860> in

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
it's really not it's it's own thing in

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.500 
it's really not it's it's own thing in
fact<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:37.280> closest<00:00:37.730> thing<00:00:37.850> that<00:00:37.880> i<00:00:38.000> would<00:00:38.090> put

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
fact the closest thing that i would put

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.570 
fact the closest thing that i would put
this<00:00:38.660> with<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:39.200> some<00:00:39.530> kind<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.740> anagram<00:00:40.310> like

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
this with is some kind of anagram like

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.910 
this with is some kind of anagram like
my<00:00:40.730> wife<00:00:40.940> gets<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:41.540> book<00:00:41.780> called<00:00:42.200> jumbo<00:00:42.740> and

my wife gets a book called jumbo and
tries<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.190> figure<00:00:43.370> out<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:43.760> different<00:00:44.060> words

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
tries to figure out the different words

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.240 
tries to figure out the different words
and<00:00:44.540> mixing<00:00:45.230> them<00:00:45.260> up<00:00:45.410> this<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:46.040> a<00:00:46.070> very

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
and mixing them up this is a very

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.790 
and mixing them up this is a very
similar<00:00:46.670> feel<00:00:47.240> to<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:47.630> it's<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.320> some<00:00:48.590> pretty

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
similar feel to that it's a some pretty

thing key word problem but it's not that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.690 
thing key word problem but it's not that
difficult<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.650> I<00:00:51.740> still<00:00:52.010> had<00:00:52.160> fun<00:00:52.400> playing

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
difficult that I still had fun playing

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.050 
difficult that I still had fun playing
the<00:00:53.090> game<00:00:53.270> let's<00:00:53.930> take<00:00:54.020> a<00:00:54.080> look<00:00:54.290> at<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.440> board

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
the game let's take a look at the board

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.690 
the game let's take a look at the board
so<00:00:56.060> here's<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.480> jambalaya<00:00:57.050> board<00:00:57.530> at<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
so here's the jambalaya board at the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.680 
so here's the jambalaya board at the
beginning<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.180> game<00:00:59.300> you're<00:00:59.510> going<00:00:59.600> to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
beginning of the game you're going to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.750 
beginning of the game you're going to
place<00:00:59.870> three<00:01:00.290> random<00:01:00.710> letters<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.250> all<00:01:01.370> the

beginning lines on the board each player

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.250 
beginning lines on the board each player
then<00:01:04.790> we'll<00:01:04.940> get<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.089> little<00:01:05.330> plastic<00:01:05.690> tray<00:01:05.990> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
then we'll get a little plastic tray and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.710 
then we'll get a little plastic tray and
they'll<00:01:07.070> draw<00:01:07.310> five<00:01:07.640> letters<00:01:08.000> from<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.330> bag

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.810 
they'll draw five letters from the bag
and<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.260> should<00:01:09.470> mention<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:09.830> when<00:01:10.580> i<00:01:10.610> say

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
and I should mention it when i say

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.430 
and I should mention it when i say
letters<00:01:11.180> sometimes<00:01:11.690> there's<00:01:11.900> multiple

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
letters sometimes there's multiple

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.890 
letters sometimes there's multiple
letters<00:01:12.620> like<00:01:12.800> here's<00:01:13.070> an<00:01:13.190> ly<00:01:13.580> there's<00:01:14.510> also<00:01:14.750> a

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
letters like here's an ly there's also a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.460 
letters like here's an ly there's also a
CH<00:01:15.520> q<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.850> go<00:01:17.570> together<00:01:18.220> ed<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:20.300> so<00:01:20.510> you<00:01:21.229> draw

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
CH q you go together ed and so you draw

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.469 
CH q you go together ed and so you draw
some<00:01:21.680> letters<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.190> then<00:01:22.430> when<00:01:23.150> it's<00:01:23.180> your

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
some letters and then when it's your

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.350 
some letters and then when it's your
turn<00:01:23.890> you're<00:01:24.890> going<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.340> try<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.640> take<00:01:26.030> control

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
turn you're going to try to take control

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.080 
turn you're going to try to take control
of<00:01:26.900> one<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.979> these<00:01:28.070> rows<00:01:28.430> on<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.729> board<00:01:28.940> now

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
of one of these rows on the board now

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.170 
of one of these rows on the board now
you<00:01:29.150> have<00:01:29.450> unlimited<00:01:30.049> time<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:31.130> guess<00:01:31.700> except

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
you have unlimited time I guess except

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.460 
you have unlimited time I guess except
that<00:01:32.270> there's<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.570> two<00:01:32.750> minute<00:01:33.110> time<00:01:33.440> limit

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
that there's a two minute time limit

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.310 
that there's a two minute time limit
which<00:01:33.770> people<00:01:34.580> will<00:01:34.670> often<00:01:34.850> flip<00:01:35.390> if<00:01:35.630> you're

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
which people will often flip if you're

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.500 
which people will often flip if you're
taking<00:01:36.650> too<00:01:36.770> long<00:01:36.950> on<00:01:37.159> your<00:01:37.280> turn<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.390> what

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
taking too long on your turn so what

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.969 
taking too long on your turn so what
you're<00:01:38.630> trying<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.930> do<00:01:39.080> is<00:01:39.290> you're<00:01:39.470> trying<00:01:39.650> to

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
you're trying to do is you're trying to

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.480 
you're trying to do is you're trying to
make<00:01:40.370> a<00:01:40.610> word<00:01:41.680> on<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.920> board<00:01:43.159> one<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
make a word on the board one of the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.920 
make a word on the board one of the
things<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.790> do<00:01:43.909> is<00:01:44.060> simply<00:01:44.360> rearrange<00:01:44.630> the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
things you do is simply rearrange the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.469 
things you do is simply rearrange the
letters<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:45.860> let's<00:01:46.729> focus<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.210> little<00:01:47.330> bit

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
letters so let's focus here a little bit

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.630 
letters so let's focus here a little bit
on<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.750> middle<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.170> could<00:01:49.070> take<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:49.430> right

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
on the middle I could take this right

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.030 
on the middle I could take this right
here<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:50.060> switch<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:50.930> around<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.530> get<00:01:52.430> the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
here and switch this around and get the

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.800 
here and switch this around and get the
that's<00:01:55.040> legal<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.670> switch<00:01:56.240> them<00:01:56.420> around<00:01:56.479> I'm

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
that's legal I switch them around I'm

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.560 
that's legal I switch them around I'm
done<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.439> when<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:57.979> do<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.700> can<00:01:59.060> then<00:01:59.210> place

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
done and when I do that I can then place

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.990 
done and when I do that I can then place
one<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.869> my<00:01:59.960> cubes<00:02:00.290> there<00:02:00.619> I've<00:02:01.220> claimed<00:02:01.790> that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
one of my cubes there I've claimed that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.580 
one of my cubes there I've claimed that
mind<00:02:02.299> if<00:02:02.570> someone<00:02:02.869> else<00:02:02.990> had<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.200> work<00:02:03.380> there

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
mind if someone else had to work there

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.219 
mind if someone else had to work there
that<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.799> rearranged<00:02:04.520> then<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.570> could<00:02:05.869> come<00:02:06.080> in

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
that I rearranged then I could come in

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.830 
that I rearranged then I could come in
if<00:02:06.470> I'm<00:02:06.650> flu<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.340> replace<00:02:08.239> them<00:02:08.450> with<00:02:08.509> my

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
if I'm flu and replace them with my

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.500 
if I'm flu and replace them with my
color<00:02:09.550> another<00:02:10.550> thing<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.789> can<00:02:10.940> do<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.270> you

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
color another thing you can do is you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.559 
color another thing you can do is you
can<00:02:11.540> add<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.530> or<00:02:12.680> two<00:02:12.709> letters

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
can add one or two letters

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.289 
can add one or two letters
so<00:02:13.810> donate<00:02:14.079> their<00:02:14.290> i<00:02:14.499> can<00:02:15.280> add<00:02:15.430> an<00:02:15.579> r<00:02:15.760> there<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
so donate their i can add an r there and

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.050 
so donate their i can add an r there and
now<00:02:16.689> that's<00:02:16.959> door<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.549> also<00:02:18.700> rearrange

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
now that's door you can also rearrange

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.110 
now that's door you can also rearrange
and<00:02:19.719> add<00:02:20.200> letters<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.129> up<00:02:21.249> here<00:02:21.280> i<00:02:21.670> could

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
and add letters so up here i could

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.860 
and add letters so up here i could
rearrange<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.889> HMA<00:02:23.889> you<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.370> add<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.269> tee<00:02:25.629> and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
rearrange the HMA you and add a tee and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.800 
rearrange the HMA you and add a tee and
i<00:02:26.439> get<00:02:26.650> shut<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.180> there's<00:02:28.569> different

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
i get shut and so there's different

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.929 
i get shut and so there's different
things<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.349> can<00:02:29.680> do<00:02:29.920> as<00:02:30.189> you're<00:02:30.790> adding

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
things that you can do as you're adding

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.660 
things that you can do as you're adding
these<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.930> also<00:02:32.109> add<00:02:32.469> and<00:02:33.069> replace

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
these you can also add and replace

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.020 
these you can also add and replace
letters<00:02:34.269> for<00:02:34.989> example<00:02:35.379> i<00:02:35.650> can<00:02:36.489> replace<00:02:36.790> the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
letters for example i can replace the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.360 
letters for example i can replace the
are<00:02:37.180> with<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> seat<00:02:37.750> for<00:02:37.959> my<00:02:38.079> tile<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.980> r<00:02:39.129> would

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
are with a seat for my tile the r would

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.179 
are with a seat for my tile the r would
come<00:02:39.549> back<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.969> my<00:02:40.209> rack<00:02:40.719> and<00:02:41.019> then<00:02:41.560> add<00:02:41.799> an<00:02:41.950> e

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
come back to my rack and then add an e

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.659 
come back to my rack and then add an e
and<00:02:42.459> get<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.510> word<00:02:43.689> dice<00:02:44.049> or<00:02:44.919> I<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.549> know

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:45.669 
and get the word dice or I can you know

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.190 
and get the word dice or I can you know
again<00:02:45.909> you<00:02:46.060> can<00:02:46.180> add<00:02:46.269> up<00:02:46.359> the<00:02:46.450> two<00:02:46.659> letters<00:02:46.989> and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
again you can add up the two letters and

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.099 
again you can add up the two letters and
the<00:02:47.260> longer<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.829> word<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:49.180> more<00:02:49.480> points

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
the longer the word is the more points

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.170 
the longer the word is the more points
that<00:02:50.349> word<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.709> going<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.919> be<00:02:51.040> worth<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.549> fact

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
that word is going to be worth in fact

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.530 
that word is going to be worth in fact
one<00:02:52.480> through<00:02:52.719> six<00:02:53.280> letter<00:02:54.280> words<00:02:54.609> are<00:02:54.879> worth

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
one through six letter words are worth

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.270 
one through six letter words are worth
one<00:02:56.049> through<00:02:56.260> six<00:02:56.469> points<00:02:56.919> the<00:02:57.069> end<00:02:57.189> the<00:02:57.250> game

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
not a big deal didn't notice a definite
