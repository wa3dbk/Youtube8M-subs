do with the l1 triangle attack in the
air<00:00:40.640> is<00:00:40.910> now<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.180> same<00:00:41.600> initiation<00:00:42.410> speed<00:00:42.680> as

when<00:00:43.100> it's<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.460> ground<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.000> then<00:00:44.480> the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
when it's on the ground and then the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.180 
when it's on the ground and then the
biggest<00:00:45.200> changes<00:00:45.590> have<00:00:45.710> actually<00:00:45.950> been<00:00:46.040> to

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
biggest changes have actually been to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.550 
biggest changes have actually been to
juggles<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:47.060> hit<00:00:47.570> reactions<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:48.290> stuff

juggles and hit reactions and stuff

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.590 
juggles and hit reactions and stuff
which<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:49.130> kind<00:00:49.490> of<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.640> bit<00:00:49.760> annoying<00:00:50.000> all

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
which is kind of a bit annoying all

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.390 
which is kind of a bit annoying all
those<00:00:50.780> cool<00:00:51.020> sort<00:00:51.320> of<00:00:51.440> juggle<00:00:51.920> combos<00:00:52.100> you

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
those cool sort of juggle combos you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.340 
those cool sort of juggle combos you
doing<00:00:52.640> out<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.820> little<00:00:53.060> bit<00:00:53.270> harder<00:00:53.690> but<00:00:54.200> at<00:00:54.290> the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
doing out a little bit harder but at the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.810 
doing out a little bit harder but at the
same<00:00:54.530> time<00:00:54.740> it<00:00:54.890> means<00:00:55.040> you<00:00:55.190> can't<00:00:55.220> just<00:00:55.550> chain

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
same time it means you can't just chain

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.790 
same time it means you can't just chain
them<00:00:56.090> into<00:00:56.450> infinity<00:00:56.960> which<00:00:57.080> gives<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.500> lot<00:00:57.740> of

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
them into infinity which gives a lot of

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.080 
them into infinity which gives a lot of
people<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.100> lot<00:00:58.250> more<00:00:58.490> chance<00:00:58.790> to<00:00:58.910> actually

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
people a lot more chance to actually

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.750 
people a lot more chance to actually
escape<00:00:59.720> them<00:01:00.250> there's<00:01:01.250> also<00:01:01.370> been<00:01:01.700> some

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
escape them there's also been some

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.749 
escape them there's also been some
changes<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.650> Sidon<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:03.800> so<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.280> lot<00:01:04.549> of<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
changes to Sidon and so a lot of the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.460 
changes to Sidon and so a lot of the
armor<00:01:05.150> has<00:01:05.269> been<00:01:05.390> changed<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:05.990> physical

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
armor has been changed so the physical

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.770 
armor has been changed so the physical
resistance<00:01:06.680> isn't<00:01:07.040> quite<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:07.400> high<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.540> lot

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
resistance isn't quite so high and a lot

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.090 
resistance isn't quite so high and a lot

actually<00:01:34.700> get<00:01:34.850> four<00:01:35.119> maps<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.749> first<00:01:35.960> one<00:01:36.170> is

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
actually get four maps the first one is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.660 
actually get four maps the first one is
chamber<00:01:36.649> of<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.829> flame<00:01:37.039> that<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.280> just<00:01:37.460> saw

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
chamber of the flame that you just saw

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.599 
chamber of the flame that you just saw
here<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.539> second<00:01:38.929> one<00:01:39.049> is<00:01:39.079> streets<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.950> sparta

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
here the second one is streets of sparta

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.760 
here the second one is streets of sparta
which<00:01:40.819> is<00:01:41.450> again<00:01:41.689> pretty<00:01:42.109> cool<00:01:42.350> one<00:01:42.530> there<00:01:42.709> are

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
which is again pretty cool one there are

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.260 
which is again pretty cool one there are
all<00:01:42.829> pretty<00:01:42.979> small<00:01:43.369> maps<00:01:43.609> as<00:01:43.819> you<00:01:43.939> can<00:01:44.090> see

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
all pretty small maps as you can see

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.059 
all pretty small maps as you can see
there<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:44.810> that's<00:01:45.049> good<00:01:45.229> or<00:01:45.319> bad<00:01:45.380> depending<00:01:45.950> on

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
there so that's good or bad depending on

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.980 
there so that's good or bad depending on
your<00:01:46.130> play<00:01:46.340> style<00:01:46.609> really<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.780> third

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
your play style really and the third

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.510 
your play style really and the third
place<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.350> actually<00:01:48.590> called<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.829> canyons<00:01:49.310> of

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
place is actually called the canyons of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.999 
place is actually called the canyons of
kira<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.990> actually<00:01:51.200> looks<00:01:51.560> really<00:01:51.619> really

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
kira and it actually looks really really

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.289 
kira and it actually looks really really
cool<00:01:52.039> it's<00:01:52.310> probably<00:01:52.520> one<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.819> best<00:01:52.999> ones

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
cool it's probably one of the best ones

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.809 
cool it's probably one of the best ones
I<00:01:53.770> actually<00:01:54.770> like<00:01:55.009> chamber<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.429> frame<00:01:55.639> the

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
I actually like chamber the frame the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.370 
I actually like chamber the frame the
best<00:01:55.999> but<00:01:56.209> this<00:01:56.329> is<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.479> really<00:01:56.749> cool<00:01:56.959> one<00:01:57.139> and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
best but this is a really cool one and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.289 
best but this is a really cool one and
like<00:01:58.039> I<00:01:58.159> said<00:01:58.219> it<00:01:58.459> is<00:01:58.520> really<00:01:58.819> small<00:01:59.029> so<00:01:59.090> it's

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
like I said it is really small so it's

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.219 
like I said it is really small so it's
kind<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.509> up<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.779> you<00:01:59.869> if<00:01:59.929> you're<00:02:00.049> going<00:02:00.170> to

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
kind of up to you if you're going to

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.050 
kind of up to you if you're going to
like<00:02:00.409> or<00:02:00.679> not<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.130> last<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.789> called

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
like or not the last one is called

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.690 
like or not the last one is called
landing<00:02:02.689> at<00:02:02.840> de<00:02:03.109> los<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:04.340> does<00:02:04.520> look

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
landing at de los and it does look

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.269 
landing at de los and it does look
pretty<00:02:04.850> cool<00:02:05.119> as<00:02:05.270> well<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.619> it's<00:02:06.859> a<00:02:06.920> completely

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:07.279 
pretty cool as well so it's a completely

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:08.620 
pretty cool as well so it's a completely
different<00:02:07.490> game<00:02:07.670> mode<00:02:07.999> this<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.390> kind<00:02:08.569> of

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
different game mode this is the kind of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.639 
different game mode this is the kind of
thing<00:02:08.690> where<00:02:08.929> if<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.110> want<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.319> settle<00:02:09.530> a

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
thing where if you want to settle a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.350 
thing where if you want to settle a
score<00:02:09.800> with<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.160> friend<00:02:10.399> or<00:02:10.520> arrival<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.240> is

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
score with a friend or arrival this is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.880 
score with a friend or arrival this is
what<00:02:11.450> you're<00:02:11.540> going<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.720> want<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.930> go<00:02:11.959> for<00:02:12.380> it's

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
what you're going to want to go for it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.350 
what you're going to want to go for it's
not<00:02:13.040> really<00:02:13.160> my<00:02:13.280> cup<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.610> tea<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.180> like

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
not really my cup of tea because I like

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.550 
not really my cup of tea because I like
to<00:02:14.390> actually<00:02:14.630> take<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.080> more<00:02:15.170> than<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.319> enemy

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
to actually take on more than one enemy

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.020 
to actually take on more than one enemy
at<00:02:15.740> once<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.400> bit<00:02:16.580> more<00:02:16.610> space<00:02:16.970> to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
at once and have a bit more space to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.210 
at once and have a bit more space to
actually<00:02:17.300> maneuver<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.650> again<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.070> is<00:02:19.100> a

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
actually maneuver but again that is a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.710 
actually maneuver but again that is a
personal<00:02:19.730> opinion<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.360> that's<00:02:20.480> why<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.600> was

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
personal opinion and that's why I was

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.240 
personal opinion and that's why I was
given<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:21.020> 3<00:02:21.290> out<00:02:21.320> of<00:02:21.530> 5<00:02:21.800> for<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.280> rating

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
given it 3 out of 5 for a rating

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.500 
given it 3 out of 5 for a rating
I<00:02:23.340> still<00:02:23.790> think<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.090> really<00:02:24.300> good<00:02:24.480> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
I still think it's really good that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.030 
I still think it's really good that
trying<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.960> add<00:02:25.080> new<00:02:25.110> game<00:02:25.500> modes<00:02:25.740> though

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
trying to add new game modes though

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.940 
trying to add new game modes though
especially<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.480> free<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.620> next<00:02:28.830> thing

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
especially as it is free the next thing

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.200 
especially as it is free the next thing
you're<00:02:29.070> going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.490> called<00:02:29.700> whirlpool

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
you're going to get is called whirlpool

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.030 
you're going to get is called whirlpool
of<00:02:30.420> alecto<00:02:30.900> which<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.350> actually<00:02:31.470> use<00:02:31.800> in

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
of alecto which you can actually use in

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.220 
of alecto which you can actually use in
2v<00:02:32.280> two<00:02:32.460> or<00:02:32.910> four<00:02:33.210> match<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.540> Champions<00:02:34.020> which

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
2v two or four match of Champions which

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.750 
2v two or four match of Champions which
you<00:02:34.350> guys<00:02:34.500> know<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.830> my<00:02:34.950> favorite<00:02:35.340> game<00:02:35.520> mode

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
you guys know is my favorite game mode

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.040 
you guys know is my favorite game mode
and<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.240> awesome<00:02:36.330> they<00:02:36.660> finally

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
and I think it's awesome they finally

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.360 
and I think it's awesome they finally
released<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.410> new<00:02:37.530> map<00:02:37.710> for<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.040> because<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
released a new map for this because the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.410 
released a new map for this because the
other<00:02:38.490> ones<00:02:38.670> were<00:02:38.760> getting<00:02:38.970> really<00:02:39.300> really

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
other ones were getting really really

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.199 
other ones were getting really really
boring<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> really<00:02:41.760> cool<00:02:41.970> map

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
boring I do think it's a really cool map

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.120 
boring I do think it's a really cool map
as<00:02:42.420> well<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.959> definitely<00:02:43.200> not<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.590> best<00:02:43.920> map

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
as well it's definitely not the best map

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.410 
as well it's definitely not the best map
I've<00:02:44.310> played<00:02:44.490> actually<00:02:44.880> thought<00:02:45.060> tower<00:02:45.300> of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
I've played actually thought tower of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.940 
I've played actually thought tower of
delphi--<00:02:45.840> would<00:02:45.990> have<00:02:46.080> been<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> better<00:02:46.500> map<00:02:46.800> to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
delphi-- would have been a better map to

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.800 
delphi-- would have been a better map to
add<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.459> maybe<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.150> individually

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
add but maybe that of that individually

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.449 
add but maybe that of that individually
still<00:02:49.530> though<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:49.920> definitely<00:02:50.250> more<00:02:50.400> fun

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
still though it's definitely more fun

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.190 
still though it's definitely more fun
than<00:02:50.760> playing<00:02:50.910> all<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.540> original<00:02:51.720> maps

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
than playing all of the original maps

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.620 
than playing all of the original maps
and<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.459> monotony<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.180> playing

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
and just because the monotony of playing

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.140 
and just because the monotony of playing
something<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.140> thousand<00:02:55.590> times<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:56.580> still<00:02:56.970> I

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
something a thousand times but still I

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.370 
something a thousand times but still I
think<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:57.480> really<00:02:57.630> cool<00:02:57.840> they've<00:02:58.020> added<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
think it's really cool they've added the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.170 
think it's really cool they've added the
Leviathan<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.250> massive<00:02:59.610> beast<00:02:59.850> in<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
Leviathan in that massive beast in the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.610 
Leviathan in that massive beast in the
back<00:03:00.330> there<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.900> does<00:03:01.050> actually<00:03:01.230> affect

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
back there and it does actually affect

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.380 
back there and it does actually affect
your<00:03:01.800> game<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.250> can<00:03:02.340> attack<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:02.970> stuff<00:03:03.209> so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
your game it can attack you and stuff so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.810 
your game it can attack you and stuff so
that<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.630> pretty<00:03:03.810> cool<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:05.250> music's<00:03:05.610> quite

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
that is pretty cool the music's quite

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.490 
that is pretty cool the music's quite
epic<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.420> generally<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:06.989> just<00:03:07.140> really<00:03:07.290> fun

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
epic and generally it's just really fun

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.410 
epic and generally it's just really fun
just<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.800> play<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> new<00:03:08.250> map<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.820> just<00:03:09.239> like<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
just to play a new map so just like the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.570 
just to play a new map so just like the
bout<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.840> Honor<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.320> actually<00:03:10.800> free<00:03:11.220> so

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
bout of Honor this is actually free so

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.220 
bout of Honor this is actually free so
it<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:12.420> cool<00:03:12.570> they've<00:03:12.750> added<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.050> for

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
it is really cool they've added this for

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.270 
it is really cool they've added this for
free<00:03:13.350> they<00:03:13.530> definitely<00:03:13.800> could<00:03:13.950> have<00:03:14.010> charged

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
free they definitely could have charged

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800 
free they definitely could have charged
for<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.580> i'm<00:03:14.700> pretty<00:03:14.910> sure<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.239> not<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.450> trial

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
for it i'm pretty sure it's not a trial

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.390 
for it i'm pretty sure it's not a trial
period<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:16.380> some<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.770> other<00:03:16.890> stuff<00:03:17.160> but

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
period like some of the other stuff but

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.800 
period like some of the other stuff but
again<00:03:17.670> i<00:03:17.700> might<00:03:17.880> be<00:03:18.030> wrong<00:03:18.060> about<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.450> and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
again i might be wrong about that and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.350 
again i might be wrong about that and
I've<00:03:19.410> actually<00:03:19.560> given<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.340> 4<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.030> 5

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
I've actually given this a 4 out of 5

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.940 
I've actually given this a 4 out of 5
like<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.690> said<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:21.989> think<00:03:22.230> Todd<00:03:22.410> Elfie<00:03:22.800> was

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.770

slightly better i'm having the manticore
and<00:03:24.810> stuff<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.230> could<00:03:25.320> have<00:03:25.440> been<00:03:25.500> cool<00:03:25.739> but

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
and stuff that could have been cool but

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.800 
and stuff that could have been cool but
