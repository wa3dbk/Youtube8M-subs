00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.670
 How are you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 is the melody of praise rejoice 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.570
 or inhabitant adhesion of thousands of san 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.570
 many frames 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.050
 they touch 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.890
 the praise as it comes from the cid and 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.180
 revival which makes a 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.180
 introduction more or less like this 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.490
 but the heaven that I come to 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.120
 and teach them 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:55.030
 in this hour the melody is the melody 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.030
 it's been this one we're here in sun 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.600
 and I know that the trumpet of a piano 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.650
 a regular trumpet is never going to be 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.030
 same but then 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.260
 to me when I started playing the piano 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.530
 he always said why not give him a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.080
 melody if you hear a little more 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.240
 nice like that, not nothing else, it's not so much 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.350
 that the chords or something like that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.280
 but then we took on the task 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.990
 so to be able to get some melodies like 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.720
 is in the church where we do not have 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.150
 some trumpet some 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.150
 wind instruments so what 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.520
 we do is touch it with the tones 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.130
 it is not heard or the same, but anyway 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.270
 we are really based then the melody 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 it's like that 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.759
 I do not 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.759
 and so 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.549
 to attack 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.450
 or if they want to do it in a part that 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.380
 does on the revival site that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.380
 now what is entrusted 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.630
 it's more or less like that 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:59.910
 She points and then just hand me 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:03.400
 they are men and rejoice honor 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.120
 that's to enter the area again 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.120
 to the song 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.290
 and that's it 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.409
 there is another 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.150
 when it comes up it is referring to the bestowal 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.400
 but if you want to touch anything else like that 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.219
 as it is in the other civil I do not remember 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.680
 how is it called the worthy to do something like that 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:32.709
 I do not remember but there you look for it 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.010
 online nothing else does is this is 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.010
 simply 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.209
 yes 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:51.819
 or if they want to do it as the 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:51.819
 daily is here 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.910
 and 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.910
 no no no 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.030
 Y 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.319
 Y 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.380

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.910

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.560
 i 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:02.790
 remember one is the sun starts the other 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:05.070
 starts in nothing what we do is that 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.020
 we raised it a tone remember the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.750
 tones 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.110
 from here here is half tone from here x a 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.110
 tone 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.400
 can we bridge 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.080
 ah 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.620

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.930
 I hope it's a blessing 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.940
 for one more was there 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.680
 melody 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.729
 we can say something so that there is a 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.620
 idea more or less how is the song 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.659
 we could sing well but the 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.110
 pure melody of rejoice dweller 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.110

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.250
 bridge yes 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.620

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.300
 forgive some note or something I'm missing and 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.150
 then there they comment to arrive less to see 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.180
 because I'm still learning and so 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.890
 the melodies we do not take them out 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.230
 that basically to pure ear listening 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.600

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.220
