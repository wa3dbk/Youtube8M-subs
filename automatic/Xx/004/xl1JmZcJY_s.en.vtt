00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.110
 hello people we want you one today 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.210
 announce another challenge 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.099
 although I already have three 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.530
 months made a challenge but that 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.209
 will be something completely different and therefore 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.200
 I think that's okay, too, I was three 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.910
 months must be fit and we had then 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.760
 a kind of challenge thought 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.530
 yes and it will be about the great advertising of 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.630
 medium to go to a screen 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.120
 in the event that the area you 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.840
 We know we play here for a short time 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.840
 the advertising 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.460
 There is a good reason for mine 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.699
 glittering main and why me so 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.900
 shimmer and why my pores are so pure 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.900
 and are clear 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:59.420
 I am eating medium babys ice cream it keeps 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.699
 me young and agile i jump off 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.549
 Activity to activity 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.630
 i love my work i love mine 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:12.290
 live if you have little babys ice cream 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.920
 they will eat and wave to each other 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.229
 nod and hug and get the fin 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.760
 rich while they are with big 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.760
 encounter enthusiasm 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:31.490
 this is a special time 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.110
 liddell babys ice cream for ice cream 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.110
 is a feeling 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.680
 we have a german text for this 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.520
 written and we want one that 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.270
 make a challenge 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.830
 that means everyone makes his text 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.000
 syncs that uses the text 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.830
 we made before 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.840
 it is not one-to-one now 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.350
 are translated but it is possible 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.770
 contain 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.170
 that translates to some but waits 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.270
 you can really own those 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.880
 challenge will be about two months 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.580
 go as long as mine 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.679
 karaoke challenge and I invite everyone 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.459
 to make one so welcome 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.890
 you can then upload everything and 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.420
 So synonymous your channel then me the link 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.190
 you can send that under this 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.590
 video we'll do it though 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.720
 probably delete the link again 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.370
 but I will take them over and in 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.709
 insert the description that does not matter 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.170
 whoever comes with you , everything comes in 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.030
 the description so no contribution goes 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.650
 lost 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.560
 a summary of all the best 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.900
 then comes after two months after it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.380
 has expired 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.880
 the video you will find the video in 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.380
 The Thunder description is it was now 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.340
 not the original songtitel im 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.750
 background but something similar so 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.100
 take a look at the description there 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.170

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.630
