okay<00:00:01.979> we're<00:00:02.159> on<00:00:02.190> our<00:00:02.250> last<00:00:02.520> section<00:00:02.760> math

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay we're on our last section math

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.720 
okay we're on our last section math
problems<00:00:03.510> disinfection<00:00:04.400> these<00:00:05.400> are<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> little

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
problems disinfection these are a little

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.930 
problems disinfection these are a little
trickier<00:00:06.120> but<00:00:06.990> it<00:00:07.109> very<00:00:07.290> easily<00:00:07.470> done<00:00:07.940> all

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
trickier but it very easily done all

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.350 
trickier but it very easily done all
right

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
right

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.669 
right
yeah<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.630> was<00:00:09.750> great<00:00:09.929> for<00:00:10.170> me<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.380> figure<00:00:10.590> out

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
yeah I was great for me to figure out

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:19.460 
yeah I was great for me to figure out
disinfection<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:14.839> your<00:00:15.839> chemical<00:00:17.570> in<00:00:18.570> palace

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
disinfection is your chemical in palace

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.670 
disinfection is your chemical in palace
equals<00:00:20.990> your<00:00:21.990> dose<00:00:24.230> milligrams<00:00:25.230> per<00:00:25.439> liter

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
equals your dose milligrams per liter

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.850 
equals your dose milligrams per liter

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
at million gallons per day the one thing

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.290 
at million gallons per day the one thing
you<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.160> in<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> algebraic<00:01:35.880> formula

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
you do not see in the algebraic formula

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.109 
you do not see in the algebraic formula
is<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:37.680> given<00:01:38.130> factor<00:01:38.550> of<00:01:38.610> eight<00:01:38.759> point

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
is this given factor of eight point

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.660 
is this given factor of eight point
three<00:01:39.180> four<00:01:39.630> eight<00:01:40.619> point<00:01:41.009> three<00:01:41.070> four<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.580> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
three four eight point three four is the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.930 
three four eight point three four is the
same<00:01:41.700> thing<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.570> your<00:01:43.080> flow<00:01:43.550> times<00:01:44.550> eight

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
same thing as your flow times eight

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.700 
same thing as your flow times eight
point<00:01:45.300> three<00:01:45.360> four<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.960> lot<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.320> people<00:01:46.560> make<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
point three four a lot of people make a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
point three four a lot of people make a
mistake<00:01:46.800> with<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.369> formula<00:01:47.910> because<00:01:48.390> they

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
mistake with this formula because they

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
mistake with this formula because they
forget<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.320> factor<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.890> eight<00:01:50.100> point

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
forget to factor in the eight point

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
forget to factor in the eight point
three<00:01:50.460> floor<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.960> why<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.140> pie<00:01:52.380> chart<00:01:52.680> is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
three floor this is why the pie chart is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.529 
three floor this is why the pie chart is
so<00:01:52.950> helpful<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.550> you<00:01:53.759> cannot<00:01:54.090> forget<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
so helpful because you cannot forget to

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.749 
so helpful because you cannot forget to
use<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> eight<00:01:54.990> point<00:01:55.259> three<00:01:55.320> four<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> let's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
asking for how many pounds of HTH now we

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.570 
asking for how many pounds of HTH now we
know<00:03:14.209> H<00:03:14.360> th<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.840> 65%<00:03:15.320> chlorine<00:03:16.160> it's<00:03:16.370> not<00:03:16.550> a

you're<00:03:30.530> going<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.739> need<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.980> figure<00:03:31.160> out<00:03:31.370> what

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
you're going to need to figure out what

you're going to need to figure out what
your<00:03:31.790> pounds<00:03:32.209> is<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.480> chlorine<00:03:32.810> gas<00:03:33.019> and

your pounds is and chlorine gas and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.050 
your pounds is and chlorine gas and
divide<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.580> answer

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
divide that answer

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.280 
divide that answer
it's<00:03:35.690> about<00:03:35.810> 0.65<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:38.120> get<00:03:38.269> your<00:03:38.480> pounds<00:03:39.200> of

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
it's about 0.65 to get your pounds of

it's about 0.65 to get your pounds of
HTH<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:40.250> say<00:03:41.150> point<00:03:41.420> six<00:03:41.660> five<00:03:41.810> because<00:03:42.170> most

HTH I say point six five because most
common<00:03:42.950> HTH<00:03:43.580> is<00:03:43.790> 65%<00:03:44.620> that's<00:03:45.620> why<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:45.890> divided

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
common HTH is 65% that's why it divided

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.890 
common HTH is 65% that's why it divided
