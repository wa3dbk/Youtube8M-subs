actually<00:01:31.020> was<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.579> worse<00:01:32.850> for

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
actually was a little worse for

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.880 
actually was a little worse for
Minnesota<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.869> maybe<00:01:34.079> Romney<00:01:34.439> i<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.740> was

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
Minnesota that maybe Romney i think was

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.230 
Minnesota that maybe Romney i think was
for<00:01:35.159> massachusetts<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.759> i<00:01:35.820> look<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.090> their

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
for massachusetts and i look at their

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.390 
for massachusetts and i look at their
executive<00:01:36.659> experience<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.229> i<00:01:37.409> tend<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> think

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
executive experience and i tend to think

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.649 
executive experience and i tend to think
that<00:01:39.590> executives<00:01:40.590> tend<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> make<00:01:41.659> good

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that executives tend to make good

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.420 
that executives tend to make good
presidents<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:43.590> they've<00:01:43.770> had<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
presidents because they've had that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
presidents because they've had that
experience<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.360> pawlenty<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.200> romney

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
experience so pawlenty and romney

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.749 
experience so pawlenty and romney
because<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:47.009> did<00:01:47.159> okay<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.490> their

think you know unfortunately the system

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.280 
think you know unfortunately the system
that<00:05:25.920> we've<00:05:26.430> got<00:05:26.700> makes<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.840> harder<00:05:28.170> and

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
that we've got makes it harder and
