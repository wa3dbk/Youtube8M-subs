00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
your troops quite a bit I can see it

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.580 
your troops quite a bit I can see it
being<00:01:24.670> at<00:01:24.850> high<00:01:25.030> levels<00:01:25.390> extremely<00:01:26.170> potent

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
being at high levels extremely potent

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.620 
being at high levels extremely potent
especially<00:01:27.460> against<00:01:27.700> loons<00:01:27.939> or<00:01:28.150> dragons<00:01:28.570> that

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
especially against loons or dragons that

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.499 
especially against loons or dragons that
are<00:01:28.780> slow<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:30.400> will<00:01:30.700> be<00:01:30.820> making<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.270> base

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
are slow and I will be making a base

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.020 
are slow and I will be making a base
sometime<00:01:32.229> in<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.439> next<00:01:32.530> week<00:01:32.680> here<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.670> show

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
sometime in the next week here to show

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.539 
sometime in the next week here to show
how<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.659> use<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.500> properly<00:01:35.530> because<00:01:36.310> there's

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
how to use it properly because there's

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.800 
how to use it properly because there's
some<00:01:36.700> placement<00:01:37.150> of<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.330> that<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.479> don't<00:01:37.630> think

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
some placement of it that I don't think

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.179 
some placement of it that I don't think
people<00:01:37.930> are<00:01:38.080> placing<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.590> very<00:01:38.740> well<00:01:38.950> and

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
people are placing it very well and

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.980 
people are placing it very well and
there's<00:01:39.850> definitely<00:01:40.060> some<00:01:40.450> places<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.869> it

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
there's definitely some places that it

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.899 
there's definitely some places that it
should<00:01:41.170> be<00:01:41.290> placed<00:01:41.500> I<00:01:41.799> think<00:01:42.460> having<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.850> the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
should be placed I think having in the

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.999 
should be placed I think having in the
center<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.180> your<00:01:43.270> base<00:01:43.479> honestly<00:01:44.080> right<00:01:44.799> by

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
center of your base honestly right by

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.210 
center of your base honestly right by
your<00:01:45.189> inferno<00:01:45.610> towers<00:01:45.850> would<00:01:46.240> be<00:01:46.420> extremely

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
your inferno towers would be extremely

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.819 
your inferno towers would be extremely
advantageous<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:49.360> because<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:49.960> will<00:01:50.530> push

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
advantageous just because it will push

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.590 
advantageous just because it will push
them<00:01:51.040> back<00:01:51.189> and<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.640> will<00:01:51.729> also<00:01:51.939> keep<00:01:52.270> them<00:01:52.420> in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
them back and it will also keep them in

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.539 
them back and it will also keep them in
range<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:53.049> your<00:01:53.290> infernos<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.009> your<00:01:54.130> expose

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
range of your infernos and your expose

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.280 
range of your infernos and your expose
and<00:01:54.759> all<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:54.970> good<00:01:55.180> stuff<00:01:55.240> but<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.229> course

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
and all that good stuff but of course

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.889 
and all that good stuff but of course
choosing<00:01:56.950> what<00:01:57.130> direction<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.850> point<00:01:58.509> it<00:01:58.689> will

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
choosing what direction to point it will

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.469 
choosing what direction to point it will
be<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.290> hard<00:01:59.560> one<00:01:59.799> so<00:02:00.399> I'm<00:02:00.729> thinking<00:02:00.790> for<00:02:01.390> all

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
be the hard one so I'm thinking for all

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.960 
be the hard one so I'm thinking for all
those<00:02:01.570> teaser<00:02:01.930> basis<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.649> think<00:02:03.040> putting<00:02:03.729> it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
those teaser basis I think putting it

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.399 
those teaser basis I think putting it
facing<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.420> opposite<00:02:04.720> direction<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.170> tease

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
facing the opposite direction the tease

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.289 
facing the opposite direction the tease
might<00:02:05.829> be<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.100> best<00:02:06.220> way<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.430> go<00:02:06.670> just<00:02:07.240> a

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
might be the best way to go just a

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.369 
might be the best way to go just a
little<00:02:07.329> piece<00:02:07.600> of<00:02:07.630> advice<00:02:07.810> for<00:02:07.960> all<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.289> guys

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
little piece of advice for all you guys

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.469 
little piece of advice for all you guys
they<00:02:08.560> use<00:02:08.739> southern<00:02:09.429> or<00:02:09.640> northern<00:02:09.670> teasers

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
they use southern or northern teasers

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.449 
they use southern or northern teasers
give<00:02:11.409> it<00:02:11.499> a<00:02:11.529> shot<00:02:11.709> let<00:02:11.950> me<00:02:12.040> know<00:02:12.189> what<00:02:12.309> you

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
give it a shot let me know what you

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.309
