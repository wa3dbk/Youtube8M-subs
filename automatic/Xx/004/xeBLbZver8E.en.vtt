00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.570
 I asked my admin if I could do it 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.250
 He didn't give me that if I was able to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.640
 I could do and then I got started 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.829

 zero forum within the software 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.500
 well once we did this we could 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.210
 open minecraft we face all the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.659
 two more files 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.520
 read me is simply a file that 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.170
 teaches you how to install it in the non-case 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.400
 is not even covering this video 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.650
 you downloaded it directly 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.479
 closing the video instead updates 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.180
 shows everything I've brought 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.310
 in the first version of the lessor 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.259
 in fact, mirror this version 1.0 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 this all that changed the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.460
 skin of the villager the voice the skin of the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.439
 Steve's zombies and much more music 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.700
 and the credit and credit rates also changed 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.470
 and splash 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.180
 then there are the texts that you see when 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.049
 you killed the under dragon you come back 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.939
 back from the portal well once given 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.290
 all this we will find ourselves on now 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.240
 minecraft to show you the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.200
 updates I've taken away like this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.060
 well then 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.160
 after letting you see how it stalls 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.679
 you download the pec resource let's move to the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.240
 practical part of the practice to let you see 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.190
 a bit so I modified it 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.140
 so I changed the sun as you see 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.810
 made it round and made these little ones 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.880
 particles modified the moon when the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.680
 we'll see I changed the rain for 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.000
 make it more realistic as you see 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.910
 the water made it a little bit more 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.570
 transparent or modified some blocks 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.400
 here you see a little, not all of them 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.620
 almost all have been taken in hd and the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.510
 Most of the blocks as I 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.550
 already been opened because the speck was already 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.550
 released on the main combat for some the 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.350
 I knew already given the link where dpf sila 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.920
 to download it I was told I had 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.600
 copied but instead not because most 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.280
 part of the blocks gave surprised speck 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.840
 from faithfull also because I am not 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.580
 let it be a very good channel block 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.590
 in fact to him neither or modified some not 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.990
 all such as I have modified 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.490
 the songs as you see in this is the 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.170
 song he had also put 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.030
 now there are many others indeed 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.390
 these are some nations with 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.940
 modified type 11 contains one 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.470
 music of look 43 16 the yellow as well not 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.160
 I remember what the other CDs are 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.760
 It contains 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.660
 because there were 300 thousand and 200 thousand tigers e 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.760
 the other song I don't remember how 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.850
 titled and there are two CDs that don't 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.110
 I can make you feel that these are the two 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.610
 which are with copyright songs 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.010
 unfortunately you will not be able to hear 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.310
 videos that one will hang jordi e 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.380
 the other is the dance of the other witches 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.500
 to tell you then the project of the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.420
 resources that was born at the beginning of the main 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.400
 combat nod in the middle of the handle but the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.650
 revolution when we decided 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.360
 to open the main combat 3.0 that was 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.640
 at the beginning of construction 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.010
 if it does not give on a given ask if I could 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.110
 create these resources they gave me 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.640
 they said yes go ahead and then me 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.220
 I started creating it 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.220
