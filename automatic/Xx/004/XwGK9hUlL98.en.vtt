00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.170
 for manuel marquez you spoke of hablaste 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.020
 out of a forced withdrawal by these 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.590
 circumstances in which in which I've 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.480
 had a clear triumph not actually 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.940
 it's real this system wanted to retire 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.060
 with a defeat like this I think 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.820
 that the seeing this kind of thing is 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.219
 situation are discouraged are discouraged by 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.140
 complete see all the effort that one 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.510
 puts the training the eight years of 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.149
 career and with only 50 minutes they can 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.500
 leave everything down I need to practice with 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.780
 my family in this talk with me 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.710
 team to see what 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.210
 that comes and in the main one in this in 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.190
 those family situations the 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.110
 I think I can practice 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.370
 with my wife with my children and what 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.260
 they tell me is based on the decision 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.699
 I had told them 38 nothing to see and 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.659
 always when you prepare when 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.210
 train you are a person 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.039
 disciplined responsible you give it out 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.450
 over and I showed it today I try with 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.909
 what we did, I think the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.010
 preparation that we achieved was great 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.720
 It was good and that's why I feel happy 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.020
 he was very sad with what they are with what 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.180
 that they became very disappointed 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.250
 dismayed by what he went through and 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.500
 this makes great careers come back 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.790
 down I think I said that for 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.670
 win this fight we have to do the 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.369
 perfect or almost perfect things and so 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.710
 it was like that was we removed them from the angle and 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.570
 we said backwards side steps but 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 I think we did a great job we have 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.930
 a great condition a great strength 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.320
 because a lot of people thought I was going to 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.299
 knock out that because this in this weight does not 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.500
 I am so strong that he sees very badly with 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.320
 mayweather 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.330
 I showed it in the second round with the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.150
 first second connects you combinations 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.610
 down he was hurt in the sixth round 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.410
 He also hit a hook so several 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.790
 Perez where he also looked hurt and 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.890
 I think it connects several times and 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.050
 I filled several times as much 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.970
 know that they are taking it as the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.310
 better pound for pound and again I repeat 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.500
 it's not the best freedom for me it's not the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.130
 better pound for pound this and what 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.760
 I demonstrated and demonstrated and I think that 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.790
 this this what was done today was was was 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.220
 very very good I think happy with 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.470
 the preparation and happy for those 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.510
 doctors and the physical trainer look 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.610
 that in the lunch I say nacho 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.410
 we are winning do not trust 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.000
 and we keep pushing and we continue 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.080
 doing the peeling with intelligence in the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.810
 12 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.410
 I told nacho to go out and box because 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.510
 because you're winning the fight then I 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.910
 I knew I was aware what 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.290
 We did not even go out to box 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.210
 because there was an exchange of blows that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.280
 there is and shoot close well to close 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.350
 well this fight we will show that 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.290
 that we won it and we won it well and look 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.510
 what are you looking for today? 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.239
 what time do you stay forming 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.030
 I think it was the epic nights 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.610
 not only for you but for the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.860
 Mexican boxing that we have rarely 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.530
 lived in history yes I believe that I 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.579
 I remain as the great joy with 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.160
 life with the hobby the support to screams the 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.700
 chilito lindo in the tenth round 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.260
 if it was possible in the eleventh in the 12 yo 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.420
 I think I'll stay with that guy 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.160
 of things for me is a great 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.140
 satisfaction that people and I said 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.910
 whenever people play their role in 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.980
 we saw him tonight drives you or I think 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.950
 that I always respect the fans and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.890
 respect your comments respect everything 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.410
 they say I think they are not going to 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.780
 depend on whether it contains or not 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.550
 it depends on me it depends on my family and 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.640
 it depends on my kind of me from my team 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.790
 I work and I have some business 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.920
 like 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.470
 I am I am building a hotel 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.280
 I'm starting in that situation and I think 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.620
 that seeing seeing or seeing this as 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.599
 things are happening by dedicating myself to 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.080
 businessman look for more I like I like 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.580
 buy real estate for the sell 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.900
 and be moving the money because the 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.970
 money in the bank does not leave you anything 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.070
 then be turning 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.370
 what do you think of the judges with 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.410
 Manuel when when you get 116-102 in 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.410
 against are being 15 103 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.080
 one shame one shame one hundred 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.650
 I feel for them that they are dedicated to 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.660
 do your job that are always there 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.740
 they know in quotes they know how to make their 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.780
 work and we see that I do not think that the 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.420
 people saw it and do not know how to do their job 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.510
 they do not know how to qualify and I think I 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.860
 I asked the media hopefully 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.410
 that they qualify what the judges 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.630
 extending and again we go with a 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.910
 great surprise we are going with a great 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.650
 sadness and the one and dismayed by what 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.440
 happened in consummate by the decision of 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.650
 these guys before and Julian and my children 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.200
 they are not saying since retired are the 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.820
 which are the ones that I do not see them 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.770
 that I am in the house and it seems that 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.229
 I'm all because it came rest 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.379
 and helps them do the homework but between 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.849
 between there between that I help them but not me 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.759
 I think they are the ones who ask the least and 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.020
 I believe that my children will grow and 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.289
 somehow you have to pay attention 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.110
 also to them and I believe that the 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.080
 decision is going to be theirs and I think that 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:39.229
 I have a very smart son at 13 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:42.250
 years and came to say that the decision 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:46.430
 but the strongest decision is 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:49.850
 movement I believe that the joy to see 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.820
 which he did not win again see what 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:58.530
 They give a fight where there where there is no 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:02.760
 won and I think for me to accept myself 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.410
 I would think I would have done if 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.240
 they would have won me clear as I would 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.530
 I won him I would have accepted them 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.410
 media and tell the 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.050
 media do not win or do not win 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.320
 because accept him as a fighter as 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.270
 professional athlete who does not win and 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.770
 I think that never does it like I do 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:25.560
 I think that even if they do not say that people 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.600
 He knows it and people saw it and I tell you 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.000
 I think you have to think calmly 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.110
 what to see you have to rest you have to leave 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.600
 that the mind cools and that the 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.880
 adrenaline down because because the 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.020
 truth the truth I am very very 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.270
 disappointed 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.340
 I love this sport I do not want to but the 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.590
 truth the truth is sad and 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.570
 disappointed with what has happened and 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.200
 finally what can I tell the people 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.050
 from Mexico 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.200
 this day everything was turned all all mexico 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.870
 it was this 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.430
 Juan Manuel Marquez All Mexico was 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.960
 with you domenico I think you have been robbed 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.420
 what do you tell all of them that 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.240
 were you always aware of 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:05.270
 this fight and obviously they think that 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.460
 that Mexico and that you won to thank them 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.130
 in advance all the support that always 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.140
 have given and I believe that we 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.570
 we have done and we have been fighters 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.820
 rights and we have done our job 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.230
 Up in the ring they have not given me anything 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.910
 Many people do not know that they have not 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.210
 gifted nobody a big sacrifice me 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:26.090
 has cost and I think we suffer 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.130
 we suffer again we suffer again the 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.690
 decision of the judges but I think that 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.160
 thank you and very happy with that 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.170
