00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
power button at the top you have the 3.5

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.220 
power button at the top you have the 3.5
OD<00:04:10.590> shot<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.700> see<00:04:12.120> an<00:04:12.389> antenna<00:04:12.900> so

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
OD shot and I see an antenna so

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.500 
OD shot and I see an antenna so
basically<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.859> or<00:04:14.389> highest<00:04:17.000> magnitude<00:04:18.000> TV

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
basically this or highest magnitude TV

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.050 
basically this or highest magnitude TV
function<00:04:18.989> as<00:04:19.109> well<00:04:22.460> there's<00:04:23.460> nothing<00:04:23.910> at<00:04:24.030> the
