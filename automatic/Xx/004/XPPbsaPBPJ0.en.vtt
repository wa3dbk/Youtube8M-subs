00:04:49.660 --> 00:05:06.360 
behind what we're doing that increases
you<00:04:50.660> know<00:04:50.810> its<00:04:51.110> its<00:04:51.530> desirability

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.860 

some<00:05:07.370> days<00:05:07.670> when<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.150> was<00:05:08.360> doing<00:05:08.630> all<00:05:08.780> the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
some days when I was doing all the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.290 
some days when I was doing all the
research<00:05:09.020> for<00:05:09.260> this<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:09.860> felt<00:05:10.430> like<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.730> thousand

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
research for this I felt like a thousand

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.120 
research for this I felt like a thousand
years<00:05:11.540> was<00:05:11.750> just<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:12.080> click<00:05:12.320> of<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.530> finger<00:05:12.740> and

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
years was just a click of a finger and

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.580 
years was just a click of a finger and
actually<00:05:13.850> it<00:05:13.940> is<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.360> now<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.380> it

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
actually it is this now and and it

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.320 
actually it is this now and and it
starts<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:16.130> blow<00:05:16.280> your<00:05:16.460> mind<00:05:16.700> and<00:05:16.910> you<00:05:17.030> start

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
starts to blow your mind and you start

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.270 
starts to blow your mind and you start
to<00:05:17.540> see<00:05:18.230> that's<00:05:18.500> different<00:05:18.830> in<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.010> sky

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
to see that's different in the sky

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.740 
to see that's different in the sky
that's<00:05:19.520> different<00:05:19.820> because<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.420> think<00:05:20.660> the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
that's different because you think the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.540 
that's different because you think the
