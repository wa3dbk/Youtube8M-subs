00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
your own wine is take something called a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.750 
your own wine is take something called a
hydrometer<00:00:21.420> reading<00:00:22.340> hydrometer<00:00:23.340> measures

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
hydrometer reading hydrometer measures

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970 
hydrometer reading hydrometer measures
the<00:00:23.939> density<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.750> liquid<00:00:24.779> okay<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the density of a liquid okay so it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.920 
the density of a liquid okay so it
allows<00:00:26.609> us<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.029> know<00:00:27.150> what's<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.720> with

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
allows us to know what's going on with

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.830 
allows us to know what's going on with
the<00:00:28.050> fermentation<00:00:29.359> one<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> only<00:00:30.599> ways

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the fermentation one of the only ways

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.130 
the fermentation one of the only ways
that<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:32.430> experts<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.079> able

that we have as experts here to be able
to<00:00:34.290> help<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.739> troubleshoot<00:00:35.809> what's<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:37.050> on

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
to help you troubleshoot what's going on

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.560 
to help you troubleshoot what's going on
with<00:00:37.290> your<00:00:37.410> fermentation<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:39.300> being

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
with your fermentation so that being

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.000 
with your fermentation so that being
said<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:40.230> obvious<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.969> taking<00:00:41.969> accurate

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
said it's obvious that taking accurate

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.200 
said it's obvious that taking accurate
hydrometer<00:00:44.010> readings<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.760> important

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
hydrometer readings is really important

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
hydrometer readings is really important
so<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> tools<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.800> come<00:00:47.070> along<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so one of the tools it's come along in

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.450 
so one of the tools it's come along in
the<00:00:48.000> last<00:00:48.090> few<00:00:48.480> years<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:49.079> made<00:00:49.950> by<00:00:50.100> company

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the last few years is made by company

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
the last few years is made by company
called<00:00:50.670> firm<00:00:50.940> Tech<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.629> they<00:00:52.440> make<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> couple

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
called firm Tech and they make a couple

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
called firm Tech and they make a couple
of<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.309> really<00:00:53.760> nice<00:00:53.969> products<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.899> this

of really really nice products now this
one<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.649> think<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.940> slick<00:00:57.239> it's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
one I think it's really slick it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.110 
one I think it's really slick it's
called<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> thief<00:00:58.050> okay<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> firm

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
called the thief okay this is a firm

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.290 
called the thief okay this is a firm
tech<00:01:00.449> thief<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.829> guy<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> simple

tech thief what this guy is is a simple

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.160 
tech thief what this guy is is a simple
plastic<00:01:04.080> tube<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.850> valve<00:01:06.119> built-in<00:01:06.720> onto

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
plastic tube with a valve built-in onto

plastic tube with a valve built-in onto
the<00:01:07.260> end<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.280> valve<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.420> way

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the end of it so now this valve the way

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.080 
the end of it so now this valve the way
it<00:01:09.750> works<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.890> point<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.430> closed

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it works is at this point it's closed

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.490 
it works is at this point it's closed
and<00:01:12.619> at<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.770> point<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.189> open<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.290> what<00:01:16.290> how

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and at this point it's open so what how

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
and at this point it's open so what how
does<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.860> thing<00:01:16.920> work<00:01:17.130> well<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.939> do

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
does this thing work well what do you do

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.990 
does this thing work well what do you do
with<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.810> say<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.590> had<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.310> vessel<00:01:20.970> like

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
with this is say you had a vessel like

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.359 
with this is say you had a vessel like
this<00:01:21.210> full<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.020> liquid<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.950> wanted<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
this full of liquid that you wanted to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.480 
this full of liquid that you wanted to
take<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.869> density<00:01:24.869> reading<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.439> using<00:01:26.340> your

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
take a density reading on using your

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670 
take a density reading on using your
hydrometer<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> hydrometer<00:01:28.350> measures

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
hydrometer so the hydrometer measures

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.280 
hydrometer so the hydrometer measures
the<00:01:28.860> density<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> liquid<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> thief

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the density of liquid now the thief

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.440 
the density of liquid now the thief
which<00:01:31.650> costs<00:01:31.979> eight<00:01:32.189> dollars<00:01:32.670> by<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> way<00:01:33.180> if

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
which costs eight dollars by the way if

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
which costs eight dollars by the way if
you<00:01:34.200> wanted<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> hydrometer<00:01:35.369> reading

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
you wanted to get a hydrometer reading

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
you wanted to get a hydrometer reading
out<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.270> glass<00:01:36.570> container<00:01:37.049> well<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
out of this glass container well if I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.280 
out of this glass container well if I
drop<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.310> high<00:01:38.579> drama<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.810> mean

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
drop this high drama into it I mean

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
drop this high drama into it I mean
retrieving<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
retrieving it's going to be just this

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
retrieving it's going to be just this
side<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.869> impossible<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.130> how<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
side of impossible so this is how you

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.789 
side of impossible so this is how you
take<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> hydrometer<00:01:45.180> reading<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.470> would<00:01:46.619> make

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
take a hydrometer reading you would make

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
take a hydrometer reading you would make
sure<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.189> everything<00:01:47.579> sanitized<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.689> don't

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
sure that everything sanitized and don't

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
sure that everything sanitized and don't
have<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.590> hands<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.100> over<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.700> do

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
have your hands all over it like I do

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.240 
have your hands all over it like I do
here<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.170> simply<00:01:52.409> put<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
here but you would simply put the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.179 
here but you would simply put the
hydrometer<00:01:53.850> into<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> thief<00:01:54.840> let<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.860> slowly

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
hydrometer into the thief let it slowly

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.179 
hydrometer into the thief let it slowly
come<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.060> bottom<00:01:57.509> then<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.560> I'll<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.950> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
come to the bottom then what I'll do is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
come to the bottom then what I'll do is
immerse<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.850> into<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> liquid<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.079> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
immerse it into the liquid I just have a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
immerse it into the liquid I just have a
colored<00:02:01.619> liquid<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:02.939> what's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
colored liquid here so we can see what's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.510 
colored liquid here so we can see what's
going<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.049> shake<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.130> bit

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
going on and just shake it a little bit

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.670 
going on and just shake it a little bit
and<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.240> will<00:02:06.479> get<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.810> guy<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> fill<00:02:07.469> up

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and that will get this guy to fill up

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.889 
and that will get this guy to fill up
and<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> see<00:02:09.030> when<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> pull<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:09.840> of

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and if you see when I pull it out of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.949 
and if you see when I pull it out of
here<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:11.009> got<00:02:11.250> enough<00:02:11.610> liquid<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.599> here<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
here if I got enough liquid in here to

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.250 
here if I got enough liquid in here to
where

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
where

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.890 
where
the<00:02:13.470> actual<00:02:13.980> hydrometer<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.640> floating<00:02:15.239> then

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the actual hydrometer is floating then

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.690 
the actual hydrometer is floating then
you<00:02:16.049> can<00:02:16.230> read<00:02:16.500> your<00:02:16.709> density<00:02:16.980> right<00:02:17.489> off<00:02:17.670> of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
you can read your density right off of

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.360 
you can read your density right off of
the<00:02:18.390> line<00:02:18.629> where<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.930> meniscus<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.250> at

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
the line where the meniscus is here at

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.000
