00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 now 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.250
 and 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.370
 hello youtube friends then in this 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.970
 I bring you this time I bring you this 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.840
 video one more tutorial for how to install 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.090
 windows 7 and so have two systems 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.600
 operatives in our computer since 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.640
 I have installed windows 8 and for 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.390
 this is because we have to have created a 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.700
 second partition on the local disk 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.600
 and here below I'll get you some links 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.789
 If you do not know how to do it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.230
 to create a second appearance and have 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.230
 this little program called daemon 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.629
 tools that is where we are going to assemble 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.670
 our image that and well then for 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.160
 proceed here I already have my image made 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.610
 what 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.470
 this is the operating system and for that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.640
 we open the little program called time on 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.640
 tour as I will repeat it 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.250
 and for that then here we are going to give here h 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.909
 image we are going to give a click 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.920
 and we look for our image made 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.070
 I for example here and then I have it 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.610
 on the desk 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.610
 Y 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.140
 has the image added once and that 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.720
 let's give 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.630
 acn 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.979
 to duty 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.979
 and we are going to give here 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.530
 iso create this image and we have to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.770
 give here in the world 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.580
 not here not sorry, we have to give 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.480
 this 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.480
 this button 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.260
 and let's give an ok 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.659
 and here as you see, the unit appears 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.330
 that has already been mounted and does not recognize it 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.330
 as a disk and we are going to execute 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.440
 As you can see, the program of 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.110
 installation of windows 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.830
 let's continue with this part I'm going to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.830
 give install now 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.840
 and as you see, the program is being 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.840
 running 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.319
 that we have to have it in 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.900
 our computer if it is an import 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.670
 we have to have it connected since a 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.590
 Sometimes it's when we have low battery 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.500
 threw an error 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.200
 for the same reason because he needs 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.750
 it shows us that it needs a lot of battery and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.750
 it does not let us do the installation 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.939
 well it did not come out anymore it did not come out of this and 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.359
 we're going to have to give the second 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.359
 option 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.970
 but if he gave us this error then 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.430
 logically we are going to 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.430
 to install the other option that appeared 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.240
 we are going to install this and here we are 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.240
 leave the license terms 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:41.910
 we accept and we give next 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.860
 here we go install custom 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.350
 and then here as you see it shows us 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.000
 where we want to logically install 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.010
 I already made my partition so I'm going to 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.629
 choose this I will give in next 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.790
 and then here you start to install 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.840
 as you see friends this is very easy to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.810
 do 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.810
 they do not need to create a virtual machine 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.850
 this is very easy and then they 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.850
 I recommend it to you 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.700
 ah 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.120
 Well then, friends , we are going with the 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:27.740
 second part of the video and then here as 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.970
 come and I have installed this windows 7 in 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.710
 this part of here I already have my 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.070
 controllers 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.040
 the drivers that would be later for 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.700
 to check this saying this here 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.650
 I have the disk here is where is the 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.220
 second partition and this is where it is 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.060
 windows 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.060
 8.1 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:55.030
 As you can see, I already have both systems 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:59.200
 start when I turn on my laptop 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:03.210
 He asks me to tell me what system I want 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.840
 start in windows 7 or windows 8.1 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.270
