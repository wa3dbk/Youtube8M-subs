00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.000
The Whispering Palms

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.667
By Deepa Gangwani

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:18.167
and Tina Suchanek

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:21.083
Mori was a little girl

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:24.417
with big brown eyes.

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:26.333
She lived with her parents

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.417
in a beautiful

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:29.167
coconut grove,

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:36.417
next to a small blue lake.

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:37.750
Every morning,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.500
she balanced a big

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.500
empty basket on her head

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.917
as she walked down to the lake.

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:47.417
Her mother followed

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:49.250
with the laundry

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.833
and her father brought

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:55.333
the big fishing net.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.250
Her mother washed the clothes

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.833
on a stone next to the lake,

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:04.250
while her father went fishing.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.000
He dragged the net

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.750
ashore,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.333
and they collected the fish

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.250
and they collected the fish

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.417
in a big basket.

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:15.417
Sometimes

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:18.083
a turtle got stuck in the net,

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:19.333
but Mori always hurried

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.750
but Mori always hurried

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.250
to the rescue.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
One sunny morning

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.833
while fishing with her father,

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.250
while fishing with her father,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.000
Mori said:

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.833
"If we catch so many fish,

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:41.083
one day there won't be any left!"

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:42.500
Her mother laughed

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.583
and sent her off to school.

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:52.000
Under the shade of the trees,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.667
Mori's mother

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:57.833
fell into an uneasy sleep.

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.250
She dreamt of a lake

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.167
with no fish,

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:05.333
while the wind

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:10.167
in the palm leaves whispered:

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:12.750
"The waters

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.583
and the land

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.417
have always taken

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:20.833
care of your family,

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:22.750
so you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.333
have to take care of them

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:31.583
in return."

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:33.083
She awoke

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:35.667
with tears in her eyes,

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:37.167
for she didn't know how to

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:39.167
bring up Mori

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:44.167
without selling enough fish.

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:46.583
All afternoon she sat,

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.667
weaving coconut mats

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:50.500
and thinking

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.000
about her dream.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.667
That night

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:56.333
Mori heard her parents

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:59.167
whisper

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:00.833
as the oil lamp burned deep

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:06.500
into the night.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.167
The next morning,

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:10.500
her father gave her

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.833
a smaller basket.

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.167
"How can we carry all the fish

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:18.583
in this little basket?"

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:22.833
Mori asked.

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:23.917
"We will only take

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:25.083
as many fish

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:28.667
as will fit inside this basket,"

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.917
he replied.

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:35.750
Mori was puzzled.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.083
When she came back from school,

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.250
she was happy

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.000
to find her mother making soap

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.167
and oil

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:47.083
from the coconuts.

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:49.333
Mori swiftly climbed up a tree

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:54.000
to get more coconuts,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.583
but her mother cautioned:

00:03:57.583 --> 00:04:00.583
"Don't pluck them;

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:02.250
we must only use

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.167
what the tree gives us."

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:09.417
Her father added:

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:10.500
"We have taken

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.750
only fallen coconuts

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.917
for these things.

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:18.083
Look,

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:19.917
we've even made this soap

00:04:19.917 --> 00:04:24.417
with a jasmine flower inside!"

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:26.500
From that day on,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.667
the family made brooms from

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.833
the palm leaves

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:32.000
and wove mats

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.333
from coconut fiber.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:37.167
They took soap,

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:39.417
oil and only a

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:40.833
small number of fish

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:44.833
to the market.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.667
When Mori grew older,

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:50.417
she loved to carve tiny turtles

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:53.417
out of coconut shells

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:57.083
and always

00:04:57.083 --> 00:04:59.667
wore one around her neck.
