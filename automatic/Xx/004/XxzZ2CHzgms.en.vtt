00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Well, it's him everyone his 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.190
 pawns in 33 today we end up 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.630
 for a small video on request league 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:14.700
 for how to have the secret vehicle 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.730
 so the vehicle sweet thoune who is I 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.890
 think the vehicle of the game that is 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 really not bad he is big so of 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.710
 funds it's a lot of vehicles with 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.810
 especially with what is in front of the hall 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.260
 is good his charge well it's paul 6 may 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.019
 you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.820
 it looks like his room and smashes place 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 we even think he's a little bit more 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.559
 resistant 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 so that's it when you go 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 unlock her the vehicle follows thoune 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.239
 you also unlocked the wheels 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.340
 switch or not they are there we will 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.379
 quickly seek them attention they are 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.589
 they are the continuation ' thoune 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.410
 that's like these more 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:57.909
 the clan the antenna sweet thoune which alas 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.949
 pretty ugly but it's not very serious 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.559
 so here is so to unlock suite or 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.180
 no i show you with all the stuff 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.490
 as we can 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.810
 except you see there drag the room 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.030
 is called sweet soul but that's the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.289
 trailing mouth by default if there is this 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.270
 pity but we can not be an antenna 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:19.369
 nor something else just change 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.880
 the color and m a chassis a wheel and 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.009
 here and a trail of course so 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.179
 how to have it is very simple but 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.750
 very long so to see it will require 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:35.179
 win once with every vehicle that 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.069
 so we offer you once a flash 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.720
 black read once shine black out a 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.179
 times to glide even with the beautiful glide 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.390
 of once with the high all the time 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:48.759
 with the sea ​​then with the obtent of 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.350
 paladin voice of ogre venom and xd city 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.399
 so here is so after unlocking 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.860
 after winning with all his 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.069
 racing with all these cars sorry 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.080
 and well you're going to have accused at the 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.569
 next 'turn so you do not need a 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.410
 particular level you just need 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.739
 all other vehicles 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.720
 except for this one so here it is 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.790
 frankly it's still quite long 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.170
 but I gave you a technique if that 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.739
 or soul to do online because the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.060
 people you can fall on allies 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.269
 rotten or as ultra strong so you 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.739
 go go xzibit to sion to you 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.930
 choose your your stadium arenas i 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.450
 do you want to say it's comfortable for example 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.250
 you make team size 1 vs 1 or 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.390
 2 as you want and there you go 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.030
 put no boots 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
 so basically you would not have a vote 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.269
 you are going to throw and red stone you 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.739
 will be all alone on the ground and you 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.840
 score about five times 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.670
 you wait until the five minutes not 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.200
 like that it's me times for an activist 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.349
 peace like that you win a little 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.569
 dissipated and that's so I see you I 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.370
 am the n 21 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.850
 so I do not use these techniques 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.860
 to go up but xp after if you want 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.030
 have fun if you want to have fun at 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.830
 do that you can but I find 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.520
 it's not very fun I prefer to play 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.620
 against guys online that towards these 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.830
 two techniques play solo just for 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.770
 ride lgv she heats beat I 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.840
 do not find it very funny so I think 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.180
 do you leave it to the game that I have 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.650
 done before unblocking the suite 'thoune 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.650
 so here it was pyromaniac of 33 hi
