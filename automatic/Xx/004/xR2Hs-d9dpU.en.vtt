00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.710
 do not 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 one 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.770
 and we are in a new chapter of the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.320
 series of confrontations and this time we are going to 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.930
 face a cougar 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.930
 between 15 to 1 stuart 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.450
 we are going to face in offensive like 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.800
 forever 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.989
 the two are launched 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.250
 and improvements of any kind of ornament or 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.480
 nothing like that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.480
 your corn for first 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.180
 it seems that the m 5 to 1 against 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.920
 the beige the cougar 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.510
 and that it has taken almost half of the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.380
 life but has emerged victorious without 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.510
 problems 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.320
 maybe we will face it without fog 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.320
 of harmless war in march 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.920
 As you can see, the result is very, very 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 similar to life I think it is 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.340
 exactly the same as before 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.090
 well this time we are going to face 2 cougars 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.210
 against 2 m 5 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.630
 you have to remember that a puma is 320 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.219
 cash points and 70 gasoline 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.950
 while the m 5 are 240 of cash 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:53.770
 and 70 gasoline are we talking about now 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:57.100
 same 2 and 2 would be 480 and 140 640 of 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.240
 cash points and 140 gasoline what 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.990
 let's face with fog of war 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.990
 but not running 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.859
 has very little to do the mc5 against 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.859
 the foam 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.629
 to which as soon as there is smoke, a 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.439
 little crazy when advancing the offensive and 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.439
 the wall and you do not see 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.980
 and it seems that he has realized is that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.290
 the other is there and they finish with this 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.860
 to finish we will face 5 cougars 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.470
 against 5 m 5 to 1 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.370
 and they start up 5 against 5 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.370
 and see what comes out of here 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.170
 will get the mc5 load at least one 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170
 Cougar 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.680
 in the obtained remain 3 054 cougars 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.390
 205 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.860
 true that they are on offense we are not 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.420
 trying nothing 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.550
 once in five months with day out there 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.550
 you do not see the cougars with the smoke 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.370
 and that I four live cougars 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.170
 and never without code 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.430
 the kids if you liked to go out 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.129
 there are favorites leave your comments 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.650
 what do you think if you think they are 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.450
 rivals the mc5 if the mc5 are more for 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.610
 more infantry for support tanks 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.330
 comment what you want we see the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.330
 next until after 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.370
 The prisoners 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.370
 saying
