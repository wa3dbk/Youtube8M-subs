all<00:00:01.740> right<00:00:02.240> let's<00:00:03.240> take<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.480> look<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:04.049> my<00:00:04.259> latest

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
all right let's take a look of my latest

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.589 
all right let's take a look of my latest
creation<00:00:05.430> yeah<00:00:06.379> we<00:00:07.379> did<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> EDT<00:00:08.599> sensor

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
creation yeah we did a EDT sensor

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.740 
creation yeah we did a EDT sensor
install<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.230> Hunt's<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:10.980> car<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:14.719> what<00:00:15.719> I

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
install on Hunt's this car and what I

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.710 
install on Hunt's this car and what I
did<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:18.109> plugged<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.789> as<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.510> see

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
did is I plugged it in as you can see

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.589 
did is I plugged it in as you can see
here<00:00:25.220> basically<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> middle<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
here basically in the middle of the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
here basically in the middle of the
collector<00:00:28.880> chose<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> run<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:31.050> drill<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
collector chose not to run to drill the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.530 
collector chose not to run to drill the
runner<00:00:33.170> didn't<00:00:34.170> want<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.559> make<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.540> manifold

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
runner didn't want to make the manifold

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.880 
runner didn't want to make the manifold
the<00:00:36.780> more<00:00:36.989> prone<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> cracking<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.260> did<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the more prone to cracking so I did it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.350 
the more prone to cracking so I did it
the<00:00:40.980> easy<00:00:41.160> way<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.730> tapped<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.390> riddle<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
the easy way and tapped in riddle the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.250 
the easy way and tapped in riddle the
external<00:00:45.360> wastegate<00:00:45.570> block<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.710> plate<00:00:48.230> then<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
external wastegate block of plate then I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.290 
external wastegate block of plate then I
ran<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.160> cable<00:00:50.539> as<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:52.070> over<00:00:53.070> here

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
ran the cable as you can see over here

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.819 
ran the cable as you can see over here
to<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> amplifier<00:00:55.879> sits<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.530> don't<00:00:58.530> mind

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to the amplifier sits here don't mind

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.000 
to the amplifier sits here don't mind
the<00:00:59.070> power<00:00:59.910> source<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.590> testing

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the power source it's just for testing

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
the power source it's just for testing
purposes<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:04.140> run<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
purposes but as we gonna run it on a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.030 
purposes but as we gonna run it on a
switch<00:01:04.860> 12<00:01:05.400> volt<00:01:07.909> source<00:01:08.909> later<00:01:09.770> this<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.830> also

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
switch 12 volt source later this is also

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.200 
switch 12 volt source later this is also
testing<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.560> yeah

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
testing and yeah

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.149 
testing and yeah
run<00:01:15.210> wires<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> amplifier<00:01:18.420> here

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
run wires we have the amplifier here

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.179 
run wires we have the amplifier here
that<00:01:21.619> translates<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.830> signal<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:25.189> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that translates the signal from the the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.289 
that translates the signal from the the
the<00:01:26.549> EDT<00:01:26.880> sensor<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.840> something<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.299> humans

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the EDT sensor to something that humans

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.899 
the EDT sensor to something that humans
can<00:01:30.509> read<00:01:30.740> or<00:01:31.740> computers<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> read<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:34.909> from

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
can read or computers can read then from

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.300 
can read or computers can read then from
the<00:01:36.119> amplifier<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.960> ran<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:39.710> plug<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the amplifier I ran it and plug it in to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
the amplifier I ran it and plug it in to
the<00:01:41.460> rare<00:01:41.790> Oh<00:01:42.119> two<00:01:42.750> sensor<00:01:43.939> connector<00:01:45.290> what

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the rare Oh two sensor connector what

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.859 
the rare Oh two sensor connector what
I've<00:01:46.409> done<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.869> have

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I've done here is I have I have

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.920 
I've done here is I have I have
completely<00:01:49.439> coded<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.520> rear<00:01:50.729> o2<00:01:51.119> sensor

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
completely coded out the rear o2 sensor

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.649 
completely coded out the rear o2 sensor
functions<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.869> binary<00:01:54.869> code<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:56.280> means

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
functions in the binary code that means

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.170 
functions in the binary code that means
you<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.810> basically<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.700> run<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> car

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
you can basically you can run the car

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.499 
you can basically you can run the car
without<00:02:00.329> any<00:02:00.840> o2<00:02:01.590> sensor<00:02:02.159> at<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:03.149> was<00:02:03.329> it

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
without any o2 sensor at all it was it

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.039 
without any o2 sensor at all it was it
won't<00:02:03.689> matter

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
won't matter

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.590 
won't matter
the<00:02:04.649> car<00:02:04.860> will<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.909> everything's<00:02:06.360> just

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the car will think everything's just

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.260 
the car will think everything's just
fine<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.469> nest<00:02:07.649> checks<00:02:07.979> out

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
fine where the nest checks out

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.350 
fine where the nest checks out
everything<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.390> cool<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.970> what<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.090> is

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
everything is cool and what I do is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.720 
everything is cool and what I do is
use<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.720> input<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.590> log<00:02:17.310> additional<00:02:18.310> data

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
use that input to log additional data

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.120 
use that input to log additional data
like<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.950> egt<00:02:21.600> or<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.990> can<00:02:23.350> log<00:02:23.560> basically

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
like this egt or you can log basically

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.130 
like this egt or you can log basically
anything<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.550> anything<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.150> want<00:02:25.360> as<00:02:25.750> long

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
anything you anything you want as long

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.700 
anything you anything you want as long
as<00:02:26.380> it's<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:27.360> zero<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.660> five<00:02:28.870> volt<00:02:29.200> line<00:02:29.680> error

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
as it's a zero to five volt line error

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.790 
as it's a zero to five volt line error
signal<00:02:32.710> you<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.280> load<00:02:33.610> fuel<00:02:33.970> pressure<00:02:34.800> you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
signal you can load fuel pressure you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.200 
signal you can load fuel pressure you
can<00:02:35.980> log<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.860> take<00:02:39.160> manifold<00:02:39.670> pressure<00:02:39.940> as

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
can log in take manifold pressure as

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.500 
can log in take manifold pressure as
I've<00:02:40.390> recently<00:02:40.660> done<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.410> have<00:02:42.370> actually<00:02:42.970> that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
I've recently done I have actually that

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.960 
I've recently done I have actually that
one<00:02:43.780> plug-in<00:02:44.230> right<00:02:44.440> here<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.860> can<00:02:48.040> log<00:02:48.280> your

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.670 

yeah<00:02:51.970> basically<00:02:52.510> anything<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.110> want<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.500> long

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
yeah basically anything you want as long

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.949 
yeah basically anything you want as long
as<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:53.980> can<00:02:54.220> output<00:02:54.870> line<00:02:55.870> error<00:02:56.880> signal

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
as you can output line error signal

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.010 
as you can output line error signal
serve<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.170> five<00:02:59.410> volts<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:01.110> every<00:03:02.110> tune<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.650> do

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
serve the five volts and every tune I do

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.570 
serve the five volts and every tune I do
will<00:03:05.020> have<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.740> function<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.200> hacks

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
will have the function in it the hacks

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.010 
will have the function in it the hacks
to<00:03:09.580> be<00:03:09.700> able<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:10.200> log<00:03:11.370> anything<00:03:12.780> through<00:03:13.780> the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
to be able to log anything through the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.550 
to be able to log anything through the
