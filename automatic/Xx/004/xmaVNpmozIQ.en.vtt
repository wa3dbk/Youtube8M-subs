00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:10.190
 hello girls in today's video I bring you 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:13.129
 a special for the hair on the tones 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.650
 or gadgets that we can use to 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.860
 make a bun the truth that I've 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.810
 found several things in the channel and I 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.060
 he liked in general and good that there 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.100
 shared with us and simply 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.000
 can explain what 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.700
 the first thing we need 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.650
 and make a tail 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.600
 and that depending on the type d 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.660
 demon we want we will use 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.340
 one or another thing then 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.079
 for those that are left there is one more bow 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.999
 perfect 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.039
 why go to the best if you have to 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:52.059
 have formal or more arranged signatures 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.620
 I recommend the tone what is 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.719
 know as donuts that you can also 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.579
 make you are attentive because 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.950
 I'm going to put a video on how 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.830
 make 10 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.010
 we just passed the pigtail this already 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:10.290
 I said a previous video 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.850
 what we need to do is distribute 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.850
 with the help of another coletero 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 we distribute it around the whole 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 donut and we passed the rubber so that already 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.010
 we have our molding done there 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.490
 different thread sizes 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.200
 that you can find both on the internet 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.790
 as in some stores like for example 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.280
 English and I think that even in 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.080
 mercadona 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.659
 the rest of the hair that we do this is the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.560
 advantage that this kind of lady has 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.460
 Lent or 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.460
 pass around 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.450
 As you can see, it was a very nice bun 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.680
 typical bun that takes the hostesses from 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.070
 flight and we secured it with a fork 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.070
 the little bank 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.960
 and that's what we have 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 we already have the bun made 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.909
 I'll put it more or less with a 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.810
 little bit of lacquer and I tell you if there is any 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.810
 more special occasion 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.019
 the next within this same year 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.010
 one of the advantages I was going to comment 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.930
 is that it allows us to play a little with the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.239
 bow and then in those that you have 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.930
 the little hair a little longer as in my 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.310
 case 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.190
 we can make a star 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.989
 an ode to the vain truths that you want 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.180
 in this case what they do with the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.769
 two locks for you to see 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.769
 valencia the braids 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.460
 and this is what we are going to 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.260
 pass around the bun to give it a 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.260
 very nice touch 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.390
 and also forward of this even in 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.600
 a wedding is great 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.760
 dv 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.790
 but you already know that you have the video for 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.460
 make a perfect pigtail there you will see 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.980
 how to leave the perfect hair for 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.790
 perform this module and now we are going to 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.790
 put this iron 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.280
 around many years then what 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.620
 is going to see around 2 is 30 that gives 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.930
 spin on a fork and that's it though 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.480
 If I tell you that I like the tone more 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.640
 big 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.299
 for these annoys so much and he with a 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.659
 tiny 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:51.049
 I usually leave it for one more wasteland 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.049
 low 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:03.400
 our next contraption 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.400
 now how to make the lowest ponytail 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.130
 good in this case 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.840
 this piece of plastic that I also like 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.459
 You see, they have teeth 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.430
 sterilize I liked it very much 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.870
 personally but of an advantage to 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.720
 a more informal bun is very cool 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.330
 then if you have the most hair 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.520
 right the Basques fear the works the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.960
 that you have it more scaled has 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.570
 cost more work but it will be 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.080
 also more disheveled there is way in 12 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:46.110
 we introduce the hair inside him 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:50.450
 puppy and we lower it to the tip 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.289
 with the tines up and here 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.540
 simply 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.280
 we take the tips 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.280
 and we go rolling 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.870
 in the hair 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.910
 and when we have it completely 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.390
 rolled the ends we have it 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.390
 link 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.600
 then as you can see there is one more muffin 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.600
 informal 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.590
 to which of course you can put a 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.920
 pin a bow if you want you can put 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.500
 some complement to make it more 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.870
 funny is very fast to use e 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.300
 even almost almost more than the other but 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.110
 I already tell you that the result is a bit 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.110
 more disheveled 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.550
 and therefore not so ideal for a 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.620
 special occasion we have this here 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.310
 like foam that the truth is that very 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.310
 similar previous 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.500
 another slit where to introduce the hair 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.070
 and it's doing me a little on the wall 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.070
 that you see it better 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.009
 and exactly the same procedure 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:24.619
 I introduce the hair 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.619
 and I'm turning 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.650
 around the foam 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.900
 in this if they are taking the hair that 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.880
 have and loose when you have draft 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.380
 is a little better than the previous one and 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.810
 the truth is that it is very easy because 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.360
 we just have to close this that by 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:48.810
 Inside leads like a wire 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.460
 and all we do is close it and 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.460
 then with some hairpin 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:04.910
 we make sure and we have another good forest 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.969
 As the 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:12.680
 There are several options 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:14.990
 they are all very cheap and good 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.610
 you have a link below to find out if 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.720
 you want to buy on the internet although many 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.509
 stores you are going to find 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.820
 I preferred to prefer, I keep saying it 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:24.800
 I found the bow very simple around 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.500
 it is much more beautiful but for 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.060
 those that you like to try and make a 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.500
 bun a little more informal then you have 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.930
 to see these two options that remain 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.729
 very well the girls are attentive if 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.070
 you want to know also how to do 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:40.840
 our own donut and see you the 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.840
 next a little kiss until later
