00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
think they're checkpoints as such if you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
think they're checkpoints as such if you
die<00:01:19.950> you'll<00:01:20.490> restart<00:01:20.909> from<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> those

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
die you'll restart from one of those

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.230 
die you'll restart from one of those

savepoints<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.360> would<00:01:24.510> imagine<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> same

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
savepoints I would imagine do the same

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.429 
savepoints I would imagine do the same
thing

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
thing

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.880 
thing
if<00:01:27.799> they<00:01:27.979> don't<00:01:28.189> then<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:28.759> just<00:01:29.179> sucks<00:01:29.890> these

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890

are<00:01:31.100> slightly<00:01:31.280> different<00:01:31.490> than<00:01:31.880> normal<00:01:31.999> ones

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
are slightly different than normal ones

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.929 
are slightly different than normal ones
as<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.990> vines<00:01:33.289> make<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.799> slip<00:01:34.159> if<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:34.729> don't

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939
