and coconut oil now let's get started

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.830 
and coconut oil now let's get started
with<00:00:43.920> boiling<00:00:44.340> our<00:00:44.640> water<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.360> want<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.660> boil

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
with boiling our water you want to boil

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
with boiling our water you want to boil
your<00:00:46.050> water<00:00:46.110> first<00:00:46.649> before<00:00:47.129> adding<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.579> flag

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
your water first before adding your flag

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479 
your water first before adding your flag
seeds<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.200> will<00:00:49.350> help<00:00:49.590> quicken<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
seeds because this will help quicken the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.729 
seeds because this will help quicken the
process<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.750> place<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.199> flax<00:00:52.440> seeds

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
process when you place the flax seeds

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.340 
process when you place the flax seeds
already<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.550> boiling<00:00:54.000> water<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.600> releases<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
already in boiling water it releases the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:07.930 
already in boiling water it releases the
gel<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> flax<00:00:56.309> seeds<00:00:56.550> even<00:00:56.879> quicker

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.780 

once<00:01:08.690> you<00:01:08.840> see<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.290> water<00:01:09.530> turning<00:01:09.890> slimy<00:01:10.400> or

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
once you see the water turning slimy or

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.270 
once you see the water turning slimy or
with<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.090> whitish<00:01:11.630> film<00:01:12.020> on<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.380> top<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:13.070> want

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
with a whitish film on the top you want

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.520 
with a whitish film on the top you want
to<00:01:13.400> turn<00:01:13.550> your<00:01:13.730> water<00:01:13.910> off<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:15.080> will<00:01:15.380> help

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
to turn your water off this will help

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.010 
to turn your water off this will help
you<00:01:15.770> be<00:01:16.370> able<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.640> remove<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.180> gel<00:01:17.480> from<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
you be able to remove the gel from the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.640 
you be able to remove the gel from the
flag<00:01:18.230> seeds<00:01:18.590> even<00:01:19.070> quicker<00:01:20.380> so<00:01:21.380> when<00:01:21.530> you

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
flag seeds even quicker so when you

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.230 
flag seeds even quicker so when you
strain<00:01:22.040> your<00:01:22.070> product<00:01:22.700> you'll<00:01:22.910> notice<00:01:23.210> that

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
strain your product you'll notice that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.470 
strain your product you'll notice that
the<00:01:23.930> flaxseed<00:01:24.440> gel<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:25.160> kind<00:01:25.760> of<00:01:25.850> watering<00:01:26.240> and

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
the flaxseed gel is kind of watering and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.880 
the flaxseed gel is kind of watering and
that's<00:01:26.720> okay<00:01:27.080> because<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:27.680> going<00:01:27.830> to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
that's okay because it's going to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.950 
that's okay because it's going to
thicken<00:01:28.130> up<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.000> don't<00:01:29.120> worry<00:01:29.330> about<00:01:29.510> that

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
thicken up so don't worry about that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.930 
thicken up so don't worry about that
especially<00:01:30.470> after<00:01:31.160> we<00:01:31.370> add<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.670> shea<00:01:31.910> butter

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
especially after we add the shea butter

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:42.940 
especially after we add the shea butter
it'll<00:01:32.480> thicken<00:01:32.720> even<00:01:33.110> more<00:01:40.930> so<00:01:41.930> I<00:01:41.960> use<00:01:42.500> the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
it'll thicken even more so I use the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.600 
it'll thicken even more so I use the
press<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.610> push<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.360> squish<00:01:44.960> my<00:01:45.620> method<00:01:46.340> to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
press and push and squish my method to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.930 
press and push and squish my method to
get<00:01:46.730> my<00:01:46.850> gel<00:01:47.120> from<00:01:47.270> around<00:01:47.600> my<00:01:47.780> flag<00:01:48.110> seeds<00:01:48.440> I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
get my gel from around my flag seeds I

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.990 
get my gel from around my flag seeds I
know<00:01:49.940> people<00:01:50.420> use<00:01:50.720> stocking<00:01:51.470> hose<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:52.130> cheese

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
know people use stocking hose and cheese

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.360 
know people use stocking hose and cheese
cloth<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.750> all<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.020> well<00:01:54.530> I've<00:01:54.860> tried

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
cloth and all of that well I've tried

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.280 
cloth and all of that well I've tried
all<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.640> those<00:01:55.910> and<00:01:56.300> all<00:01:56.479> I've<00:01:56.660> done<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:56.870> burned

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
all of those and all I've done is burned

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.500 
all of those and all I've done is burned
myself<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.100> I<00:01:58.370> don't<00:01:58.580> like<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.940> so

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
myself and I don't like that so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.530 
myself and I don't like that so
therefore<00:01:59.750> this<00:02:00.560> is<00:02:00.770> easier<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.490> me<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.880> if<00:02:02.420> I

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
therefore this is easier for me and if I

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.969 
therefore this is easier for me and if I
want<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.780> get<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:02.960> rest<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.440> gel<00:02:03.650> off<00:02:03.800> I

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
want to get the rest of the gel off I

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.469 
want to get the rest of the gel off I
can<00:02:04.160> just<00:02:04.310> boil<00:02:04.640> them<00:02:04.790> again<00:02:05.030> in<00:02:05.150> some<00:02:05.330> more

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
can just boil them again in some more

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.010 
can just boil them again in some more
water<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.490> press<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:10.850> mash<00:02:11.420> until<00:02:11.900> you

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
water so just press it mash until you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.860 
water so just press it mash until you

that's<00:03:29.629> why<00:03:29.840> I'm<00:03:29.959> adding<00:03:30.349> in<00:03:30.500> sodium<00:03:31.220> benzoate

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
that's why I'm adding in sodium benzoate

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.170 
that's why I'm adding in sodium benzoate
sodium<00:03:32.599> benzoate<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:34.129> good<00:03:34.549> preservative

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
sodium benzoate is a good preservative

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.809 
sodium benzoate is a good preservative
because<00:03:35.599> it's<00:03:35.959> low<00:03:36.830> toxicity<00:03:37.340> and

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
because it's low toxicity and

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:46.869 
because it's low toxicity and
non-carcinogenic<00:03:45.040> when<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.069> make<00:03:46.340> products<00:03:46.730> I
