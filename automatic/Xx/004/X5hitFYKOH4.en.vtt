impressed with the detail at first when

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.990 
impressed with the detail at first when
they<00:00:23.070> showed<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.800> packaging<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> figures

and they weren't dating it too good out
I<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.760> hoping<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.359> uh<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:32.550> know<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.850> wasn't

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
I was hoping that uh you know it wasn't

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.720

the<00:00:33.360> final<00:00:33.660> product<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.380> good<00:00:35.280> thing<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.489> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the final product and good thing that it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.080 
the final product and good thing that it
wasn't<00:00:36.030> because<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.860> final<00:00:37.860> product<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.370> right

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
wasn't because a final product is right

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.660 
wasn't because a final product is right
