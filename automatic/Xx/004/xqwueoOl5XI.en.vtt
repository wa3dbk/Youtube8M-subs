that is located on the bottom of the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.420 
that is located on the bottom of the
camera<00:00:39.090> you're<00:00:39.360> gonna<00:00:39.480> push<00:00:40.280> towards<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
camera you're gonna push towards the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.270 
camera you're gonna push towards the
front<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.200> it's<00:00:43.200> spring-loaded<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.980> flips

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
front and it's spring-loaded so it flips

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.639 
front and it's spring-loaded so it flips
right<00:00:44.370> open<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.320> now<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.590> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
right open like that now I'm going to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.950 
right open like that now I'm going to
insert<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> lithium<00:00:47.520> battery<00:00:47.690> I'm<00:00:48.690> gonna

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
insert the lithium battery I'm gonna

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.500 
insert the lithium battery I'm gonna
watch<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.800> orange<00:00:50.430> stripe<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> it's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
watch for this orange stripe and it's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
watch for this orange stripe and it's
going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> match<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.379> orange<00:00:52.770> tab<00:00:53.100> that's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
going to match the orange tab that's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.950 
going to match the orange tab that's
probably<00:00:53.850> where<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.570> also<00:00:54.719> want

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
probably where to do it you also want

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.650 
probably where to do it you also want
the<00:00:54.989> contacts<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.879> towards<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> camera

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the contacts to be in towards the camera

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
the contacts to be in towards the camera
so<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.309> away<00:00:59.550> from<00:00:59.820> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so if I have it this way away from the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.779 
so if I have it this way away from the
tab<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> incorrectly<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.520> make<00:01:02.640> sure

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
tab I have it incorrectly so make sure

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.189 
tab I have it incorrectly so make sure
that's<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:03.629> way<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.899> I'm

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that's going in the right way so I'm

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.160 
that's going in the right way so I'm
going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> slide<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.750> clips<00:01:06.930> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
going to slide it in and it clips in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
going to slide it in and it clips in
place<00:01:07.369> as<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.570> batteries<00:01:09.840> does

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
place as you can see the batteries does

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.590 
place as you can see the batteries does
not<00:01:10.140> fall<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.380> now<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.430> push<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.119> tab<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
not fall out now if I push the tab to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.070 
not fall out now if I push the tab to
the<00:01:12.630> left<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:14.340> body<00:01:14.549> will<00:01:14.850> come<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.570> again<00:01:15.689> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the left the body will come out again so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.550 
the left the body will come out again so
that's<00:01:16.200> how<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.380> eject<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> batteries<00:01:18.320> okay

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that's how you eject the batteries okay

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.760 
that's how you eject the batteries okay
now<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> camera<00:01:20.340> uses<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.000> course<00:01:21.210> an<00:01:21.390> SD<00:01:21.780> SDHC

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
now the camera uses of course an SD SDHC

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
now the camera uses of course an SD SDHC

video<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.930> camera<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.920> properly

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
video on this camera now to properly

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.219 
video on this camera now to properly
insert<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> card<00:01:45.270> there's<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.960> slot

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
insert the card there's a little slot

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.330 
insert the card there's a little slot
here<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.590> well<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:47.040> above<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.579> battery<00:01:47.840> ok

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
here as well just above the battery ok

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.039 
here as well just above the battery ok
the<00:01:50.340> contacts<00:01:50.939> will<00:01:51.180> face<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> back<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the contacts will face the back of the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
the contacts will face the back of the
camera<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.460> inserted<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
camera so if you have it inserted this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.429 
camera so if you have it inserted this
way<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.630> incorrect

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
way that's incorrect

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.830 
way that's incorrect
it<00:01:55.770> should<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.630> going

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it should be like that so I'm just going

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
it should be like that so I'm just going
to<00:01:57.869> insert<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.590> slot<00:01:58.890> push<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
to insert it into a slot push it in and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.440 
to insert it into a slot push it in and
because<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> also<00:02:01.829> spring-loaded<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:03.210> take

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
because it is also spring-loaded to take

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
because it is also spring-loaded to take
the<00:02:03.570> card<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.350> pull<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.920> just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the card out I don't pull it out I just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.029 
the card out I don't pull it out I just
push<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.579> again<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:07.200> pops<00:02:07.439> open<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.950> me

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
push it in again and it pops open for me

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.499 
push it in again and it pops open for me
to<00:02:08.069> pick<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> card<00:02:08.700> out<00:02:08.819> again

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
to pick the card out again

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.760
