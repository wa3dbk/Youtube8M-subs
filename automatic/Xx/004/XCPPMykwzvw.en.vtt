00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.790
 1 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.779
 well hello everyone and welcome to 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.849
 the cub x pleads so today we get 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.810
 found for another video 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.970
 information in which I am going to 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.820
 just talk about the next 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.839
 update so good I do not say 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.000
 of title because to learn to come 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.279
 yeah that's not it na na na good what 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.720
 is not it's not important me 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.339
 I do not care personally number so much 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.530
 that it's the content that's interesting 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.839
 so of course she from the studio like 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.150
 every Friday now we post a 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.370
 little 8 talking to us about a teddy 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.949
 this time a small plush 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.140
 cows of course for the most part you 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.640
 will understand that it's not that so we 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.090
 go right away so we're going 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.410
 first start with the screen you bauer 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.370
 who has four screens will start with 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.379
 from the top left screen so 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.800
 at the top left there is something very 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.679
 very interesting that is simply 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.940
 we can see that we have powders even 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:08.440
 if it's a little fuzzy I know I you 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.910
 the agreement but it still shows 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.140
 quite clearly for those who if you 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.360
 be careful you will see everything 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.580
 simply we can see the powders 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.880
 of fireworks and fireworks 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.130
 who is in the square just to 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.160
 the one box just to the right but we 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.959
 can see something that is pretty special 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.270
 I will go I have the impression that they have us 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.610
 put the kraft tables that are not 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.929
 necessarily automatic in the sense of this 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.149
 that we can perhaps kraft and our 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.500
 objects without necessarily having to go through 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.239
 an automatic table since you 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.220
 can finally see for me that's it 

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:43.630
 ie that it has nine boxes like this 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.509
 like in a kraft table so for 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.450
 me it would be that so do I have 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.539
 Because if I'm not mistaken I do to 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.560
 excuse who has a so special stuff but 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.840
 I do not think I 'm wrong 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.190
 so that would mean that if I do not know 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.390
 how is it managed that is to say that we 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.369
 would have liked a kraft table that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.220
 would not be automatic at all and 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.629
 so we'll go to the kraft stage between 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.030
 classic quotation marks or we could 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.890
 to have both I do not know too much but 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.629
 in any case if it happens it would be 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.370
 a possibility in addition who I think 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.410
 could be quite interesting 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.750
 so we see it after the fireworks 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.629
 with my opinion these are all effects 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.970
 who gives but we know pretty crazy so I 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.300
 could not tell you 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.830
 them too as you can see I 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.660
 can not specify video bitrate but we 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.030
 can see that that's where it's been integrated into 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.370
 each version 2 of minecraft is at 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.470
 to say that good I do not know if I do not know 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.460
 Too much difference between ps3 and ps4 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.140
 and xbox 360 and xbox one not even what 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.660
 it's the pictures are a bit like that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.110
 price price a bit hungry it's a little fuzzy 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.630
 quite simply 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.060
 but in any case we see that there is already 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.900
 at least on ps3 and at least on xbox 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.190
 on xbox 360 so certainly both 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.890
 for those who put us four screens 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.570
 I think there is a screen for ps3 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.770
 a screen for ps4 a screen for x 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.200
 autumn a screen for simply 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.390
 xbox 360 and the ps vita I do not have 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.470
 specified but of course I did not put 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.330
 in the hole I 'm going to add them 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.830
 that all I tell you 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.360
 information and so on it also counts 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.500
 of course for ps vita 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.110
 so then we'll go back to the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.090
 next cloud that is to say that he we 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.450
 will have next picture they show us 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.090
 not two extraordinary things and between 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.500
 simply but still stuff 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.239
 who are really crazy so we can see 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.920
 already in the inventory bar can 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.920
 see the coal blog I'm putting a 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.269
 lighter or scare a yellow block that I 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.150
 still do not know what is it? 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.910
 the liver block or I hope art 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.950
 sharpness but hey it's true that finally 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.330
 we'll see simply but good at 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.290
 worse it will be for a next update 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.980
 day 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.350
 after we can also see the beacon 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.739
 nothern barrier upstream that one 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.350
 knows 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.239
 after in the inventory itself I 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.890
 believe that there is a bow and arrows and 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.000
 after the third theme I will not be 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.700
 To say too much what it is but here it is 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.980
 it does not look very important and 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.360
 you can see quite simply 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.850
 the interface of the beacon so that is to say 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.549
 the interface to manage the between 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.010
 quotation marks as I do not know how 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.860
 call that and the powers that we 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.490
 give the picone we'll say so here's 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.570
 that's how it is 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.580
 will come up the interface all 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.740
 simply but we'll see of course 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.510
 later so good at the same time I you 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.120
 show peace and that of ps vita you 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.010
 can see the colette withers who are 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.110
 on ps vita but that in every 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.050
 picture we see the whizzer this pass is so 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.490
 good I did not specify but it is 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.920
 in each picture simply 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.230
 then we will go to the picture 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.380
 at the bottom left 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.360
 finally at the bottom left so there we are a 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.490
 times over we are on 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.680
 playstation there we are on xbox so 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.170
 xbox there we can see inside the or 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.180
 scared simply have how it gets 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.250
 goes into the water scared so we can see 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.280
 that there are five slot 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.020
 so here are the items in the bar 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.970
 are really crazy I see a cart to 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.560
 tlt I see they have tried peak 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.300
 and something but the not frankly 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.660
 I tried to play and it was enough 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.570
 really unreadable and the rest I 'll be 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.900
 not really tell you because 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.010
 it's really crazy what I tried 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.050
 to look a bit before doing the 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.020
 video but it's not really clear so 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.550
 good we'll see but I think it's that 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.850
 of ages stuff that had already been 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.520
 announced then we go to the screen the 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.830
 last screen while bottom right 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.450
 so we can see once again we 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.580
 is on xbox we do not know which one 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.600
 but that's not important because of 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.130
 anyway it would come anyway on 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.240
 all the consoles and there we can see 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.090
 that the stamp not overuse he had that 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.010
 his horse in the nether is everything 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.120
 simply they open the interface is 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.190
 so we can see so of course 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.320
 will miss mind because all fear mind guard 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:05.780
 tnt night day detector and all and 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.510
 the others it's really vague so I 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.790
 tried to make a maximum to see 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.360
 but it's really not obvious what 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.180
 so I think it's a bit close 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.550
 if ever of course I may not have 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.650
 seen it all but you're telling me there 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.790
 there maybe that's quite 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.320
 likely because I did not really know 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.940
 recognize all items expanding 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.780
 that they were crazy as I said so 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.370
 but if you recognize items 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.330
 or just do not hesitate to 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.520
 comment 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.710
 but hey whoever says to me see again 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.500
 with the blocks that boots commands 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.030
 et cetera it's good finally I mean 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.730
 now there are people it will and 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.190
 Block commands everywhere have to stop 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.140
 like that during this I hope that 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.350
 this little news video will have pleased you and 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.610
 we are definitely on Friday 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.690
 next for a new 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.690
 go ciao everyone
