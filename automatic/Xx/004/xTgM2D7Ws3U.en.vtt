00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
know the mat so it's something that the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
know the mat so it's something that the
creator<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.010> map<00:00:44.160> left<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.049 
creator of the map left in here with the
I<00:00:45.899> guess<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.829> intent<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> people<00:00:47.610> finding<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
I guess the intent of people finding it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.720 
I guess the intent of people finding it
and<00:00:48.180> enjoying<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.340> over

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
what the Cohens always meant was that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
what the Cohens always meant was that
there's<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> easter<00:01:45.869> egg<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.799> he<00:01:47.520> put<00:01:47.700> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
there's the easter egg so he put that
