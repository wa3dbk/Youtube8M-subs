00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.139
 for this craft we are going to need 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.810
 base cutting mechanism and needles 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.369
 watch wooden rods saw 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:23.250
 marquetry and sandpaper cardboard pen box cutter 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.080
 pencil and rule silicone gun and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.450
 drill 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.000
 let's make a watch with these 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.970
 1 cm square wooden rods 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.330
 1 centimeter and we will start cutting 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.030
 12 pieces of 20 centimeters in length 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.340
 that we will mark with the pencil and cut 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.680
 with the marquetry saw we are going to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.090
 do 12 equal 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.400
 we already have our rods trimmed 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 and what we will do is sanding the ends 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.790
 against a sandpaper to leave them smooth 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.790
 and soft 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.570
 we rub hard and make sure 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.880
 that are flat we will do the same 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.120
 also on all four sides of the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.660
 rod so that they remain without splinters and 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.660
 soft 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.030
 we already have our 12 linked rods 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.159
 If you wanted to give it a varnish it would be this 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.619
 the moment later we would let dry 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.280
 the next step is going to be using 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.289
 a cardboard board pen like this 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.960
 circle a circle we have chosen 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.850
 do it with this roll of tape that we 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.399
 comes more or less the measure we want 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.619
 about 12 centimeters in diameter you can 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.359
 do it with compass or any other 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.539
 as it suits you for the size 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.120
 of your watch we mark it well with a 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.790
 pencil 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.820
 and the next step will be to cut it with the 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.430
 cutter how deep is what we do is 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.460
 give several passes first by cutting the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.800
 top paper another last deepening 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.920
 a little more several passes until 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.869
 let's cut completely the cardboard pen 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.940
 As you know, it is thick and 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.300
 You need us to insist a little bit with 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.300
 the cutter 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.610
 see how the circle has been 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.250
 trimmed completely and with the sandpaper what 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.140
 what we have done has been to sand the edges 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.450
 well to remove the imperfections that 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.720
 we could have been left to cut with the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.629
 cutter then peaks threads of paper of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.250
 sponge to leave it as perfect and 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.290
 as smooth as possible 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.270
 if you want to hide the edge so that 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.670
 you see the inside filling of the cardboard 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.370
 you can cover it with a ribbon 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.620
 paper or rubber eva we have also 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.570
 bored with the drill the center as 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.180
 You see where the axis will then 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.000
 the machinery the next step is going to be 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.610
 mark at one end of each 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.160
 one of the rods a mark with a pencil 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.100
 to a centimeter or a half centimeter 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.620
 more or less from the east end will be the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.840
 measure that tells us what part will go 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.120
 stuck on the back of the pen and cardboard 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.120
 which part of the rod is in sight 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.340
 fix as we already have the 12 rods 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.500
 marked a centimeter and a half more or 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.650
 less and what we will do now will be 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.780
 stick them on the back we will do 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.780
 with the help of a template like this 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.870
 As you can see, what we have done has been 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.060
 remove the paper from the back of our 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.430
 cardboard pen that as you can see is 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.050
 adhesive sticks then let's 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.300
 take this adhesive to make a 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.550
 first placement of the position that 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.350
 they will have the rods we have also 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.570
 expanded the template four times its 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.090
 size by gluing four folios together 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.940
 that will serve us as a diaz to mark 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.730
 the position of the rods first 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.850
 will be to place the center of the cardboard pen 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.570
 where will our machinery go 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.470
 coinciding with the center of the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.540
 template 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.120
 and the next step will be to start 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.400
 place the rods sticking them in the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.250
 adhesive on the back following the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.959
 lines that the template marks if your 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.490
 Feather cardboard is not adhesive you can 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.740
 do with a little bit of glue 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.970
 liquid that allows you then movement 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.970
 to place them well 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.250
 the edge that we have marked to a 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.520
 centimeter and a half will have to match 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.230
 with the edge of the pen cardboard of this 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.120
 form a centimeter and a half of each 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.760
 rod will stay inside and the 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.670
 rest will remain visible 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.590
 in this way we will be placing all 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.450
 the rods and I tell you that we are going to 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.670
 use this sticker to present the 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.040
 position of the rods but then the 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.670
 we will stick well fixed with pistol 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.670
 hot silicone 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.010
 As you can see, we are placing first the 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.850
 four axes that would be twelve the three 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.010
 six and nine o'clock and once placed 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.630
 instead we will place the same 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.630
 forms the rest of rods 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.340
 we already have the 12 rods in place and 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.199
 we need to fix them with a bit of 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.819
 hot silicone so they fit 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.819
 attached to the back 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.220
 we put it back in its position 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.680
 we press and wait for it to dry and 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.050
 this way we will place the 12 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.539
 we already have the 12 rods well 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.850
 attached on the back and we already have 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.130
 complete in the hours of our watch 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.530
 the next step is to place the 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.949
 we are going to do it with the same mechanism 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.539
 way by giving some hot silicone 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:06.210
 so that it stays stuck on the back 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.250
 I recommend you not to get too close 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.979
 to the central hole through which the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.770
 axis because if not when we place it if 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:16.199
 seats the silicone and moves can 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.270
 stick to the shaft and as it cooled we were 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.440
 block and that's where our 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.290
 clock 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.300
 we press well we move a little bit to 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:31.270
 that seats the silicone 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:34.360
 and we hope that it is very fast 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:37.190
 look how the shaft protrudes through the 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.290
 front part of the cardboard pen 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.270
 we check that the mechanism works 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.870
 perfectly that has not been blocked with 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.870
 the silicone 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.280
 and so we would have it ready for 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.280
 finish 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.500
 we press a little bit we make sure 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.920
 that the silicone has cooled and the 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:03.650
 last step will be to place the needles 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.650
 first the hour hand 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.479
 then the minute hand 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.840
 and finally the cap cited embellisher 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.389
 see how simple and how beautiful it has 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:29.030
 this original watch made with 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:31.129
 wooden rods if you liked them
