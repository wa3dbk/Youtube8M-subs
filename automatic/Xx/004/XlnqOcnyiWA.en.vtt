00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.370
 hello people and welcome to the pid 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.740
 review with media patrick i introduce 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.240
 you guys today the kit the moment before what 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.560
 you can do anything with the thing 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.060
 and how it works 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.759
 I wish you much fun with the video 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.380
 and the fan you wear like most 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.200
 surely the knowledge starts from you 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.059
 with the kit the oman with two stones 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.809
 pressure plates and two gravel or else 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.329
 called glasses 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.130
 these can then be stacked one above the other 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.770
 and jump on it and it 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.690
 there is a kind of tnt blog we are very 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.350
 suitable for speeding in a team 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.030
 to form 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.010
 One can drive stone, for example 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.250
 goes and what is up and the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.840
 others go in time to drive wood and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.070
 You can then directly wooden swords 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.850
 make stone steps you can 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.440
 then do everything with it in the cave 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.120
 then there is and still more scrabble 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.870
 like me, then you can still do it 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.290
 cause more explosions with the kit 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.920
 as often with the kit the two gremmel 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.460
 blocks go earlier yes than one 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.289
 stone pressure plate because it is just like that 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.600
 that somehow they are going through the explosion 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.999
 go away faster than the jewelry chain 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.530
 from which it always makes sense even a grill 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.179
 to be there was that I was in the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.639
 pit that you can pick up quickly 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.819
 to cause even more explosion around 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.780
 then there will be more stone iron than 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.840
 I get 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.459
 Of course it is also iron degradable 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.139
 But the iron ore blocks often stop 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.569
 lost in the explosion 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:44.359
 and yes you can not pick up that 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.069
 also applies to coal use here had 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.079
 I still hold that the kreml is there and 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.249
 then I imagined and there 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.520
 even more luck 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.139
 so now in the jungle again 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.899
 easy to explain how the blocks on it 

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:58.909
 put it on and off you go found 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.639
 really, it does not matter if 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.310
 wood stone earth you have it 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.450
 quite elementary with the kag and there 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.789
 it is also useful with others 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.180
 players then make one go 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.970
 for example as a cold weather seed farm 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.430
 and then you catch wood and stone then 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.620
 you meet you are up there 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.049
 him a little bit 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.299
 wood or earth stuck to the book 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.670
 you eat yourselves up and then 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.709
 could go down and couple again 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.269
 kill people 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.220
 you see in the background just how many 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.150
 I'm still exploding in the round 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.480
 did because 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.370
 So you often get up to ten 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.650
 explosions when you get enough level 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.099
 has found and the stone pressure plates 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.390
 play so it is bad what you are 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.489
 to do everything with it 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.620
 and then you have a loose about one 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.390
 stack earth so you have all yours 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.109
 stone pressure plates baffled and since 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.549
 with the game 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.930
 and do not know how her new stone 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.359
 he can do that with pressure plates 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.660
 It is not easy to cable the oven 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:01.030
 melt next to each other and do wool 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.359
 Do you have a new lithographic plate the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.459
 you can use it so you wonder 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.560
 What else can you do with the kit 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.230
 You can do everything easily 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.379
 passive with the kit just play in the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.000
 build house with three entrances or more 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.790
 bit then select the input is 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.159
 build down an expert audience and then 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.290
 rather than a capsule it takes just so 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.419
 a pressure plate with gremmel on it if 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.310
 Below that comes the guy making boom once 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.169
 and he's dead that's no guess now 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.109
 I have the tactics ever with basti 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.299
 unfortunately not taken and the 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.549
 Type of popular and has died 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.099
 after that armor we had everything 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.530
 we had tombstone sword he is 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.019
 Run on it and we had complete 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.760
 equipment so easy you can go 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.970
 The tactics also try it just like that 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.750
 just as has so an underground 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.430
 Build booths with few stages of entrance 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.660
 just in front of such a thing greven with 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.760
 a stone pressure plate on it 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.230
 place as the moment and wait until 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.449
 one comes you have to be careful 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.519
 that he does not undermine himself but when 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.949
 her signals so signaled that there 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.090
 One is then likely to be 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.709
 also come down 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.480
 I would go there once super torch 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.489
 Do that you can see it at night 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.930
 that is just perfect because the 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.570
 Most of them just go down without 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.310
 to think and then they run directly 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.190
 into their trap purely natural one can 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.780
 also around the area its the moment 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.430
 to place a drop but today I am 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.409
 then not come so far to the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.750
 surface you can give it a try 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.960
 just around 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.060
 to place their plates on foot and 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.930
 wait and see if there is a row 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.360
 is running or not 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.930
 I hope you liked it anyway 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.600
 the review 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.650
 even if it is without bastida 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.670
 still a little bit of time you can 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.680
 like to write in the comments 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.040
 which kit will come next 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.630
 should 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.130
 and if you liked the video 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.560
 we would be pleased about a like 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.560
 until then, three people and ciao skin
