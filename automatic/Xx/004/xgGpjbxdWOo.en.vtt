excuse me I got that setup wrong ok so a
piston<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.869> made<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.360> get

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
piston is just made like so and you get

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
piston is just made like so and you get
one<00:01:42.689> regular<00:01:43.140> piston<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.829> now<00:01:44.189> there's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
one regular piston and now there's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.219 
one regular piston and now there's
actually<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> use<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.270> slimeballs<00:01:45.840> place<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
actually a use for slimeballs place a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.830 
actually a use for slimeballs place a
piston<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> middle<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> add<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> slime

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
piston in the middle and add a slime

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.910 
piston in the middle and add a slime
ball<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.170> top<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.280> sticky<00:01:50.759> piston

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
ball on top and you get a sticky piston

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.990 
ball on top and you get a sticky piston
so<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.399> both<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> different

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
so you get both of the different

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.740 
so you get both of the different
versions<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.780> were<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> mod<00:01:55.409> sticky<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
versions that were in the mod sticky and

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.209 
versions that were in the mod sticky and
regular<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:58.619> work<00:01:58.799> slightly

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
regular but they work slightly

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.330 
regular but they work slightly
differently<00:01:59.570> than<00:02:00.570> before<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:02.070> I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
differently than before and that I

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
differently than before and that I
forget<00:02:03.030> which<00:02:03.180> order<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.750> them<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.079> here

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
forget which order I have them in here

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.359 
forget which order I have them in here
but<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> that's<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.020> sticky<00:02:07.320> piston<00:02:07.500> sticky

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
but so that's a sticky piston sticky

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
but so that's a sticky piston sticky
piston<00:02:08.759> well<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> behaves<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> did

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
piston well it behaves as it did

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.630 
piston well it behaves as it did
previously

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
previously

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.790 
previously
and<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.420> does<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.720> regular<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.290> when<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:14.620> on

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
and so does the regular one when it's on

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.610 
and so does the regular one when it's on
wooden<00:02:15.610> blocks<00:02:15.880> dirt<00:02:16.210> blocks<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.500> so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
wooden blocks dirt blocks so on and so

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.720 
wooden blocks dirt blocks so on and so
forth<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.220> actually<00:02:18.580> behaves

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
forth but it actually behaves

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.780 
forth but it actually behaves
differently<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.570> sand<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.790> it'll

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
differently with sand and that it'll

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.850 
differently with sand and that it'll
lift<00:02:22.000> sand<00:02:22.270> up<00:02:22.450> but<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.690> won't<00:02:22.870> actually<00:02:23.230> fling

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
lift sand up but it won't actually fling

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.440 
lift sand up but it won't actually fling
it<00:02:24.010> into<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.370> air<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.610> was<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.790> regular<00:02:25.180> non

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it into the air that was a regular non

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.230 
it into the air that was a regular non
sticky<00:02:26.020> piston<00:02:26.920> whereas<00:02:27.250> before<00:02:27.580> hand<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
sticky piston whereas before hand in the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.000 
sticky piston whereas before hand in the
piston<00:02:28.600> mod<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.870> would<00:02:28.960> have<00:02:29.080> flown<00:02:29.590> up<00:02:29.770> into

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
piston mod it would have flown up into

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.060 
piston mod it would have flown up into
the<00:02:30.100> air<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.940> also<00:02:31.090> won't<00:02:31.330> launch<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:32.140> anymore

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
the air it also won't launch you anymore

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.550 
the air it also won't launch you anymore
it<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.280> lifts<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.060> up<00:02:34.120> one<00:02:34.630> block<00:02:34.870> high<00:02:35.110> onto

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
it just lifts you up one block high onto

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.190 
it just lifts you up one block high onto
the<00:02:35.680> top<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.360> can't<00:02:37.360> say<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.540> didn't<00:02:37.810> expect<00:02:38.140> that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the top I can't say I didn't expect that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.140 
the top I can't say I didn't expect that
I<00:02:38.320> was<00:02:38.680> pretty<00:02:39.040> sure<00:02:39.310> they<00:02:39.520> wouldn't<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:40.000> it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
I was pretty sure they wouldn't have it

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.550 
I was pretty sure they wouldn't have it
flinging<00:02:40.510> stuff<00:02:40.780> into<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> air<00:02:41.290> when<00:02:41.440> they

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
flinging stuff into the air when they

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.980 
flinging stuff into the air when they
included<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.070> into<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.640> game<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.030> it's<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.870> be

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
included it into the game so it's to be

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.550 
included it into the game so it's to be
expected

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
expected

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.310 
expected
they<00:02:44.980> also<00:02:45.160> won't<00:02:45.670> push<00:02:46.060> blocks<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.810> store

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
they also won't push blocks that store

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.650 
they also won't push blocks that store
entity<00:02:48.160> values<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.030> think<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.450> correct

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
entity values is I think the correct

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.780 
entity values is I think the correct
terminology<00:02:49.930> for<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.650> in<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:50.800> when<00:02:51.760> you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
terminology for it in that when you

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.270 
terminology for it in that when you
actually<00:02:52.060> store<00:02:52.540> an<00:02:52.660> item<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.320> chest<00:02:53.650> like

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
actually store an item in a chest like

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.060 
actually store an item in a chest like
so<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.720> stores<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.440> actual<00:02:56.770> location

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
so it stores it to the actual location

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.000 
so it stores it to the actual location
of<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:58.209> block<00:02:58.630> where<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.200> resides<00:02:59.470> in<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
of that block where it resides in the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.760 
of that block where it resides in the
world<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.000> if<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.300> push<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.600> around<00:03:01.900> it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
world so if you push that around it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.710 
world so if you push that around it
would<00:03:02.890> actually<00:03:03.100> erase<00:03:03.700> all<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> items<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.600> it

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
would actually erase all the items in it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.230 
would actually erase all the items in it
so<00:03:05.260> basically<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:06.459> prevents<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.209> from

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
so basically it prevents you from

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.080 
so basically it prevents you from
pushing<00:03:08.080> around<00:03:08.170> chests<00:03:09.100> note<00:03:09.790> blocks

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
pushing around chests note blocks

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.260 
pushing around chests note blocks
because<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.930> notes<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.280> actual<00:03:12.610> note<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
because the notes the actual note of the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.300 
because the notes the actual note of the
note<00:03:13.420> block<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.840> stored<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.470> specific

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
note block is stored in that specific

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.979 
note block is stored in that specific
location<00:03:15.459> as<00:03:16.000> well

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
location as well

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.660 
location as well
so<00:03:17.320> you're<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:17.560> unable<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.100> push<00:03:18.370> those

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
so you're just unable to push those

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.430 
so you're just unable to push those
sorts<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.120> blocks<00:03:19.360> as<00:03:19.510> well<00:03:19.690> as<00:03:19.870> obviously

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
sorts of blocks as well as obviously

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.030 
sorts of blocks as well as obviously
obsidian<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.750> admittance<00:03:22.750> tough<00:03:23.380> there's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
obsidian and admittance tough there's

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.570 
obsidian and admittance tough there's
also<00:03:24.220> been<00:03:24.430> an<00:03:24.550> update<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:25.360> TNT<00:03:26.100> which<00:03:27.100> i<00:03:27.430> think

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
also been an update to TNT which i think

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.250 
also been an update to TNT which i think
is<00:03:27.910> really<00:03:28.120> really<00:03:28.300> nice<00:03:28.720> because<00:03:28.930> no<00:03:29.140> longer

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
is really really nice because no longer

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.620 
is really really nice because no longer
do<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.830> worry<00:03:30.070> about<00:03:30.480> screwing<00:03:31.480> up

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
do you have to worry about screwing up

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.690 
do you have to worry about screwing up
in<00:03:31.930> placing<00:03:32.680> down<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.830> whole<00:03:33.010> bunch<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.310> TNT<00:03:33.670> and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
in placing down a whole bunch of TNT and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.259 
in placing down a whole bunch of TNT and
then<00:03:33.880> accidentally<00:03:34.360> hitting<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.320> or

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
then accidentally hitting it or

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.310 
then accidentally hitting it or
accidentally<00:03:37.269> placing<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.630> TNT<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.170> wrong

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
accidentally placing a TNT in the wrong

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.979 
accidentally placing a TNT in the wrong
place<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.850> not<00:03:39.850> knowing<00:03:40.269> how<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.450> get<00:03:40.720> rid<00:03:40.870> of

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
place and not knowing how to get rid of

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.449 
place and not knowing how to get rid of
it<00:03:41.080> unless<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.410> own<00:03:41.590> two<00:03:41.680> mcedit<00:03:42.160> or

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
it unless you own two mcedit or

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.009 
it unless you own two mcedit or
something<00:03:43.030> like<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.330> so<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.690> can<00:03:43.870> actually

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
something like that so you can actually

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.560 
something like that so you can actually
hit<00:03:44.260> TNT<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.580> just<00:03:45.730> goes<00:03:45.850> back<00:03:46.120> into<00:03:46.330> its

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
hit TNT and it just goes back into its

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.110 
hit TNT and it just goes back into its
normal<00:03:46.720> block<00:03:47.140> state<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.620> instead<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.730> order

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
normal block state and instead in order

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.530 
normal block state and instead in order
to<00:03:49.330> activate<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.440> just<00:03:50.620> have<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:51.010> use

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
to activate it you just have to use

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.330 
to activate it you just have to use
redstone<00:03:52.570> yoikes<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:54.400> that'll<00:03:55.030> blow<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.269> up

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
redstone yoikes and that'll blow it up

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.180 
redstone yoikes and that'll blow it up
and<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:58.480> top<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.110> can<00:03:59.260> also<00:03:59.380> set<00:04:00.160> it

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
and on top of that you can also set it

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.630 
and on top of that you can also set it
on<00:04:00.370> fire<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:01.060> don't<00:04:01.269> know<00:04:01.390> if<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.570> have<00:04:01.780> any<00:04:02.640> flint

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
on fire I don't know if I have any flint

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.340 
on fire I don't know if I have any flint

and steel on me it doesn't seem like I

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.680 
and steel on me it doesn't seem like I
do<00:04:05.410> however<00:04:06.100> if<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.610> take<00:04:07.150> some<00:04:07.360> flint<00:04:07.570> and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
do however if you take some flint and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.140 
do however if you take some flint and
steel<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.110> just<00:04:08.670> right-click<00:04:09.670> on<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.940> block

steel and just right-click on the block
it'll<00:04:10.510> it'll<00:04:11.440> light<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.220> fire<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.790> it'll

it'll it'll light it on fire and it'll

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.039 
it'll it'll light it on fire and it'll
blow<00:04:13.720> up<00:04:13.900> shortly<00:04:14.410> after<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.209> wanted<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.930> go

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
blow up shortly after now I wanted to go

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.520 
blow up shortly after now I wanted to go
ahead<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.890> was<00:04:17.979> trying<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.519> recreate<00:04:19.090> that

ahead and I was trying to recreate that

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.380 
ahead and I was trying to recreate that
sort<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.650> hidden<00:04:20.950> entrance<00:04:21.580> that<00:04:21.940> Yin's

for<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.130> piston<00:04:27.460> mod<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.850> was<00:04:28.210> trying<00:04:28.420> to<00:04:28.480> do<00:04:28.570> it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
for the piston mod I was trying to do it

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.990 
for the piston mod I was trying to do it
while<00:04:29.230> hiding<00:04:29.650> all<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.160> wires<00:04:30.370> except<00:04:30.850> for

while hiding all the wires except for

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.550 
while hiding all the wires except for
the<00:04:31.060> Pistons<00:04:31.390> that<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.690> can<00:04:31.840> see<00:04:32.020> right<00:04:32.380> in

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
the Pistons that you can see right in

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.130 
the Pistons that you can see right in
there<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:32.920> theoretically<00:04:33.760> my<00:04:34.090> design<00:04:34.570> should

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
there and theoretically my design should

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.560 
there and theoretically my design should
have<00:04:35.260> worked<00:04:35.530> but<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.430> turns<00:04:36.670> out<00:04:36.940> there<00:04:37.390> is<00:04:37.540> a

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
have worked but it turns out there is a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.810 
have worked but it turns out there is a
little<00:04:37.960> bug<00:04:38.230> I<00:04:38.500> am<00:04:38.680> sad<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.010> report<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.670> have

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
little bug I am sad to report I have

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.790 
little bug I am sad to report I have
heard<00:04:40.030> there<00:04:40.240> are<00:04:40.270> other<00:04:40.480> bugs<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.650> my

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
heard there are other bugs but to my

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.560 
heard there are other bugs but to my
knowledge<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.400> haven't<00:04:42.820> seen<00:04:43.090> this<00:04:43.270> one

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
knowledge I haven't seen this one

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.490 
knowledge I haven't seen this one
reported<00:04:44.260> quite<00:04:44.920> yet<00:04:45.250> in<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:46.200> well<00:04:47.200> let's

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
reported quite yet in that well let's

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.620 
reported quite yet in that well let's
see<00:04:47.710> I'm<00:04:48.010> gonna<00:04:48.190> gather<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.550> torch<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:49.360> have<00:04:49.600> a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
see I'm gonna gather a torch I have a

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.420 
see I'm gonna gather a torch I have a
torch<00:04:49.960> somewhere<00:04:50.320> around<00:04:50.410> here<00:04:50.920> yeah<00:04:51.250> let<00:04:51.400> me

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
torch somewhere around here yeah let me

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.750 
torch somewhere around here yeah let me
just<00:04:51.490> grab<00:04:51.700> this<00:04:53.490> if<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.640> can<00:04:54.910> there<00:04:55.360> we<00:04:55.390> go<00:04:55.660> and

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
just grab this if I can there we go and

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.650 
just grab this if I can there we go and
take<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:57.940> back<00:04:58.180> up<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:59.080> top<00:04:59.370> so<00:05:00.370> if<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.450> put<00:05:01.630> a

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
take it back up to the top so if I put a

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.110 
take it back up to the top so if I put a
piston<00:05:02.050> down<00:05:02.200> right<00:05:02.650> here<00:05:02.950> and<00:05:04.440> activate<00:05:05.440> that

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
piston down right here and activate that

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.070 
piston down right here and activate that
nothing<00:05:07.120> should<00:05:07.270> happen<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:07.870> we<00:05:07.960> have<00:05:08.050> a

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
nothing should happen so we have a

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.740 
nothing should happen so we have a
redstone<00:05:08.440> piece<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.160> it's<00:05:09.820> not<00:05:10.030> anywhere

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
redstone piece and it's not anywhere

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.330 
redstone piece and it's not anywhere
near<00:05:10.810> touching<00:05:11.530> this<00:05:11.650> piston<00:05:12.070> there<00:05:12.220> would

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
near touching this piston there would

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.490 
near touching this piston there would
either<00:05:12.430> have<00:05:12.700> to<00:05:12.850> be<00:05:12.970> a<00:05:13.180> block<00:05:13.660> right<00:05:14.020> directly

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
either have to be a block right directly

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.040 
either have to be a block right directly
on<00:05:14.650> top<00:05:14.860> with<00:05:15.130> redstone<00:05:15.490> on<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:16.000> or<00:05:16.210> redstone

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
on top with redstone on it or redstone

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.200 
on top with redstone on it or redstone
coming<00:05:17.440> in<00:05:17.560> from<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.830> side<00:05:18.040> but<00:05:18.910> there's<00:05:19.090> no

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
coming in from the side but there's no

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.300 
coming in from the side but there's no
redstone<00:05:19.600> touching<00:05:19.960> it<00:05:20.050> and<00:05:20.230> nothing<00:05:21.160> should

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
redstone touching it and nothing should

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.220 
redstone touching it and nothing should
happen<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:22.090> nothing<00:05:22.480> is<00:05:22.660> happening<00:05:23.110> right

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
happen and nothing is happening right

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.860 
happen and nothing is happening right
now<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.410> can<00:05:23.650> delete<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.010> torch<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:25.660> still

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
now I can delete the torch and it still

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.510 
now I can delete the torch and it still
stays<00:05:26.170> the<00:05:26.470> same<00:05:26.970> but<00:05:27.970> if<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.480> go<00:05:28.660> in<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:29.520> take

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
stays the same but if I go in and take

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.920 
stays the same but if I go in and take
the<00:05:30.640> piston<00:05:30.940> out<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:31.180> then<00:05:31.270> place<00:05:31.420> it<00:05:31.660> whoa

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
the piston out and then place it whoa

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.070 
the piston out and then place it whoa
well<00:05:32.920> had<00:05:33.040> that<00:05:33.220> happen<00:05:33.640> what's<00:05:34.150> what's<00:05:34.810> this

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
well had that happen what's what's this

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.160 
well had that happen what's what's this
what's<00:05:35.980> going<00:05:36.220> on<00:05:36.430> here<00:05:36.760> why<00:05:37.210> is<00:05:37.270> it<00:05:37.540> going<00:05:37.840> why

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
what's going on here why is it going why

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.300 
what's going on here why is it going why
is<00:05:38.200> it<00:05:38.440> extending<00:05:39.010> I<00:05:39.390> I<00:05:40.390> don't<00:05:40.630> know<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.310> I've

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
is it extending I I don't know and I've

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.890 
is it extending I I don't know and I've
come<00:05:42.640> to<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:42.760> conclusion<00:05:42.850> that<00:05:43.419> it<00:05:43.510> must<00:05:43.720> be<00:05:43.870> a

come to the conclusion that it must be a
bug<00:05:44.140> because<00:05:44.500> no<00:05:44.680> matter<00:05:44.830> what<00:05:45.040> I<00:05:45.100> do<00:05:45.220> I<00:05:45.370> can't

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
bug because no matter what I do I can't

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.940 
bug because no matter what I do I can't
figure<00:05:46.300> out<00:05:46.450> what<00:05:46.960> is<00:05:47.080> going<00:05:47.110> on<00:05:47.500> it<00:05:47.620> shouldn't

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
figure out what is going on it shouldn't

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.100 
figure out what is going on it shouldn't
happen<00:05:48.130> so<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.610> just<00:05:48.820> made<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.000> little<00:05:49.180> setup

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
happen so I just made a little setup

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.980 
happen so I just made a little setup
over<00:05:50.500> here<00:05:50.919> so<00:05:51.820> nothing<00:05:52.180> happens<00:05:52.690> we<00:05:52.840> got

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
over here so nothing happens we got

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.409 
over here so nothing happens we got
redstone<00:05:53.380> going<00:05:53.620> up<00:05:53.740> here<00:05:54.210> nothing<00:05:55.210> should

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
redstone going up here nothing should

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.090 
redstone going up here nothing should
happen<00:05:55.480> that's<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.470> way<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.680> should<00:05:56.890> be

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
happen that's the way it should be

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.170
