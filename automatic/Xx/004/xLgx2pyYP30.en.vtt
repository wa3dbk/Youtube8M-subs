00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.879
 the first edition of the entire monologue circuit to its end in this 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.779
 fifth season with a huge audience success 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.890
 uribe magnificent four important points of the country is expected for the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.320
 next edition that will begin in mid-January of next year 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 it happens with the custom of bringing magnificent cuts 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.399
 the person in charge of closing the first edition of the monologue circuit 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.489
 as studies increasingly known by all comedians impede a humorist 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.469
 until both these appearances culminated with media success 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.289
 television broad programs last 24 hours 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.690
 his daring performances insisted on asking people in certain 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.610
 clean spaces a danger on several occasions its owner 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.830
 physical at the hands of pretty successful people 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.960
 old television interviewed this peculiar comedians and has the honor and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.970
 that is one of the most visited comedians in the youtube channel 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.700
 good already started to lend a hand 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.390
 and I was 14 years old for these facts 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.540
 suddenly started from the world of moto2 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.840
 and I realized that I was running out of work garcía monologues 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.190
 you can not gómez 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.290
 tevenet and in the mood and I realized that the smoke is much better than the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.010
 magic handled it much better 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.650
 it's harder to humor than magic 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.650
 remember that more complicated because when you do a magic show 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.850
 people for example 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.840
 d Trick is deluded with tricks 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 the Levantines like you are not surprised 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 but with the humor as not you who is a whore 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.110
 then I started 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.850
 mow combine magic with humor more than anything 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.780
 at the end of the monologue show and I realized that it was a 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.740
 error 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.299
 to me what I have marked yesterday to be prettier than my show is based 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.250
 in that 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.840
 do monologue to do magic 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.219
 tiger woods to buy waste 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980
 if something is not right 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.950
 and van gogh and rafael strap 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.020
 but for low in cup game 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.300
 now 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.689
 that version of the facts points 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.139
 and with show is to mess with the public 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.789
 spread pissed off to the public 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.279
 to be a nice scoundrel 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:22.180
 but you have stung I like pissed-off viewer when resigning be 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.279
 text of 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:25.919
 quesada spectator in order that some of that 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.169
 I put him one I laugh 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.900
 because that counterpoint is with me there are always three or four that I 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.259
 I put in during the whole show even then he stressed 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.009
 I like to 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.409
 that the public is tense as saying 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.769
 leads to hit a host 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.729
 I like that caused people to be what I'm good at all people but eye 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.049
 provoking good vibes 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.170
 that is to say that I have the spectator pissed off but then I win it and I get 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.349
 of the viewer 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.749
 do not feel humiliated 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:00.969
 and he laughs too with the show 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.359
 justified 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.959
 this was indicated every day in the afternoon 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.379
 precious less rigid because gustavo and even in the hand-held name 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:16.139
 I had a hard time when I'm going to act even if you put yourself in a biosca 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:20.319
 I like it here, I like gustavo liestal comics, say joel, comedians, decide 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.129
 because people remember me puerto rico decide 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.290
 those who are familiar know that he showed me biosca but what they resort to 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.979
 the people of toledo decide 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.899
 pro-Palestinian activists 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.899
 abaroa 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:42.329
 of course I will go back to is more than that I'm there 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.589
 seeing that the public asks to give it is that this did not mean andahuaylas to do 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.739
 that delay or amount I do not know what 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 I do not have admits 2015 is the noisemaker 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.609
 it's the noisemaker 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:54.959
 so 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.309
 the assault and January many times landecho 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.079
 while at 16 in the Basque country 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.959
 and the prolana was I was the bullfighter sense 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.409
 3 people 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.409
 confused with the chest mañama follonero min down the street 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.029
 the noisemaker but he has a radio that I do not have and we do two things 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:13.679
 totally different 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.679
 but we go or in the shadow of the noisemaker what I can tell you 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.870
 aesthetics or with the tunnel with me knows 0 he has his own program his 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.029
 own program because it makes another roll 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.900
 Soto said but what I do has nothing to do with what he does outside the 

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:31.329
 expo study completely different neither better nor worse photo dyn 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.850
 50s opposite way in all 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.430
 and each of them 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.610
 in all 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.190
 in all but especially the ones that she does at the beginning because at the beginning she 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.360
 program writer and I proposed this section for another comedian 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.780
 Santiago Santiago told me not comedic actors and screenwriter of the program 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.259
 other 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.599
 jamie redo the io 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.999
 and vote within two months they said come at all costs a round of applause 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.110
 been and I had to do it myself 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.270
 already from the first ones that were the barranquillas the mario heron party 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.650
 He spoke about the Basque country I had a terrible time 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.629
 I had a terrible time then I realized 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.819
 who started to move the noise that causes people 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.279
 I had a hard time but I was cool 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.319
 I was cool, I had a bad time in all of them but especially if 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.800
 and in passing more outside the castle there was a ghost 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.969
 the awards the entire castle 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.159
 sky I heard the ghost 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.159
 and I was scared where the balls were in the castle 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.719
 olga cannon hiriart cuba television 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.419
