00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.590
 If you want to put other vegetables 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.989

 add half a glass of wine 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.290
 white or any other drink to 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.799
 take that nasty smell of 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.430
 raw chicken and beans for about two 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.590
 minutes after two minutes Drain 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.900
 chicken and clean any residues that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.549
 are trained in staying as well as 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.310
 the little legs that are still 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.350
 and made a cut in the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.170
 chubby sauce for the electric sauce with 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.030
 more easily 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.700
 now let's prepare the sauce mix one 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.619
 spoon of water thrown with two spoons 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.259
 of generous soup to cut already three to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.280
 four tablespoons of expensive kut 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:49.500
 the red pepper powder 3 tablespoons 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.280
 soy sauce soup two tablespoons of 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.280
 corn glucose 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.270
 and two tablespoons of honey 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.870
 if you do not you can use the wine 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.700
 white and black pepper to taste and some 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.010
 two pinches of salt 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.780
 Now mix well so this sauce 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:17.130
 stay homogeneous over high heat and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:19.590
 the carrots potatoes the chicken and you go 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.810
 need to put three glasses of water 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.760
 I only put one part because people 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.790
 will need to put the sauce of any 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.360
 Way I think I'm going to take advantage of the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:35.520
 water to avoid wasting sauce and 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.550
 whisk the sauce well in the water and let it boil 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.280
 for 5 minutes the high heat 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.490
 after five minutes let's lower the fire 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.010
 for medium heat and with the help of a 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.890
 spoon let's wet the chicken with the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.070
 broth and leave for 10 minutes on fire 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070
 medium 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:03.110
 after ten minutes when joining the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:03.110
 onion the chilies 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.510
 let's keep boiling for five more 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.510
 little 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.560
 after 15 minutes 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:26.300
 Let's put the chives and boil them 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.300
 one more minute or two 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:39.050
 is ready our delicious soup of 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:40.220
 chicken with potatoes and vegetables and now is the 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.200
 time to prove 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.610
 today my husband is going to be late then 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.610
 I'm going to eat alone 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.579
 the car is very dense as I like the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.110
 My spicy but not so spicy 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.629
 with that my suspicion to say it 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.180
 it 's not something we eat here 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.180
 with rice picking up a little here 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.450

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.660
 sweet potatoes and chicken with 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.850
 bacon but it's not good 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.500
 do not forget to wash your hands and 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.540

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.280
