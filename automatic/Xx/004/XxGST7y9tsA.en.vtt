the<00:00:15.040> process<00:00:15.280> how<00:00:15.759> quickly<00:00:15.999> came<00:00:16.299> together

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
the process how quickly came together

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.269 
the process how quickly came together
and<00:00:16.660> how<00:00:16.750> good<00:00:16.990> this<00:00:17.169> thing<00:00:17.380> looks<00:00:17.650> yeah<00:00:18.250> I

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
and how good this thing looks yeah I

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.740 
and how good this thing looks yeah I
mean<00:00:18.520> obviously<00:00:18.669> we<00:00:19.090> all<00:00:19.180> start<00:00:19.450> off<00:00:19.539> with<00:00:19.720> a

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
mean obviously we all start off with a

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.269 
mean obviously we all start off with a
concept<00:00:20.200> of<00:00:20.349> what<00:00:20.500> we<00:00:20.619> expect<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.070> car<00:00:21.250> to

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
concept of what we expect the car to

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.279 
concept of what we expect the car to
look<00:00:21.490> like<00:00:21.670> I<00:00:21.699> want<00:00:22.000> it<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.210> look<00:00:22.300> like<00:00:22.359> that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
look like I want it to look like that

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.509 
look like I want it to look like that
probably<00:00:23.619> dead<00:00:23.800> took<00:00:23.980> longer<00:00:24.220> than<00:00:24.400> yet

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
probably dead took longer than yet

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.679 
probably dead took longer than yet
probably<00:00:24.699> took<00:00:24.910> a<00:00:24.970> couple<00:00:25.179> of<00:00:25.240> weeks<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.570> get

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
probably took a couple of weeks to get

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.630 
probably took a couple of weeks to get
it<00:00:25.779> to<00:00:25.869> where<00:00:25.990> we<00:00:26.109> wanted<00:00:26.349> it<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:27.160> then<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.519> was

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
it to where we wanted it and then it was

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.099 
it to where we wanted it and then it was
how<00:00:27.849> could<00:00:28.029> they<00:00:28.119> build<00:00:28.300> it<00:00:28.509> and<00:00:28.689> follow<00:00:28.900> that

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
how could they build it and follow that

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.800 
how could they build it and follow that
so<00:00:29.470> we've<00:00:30.070> got<00:00:30.310> to<00:00:30.519> where<00:00:31.089> we<00:00:31.119> are<00:00:31.269> today<00:00:31.390> by

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
so we've got to where we are today by

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.079 
so we've got to where we are today by
obviously<00:00:31.990> countless<00:00:32.589> hours<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:33.190> not<00:00:33.910> to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
obviously countless hours and not to

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:36.180 
obviously countless hours and not to
mention<00:00:34.470> thousands<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.620> thousand<00:00:35.890> hours<00:00:36.010> in

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
mention thousands and thousand hours in

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.039 
mention thousands and thousand hours in

something<00:01:40.929> with<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.499> as<00:01:42.159> we<00:01:42.369> know<00:01:42.490> on<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
something with it and as we know on the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.830 
something with it and as we know on the
Indy<00:01:43.450> car<00:01:43.659> a<00:01:43.960> larger<00:01:44.859> undoing<00:01:45.539> it<00:01:46.539> becomes

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
Indy car a larger undoing it becomes

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.569 
Indy car a larger undoing it becomes
detrimental<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.469> the<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.130> lift<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
detrimental to the to the lift of the

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.660 
detrimental to the to the lift of the
car<00:01:48.759> so<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.929> under<00:01:50.229> wing<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.950> really

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
car so this under wing is is really

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.390 
car so this under wing is is really

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.540

a<00:01:53.430> lot<00:01:53.670> around<00:01:53.910> what<00:01:54.150> we<00:01:54.240> learnt<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.570> IndyCar

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
a lot around what we learnt on IndyCar

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.090 
a lot around what we learnt on IndyCar
but<00:01:57.560> thousands<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.650> hours<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
but thousands of hours and the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.290 
but thousands of hours and the
Windtunnel<00:01:59.520> got<00:01:59.670> us<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.910> where<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.120> are<00:02:00.150> here

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
Windtunnel got us to where we are here

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.100 
Windtunnel got us to where we are here
and<00:02:01.460> just<00:02:02.460> coincidentally<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.450> increase<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and just coincidentally we increase the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.200 
and just coincidentally we increase the
lift<00:02:04.260> speed<00:02:04.590> from<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.860> time<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.250> started<00:02:05.610> this

lift speed from the time we started this

lift speed from the time we started this
time<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.600> finished<00:02:06.930> by<00:02:07.080> about<00:02:07.290> thirty<00:02:07.620> mile<00:02:07.770> an

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.100 
time we finished by about thirty mile an
hour<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.940> speed<00:02:09.180> that<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.360> takes<00:02:09.630> off<00:02:09.840> at<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
hour so the speed that it takes off at a

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.710

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
about thirty mile an hour which is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.070 
about thirty mile an hour which is

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
baby's got some power and it's

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.620 
baby's got some power and it's
turbocharged<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.910> really<00:02:42.209> like<00:02:42.390> right

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
