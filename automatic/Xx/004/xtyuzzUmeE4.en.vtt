00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it let's get started the first one is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.640 
it let's get started the first one is
for<00:01:11.790> hand<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.030> backhand<00:01:12.510> I'll<00:01:13.320> show<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.560> what

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
for hand to backhand I'll show you what

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
for hand to backhand I'll show you what
it<00:01:13.710> looks<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.950> right<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.420> but<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.870> can<00:01:16.050> move

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it looks like right now but you can move

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.830 
it looks like right now but you can move
the<00:01:16.590> left<00:01:16.770> analog<00:01:17.040> stick<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.480> down

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the left analog stick right or down

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.920 
the left analog stick right or down
it'll<00:01:19.410> both<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> same<00:01:20.220> deke<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.540> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it'll both do the same deke for this I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.950 
it'll both do the same deke for this I
moved<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.950> down<00:01:23.120> but<00:01:24.120> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.390> also<00:01:24.480> move<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
moved it down but you can also move it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.450 
moved it down but you can also move it
to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> left<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:25.800> will<00:01:25.920> still<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.370> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
to the left and it will still do the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.220 
to the left and it will still do the
same<00:01:26.670> deke<00:01:32.360> second<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> backhand<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
same deke second one is backhand the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.410 
same deke second one is backhand the
forehand<00:01:35.780> same<00:01:36.780> thing<00:01:37.050> kind<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:37.830> verse

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
forehand same thing kind of just verse

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.420 
forehand same thing kind of just verse
you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.570> move<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.020> left<00:01:40.140> analog<00:01:40.380> stick<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:41.070> or

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you can move the left analog stick up or

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.160 
you can move the left analog stick up or
to<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:41.760> left<00:01:41.880> both<00:01:42.660> ways<00:01:43.080> work<00:01:44.780> third<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to the left both ways work third one is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.730 
to the left both ways work third one is
back<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> backhand<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.590> can

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
back in the backhand you just you can

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.190 
back in the backhand you just you can
also<00:01:50.010> move<00:01:50.370> the<00:01:50.700> left<00:01:50.970> analog<00:01:51.150> stick<00:01:51.300> right<00:01:51.960> or

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
also move the left analog stick right or

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.810 
also move the left analog stick right or
you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.440> move<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> straight<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.700> with

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you can move it straight down but with

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.730 
you can move it straight down but with
ways<00:01:54.030> you'll<00:01:54.300> do<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.750> same<00:01:54.990> exact<00:01:55.500> deke<00:01:55.800> on

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
ways you'll do the same exact deke on

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.340 
ways you'll do the same exact deke on
for<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:59.070> yep<00:01:59.400> anyways<00:02:00.260> through<00:02:01.260> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
for this one yep anyways through the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.730 
for this one yep anyways through the
legs<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.570> eat<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.900> you<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> flick

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
legs you can eat just you have to flick

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.160 
legs you can eat just you have to flick
the<00:02:04.979> left<00:02:05.340> analog<00:02:05.520> stick<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:06.090> or<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.780> won't<00:02:06.990> do

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the left analog stick up or it won't do

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290 
the left analog stick up or it won't do
it<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:08.129> that's<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> only<00:02:08.399> option<00:02:08.909> some<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it so that's the only option some of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.460 
it so that's the only option some of
them<00:02:09.450> yet<00:02:09.659> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.989> plug<00:02:10.110> them<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.349> two

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
them yet you can plug them in two

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.229 
them yet you can plug them in two
different<00:02:10.649> directions<00:02:10.849> but<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
different directions but this one you

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.009 
different directions but this one you
have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.480> flick<00:02:12.719> up<00:02:13.189> then<00:02:14.189> five<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:15.269> can<00:02:15.689> flick

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
have to flick up then five you can flick

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.480 
have to flick up then five you can flick
it<00:02:16.139> up<00:02:16.349> or<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.799> can<00:02:16.920> plug<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.159> a<00:02:17.219> little

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
it up or you can plug it's a little

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.670 
it up or you can plug it's a little
so<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.180> get<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.840> left<00:02:19.050> analog<00:02:19.380> stick<00:02:19.410> you

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
so you can get a left analog stick you

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.610 
so you can get a left analog stick you
can<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:19.980> straight<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.760> or<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.390> left<00:02:21.620> both

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
can just straight up or to the left both

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.810 
can just straight up or to the left both
will<00:02:22.890> do<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.190> same<00:02:23.220> exact<00:02:23.700> deke<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:25.820> number

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
will do the same exact deke on number

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.850 
will do the same exact deke on number
six<00:02:27.120> may<00:02:27.390> use<00:02:27.600> make<00:02:27.780> sure<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.990> pull<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.230> pull

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
back to a toe drag first before you

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.600 
back to a toe drag first before you
start<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:31.890> move<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.340> down

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
start this one and you can move it down

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.690 
start this one and you can move it down
or<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.540> right<00:02:33.920> both<00:02:34.920> ways<00:02:35.130> will<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.550> it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
or to the right both ways will do it

back to your chode rag and then make

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.970 
back to your chode rag and then make
sure<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.340> release<00:02:48.050> both<00:02:49.050> analog<00:02:49.470> sticks<00:02:49.770> then

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
sure you release both analog sticks then

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.560 
sure you release both analog sticks then
flick<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:50.460> one<00:02:50.610> down<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.120> left<00:02:51.390> one

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
