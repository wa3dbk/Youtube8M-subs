chart here we go with my first ever

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.249 
chart here we go with my first ever
practice<00:01:49.709> 25<00:01:50.250> reps<00:01:50.550> but<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.450> some<00:01:51.599> reason<00:01:52.050> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
practice 25 reps but for some reason I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.589 
practice 25 reps but for some reason I
had<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.649> leave<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.459> practice<00:01:53.670> mode<00:01:54.119> halfway

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
had to leave the practice mode halfway

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:56.630 
had to leave the practice mode halfway
through<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.440> I<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.739> back<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.220> had<00:01:56.459> about

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
through and as I got back in I had about

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.089 
through and as I got back in I had about
three<00:01:57.030> reps<00:01:57.270> left<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:57.929> it<00:01:58.110> basically<00:01:58.770> took

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
three reps left and it basically took

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.609 
three reps left and it basically took
away<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.700> XP<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.330> had<00:02:00.539> gained<00:02:00.840> prior

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
away all the XP that I had gained prior

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.740 
away all the XP that I had gained prior
to<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.039> but<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.340> believe<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.879> still<00:02:03.119> saved<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.569> so

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to it but I believe it still saved it so

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.339 
to it but I believe it still saved it so
easy<00:02:03.929> right<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.200> I'm<00:02:04.950> at<00:02:05.160> 103<00:02:05.580> out<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.149> 150<00:02:06.690> XP

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
easy right now I'm at 103 out of 150 XP

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.850 
easy right now I'm at 103 out of 150 XP

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.990 
we end up getting a touchdown although I
wasn't<00:06:16.500> in<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.710> game<00:06:16.919> but<00:06:17.160> I<00:06:17.370> get<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:17.820> ball

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.020 
once again here yet another possession
you<00:06:21.570> guys<00:06:21.810> know<00:06:22.050> my<00:06:22.680> defense<00:06:23.250> is<00:06:23.520> putting<00:06:23.940> in

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
you guys know my defense is putting in

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.760 
you guys know my defense is putting in
that<00:06:24.150> work<00:06:24.210> and<00:06:24.630> giving<00:06:24.960> us<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.229> ball<00:06:25.350> back<00:06:25.560> in

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
that work and giving us the ball back in

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.150 
that work and giving us the ball back in
I<00:06:25.919> dived<00:06:26.220> my<00:06:26.430> way<00:06:26.610> in<00:06:26.880> for<00:06:27.750> my<00:06:27.990> first<00:06:28.380> rushing

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
I dived my way in for my first rushing

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.279 
I dived my way in for my first rushing
touchdown<00:06:29.639> so<00:06:29.910> we<00:06:30.030> get<00:06:30.180> one<00:06:30.510> receiving

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
touchdown so we get one receiving

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.320 
touchdown so we get one receiving
touchdown<00:06:31.800> and<00:06:32.070> now<00:06:32.610> one<00:06:32.910> rushing<00:06:33.300> touchdown

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
touchdown and now one rushing touchdown

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.310 
touchdown and now one rushing touchdown
and<00:06:34.020> the<00:06:34.800> game<00:06:35.039> is<00:06:35.250> not<00:06:35.520> over<00:06:35.970> yet<00:06:36.080> how<00:06:37.080> big

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
and the game is not over yet how big

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.110 
and the game is not over yet how big
could<00:06:37.500> it<00:06:37.560> be<00:06:37.770> if<00:06:37.979> I<00:06:38.160> get<00:06:38.340> three<00:06:38.610> touchdowns

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
could it be if I get three touchdowns

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.680 
could it be if I get three touchdowns
right<00:06:39.360> here<00:06:39.600> and<00:06:39.950> only<00:06:40.950> about<00:06:41.160> one<00:06:41.910> quarter<00:06:42.479> I

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
right here and only about one quarter I

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.690 
right here and only about one quarter I
mean<00:06:43.229> technically<00:06:43.740> we<00:06:43.830> checked<00:06:44.250> in<00:06:44.400> late<00:06:44.639> in

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
mean technically we checked in late in

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.580 
mean technically we checked in late in
the<00:06:44.850> third<00:06:45.090> quarter<00:06:45.450> so<00:06:45.600> that<00:06:45.750> does<00:06:45.930> not<00:06:46.110> count

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
the third quarter so that does not count

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.219 
the third quarter so that does not count
so<00:06:47.039> we're<00:06:47.280> basically<00:06:47.669> set<00:06:48.539> up<00:06:48.660> here<00:06:48.900> to<00:06:48.930> have

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
so we're basically set up here to have

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:51.520 
so we're basically set up here to have
yet<00:06:49.470> another<00:06:49.650> touchdown<00:06:50.250> and<00:06:50.729> that<00:06:51.330> is

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
yet another touchdown and that is

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.250 
yet another touchdown and that is
exactly<00:06:52.530> what<00:06:53.190> I<00:06:53.220> do<00:06:53.460> so<00:06:54.240> what<00:06:54.479> a<00:06:54.539> de<00:06:54.960> beauté

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 
exactly what I do so what a de beauté

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.680 
exactly what I do so what a de beauté
right<00:06:55.470> here<00:06:55.800> although<00:06:56.039> my<00:06:56.760> debut<00:06:57.180> was<00:06:57.389> a<00:06:57.419> weak

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
right here although my debut was a weak

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.719 
right here although my debut was a weak
one<00:06:57.960> I<00:06:58.200> came<00:06:58.289> out<00:06:58.770> here<00:06:58.979> a<00:06:59.010> week<00:06:59.250> to<00:06:59.490> and

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
one I came out here a week to and

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:02.840 
one I came out here a week to and
actually<00:07:00.330> got<00:07:00.570> reps<00:07:00.990> with<00:07:01.830> the<00:07:02.010> starters<00:07:02.580> and

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
actually got reps with the starters and

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.469 
actually got reps with the starters and
I<00:07:03.330> took<00:07:03.389> advantage<00:07:03.870> of<00:07:04.710> every<00:07:05.250> single<00:07:06.000> place

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 
I took advantage of every single place

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.520 
I took advantage of every single place
so<00:07:06.750> we<00:07:06.870> are<00:07:06.990> headed<00:07:07.350> into<00:07:07.560> week<00:07:07.950> number

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
so we are headed into week number

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.460 
so we are headed into week number
and<00:07:08.830> guess<00:07:09.370> what<00:07:09.640> happens<00:07:10.120> we<00:07:10.630> are<00:07:10.810> granted

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
and guess what happens we are granted

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.980 
and guess what happens we are granted
