00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.009 
average output to a lower output pickup
then<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.830> can<00:02:21.980> turn<00:02:22.220> it

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
then you can turn it

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.460 
then you can turn it
more<00:02:23.530> clockwise<00:02:24.239> again<00:02:25.239> in<00:02:25.569> keeping<00:02:26.019> with<00:02:26.379> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
more clockwise again in keeping with the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.009 
more clockwise again in keeping with the
thinking<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.920> keeping<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.970> mighty<00:02:28.450> micro

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
thinking of keeping the mighty micro

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.869 
thinking of keeping the mighty micro
line<00:02:29.650> pedals<00:02:30.430> small<00:02:31.799> Gaytan<00:02:32.799> also<00:02:33.280> put<00:02:33.579> the

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
line pedals small Gaytan also put the

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.479 
line pedals small Gaytan also put the
power<00:02:34.329> and<00:02:34.689> the<00:02:35.079> input<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.890> output<00:02:35.920> jacks

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
power and the input and the output jacks

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.610

on<00:02:37.030> top<00:02:37.329> of<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.569> pedal<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.379> more

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
on top of the pedal so you have more

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.770 
on top of the pedal so you have more
room<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:39.010> your<00:02:39.040> board<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:40.359> fit<00:02:40.629> more<00:02:40.900> pedals

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
room on your board to fit more pedals

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.580 
room on your board to fit more pedals
they<00:02:43.780> also<00:02:44.760> put<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> stop<00:02:46.180> guard<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:47.349> these

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
they also put a stop guard on these

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.759 
they also put a stop guard on these
pedals<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.510> took<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.629> off<00:02:49.780> for<00:02:50.170> purposes<00:02:50.709> of

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
pedals I took it off for purposes of

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.530 
pedals I took it off for purposes of
this<00:02:51.069> demonstration<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:52.090> you'll<00:02:52.209> see<00:02:52.390> where

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
this demonstration but you'll see where

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.240 
this demonstration but you'll see where
these<00:02:52.659> two<00:02:52.930> screws<00:02:53.349> are<00:02:53.560> there<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> stomp

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
these two screws are there is a stomp

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.140 
these two screws are there is a stomp
guard<00:02:54.579> that<00:02:55.239> comes<00:02:55.510> right<00:02:55.750> across<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.290> top

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
guard that comes right across the top

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.660 
guard that comes right across the top
which<00:02:58.150> just<00:02:58.389> helps<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.500> if<00:02:59.709> your<00:02:59.950> foot

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
which just helps so that if your foot

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.629 
which just helps so that if your foot
comes<00:03:00.909> down<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.359> accidentally<00:03:01.870> slip<00:03:02.260> as<00:03:02.639> you

switch<00:03:44.949> I<00:03:45.220> have<00:03:45.669> this<00:03:46.150> two<00:03:46.750> off<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:48.250> it's

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
switch I have this two off so it's

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.099 
switch I have this two off so it's
really<00:03:48.549> going<00:03:48.699> to<00:03:48.790> bypass<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.510> whole<00:03:49.540> pedal

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
really going to bypass the whole pedal

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.229 
really going to bypass the whole pedal
except<00:03:50.949> for<00:03:51.159> the<00:03:51.250> level<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.790> that's<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:52.060> main

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
except for the level and that's the main

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.780 
except for the level and that's the main
thing<00:03:52.510> here<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:52.810> want<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.049> use<00:03:53.169> it<00:03:53.319> as<00:03:53.409> a<00:03:53.440> booster

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
thing here I want to use it as a booster

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.349 
thing here I want to use it as a booster
so<00:03:54.790> I'll<00:03:55.359> play<00:03:55.540> some<00:03:55.780> things<00:03:56.019> here<00:03:56.409> first

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
so I'll play some things here first

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:21.450 
so I'll play some things here first
without<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.479> pedal

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.469

I'll<00:04:33.169> just<00:04:33.440> boost<00:04:33.740> that<00:04:33.949> as<00:04:34.130> well<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.720> it's

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
I'll just boost that as well and it's

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.810 
I'll just boost that as well and it's
perfect<00:04:36.169> when<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.470> solo<00:04:36.860> comes<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.610> you

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
3:00 without the pedal I just get this

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:14.140 
3:00 without the pedal I just get this
sound<00:05:04.580> here

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:38.510 

and<00:05:15.150> then<00:05:15.270> when<00:05:15.390> I<00:05:15.420> engage<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:38.190> just<00:05:38.370> gives

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
and then when I engage it it just gives

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.400

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.080 
me a really nice tunnel character and I
can<00:05:40.590> sweep<00:05:40.890> the<00:05:40.950> shape

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:06:05.370 

this<00:05:46.090> way<00:05:46.270> now<00:06:03.150> now<00:06:04.150> let's<00:06:04.360> say<00:06:04.600> I<00:06:04.630> wanted<00:06:05.080> to

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
this way now now let's say I wanted to

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.550 
this way now now let's say I wanted to
simulate<00:06:06.190> in<00:06:06.699> acoustic<00:06:07.389> sound<00:06:08.080> more<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.530> a

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
simulate in acoustic sound more of a

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.850 
simulate in acoustic sound more of a
hollow<00:06:08.770> body<00:06:09.039> sound<00:06:09.370> I<00:06:09.699> can<00:06:10.210> do<00:06:10.330> that<00:06:10.539> too

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
hollow body sound I can do that too

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:19.399 
hollow body sound I can do that too
without<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:12.009> pedal<00:06:12.190> of<00:06:12.520> course<00:06:12.759> I<00:06:12.910> would<00:06:13.060> have

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.679 

I'm<00:06:20.069> real<00:06:20.219> solid<00:06:20.519> biotypes<00:06:20.999> am<00:06:21.269> tough<00:06:21.569> I

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:21.689 
I'm real solid biotypes am tough I

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:28.329 
I'm real solid biotypes am tough I
engage<00:06:21.899> the<00:06:22.080> pedal<00:06:22.409> now<00:06:26.479> gives<00:06:27.479> me<00:06:27.539> more<00:06:27.719> that

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:28.339 
engage the pedal now gives me more that

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.529 
engage the pedal now gives me more that
hollowness<00:06:29.339> so<00:06:29.819> if<00:06:29.939> I<00:06:30.029> play<00:06:30.179> a<00:06:30.209> little<00:06:30.330> bit

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
hollowness so if I play a little bit

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.959 
hollowness so if I play a little bit
this<00:06:30.599> for<00:06:30.839> you
