00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:34.190
 yes that is a gram start-up it is exactly 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.800
 I you 555 '72 subject to very 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.850
 I think strong information in the carriage 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.530
 before pedaling that is if here 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.360
 when met and loop like this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.470
 I press the pedal there yes that is, he and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.660
 hand even shake 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.690
 and itâ€™s very easy for the whole carriage carriage to go 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.820
 knot it says that the novel 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.800
 pretty soft plasticine deities 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.629
 because she loves him I used to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.390
 achieve absolutely can not get out of place 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.700
 and 2 bike aluminum well I don't know 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.010
 maybe this is my frame at least 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.030
 the old 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.460
 presented here five years on the balcony 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 presented therefore the whole will go a little 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 sorry you 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.690
 but the pipes seem to be internally rusty to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.560
 this is such a funny job 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:34.799
 here's another thing to check the steering glass 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.710
 information because I really 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.659
 interesting really 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 how will he behave because 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.920
 Handling over the chassis is not the most 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.770
 best i don't seem secret or on 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.560
 handling lies just softness 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.179
 the whole frame even seemed excessive 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.030
 softness because well, that it is developed 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:06.289
 so good when not even all the weight on 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.289
 leg move if the frame walks walker
