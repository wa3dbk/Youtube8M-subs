00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 so hello to everyone and today i will talk about 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.880
 main criteria as long as you can 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:13.080
 distinguish a pirated disc from a license 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.790
 so the first criterion is an inscription 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.090
 games for windows not ever on 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.689
 license disks license disks 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:28.109
 writes like this from sit and here's another 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:33.920
 examples of mass here for example yes where 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.239
 here now if i had more 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 I would show you the disks 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:45.329
 Again I buy everything in the incentive so further it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.070
 will not be written on the face green on 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.620
 license disk is always written 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.020
 the language in which here comes the game here 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.870
 now focus not completely on 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.989
 Russian language see in the same 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.589
 it is written yes but on what here 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.200
 so here 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.210
 pirated drives nowhere will this 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.450
 No written here is an inscription what is it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.280
 fully in Russian 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 when not on some pirates written 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 all the same you see here pirates yes on 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.130
 it is written to her but again it burns here 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.900
 what game your nose so another 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.770
 the main criterion by which you can 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.299
 to distinguish 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.430
 This is such an inscription as 9 in one such 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.850
 inscriptions will never be licensed 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.369
 drive here every three in one hundred there 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.030
 five hundred in one I never know 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.450
 will be in the license disk 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.549
 here is another criterion which flight 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.170
 then 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.890
 always on the license disk will be 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.210
 written by 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.950
 age restrictions you see here 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.340
 the same pirate drive there is no 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.500
 age restrictions are true 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.119
 some pirated discs on which 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.219
 write age restrictions but 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.720
 again their flight games for windows 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:13.420
 Here is an inscription on it 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.320
 Article main criteria here again 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.580
 You see, you can immediately burn the games for 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.860
 windows there is a unique collection of trawling 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.800
 outrages to games and of course this 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.190
 there will not be more than 40 of them for 100 rubles 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.890
 for example, this will never happen anywhere 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.810

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.720

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.560
