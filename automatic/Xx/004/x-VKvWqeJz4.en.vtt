unique way to make me proud and to be

unique way to make me proud and to be
functional<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.710> main<00:00:41.980> issue<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.430> we<00:00:42.579> saw

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
functional the main issue that we saw

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.450 
functional the main issue that we saw
was<00:00:43.329> most<00:00:43.870> growlers<00:00:44.289> have<00:00:44.500> threaded<00:00:44.920> lids<00:00:45.219> and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
was most growlers have threaded lids and

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.400 
was most growlers have threaded lids and
the<00:00:45.550> problem<00:00:46.059> is<00:00:46.239> is<00:00:46.719> you<00:00:46.780> can't<00:00:47.109> get<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.260> good

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
the problem is is you can't get a good

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.619 
the problem is is you can't get a good
seal<00:00:47.829> and<00:00:48.129> what<00:00:48.250> happens<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.090> carbonation

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
seal and what happens is the carbonation

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.349 
seal and what happens is the carbonation
with<00:00:49.780> rear<00:00:49.989> creates<00:00:50.289> pressure<00:00:50.559> and

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
with rear creates pressure and

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.520 
with rear creates pressure and
ultimately<00:00:52.359> comes<00:00:52.600> out<00:00:52.780> of<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:52.960> threads<00:00:53.320> and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
ultimately comes out of the threads and

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.259 
ultimately comes out of the threads and
you<00:00:53.590> lose<00:00:53.859> that<00:00:54.190> great<00:00:54.670> combination<00:00:55.179> that

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
you lose that great combination that

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.900 
you lose that great combination that
makes<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:55.539> good<00:00:55.719> quality<00:00:56.289> beer<00:00:56.679> one<00:00:57.670> company
