00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.710
 descended us the launcher and you 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.020
 need a little climb let's say you 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.710
 drove past their work front to 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.509
 past the place where you need to work you can 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.000
 to use the trigger to lift 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:41.510
 the device does not move on the clamps like 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.480
 do this take the bags with the pedal like 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:50.359
 Usually it is higher than the trigger 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.000
 after that compared to the usual 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.800
 pedal position with normal length 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.280
 the pedals we need 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.199
 when climbing on the wing we have a little bit 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.570
 increase this is done in order to 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.210
 It was a comfortable step because the trigger 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.100
 stands taller than king 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:18.020
 after that we put our foot in the pedal 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:20.210
 run a rope in his hand a pen we start Haydee 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.159
 in anti-panic if you have some other 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.479
 the device is simply removable from 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.729
 lock and after that without losing 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.880
 ropes and hands so as the trigger has 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.380
 we are not blocked we start lifting 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.979
 that is, we also raise noise above we get up 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.310
 raise we stretch the rope through 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:47.560
 trigger do not forget to follow 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:52.360
 for insurance and in this way 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.360
 go up where we need 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.979
 that is, also how to climb 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.200
 the trigger can descend at the clamps 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.259
 This method is used much less frequently than 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.349
 raising us launcher but he 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.220
 sometimes it is necessary he first goes to 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.340
 exercise go over the knot on the descent 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.989
 as well as if you need for example in 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.370
 time saved works go down by 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.489
 loaded rope 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.060
 that is, letters except at the terminals you 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:31.019
 do not go down means this method 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.480
 what looks like you need your clamps by 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:40.560
 queues to lower at some distance 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.810
 steps here squeezing this one cam here 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.680
 that is, it can be done in two ways 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.739
 either using a special notch 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.790
 let him dojima i cam either 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.410
 top click on the cam like this 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.950
 in no case can not be taken on 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.440
 plasticity is this dog and open 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.670
 zhumar or krol completely well 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.500
 actually as a two step climb with 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.790
 pedal'ku get up challenge 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.989
 the king's cam come down after that 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.010
 second hand 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.370
 not to waste time on the triton trigger 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.810
 descend the throne, preferably a rope 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.049
 arrange for it to pass through 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.870
 king clinging to counters on nick 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:37.639
 the street then the rope will pass 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.639
 easier down 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.390
 delay 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.690
 used to make rope 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.730
 reject to the desired us Plantu works 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.420
 if we are directly from there immediately 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.000
 relief we canâ€™t decide hard not 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.250
 is a reliable insurance point then 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.480
 there we do not use it for insurance 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.670
 she only pulls our rope 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.129
 means how to pass the chunks us 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.660
 we launch us launcher 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:23.580
 until we get down just below the point 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.370
 attachments from grievous we pull up to 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.130
 heavy for a knot if we can't just 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.630
 get hold of hand knot should be 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:37.190
 tied somewhere below below a meter hard on 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.180
 three or at the very end often knit it 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.729
 this knot tightened knuckles and 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.680
 retract 2 karabiner quickdraws above our 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:52.919
 devices zuma 2 other 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.479
 two carbines are here not to 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:01.940
 lose the delay do not fly away when 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:05.910
 hauling rope and stitches through the tightness 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.289
 after this lower carabiner you can already 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.080
 unfasten the knot 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.680
 need to cut if it is not at the very 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:20.430
 end of the rope tied all the rope 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:24.110
 let go and go down already in 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.110
 another plane 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.580
 passing the backs up we come up to 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.130
 a cup 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.730
 we bring to it the devices we take 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.360
 the rope 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:50.980
 lower your tired get her in 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:57.700
 free carabiner quickdraws 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:06:07.830
 an imago clutch we tie a knot lower by three 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:11.970
 meters we let the rope after that 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:14.740
 scour your top carbine and 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.990
 pulling in and pulling out 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:25.140
 carbine 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:25.140
 smoothly side and you can continue climbing
