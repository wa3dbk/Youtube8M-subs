00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
right now the build quality on this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
right now the build quality on this
machine<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.840> outstanding<00:02:52.360> it's<00:02:53.360> very<00:02:53.630> rugged

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
machine is outstanding it's very rugged

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.930 
machine is outstanding it's very rugged
and<00:02:54.710> by<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.190> mean<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.580> looks<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.820> a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
and by that I mean it looks like a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.450 
and by that I mean it looks like a
stealth<00:02:56.240> farmer<00:02:56.690> almost<00:02:57.050> on<00:02:57.770> how<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:58.190> just

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
stealth farmer almost on how it's just

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.140 
stealth farmer almost on how it's just
so<00:02:58.640> like<00:02:58.880> military<00:02:59.950> it's<00:03:00.950> fairly<00:03:01.250> thick<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:02.120> I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
so like military it's fairly thick but I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.550 
so like military it's fairly thick but I
mean<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.900> look<00:03:03.020> good<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.320> you're<00:03:03.410> getting

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
mean you look good and you're getting

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.330 
mean you look good and you're getting
more<00:03:03.860> power<00:03:04.070> than<00:03:04.310> some<00:03:04.550> desktops<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:06.350> I<00:03:06.650> mean

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
more power than some desktops so I mean

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.150 
more power than some desktops so I mean
you<00:03:07.550> can<00:03:07.700> either<00:03:07.790> get<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.360> laptop<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.620> desktop

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
you can either get a laptop I desktop

3sw<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:19.040> they<00:03:19.790> said<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.090> was<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.210> downgrade<00:03:20.750> to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
3sw and they said it was a downgrade to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.250 
3sw and they said it was a downgrade to
go<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.290> alien<00:03:22.250> where<00:03:22.400> I'm<00:03:22.490> 14x<00:03:23.090> but<00:03:24.080> I

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
go to a alien where I'm 14x but I

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.980 
go to a alien where I'm 14x but I
actually<00:03:24.970> people<00:03:25.970> were<00:03:26.180> saying<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.600> is<00:03:26.960> a

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
actually people were saying that it is a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.660 
actually people were saying that it is a
weaker<00:03:27.910> video<00:03:28.910> card<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.270> it<00:03:29.450> actually<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:30.670> but

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
weaker video card and it actually is but

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.340 
weaker video card and it actually is but
the<00:03:31.820> thing<00:03:31.970> is<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:32.360> very<00:03:32.450> overclockable

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
the thing is it's very overclockable

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.920 
the thing is it's very overclockable
meaning<00:03:33.950> it's<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:34.280> very<00:03:34.520> easy<00:03:34.820> whereas<00:03:35.690> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
meaning it's like very easy whereas the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.930 
meaning it's like very easy whereas the
460<00:03:36.710> has<00:03:36.830> actually<00:03:37.220> seen<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.400> couple<00:03:37.610> glitches

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
460 has actually seen a couple glitches

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.270 
460 has actually seen a couple glitches
with<00:03:38.570> that<00:03:38.780> not<00:03:39.050> me<00:03:39.290> personally<00:03:39.560> but<00:03:39.980> I've

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
with that not me personally but I've

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.120 
with that not me personally but I've
read<00:03:40.490> on<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.870> anyway<00:03:41.870> what<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.560> thing<00:03:42.740> is<00:03:42.770> I

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
read on that anyway what the thing is I

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.620 
read on that anyway what the thing is I
can<00:03:43.430> run<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:43.790> computer<00:03:44.210> at<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.360> lower

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
can run this computer at a lower

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.000 
can run this computer at a lower
resolution<00:03:44.900> on<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:45.980> Asus<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.730> get<00:03:47.390> as<00:03:47.630> good

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
resolution on the Asus and get as good

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.800 
resolution on the Asus and get as good
pixel<00:03:49.010> density<00:03:49.430> as<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.700> Asus<00:03:50.240> because<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:50.720> a

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
pixel density as the Asus because it's a

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.190 
pixel density as the Asus because it's a
14<00:03:51.170> inch<00:03:51.320> screen<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.800> course<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.600> 17<00:03:54.020> inch

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
14 inch screen of course and the 17 inch

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.550 
14 inch screen of course and the 17 inch
screen<00:03:54.820> so<00:03:55.820> it<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.480> could<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.170> can<00:03:57.380> lower

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
screen so it can it could you can lower

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.080 
screen so it can it could you can lower
the<00:03:57.680> graphics<00:03:58.100> but<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.280> won't<00:03:58.490> be<00:03:58.580> as<00:03:58.670> detailed

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
the graphics but it won't be as detailed

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.600 
the graphics but it won't be as detailed
so<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.360> can<00:03:59.600> still<00:03:59.840> play<00:03:59.990> it<00:04:00.200> at<00:04:00.410> 1280<00:04:01.010> by<00:04:01.250> 720

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
so I can still play it at 1280 by 720

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.780 
so I can still play it at 1280 by 720
and<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.840> will<00:04:03.020> still<00:04:03.230> look<00:04:03.260> amazing<00:04:04.010> but<00:04:04.520> on

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
and it will still look amazing but on

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.840 
and it will still look amazing but on
the<00:04:05.000> Asus<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:06.020> would<00:04:06.290> look<00:04:06.680> horrible<00:04:07.130> so

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
the Asus that would look horrible so

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.480 
the Asus that would look horrible so
overall<00:04:08.300> I'd<00:04:08.630> give<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.960> Alienware<00:04:09.320> m<00:04:09.620> 14x<00:04:10.250> a

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
overall I'd give the Alienware m 14x a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.930 
overall I'd give the Alienware m 14x a
very<00:04:11.030> good<00:04:11.300> 8<00:04:11.540> out<00:04:11.690> of<00:04:11.720> 10<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:13.400> only<00:04:13.430> things

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
very good 8 out of 10 the only things

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.060 
very good 8 out of 10 the only things
that<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.150> see<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:15.260> could<00:04:15.500> have<00:04:15.710> improved

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
that I see that it could have improved

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.460
