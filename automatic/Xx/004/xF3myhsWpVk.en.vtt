00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.130
 Hello to you wih this review here 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:12.000
 This is the plane I wrote one 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.070
 my subscriber unsubscribed ios ionik technician 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 here he signed new to us said 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.039
 make a review and did not understand about what 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 of those two 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.380
 Well, that's about it, I now decided to do if 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.869
 you need to write about here, I will do 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.090
 any questions you can ask me on them 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.630
 I 'll do well the video will do and will 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.700
 answer all your questions then write 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.579
 foot on any toys review well not any 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.930
 which show end there discuss 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:46.250
 past video collection there will be here 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:50.149
 so first let's see the plane itself so 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.969
 here is the plane itself right over here 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 the accident was eagerly there was an accident and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.890
 here this is now no longer in them was 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.050
 I could not see this one here 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.350
 somewhere it was already closed owners only 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.299
 here it was visible here he was also 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 the crowns are not black in this color 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.280
 kotisch block replaced here it means he 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.290
 two wings two wings 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.290
 Here's an engine so interesting 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.530
 are turning 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 2 france fenders and here we have 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.270
 males motor that turns one and for 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.930
 account of this stick 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.210
 it's time to read 2 but also here 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.659
 here it turns us to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.430
 protection and now these are turning so 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.430
 up down due to this here 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.780
 antennas such here taxis still wrapped 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:01.350
 equipment here it is a partner means you have 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.549
 gassing these trimmers trimmers 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.670
 here and all here is this merlock 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:14.190
 Here he also eats 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:20.030
 And 8 finger-type batteries saw different to 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.030
 the battery is so scattered 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.160
 bad that feeds your media done bob 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:39.870
 4 to eat 4 it would be better to have 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:44.910
 very long antenna 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.910
 so it will be gas forward it answers 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:56.989
 for it is possible because I will say let's run 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:03:13.519
 we start it the general equipment 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:13.519
 we turn on the Lego plane itself and so in general 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:32.870
 these here this connects here 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:49.700
 answer you know this here and if 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:51.859
 this gas him nothing to say flight and not 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.500
 I know maybe I did a review about the flight 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:04:00.349
 how will he fly 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:03.319
 I don't know most likely not either 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.230
 if you say you want to buy a plane 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.620
 and after all just want to get in 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.739
 the plane is not starting here such here 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.980
 and with a glider, start by planning later 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.359
 learn me stand height 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.900
 plan just so he flew a 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.690
 then buy not these already 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.690
 it is also also difficult which at least these 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.690
 the wings are slightly bent up from and here 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.909
 These are difficult all the same first plans 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.370
 learn to fly then take these 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.800
 Besides, you know what I have learned from 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.699
 plan to torture me, too, were the enemy ara 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.690
 plans jet plane flew too 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.900
 broke bump strong the same if u 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.990
 you 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.909
 break planes let's say flies off 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.740
 wing breaks no need to buy 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.900
 special kind of glue for the plane 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.979
 go because they say good glue 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.770
 that's just for planes tiled 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:05.570
 glue glue glue and all year 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:11.060
 which in the tile glue is about it here 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:14.590
 here and here it is necessary to drink here 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.590
 there is 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.960
 on this, probably all thanks for all
