00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:28.400
 a type of prosthesis particularly 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 important for the prosthesis center is 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.120
 represented of functional prostheses 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.430
 for these all levels of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 amputation of the upper limb prosthesis 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.150
 so-called to control my electric in 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.640
 practice are controlled controlled by 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.580
 a very weak electric current which 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.690
 is detected by sensors from the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.510
 residual limb muscles 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.070
 these signals are amplified 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.409
 brought to the various parts of the prosthesis e 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.700
 via a battery inserted 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.130
 within the same are 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.790
 operated for example with this system 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.799
 a functional prosthesis can be obtained 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.290
 up to shoulder level 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.409
 therefore it is possible to have the movement 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.450
 of the elbow in flexed extension of the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.090
 hand in opening mum's closing e 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 also wrist level in intra extra 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.469
 rotation 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.390
 these are important movements 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.909
 especially for bilateral amputees 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.399
 of upper limb for which this 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.770
 type of prosthesis represents the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.229
 survival and without which not 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.840
 could reach a complete 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.320
 autonomy 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.439
 have recently been introduced 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.429
 so-called articulated poles ie hands 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.560
 hands that reproduce almost 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.359
 completes the movements of the natural limb 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.289
 in particular of the hand 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.689
 for this reason they are called anthropomorphic 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:10.810
 represent the most advanced of 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.459
 devices for this type of prosthesis 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.590
 to explain it better with a hand of 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.300
 this kind of thing you can do with 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.000
 a hand of this kind and therefore with 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.060
 a poly articulated or anthropomorphic hand 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.459
 it is possible to achieve practically 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.590
 all natural hand movements 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.099
 therefore it is possible to grab an object 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.660
 with all five fingers use a 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:38.330
 just finger then be able to beat the keys 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.230
 of a keyboard then use the 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.180
 computer any other keyboard 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.040
 use your thumb then move the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.580
 thumb to get a huge one 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.100
 range of movements this type of 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.560
 hands differs greatly from the 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.989
 hands normally used up to approx 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.080
 two years ago they have movement of 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.470
 this genus is called digital 3 ie the e 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.200
 all objects are grabbed 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.989
 exclusively between the first wound and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.330
 therefore it is not possible to make one 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.799
 very wide range of movements also 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.799
 sons also resumed
