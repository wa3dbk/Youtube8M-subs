00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.980
 but in general, hello to all of us today 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.160
 It will review no Belgian as you could 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.260
 think about his products namely 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.700
 pocket sharpeners 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.130
 but I'll immediately add something from myself 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.289
 sharpener was determined acquired but it 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 not at all recently, and so I still 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.760
 not really used so will 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.699
 as small as some reviewer 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.529
 In general, that I myself Tatchenko represents 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.160
 First of all, let's take a look at 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.890
 box leg interesting box 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 bright colors here are various laudatory 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.329
 songs what is it a sharpener can what she 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 beautiful as fishing line colony of opportunity 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.940
 and yet itâ€™s kinda made without us too 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 the most here is some instruction 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.640
 In short, nothing interesting box 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.640
 box we move perhaps grind with me 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.890
 on 4 people stoch a point and some 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.910
 little book suspecting something will be 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.910
 survival instruction 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.880
 quite right 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.159
 what do we see here we see ways 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:24.600
 making fire 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:26.690
 three ways are here we see us 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.400
 already determine the direction of the world 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:35.810
 focus here we have various traps 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.210
 ways of tying various loops 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:47.509
 here you can collect intelsat 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:52.560
 it seems the length is still there 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.060
 ways how to build a hut and how 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.149
 signaling there for example 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:03.179
 lifeguard for interesting cake turns out 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.869
 but go on hitachi better than yourself 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:10.890
 represents our sharpener to cover 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.989
 rubberized rubber most likely with 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.670
 such a surface that principle 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.450
 keeps quite so tight 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.329
 tight grip with a good hand 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.440
 keep here we see the sign of sos yes 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:30.390
 absolutely sos than here the company logo 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.790
 Berber hole to wear our 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.700
 sharpener us about a clone would carabiners 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.700
 or on the threshold order not to lose and 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.079
 he sits on the yeast and not bad 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.220
 then it will remain on 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.040
 carbine or on the curtain if he lost 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:57.980
 our case is good on gogear well done all 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.540
 for the state version for merged with us rarely 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.310
 he thought not say anything 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.430
 therefore, in principle, interested 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.200
 sharpener what we have here we have 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.970
 we have pottery it suspects for 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.070
 file sharpening here we have on 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.590
 first look to what it is also ceramics 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.940
 but if so look closely then I see 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:27.470
 what is this some steel this is not ceramics 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:32.480
 quite interesting here we see 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.680
 different diameter diamond rods and so 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.510
 I understand for sharpening 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:44.810
 Tyrants series not only here also has 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:48.500
 logo slot wear a feather over pretty 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.830
 it's interesting, I took the scissors who 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.770
 this gerbera is interesting as it is the way and 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.640
 sharpened but under big syria then 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.950
 fish take great know pretty 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.489
 great suits him a big saltpeter like 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.459
 times the diameter matches small 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.510
 for example , the small one perfectly matches 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:18.020
 this selector which can be excellent 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:21.859
 does okay as they say 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:26.090
 we will look at first sight such 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.590
 decently everything is done qualitatively not 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.529
 we know whether it will serve me by faith and 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.849
 true 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:35.479
 slowly my arkansas bricks 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:38.909
 perhaps one of the options for sharpening 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.559
 hiking conditions are still about him 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:43.349
 will be color talk about well let's 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:43.919
 let's see shona seems to be by 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.469
 the length 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:53.639
 it's 12 almost 12 centimeters wide 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:58.039
 her three centimeters high think of what 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:01.229
 more than ours about one and a half centimeters 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:04.889
 weight I do not know her on the box is not written 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:08.489
 Well, so for a discount no wonder 60 could 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:12.449
 65 basically everything is so short 

00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:14.909
 Obzorchik how I more or less use 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.319
 made a clearer review we will i 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.149
 Santa who gave themselves represents this 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:22.039
 pencil sharpener 

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:22.039
 burgers in everything thank you bye
