back low and sleep again and what's

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.330 
back low and sleep again and what's
important<00:00:13.139> about<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.040> want<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> be

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
important about this is I want to be

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.560 
important about this is I want to be
building<00:00:14.610> up<00:00:14.700> my<00:00:14.790> red<00:00:15.000> blood<00:00:15.299> cell<00:00:15.540> count

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
building up my red blood cell count

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
building up my red blood cell count
because<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.350> lot<00:00:16.470> less<00:00:16.650> oxygen<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
because it's a lot less oxygen in the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
because it's a lot less oxygen in the
air<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.390> need<00:00:18.570> more<00:00:19.020> red<00:00:19.230> blood<00:00:19.260> cells<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
air and you need more red blood cells to

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.230 
air and you need more red blood cells to
process<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:20.699> amount<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> oxygen

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
process the little amount of oxygen

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.330 
process the little amount of oxygen
that's<00:00:21.359> out<00:00:21.630> there<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> how

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
that's out there so this is kind of how

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.550 
that's out there so this is kind of how
how<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.660> go<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.900> high<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.500> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
how you do it you go up high and you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.259 
how you do it you go up high and you
sleep<00:00:25.859> low<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.250> go<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.460> high<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.849> sleep<00:00:27.090> low

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
sleep low you go up high you sleep low

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
sleep low you go up high you sleep low
so<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> next<00:00:28.230> few<00:00:28.500> days<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:29.039> be

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
so for the next few days this will be

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.669 
so for the next few days this will be
the<00:00:29.490> de<00:00:29.910> pattern<00:00:30.300> until<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:30.720> body<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.170> strong

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the de pattern until my body is strong

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
the de pattern until my body is strong
enough<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.030> over<00:00:33.270> throw<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.630> over<00:00:33.780> La<00:00:33.960> Paz

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
enough to go over throw it over La Paz

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.430 
enough to go over throw it over La Paz
at<00:00:34.530> 18,000<00:00:35.280> feet

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.979 

it's<00:00:41.920> amazing<00:00:42.520> how<00:00:42.700> not<00:00:43.180> carrying<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.780> backpack

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
it's amazing how not carrying a backpack

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.800 
it's amazing how not carrying a backpack
makes<00:00:44.530> life<00:00:44.800> so<00:00:45.220> much<00:00:45.250> more<00:00:45.640> enjoyable<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.360> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.940 

kneeled<00:01:43.840> down<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.290> front<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.619> him<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:44.860> he

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
quickly tied a little string around my

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.690 
quickly tied a little string around my
neck<00:01:46.930> which<00:01:47.350> I'm<00:01:47.530> guessing<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:48.100> some<00:01:48.369> sort<00:01:48.640> of

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
neck which I'm guessing is some sort of

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.120 
neck which I'm guessing is some sort of
a<00:01:48.759> good-luck<00:01:48.970> charm<00:01:49.450> he<00:01:50.290> then<00:01:50.470> began<00:01:50.770> speaking

a good-luck charm he then began speaking
which<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.700> me<00:01:51.850> sounded<00:01:52.420> like<00:01:52.570> gibberish<00:01:52.840> but<00:01:53.320> I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
which to me sounded like gibberish but I

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:11.340 
which to me sounded like gibberish but I
was<00:01:53.680> able<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.070> make<00:01:54.310> out<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.490> few<00:01:54.820> words<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:10.390> got

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
was able to make out a few words I got

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.710 
was able to make out a few words I got
that<00:02:11.560> he<00:02:11.710> was<00:02:11.830> 93<00:02:12.400> years<00:02:12.430> old<00:02:12.850> but<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.270> doubt<00:02:13.390> I
