in<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.110> video<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.829> demonstrate

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
in this video we're going to demonstrate

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.610 
in this video we're going to demonstrate
how<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.580> use<00:00:02.700> right<00:00:03.179> softs<00:00:03.570> new<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:04.230> draw<00:00:04.470> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
how to use right softs new and draw a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.130 
how to use right softs new and draw a
wall<00:00:04.859> feature<00:00:05.359> while<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.480> could<00:00:06.629> use<00:00:06.779> lots<00:00:07.020> of

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
wall feature while we could use lots of

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.020 
wall feature while we could use lots of
different<00:00:07.259> buildings<00:00:07.560> as<00:00:07.890> an<00:00:08.010> example<00:00:08.309> we're

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
different buildings as an example we're

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.549 
different buildings as an example we're
going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.300> use<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> common<00:00:09.840> situation<00:00:10.349> like<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
going to use a common situation like a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.470 
going to use a common situation like a
walkout<00:00:11.070> basement<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.759> demonstrate<00:00:12.269> this

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
walkout basement to demonstrate this

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.560 
walkout basement to demonstrate this
process<00:00:13.019> as<00:00:13.670> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.969> see<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.240> our<00:00:15.330> little

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
process as you can see in our little

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.019 
process as you can see in our little
demonstration<00:00:15.809> here<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:17.130> basement<00:00:17.400> area<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
demonstration here this basement area is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.070 
demonstration here this basement area is
only<00:00:18.300> partially<00:00:18.930> below<00:00:19.230> great<00:00:21.080> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
only partially below great to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.640 
only partially below great to
demonstrate<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.670> select<00:00:24.060> our<00:00:24.180> rooms

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
demonstrate this we can select our rooms

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.480 
demonstrate this we can select our rooms
and<00:00:26.510> designate<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:27.990> type<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.320> wall<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:29.279> want

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and designate what type of wall we want

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.849 
and designate what type of wall we want
to<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.720> example<00:00:30.779> I'll<00:00:31.260> use<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> below

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to use in this example I'll use a below

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.160 
to use in this example I'll use a below
grade<00:00:32.099> wall<00:00:33.469> however<00:00:34.469> as<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:36.020> much<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
grade wall however as we can see much of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.119 
grade wall however as we can see much of
this<00:00:37.260> wall<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.700> below<00:00:39.000> grade

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
this wall is not actually below grade

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
this wall is not actually below grade
that's<00:00:41.129> where<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.489> icon<00:00:41.940> comes<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.390> our<00:00:43.320> draw

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that's where this icon comes in our draw

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.819 
that's where this icon comes in our draw
a<00:00:43.800> wall<00:00:44.010> tool<00:00:44.420> simply<00:00:45.420> click<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.750> icon<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.260 

draw<00:00:49.879> when<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> right<00:00:51.210> click<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.690> icon<00:00:53.270> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
draw when I right click on this icon the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
draw when I right click on this icon the
program<00:00:54.629> will<00:00:54.780> show<00:00:54.809> me<00:00:55.079> unique<00:00:55.440> properties

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
program will show me unique properties

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.670 
program will show me unique properties
for<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.370> section<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.449> wall<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.170> I've<00:00:58.469> drawn

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
for that section of wall that I've drawn

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.720 
for that section of wall that I've drawn
there<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.239> can<00:01:00.239> set<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> height<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.609> this

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
there I can set a height so that if this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.070 
there I can set a height so that if this
were<00:01:02.910> partially<00:01:03.570> below<00:01:04.049> grade<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:06.080> could

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
were partially below grade I could

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.230 
were partially below grade I could
designate<00:01:07.280> half<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.640> wall<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.000> being

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
designate half of this wall as being

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.890 
designate half of this wall as being
above<00:01:09.720> grade<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:11.210> for<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.330> section<00:01:12.689> alone

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
above grade and for this section alone

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.679 
above grade and for this section alone
half<00:01:13.530> below<00:01:13.920> grade

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
half below grade

half below grade
assuming<00:01:15.689> an<00:01:15.780> eight-foot<00:01:16.200> wall<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:17.540> can<00:01:18.540> draw

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
assuming an eight-foot wall I can draw

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.080 
assuming an eight-foot wall I can draw
this<00:01:18.900> wall<00:01:19.110> across<00:01:19.590> multiple<00:01:20.580> rooms<00:01:23.090> again

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
this wall across multiple rooms again

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.490 
this wall across multiple rooms again
adjust<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> properties<00:01:25.549> by<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:26.820> clicking

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
adjust the properties by right clicking

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.819 
adjust the properties by right clicking
set<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.650> height<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.750> that<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> unique

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
set your height and that is now a unique

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.700 
set your height and that is now a unique
wall<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> same<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:34.590> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
wall and I can do the same for that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
wall and I can do the same for that
section<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:36.090> also<00:01:36.299> good<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> note

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
section there it's also good to note

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.420 
section there it's also good to note
that<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.259> should<00:01:37.470> put<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> window<00:01:38.040> or<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> door

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that if I should put a window or a door

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.940 
that if I should put a window or a door
in<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:39.150> walls<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:43.470> program<00:01:43.829> will

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
in one of these walls the program will

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.889 
in one of these walls the program will
automatically<00:01:44.490> assign<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.090> wall<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.750> my

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
automatically assign that wall to my

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.830 
automatically assign that wall to my
custom<00:01:46.409> wall<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.770> I've<00:01:46.890> drawn<00:01:47.600> this<00:01:48.600> wall
