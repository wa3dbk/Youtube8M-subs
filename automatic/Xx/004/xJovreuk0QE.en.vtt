00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
because it's going to be kind of not

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
because it's going to be kind of not
under<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> ledge<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.619> kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.830> same

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
under a ledge but kind of that same

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
under a ledge but kind of that same
concept<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.600> hard<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
concept it's just going to be hard to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.390 
concept it's just going to be hard to
see<00:01:13.080> especially<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.650> you're<00:01:13.799> cruising<00:01:14.250> when

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
see especially if you're cruising when

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.920 
see especially if you're cruising when
it's<00:01:14.549> dark<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.180> me<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:15.750> it's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it's dark out like me right now it's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.469 
it's dark out like me right now it's
dark<00:01:16.170> outside<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.520> way<00:01:17.820> dark<00:01:18.119> under<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
dark outside and is way dark under the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.370 
dark outside and is way dark under the
water<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.600> maybe<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.869> something<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.200> keep

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
water so maybe that's something to keep

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.990 
water so maybe that's something to keep
in<00:01:22.530> mind<00:01:22.590> while<00:01:23.009> you're<00:01:23.159> looking<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:23.909> these
