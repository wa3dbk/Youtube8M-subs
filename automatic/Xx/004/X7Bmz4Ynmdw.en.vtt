00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
don't want to be late so basically I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.009 
don't want to be late so basically I
start<00:00:20.369> from<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> bottom<00:00:20.759> but<00:00:21.539> I'm<00:00:21.630> taking

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
start from the bottom but I'm taking

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.400 
start from the bottom but I'm taking
them<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.730> I'll<00:00:23.730> give<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> twist<00:00:24.509> a<00:00:24.839> slight

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
them out I'll give the twist a slight

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.560 
them out I'll give the twist a slight
turn<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.249> opposite<00:00:26.849> direction<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.419> how<00:00:27.539> I

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
turn in the opposite direction of how I

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
turn in the opposite direction of how I
twisted<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.919> it<00:00:28.980> already<00:00:29.310> comes

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
twisted it so that it already comes

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.659 
twisted it so that it already comes
apart<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.419> I<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.720> pull<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:32.040> just

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
apart and then I just pull that just

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.850 
apart and then I just pull that just
makes<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.970> easier<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> come<00:00:33.720> out<00:00:33.900> so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> just

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
makes it easier to come out so I just

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.730 
makes it easier to come out so I just
grab<00:00:35.400> them<00:00:35.580> from<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> bottom<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.230> pull

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
grab them from the bottom and just pull

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.210 
grab them from the bottom and just pull
like<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:40.550> there<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.820> again<00:00:42.090> pull<00:00:43.220> you're

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
like that there you go again pull you're

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.280 
like that there you go again pull you're
really<00:00:44.520> easy<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.880> take<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.810> twist<00:00:46.080> in

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
really easy to take out if you twist in

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.530 
really easy to take out if you twist in
the<00:00:46.380> opposite<00:00:46.830> direction<00:00:47.270> it<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.540> makes<00:00:48.930> for

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
the opposite direction it just makes for

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.800 
the opposite direction it just makes for
less<00:00:51.540> tangling<00:00:52.140> there's<00:00:52.920> actually<00:00:53.810> pretty

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
less tangling there's actually pretty

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.230 
less tangling there's actually pretty
much<00:00:54.900> none<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.550> never<00:00:56.730> borrowed

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
much none because if you never borrowed

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
much none because if you never borrowed
here<00:00:58.310> then<00:00:59.310> it<00:00:59.520> should<00:00:59.730> come<00:00:59.880> apart<00:01:00.240> very<00:01:00.930> very

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
here then it should come apart very very

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:22.370 
here then it should come apart very very
easily<00:01:03.350> okay

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.609 

I<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:23.219> them<00:01:23.399> here's<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
I get them here's one it's one in the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
I get them here's one it's one in the
front<00:01:28.979> twisted<00:01:33.200> okay<00:01:34.640> okay<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.020> how

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
front twisted okay okay so this is how

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.279 
front twisted okay okay so this is how
it<00:01:37.350> looks<00:01:37.850> without<00:01:38.850> any<00:01:39.030> type<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> separation

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
it looks without any type of separation

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.719 
it looks without any type of separation
so<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.520> has<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.149> definition<00:01:43.729> today

so<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:48.510> can<00:02:49.040> make<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.100> bigger<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.579> bigger

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
so that it can make it bigger and bigger

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.699 
so that it can make it bigger and bigger
and<00:02:52.730> yeah<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.760> did<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.329> split<00:02:54.959> down<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.319> middle

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
and yeah I did a split down the middle

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.460 
and yeah I did a split down the middle
middle<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.810> split<00:02:58.170> down<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
middle of that I just split down the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.129 
middle of that I just split down the
middle<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.250> my<00:02:59.430> head<00:02:59.670> like<00:03:00.540> all<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.989> way<00:03:01.079> to

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
middle of my head like all the way to

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.910 
middle of my head like all the way to
the<00:03:01.350> back<00:03:01.730> splitting<00:03:02.730> making<00:03:03.510> two<00:03:03.660> halves<00:03:03.920> not

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
the back splitting making two halves not

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.690 
the back splitting making two halves not
a<00:03:04.950> good<00:03:05.160> idea<00:03:06.019> because<00:03:07.190> now<00:03:08.190> I'm<00:03:08.459> gonna<00:03:08.609> have

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
a good idea because now I'm gonna have

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.890 
a good idea because now I'm gonna have
to<00:03:08.910> work<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.690> close<00:03:09.959> in<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.590> gap<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:12.540> yeah

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
to work to close in that gap but yeah

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.370 
to work to close in that gap but yeah
I'm<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.799> going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.010> keep<00:03:14.160> separating<00:03:14.850> these

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:39.390 

um<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:20.459> make<00:03:21.769> my<00:03:22.769> fro<00:03:23.190> bigger

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:49.920 

I<00:03:39.489> believe<00:03:40.239> those<00:03:40.480> ones<00:03:40.900> there

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.699 

now<00:03:50.590> if<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:51.159> did<00:03:51.519> them<00:03:51.700> bigger<00:03:52.349> it<00:03:53.349> wouldn't<00:03:53.650> be

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
now if I did them bigger it wouldn't be

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.170 
now if I did them bigger it wouldn't be
so<00:03:54.780> defined<00:03:55.780> which<00:03:56.079> is<00:03:56.260> how<00:03:56.409> i<00:03:56.439> do<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.769> usually

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
so defined which is how i do it usually

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.610 
so defined which is how i do it usually
never<00:03:58.180> really<00:03:58.540> done<00:03:58.719> them<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.109> small<00:03:59.439> and

right back headache hey guys so i'm back
real<00:04:30.370> quick<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:31.349> separated<00:04:32.349> it<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.919> this<00:04:33.580> is

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
real quick I separated it and this is

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.629 
real quick I separated it and this is
basically<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.419> so<00:04:35.289> this<00:04:35.560> is<00:04:35.590> not<00:04:36.130> exactly<00:04:37.030> a

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
basically it so this is not exactly a

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.920 
basically it so this is not exactly a
chunky<00:04:39.639> twist<00:04:39.970> on<00:04:40.150> I<00:04:40.330> think<00:04:40.630> I'm<00:04:40.690> going<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.870> go

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
chunky twist on I think I'm going to go

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.980 
chunky twist on I think I'm going to go
and<00:04:41.199> call<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:42.150> medium<00:04:43.150> chunky<00:04:43.419> Twista

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
and call it a medium chunky Twista

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.260 
and call it a medium chunky Twista
because<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.680> pieces<00:04:45.099> should<00:04:45.310> be<00:04:45.490> bigger<00:04:45.880> and

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
because the pieces should be bigger and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.260 
because the pieces should be bigger and
you<00:04:47.020> can't<00:04:47.289> really<00:04:47.530> see<00:04:47.680> big<00:04:48.550> chunks<00:04:49.090> there's

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
you can't really see big chunks there's

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.089 
you can't really see big chunks there's
just<00:04:49.479> a<00:04:49.690> lot<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.710> crimps<00:04:51.280> if<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:51.759> see<00:04:51.970> that

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
just a lot of crimps if you can see that

00:04:53.099 --> 00:05:01.850 
just a lot of crimps if you can see that
wait<00:04:54.099> turn<00:04:54.580> around

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.600 

so<00:05:02.860> yeah<00:05:03.250> it's<00:05:03.640> not<00:05:04.320> exactly<00:05:05.370> chunky<00:05:06.370> twist

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
so yeah it's not exactly chunky twist

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.300 
so yeah it's not exactly chunky twist
out<00:05:06.760> by<00:05:06.970> a<00:05:07.270> twist<00:05:07.780> out<00:05:07.990> but<00:05:08.620> it's<00:05:08.980> all<00:05:09.130> cause

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
out by a twist out but it's all cause

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.260 
out by a twist out but it's all cause
there's<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.210> medium<00:05:10.750> chunky<00:05:11.110> twist<00:05:11.650> out<00:05:11.830> okay

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
there's a medium chunky twist out okay

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.680
