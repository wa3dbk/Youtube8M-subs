next<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.470> LA<00:00:23.800> when<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.160> knew<00:00:24.340> that<00:00:24.369> there<00:00:24.670> was

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
next to LA when I knew that there was

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.689 
next to LA when I knew that there was
such<00:00:24.940> a<00:00:24.970> huge<00:00:25.240> Iraqi<00:00:25.920> expat<00:00:26.920> community<00:00:26.949> and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
such a huge Iraqi expat community and

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.880 
such a huge Iraqi expat community and
thought<00:00:27.880> like<00:00:28.119> they<00:00:28.750> needed<00:00:28.960> a<00:00:29.140> flag<00:00:29.380> so<00:00:29.740> this

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
thought like they needed a flag so this

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.830 
thought like they needed a flag so this
is<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.220> Chicago<00:00:30.400> flag<00:00:31.000> but<00:00:31.240> just<00:00:31.420> with<00:00:31.570> Iraqi

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.900 
is the Chicago flag but just with Iraqi
colors<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.619> thought<00:00:32.920> what<00:00:33.219> would<00:00:33.309> be<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.579> best

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
colors I thought what would be the best

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.700 
colors I thought what would be the best
was<00:00:34.239> to<00:00:34.270> do<00:00:34.570> something<00:00:34.780> to<00:00:34.989> celebrate<00:00:35.199> that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
was to do something to celebrate that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
presence and to work with it so the food

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.709 
presence and to work with it so the food
truck<00:00:38.289> idea<00:00:38.800> was<00:00:38.979> kind<00:00:39.159> of<00:00:39.309> born<00:00:39.609> and<00:00:39.969> through

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719
