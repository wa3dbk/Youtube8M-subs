00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.789
 but about 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.329
 it's kind of like fog in the street 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.250
 and here it is that well there 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.210
 the haze that's what the families didn't take 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.099
 300 meters 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.590
 video panel with what does it have to do with 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.090
 see what's the use of visibility 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.090
 q word operation vizier 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:48.520
 and where we parked on your left 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:57.670
 Gomel three feet to go did not get up like 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:59.770
 you can relax to the right of the objective 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.300
 just not in the very melody baby myself 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.610
 prepare all your questions 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.320
 but a little shovel sensor is parked 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.740
 he still has all your questions for sure 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 of problems 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.810
 dobra is not famous 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.430
 no he can't 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.150
 well based homosexuals on 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.430
 was really considered 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.050
 the rendering of the vizier even now 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.210
 anyway on the street one hundred percent 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.600
 the clouds 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 was waiting 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.750
 and the road why are you wet there how is it 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.080
 not absolutely if the road could it 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.080
 horrible 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.909
 dry gone at 99 percent moisture and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.259
 especially difficult 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.539
 ship in this ball price really 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.590
 it turns out the contributes can wear fail 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.590
 work vizier 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.180
 and had time 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.180
 on 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.690
 still that you are already 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.250
 dota 2 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.870
 has passed 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.180
 No, I understand what if I 'm sure 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.610
 moisture wrong and once if the driver 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.160
 according to understand what you go but here 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.040
 the question is even broken vanilla and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.860
 agree and analysis 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.010
 the question is that the device itself is now 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.350
 is beyond optimal conditions me in 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.760
 These parameters do not use for a long time well 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.590
 oh god okay absolute you 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.790
 I sympathize with the barometer and all the rest 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:58.090
 google devices it takes away 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:58.090
