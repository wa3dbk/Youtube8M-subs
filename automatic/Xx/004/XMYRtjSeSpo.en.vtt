we'll be showing you to waste crack
system<00:00:56.170> on<00:00:56.530> target<00:00:56.949> first<00:00:57.579> way<00:00:57.789> it's<00:00:57.940> the

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
system on target first way it's the

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.490 
system on target first way it's the
basic<00:00:58.449> way<00:00:58.539> of<00:00:58.570> doing<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:59.019> I<00:00:59.079> just<00:00:59.320> show<00:00:59.469> you

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
basic way of doing that I just show you

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.220 
basic way of doing that I just show you
pick<00:01:00.370> up<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:00.519> leg<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.420> back<00:01:01.600> straight<00:01:02.079> up

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
pick up that leg the back straight up

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.270 
pick up that leg the back straight up
and<00:01:02.409> down<00:01:02.469> but<00:01:03.100> we<00:01:03.339> land<00:01:03.610> in<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.820> front

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
and down but we land in the front

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.270 
and down but we land in the front
get<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.269> extra<00:01:05.540> reach<00:01:05.810> that<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.770> second<00:01:07.130> way

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
get that extra reach that the second way

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.649 
get that extra reach that the second way
we're<00:01:07.729> not<00:01:07.850> going<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.060> keep<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.360> straight

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
we're not going to keep it straight

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.090 
we're not going to keep it straight
we're<00:01:08.840> going<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.080> bend<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.470> leg<00:01:09.650> on<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.890> way

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
we're going to bend the leg on the way

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.950 
we're going to bend the leg on the way
up<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.030> different<00:01:11.150> variation<00:01:11.570> than

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
up so it's a different variation than

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.600 
up so it's a different variation than
the<00:01:12.049> one<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:12.229> showed<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.680> but<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:13.400> very

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
the one I showed you but it's very

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.160 
the one I showed you but it's very
effective<00:01:13.880> when<00:01:14.180> you're<00:01:14.299> in<00:01:14.390> close<00:01:14.690> distance

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
effective when you're in close distance

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.820 
effective when you're in close distance
event<00:01:15.500> let's<00:01:15.890> watch<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.110> first<00:01:18.350> way<00:01:18.590> is

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
event let's watch so the first way is

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.590 
event let's watch so the first way is
getting<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.430> straight<00:01:19.790> up<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:19.940> out<00:01:20.210> and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
getting it straight up and out and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.690 
getting it straight up and out and
getting<00:01:20.899> that<00:01:21.050> reach<00:01:21.350> now<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:22.340> can<00:01:22.520> hit

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
getting that reach now you can hit

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.870 
getting that reach now you can hit
either<00:01:23.180> your<00:01:23.450> heel<00:01:23.690> or<00:01:24.259> your<00:01:25.040> bottom<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.790> the
