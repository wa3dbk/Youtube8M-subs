develop<00:01:31.539> her<00:01:31.689> immune<00:01:31.929> system<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.619> know<00:01:33.549> that

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
develop her immune system I know that

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.800 
develop her immune system I know that
it's<00:01:34.960> got<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.859> lot<00:01:36.789> of<00:01:36.850> good<00:01:37.030> fats<00:01:37.299> in<00:01:37.509> there<00:01:37.659> to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
it's got a lot of good fats in there to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.809 
it's got a lot of good fats in there to
help<00:01:38.020> her<00:01:38.170> put<00:01:38.380> weight<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:38.619> which<00:01:39.609> is<00:01:39.759> very

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
help her put weight on which is very

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.239 
help her put weight on which is very
important<00:01:40.390> for<00:01:40.630> us<00:01:40.719> I<00:01:41.109> know<00:01:41.499> that<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:41.950> effects

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
important for us I know that the effects

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.459 
important for us I know that the effects
of<00:01:42.490> her<00:01:43.210> breastfeeding<00:01:43.569> early<00:01:44.020> on<00:01:44.139> are<00:01:44.380> gonna

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
of her breastfeeding early on are gonna

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.410 
of her breastfeeding early on are gonna
stay<00:01:45.429> with<00:01:45.579> her<00:01:45.729> for<00:01:45.939> life

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
stay with her for life

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.899 
stay with her for life
together<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.770> bacteria<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.670> baby

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
together the bacteria and the baby

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.539 
together the bacteria and the baby
developed<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.960> idea<00:01:50.409> here<00:01:50.740> is<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
developed the idea here is that the

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.359 
developed the idea here is that the
mother's<00:01:51.880> milk<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.600> very<00:01:53.170> important<00:01:53.950> for<00:01:54.100> how

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
mother's milk is very important for how

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.149 
mother's milk is very important for how
the<00:01:54.429> bacteria<00:01:55.149> developed<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:56.159> probably

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
the bacteria developed and probably

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.429 
the bacteria developed and probably
therefore<00:01:57.700> important<00:01:58.240> for<00:01:58.479> how<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.020> baby

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
therefore important for how the baby

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.859 
therefore important for how the baby
develops<00:01:59.679> so<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.609> main<00:02:00.880> thing<00:02:01.240> about<00:02:01.569> the

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
develops so the main thing about the

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.570 
develops so the main thing about the
study<00:02:02.109> hopefully<00:02:02.829> is<00:02:03.100> that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
study hopefully is that

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.210 
study hopefully is that
those<00:02:03.850> people<00:02:04.480> that<00:02:04.810> absolutely<00:02:05.380> cannot<00:02:05.920> get

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
those people that absolutely cannot get

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.830 
those people that absolutely cannot get
