the<00:02:08.179> instructions<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:08.929> you're<00:02:09.050> going<00:02:09.200> to

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
the instructions that you're going to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.749 
the instructions that you're going to
get<00:02:09.380> when<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.679> actually<00:02:09.860> order<00:02:10.340> these<00:02:10.490> it's

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
get when you actually order these it's

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.980 
get when you actually order these it's
going<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> sheet<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.450> instructions

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
going to be a sheet of instructions

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.660 
going to be a sheet of instructions
photo<00:02:12.380> instructions<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.280> makes<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.520> real

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
photo instructions so it makes it real

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.660 
photo instructions so it makes it real
easy<00:02:13.700> for<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.740> but<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:15.770> actually<00:02:15.950> use<00:02:16.370> a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
easy for you but I actually use a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.530 
easy for you but I actually use a
tweezer<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:18.410> open<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:18.860> close<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.430> these<00:02:19.640> are<00:02:20.000> I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
tweezer to open and close so these are I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.100 
tweezer to open and close so these are I
call<00:02:21.200> them<00:02:21.380> my<00:02:21.500> lock<00:02:21.740> rings<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.630> if<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.870> look

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
call them my lock rings and if you look

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.720 
call them my lock rings and if you look
real<00:02:24.380> closely<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:24.980> hair<00:02:25.220> when<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.489> come<00:02:25.640> up

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
real closely in my hair when I come up

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.160 
real closely in my hair when I come up
close<00:02:25.970> again<00:02:26.180> you'll<00:02:26.510> see<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.930> actually

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
close again you'll see that I actually

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.199 
close again you'll see that I actually
have<00:02:27.500> lock<00:02:27.739> rings<00:02:28.040> on<00:02:28.250> some<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.610> my<00:02:28.640> locks<00:02:28.940> and

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209

have lock rings on some of my locks and
what<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.959> use<00:02:30.260> those<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.830> anchor<00:02:31.220> or

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
what I do is I use those to anchor or

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.630 
what I do is I use those to anchor or

attach my Maggiore pieces to now if

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.340 
attach my Maggiore pieces to now if
there's<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:34.910> nice<00:02:35.150> good<00:02:35.450> substantial<00:02:35.660> lock

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
there's a nice good substantial lock

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.130 
there's a nice good substantial lock
that<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.370> have<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.510> doesn't<00:02:38.810> have<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> lock

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
that I have that doesn't have a lock

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.420 
that I have that doesn't have a lock
ring<00:02:39.350> on<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.920> don't<00:02:40.100> have<00:02:40.220> any<00:02:40.340> more

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.800 
ring on it and I don't have any more
lock<00:02:40.640> rings<00:02:40.880> available<00:02:41.390> then<00:02:41.510> I'll<00:02:41.630> just

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
lock rings available then I'll just

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.540 
lock rings available then I'll just
pierce<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.230> through<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.440> lock<00:02:42.620> but<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.160> make

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
pierce it through the lock but I make

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.040 
pierce it through the lock but I make
sure<00:02:43.580> it's<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.880> healthy<00:02:44.300> lock<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.750> do<00:02:44.810> that

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
sure it's a healthy lock that I do that

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.949 
sure it's a healthy lock that I do that
on<00:02:45.200> but<00:02:45.920> anyway<00:02:46.040> if<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.120> look<00:02:47.300> real<00:02:47.540> close<00:02:47.780> I

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
on but anyway if you look real close I

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.090 
on but anyway if you look real close I
don't<00:02:48.200> know<00:02:48.260> if<00:02:48.350> you're<00:02:48.470> not<00:02:48.709> gonna<00:02:48.860> be<00:02:48.950> any

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
don't know if you're not gonna be any

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.890 
don't know if you're not gonna be any
look<00:02:49.310> too<00:02:49.760> closely<00:02:50.030> because<00:02:50.360> it'll<00:02:50.570> get<00:02:50.660> fuzzy

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
look too closely because it'll get fuzzy

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.820 
look too closely because it'll get fuzzy
but<00:02:51.200> anyway<00:02:51.560> there's<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:53.440> there's<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.590> cut

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
but anyway there's a like there's a cut

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.400 
but anyway there's a like there's a cut
in<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> wire<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.120> I'm<00:02:56.630> either<00:02:56.810> gonna<00:02:57.019> pull

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
in the wire and I'm either gonna pull

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.610 
in the wire and I'm either gonna pull
this<00:02:57.530> back<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:58.100> me<00:02:58.310> or<00:02:58.549> away<00:02:59.330> from<00:02:59.690> me<00:02:59.810> either

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
this back to me or away from me either

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.470 
this back to me or away from me either
pull<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.430> me<00:03:01.580> or<00:03:01.700> away<00:03:01.880> from<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.150> don't<00:03:02.209> want

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
pull it to me or away from I don't want

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.830 
pull it to me or away from I don't want
to<00:03:02.540> stretch<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.549> because<00:03:04.549> then<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> you'll

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
to stretch it because then the you'll

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.539 
to stretch it because then the you'll
lose<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.200> integrity<00:03:06.470> of<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.950> circle<00:03:07.370> there

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
lose the integrity of the circle there

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.000 
lose the integrity of the circle there
but<00:03:08.060> anyway<00:03:09.190> let's<00:03:10.190> see<00:03:10.400> I'm<00:03:10.549> gonna<00:03:10.670> take<00:03:10.970> a
