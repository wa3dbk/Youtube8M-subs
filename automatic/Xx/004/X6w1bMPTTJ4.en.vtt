00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.220
 to express myself 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.590

 profile of the character and the costume designer 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.840

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.880
 11 search is made for what we wanted 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.070

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.500
 to work but were 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.560
 world is the secret so use one 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.709
 product to give volume to the root and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.290
 I often wear earrings with it 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.599
 a little more volume so do 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.730
 a baby liss, and then he broke the taste of him 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.650
 more messy 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.469
 You're very involved with this 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.690
 fashion you have a stage that helps you or 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:28.000
 You even choose your clothes I like 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.980
 have my closet play with the pieces 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.470
 of clothing but often do not have as much 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.450
 time then sometimes I ask for help like this 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.640
 and even because I do not have time to 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.080
 research what is happening too 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.080

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.350

 fashion besides beautiful snow this way it has 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.150
 an affinity there that we feel that 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.650
 there is a way of expressing what 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.960
 I wanted to know that when I arrived in 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.450
 At night there is some time that 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.340
 You speak good now, it 's only Marian or 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.950
 You know, I lived that person who 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.990
 end of the novel how does this thing 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.480
 It's time you have to talk, not for 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.960
 reading and now it's me there is not me 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.480
 I think there is good you have in you 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.300
 Take a bath and take a shower. 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.040
 I enjoy this ritual so long I do not 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.410
 It matters the time I got to take the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.270
 Makeup is always a law that 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.030
 I put it that you could say that the 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.200
 my readers of 35 basic items in the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.060
 Your closet that you think is 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.240
 essential for a piece 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:34.420
 fundamental is yours during t-shirts 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:38.650
 my nails is this one has a little 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.290
 back so there is not always a way 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.350
 black blazer chuck black blazer 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.750
 fundamentally wants to know what you do 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.290
 when you are not recording is not 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.060
 in a play is not in a movie that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.489
 you already know what hobbies you like 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.200
 to do one of the best things that 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.730
 But do you like to do it when a 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.370
 novel or a play a movie is to travel more 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.209
 I have the destinations so difference by 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.890
 example when the season in São 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.070
 Paulo my piece making 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.200
 altruistic talk delicious to do 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:19.280
 I even came from tanzania 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.010
 I was a champion destination 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.780
 and that inspired me a lot for 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.660
 example you like most to do 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.690
 motorcycle or villain 0 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.130
 each one has its appeal 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.540
 I like thought-provoking characters. 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.310
 so my cheap is to search 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.570
 different human behaviors then 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:45.230
 for me a complex character and it's very 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.470
 more provocative is intriguing for my 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.570
 I work, I read that you rule more 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.190

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.090
 mainly during the week and has 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.260
 thought of organic vegetables and 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.380
 and advantage of the combination of 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.840
 food in my day to day I search 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.690
 have a good feed extremely 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.110
 balanced drink lots of water coconut water 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.880

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.210
 Dora does yoga gymnastics I love doing 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.490
 massage massage something that relaxes me 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.830
 deep but all this we will 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.729
 trying to balance our lack of 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.280
 routine 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.370
 Can you turn things around? 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.390
 Bad problems with the brigade 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.390
