welcome<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.790> my<00:00:02.909> fish<00:00:03.149> grow<00:00:04.069> okay<00:00:05.069> so<00:00:05.370> we're

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
welcome to my fish grow okay so we're

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.140 
welcome to my fish grow okay so we're
back<00:00:05.670> here<00:00:06.089> this<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.080> tank<00:00:07.379> with<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:08.550> lot<00:00:09.120> of

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
back here this is the tank with a lot of

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.230 
back here this is the tank with a lot of
hair<00:00:09.450> algae<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.340> these<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.700> teachers

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
hair algae and these going to teachers

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.760 
hair algae and these going to teachers
etc<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.070> our<00:00:14.219> first<00:00:14.570> time<00:00:15.570> here<00:00:16.470> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
etc so this is our first time here to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.290 
etc so this is our first time here to
change<00:00:17.160> water<00:00:19.010> now<00:00:20.010> he's<00:00:20.160> got<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> reservoir<00:00:20.880> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
change water now he's got a reservoir in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.890 
change water now he's got a reservoir in
this<00:00:21.480> closet<00:00:23.150> let's<00:00:24.150> check<00:00:24.390> see<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
this closet let's check see what the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.410 
this closet let's check see what the
salinity<00:00:25.199> hit<00:00:25.730> we<00:00:26.730> brought<00:00:26.939> him<00:00:27.090> up<00:00:27.180> help

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
salinity hit we brought him up help

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.389 
salinity hit we brought him up help
yesterday<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:30.300> way<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.920> reservoir

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
yesterday and that way the reservoir

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.209 
yesterday and that way the reservoir
will<00:00:32.520> circulate<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.680> hopefully<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> salts

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
will circulate and hopefully the salts

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.970 
will circulate and hopefully the salts
correct<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.850> everything<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.500> he's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
correct and everything so right now he's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.860 
correct and everything so right now he's
a<00:00:38.010> 1020

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.350 

don't<00:00:44.530> drop<00:00:44.829> tightrope<00:00:45.489> here

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.040 

is<00:00:52.360> Emma<00:00:52.600> talking<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.270> did<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.450> put<00:00:55.660> any<00:00:55.840> salt

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
is Emma talking so did you put any salt

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.510 
is Emma talking so did you put any salt
in<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.260> reservoir

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.450 

yeah<00:01:04.410> doesn't<00:01:05.410> stop<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.710> hydrometer<00:01:06.220> in<00:01:06.310> an

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
yeah doesn't stop the hydrometer in an

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.900 
yeah doesn't stop the hydrometer in an
a-hole<00:01:06.670> rate<00:01:06.940> I<00:01:07.980> just<00:01:08.980> stuck<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.340> hydrometer

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
a-hole rate I just stuck the hydrometer

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.480 
a-hole rate I just stuck the hydrometer
in<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.300> didn't<00:01:10.540> get<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.660> reading<00:01:11.050> at<00:01:11.490> one

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
in and I didn't get a reading at one

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:23.430 
in and I didn't get a reading at one
point<00:01:12.670> one<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.000> so<00:01:13.330> I<00:01:13.380> shook<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.410> up<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.710> bit<00:01:22.440> okay

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
point one is so I shook it up a bit okay

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.110 
point one is so I shook it up a bit okay
so<00:01:23.500> what<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.740> did<00:01:23.800> really<00:01:24.520> really<00:01:24.640> one<00:01:24.910> point

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
so what I did really really one point

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.850 
so what I did really really one point
one<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.300> then<00:01:25.600> I<00:01:25.660> did

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.670 

never<00:01:28.860> once<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> stirs<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.060> should<00:01:30.680> okay

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
never once it stirs up it should okay

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.760 
never once it stirs up it should okay
stirred<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.189> big<00:01:32.790> bet<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> won't<00:01:33.479> put<00:01:33.689> such

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
stirred up big bet it won't put such

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.529 
stirred up big bet it won't put such
attitude<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> dumped<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.149> not<00:01:36.329> just

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
attitude and you dumped all I'm not just

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:45.830 
attitude and you dumped all I'm not just
us<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:36.899> him<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> back<00:01:44.420> if<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.539> is<00:01:45.659> I'll

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
us or him go to the back if it is I'll

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.520 
us or him go to the back if it is I'll
be<00:01:45.960> real<00:01:46.170> surprised

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.410 

so<00:01:50.100> he's<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> reading<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.150> his

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so he's going to do a reading with his

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.410 
so he's going to do a reading with his
salt<00:01:51.750> meter<00:01:52.820> yeah<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> don't<00:01:54.090> know<00:01:54.150> what<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
salt meter yeah I don't know what is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.810 
salt meter yeah I don't know what is
about<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> red<00:01:55.260> streaks<00:01:55.740> something<00:01:56.700> about

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
about the red streaks something about

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.820 
about the red streaks something about
this<00:01:57.000> metal<00:01:57.630> halide<00:01:57.930> lighting<00:01:58.200> makes<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
this metal halide lighting makes the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.539 
this metal halide lighting makes the
camera<00:01:59.280> produce<00:01:59.549> red<00:01:59.790> streaks<00:02:00.150> oh<00:02:00.390> yeah<00:02:01.049> yeah

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
camera produce red streaks oh yeah yeah

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.490 
camera produce red streaks oh yeah yeah
looks<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> strobe<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.299> something<00:02:06.500> one

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
point 0 to five but you said to keep a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.520 
point 0 to five but you said to keep a
little<00:02:15.150> low<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.750> tank<00:02:16.050> was<00:02:16.170> running<00:02:16.470> at

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
little low in the tank was running at

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:26.840 
little low in the tank was running at
1.23<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.610> morning<00:02:20.180> one<00:02:21.180> point<00:02:21.480> 0<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.840> 0<00:02:25.310> ok<00:02:26.310> so

one hears ya and then we come over here
and<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:43.280> stick<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.519> here

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.930 

slow<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:59.300> 13-0<00:03:01.489> well<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.700> doesn't

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
slow to that 13-0 well this doesn't

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.120 
slow to that 13-0 well this doesn't
