00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
and these are very similar like so

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.520 
and these are very similar like so
similar<00:04:24.979> look

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
similar look

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.159 
similar look
basically<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:27.009> exact<00:04:27.430> same<00:04:27.759> on<00:04:28.270> your<00:04:28.719> face

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
basically the exact same on your face

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.080 
basically the exact same on your face
I<00:04:29.199> actually<00:04:29.650> kind<00:04:30.159> of<00:04:30.310> prefer<00:04:30.520> these<00:04:31.030> because

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
I actually kind of prefer these because

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.589 
I actually kind of prefer these because
this<00:04:31.750> one<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:32.349> more<00:04:32.800> like<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:33.069> rose<00:04:33.460> gold<00:04:34.150> color

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
this one is more like a rose gold color

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.300 
this one is more like a rose gold color
this<00:04:35.050> one's<00:04:35.259> straight-up<00:04:35.680> gold<00:04:36.009> but<00:04:36.219> this

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
this one's straight-up gold but this

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.399 
this one's straight-up gold but this
one's<00:04:36.520> more<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.789> a<00:04:36.939> rose<00:04:37.180> gold<00:04:37.539> color<00:04:37.840> which<00:04:38.319> i

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
one's more of a rose gold color which i

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.559 
one's more of a rose gold color which i
think<00:04:38.469> looks<00:04:38.680> really<00:04:38.969> nice<00:04:39.969> as<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.300> bronzer

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
think looks really nice as a bronzer

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.510 
think looks really nice as a bronzer
this<00:04:41.229> one's<00:04:41.439> also<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:41.919> a<00:04:42.009> straight-up<00:04:42.219> gold

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
this one's also just a straight-up gold

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.689 
this one's also just a straight-up gold
so<00:04:42.789> I<00:04:43.000> think<00:04:43.930> these<00:04:44.139> are<00:04:44.199> really<00:04:44.740> really

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
so I think these are really really

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.369 
so I think these are really really
really<00:04:45.879> similar<00:04:46.210> I'm<00:04:46.419> not<00:04:46.569> gonna<00:04:46.689> call<00:04:46.960> dupes

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
really similar I'm not gonna call dupes

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:51.270 
really similar I'm not gonna call dupes
but<00:04:48.280> they're<00:04:48.430> like<00:04:48.610> almost<00:04:49.469> dupes<00:04:50.469> and<00:04:50.949> if<00:04:51.099> I

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
but they're like almost dupes and if I

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.920 
but they're like almost dupes and if I
could<00:04:51.460> go<00:04:51.550> back<00:04:51.789> in<00:04:52.000> time<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.569> I<00:04:52.599> knew<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:52.780> would

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
could go back in time and I knew I would

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.050 
could go back in time and I knew I would
own<00:04:53.259> this<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.830> wouldn't<00:04:54.189> bought<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.759> because

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
own this I wouldn't bought this because

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.179 
own this I wouldn't bought this because
it<00:04:55.150> looks<00:04:55.300> pretty<00:04:55.539> it<00:04:56.080> looks<00:04:56.229> like<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.919> exact
