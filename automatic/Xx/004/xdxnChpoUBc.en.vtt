00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.990
 will pick up today we'll talk about 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.639
 customization of the technique in battlefield 4 but 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.770
 before i start talking about this topic 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.580
 I want to thank from the bottom of my heart 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.890
 Cyril pagina who provided me 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.170
 your account with alpha battlefield 4 and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.750
 thanks to this event I can more 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.630
 talk in detail about customization and about 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.460
 the technique itself how it feels like 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.880
 she drives as she shoots 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.380
 okay let's move on to disassembling on 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.590
 today it is known that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.680
 battlefield 4 tanks and bmp will appear 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.370
 helicopters and fighters and attack aircraft and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.350
 each type of boat has 5 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.250
 slots for modules except 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.710
 helicopter 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.710
 he has 4 of them as well 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.859
 slots for shooters but only in the case of 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.420
 tank bmp and helicopters think now 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.359
 can see more detail 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.640
 customization and we will start with tanks 1 slot 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.520
 responsible for the main weapon in alpha 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.740
 only two types of shells are available first 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.040
 this is standard armor-piercing steel 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.180
 2 this x exposes show is a projectile 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.320
 which judging by the description is calculated on 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.280
 suppression and destruction of equipment 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.860
 adversary but unfortunately hayek committed 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.710
 no, it does not increase the damage so much 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.900
 increases by only 2 units and and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.150
 the difference to be honest is some i don't 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.579
 noticed the most interesting thing in 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.340
 battlefield haix shell favor 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.619
 created as a vehicle against infantry they 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.079
 technology because it had a higher 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.689
 splash damage unfortunately I could not 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.390
 test up to find ammunition in alfino 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.750
 infantry because most of the infantry 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.700
 hang out on the last floor of the great 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.970
 skyscraper 2 slots responsible for 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.520
 extra ruble 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.370
 fingers represented only light machine gun 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.440
 caliber with them 62 by analogy slowed down 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.770
 filbin 3 most likely to appear and heavy 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.710
 machine gun caliber 12 7 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.710
 on the rest expect some tours 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.220
 guided missiles and suggestive will create 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.760
 the third slot is responsible for the contour of the measure and in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.040
 alpha is only you what others will be 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.720
 countermeasures are still unknown if you have 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.870
 have any thoughts on that 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.690
 write in the fourth start comment 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.270
 you kept a diverse optician 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.610
 the latest varied upgrade 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.790
 for example improved maintenance 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.530
 it is also possible to change camouflage and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.900
 finally there was an opportunity 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.290
 customize the place arrow certainly not 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.300
 you can change the trunk there for what 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.820
 rapid-fire grenade launcher yet but 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.390
 you can change optics and install 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.760
 various upgrades such as scanner 2 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.459
 impressions of the tanks are mixed as 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.280
 this alpha house is also visible positive 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.220
 changes the tank became more tenacious became 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.650
 less drift and become more passable 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.810
 but the helicopters have practically no 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.660
 days customization added 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.600
 only one additional slot which 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.820
 we can change the main weapon in 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.989
 alpha presents two types of basic 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.890
 weapons is the classic hydra missiles 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.440
 who serves as the main 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.640
 caliber like ground and air 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.120
 technology 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.549
 and the second type is rocket zuni these rockets 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.130
 have lower flight speeds and 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.799
 possess high use 900 like you 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.220
 understand this type of shells calculated 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.430
 on the destruction of enemy manpower then 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.099
 have infantry 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.290
 but if we talk about how now flies 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.989
 on the helicopter you can say one thing 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.480
 now the helicopter has become heavier in 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.810
 the literal sense of the word appeared 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.079
 a certain inertia of the helicopter also 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.930
 there was a return on rocket launch and if 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.719
 honestly this is confusing at first but i 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.239
 I think that from the severity of the machine itself and 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:08.689
 and the inertia of the helicopter became easier 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.939
 control from the keyboard to the controller is 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.870
 as it does not really affect because 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:16.820
 control or in my case handy so 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.599
 but now consider the most interesting 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.940
 type of technology 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:23.030
 these are boats and first i want to tell 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.570
 how do kittens behave on the battlefield 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.300
 this thing kicks ass and not afraid to not 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.389
 helicopters no tanks don't give infantry 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.930
 you are a real floating fortress 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.660
 analogue 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.780
 antrag from battlefield 3 by itself 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.430
 boat in the case of the siege card of Shanghai 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.380
 shoots almost the entire map even 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.229
 upper floors skyscraper 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.419
 well, and like a tank boat available 5 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.210
 modules 1 responsible for the main weapon 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:54.080
 there we have a bow between two kinds 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.599
 guns first this is classic bm lush 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.550
 30 millimeter cannon second variant 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.130
 twenty five millimeter cannon with 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.659
 explosive shells 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.789
 perfect anti cluster 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:06.789
 opponents on the roof of a skyscraper 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.530
 as well as extremely effective against 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.690
 helicopters second slot we have to be responsible for 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.870
 extra weapon there is a classic 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.570
 the choice between ptura we fix frame third 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.650
 slot optics April 4th also you can 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.740
 change camouflage in general the main thing 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.110
 change in customization technology 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.440
 is to give one just decided 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.770
 allow players to install everything and 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.949
 immediately and it pleases because of the numbers 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.289
 battlefield 3 customization system not 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.599
 I really liked it but I think that's all 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.220
 thanks for watching subscribe 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.849
 comment put the huskies see you on 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.570
 battlefield 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.570
 until
