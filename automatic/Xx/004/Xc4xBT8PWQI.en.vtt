00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.299
 let's do the pump test 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.299
 gasoline from 1 to 3 2004 engine 2.0 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.549
 of this part 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.609
 where he came from the salina to the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:22.600
 injectors let's get the line and 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.700
 let's find what is this 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.710
 originally to know what a 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.510
 side in this part 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.880
 here we remove it 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.330
 and we put the hose in the line of 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.330
 high pressure 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.000
 and we put it in an entrance 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.320
 the mediator of appreciation 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.130
 with depression 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.830
 let's do the test 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.730
 put gasoline between 55 and 60 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.500
 pounds of pressure when opening the living 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:10.450
 let's check right now 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.450
 how much it reaches to join we are going to put it 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.790
 in this way for the moment 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.140
 baby 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.140
 to leave the list that works 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.760
 how to be watching it at the same time 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.210
 what am I going to give him in this 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.710
 to see how much black 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.710
 thus 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.120
 be without giving it to be open the key 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.570
 to turn on the pump and do the 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.570
 Pressure 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.960
 and it was done 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.760
 and practically did not move anything we're going to 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.760
 do it again I close it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.470
 or the volvo april 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.670
 and he barely died 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.280
 it is being marked here 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.040
 25 pounds of pressure that is very little and 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.840
 is already the second one open without releasing the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.410
 pressure let's do it again to 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.410
 download any 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.380
 moved until 30 in the third 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.610
 Key opening inhibits depression 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.610
 let's do it again 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.040
 again 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.080
 up to 40 a quarter with four 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.730
 pressure opening 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:11.190
 the fifth arrived at 52 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.140
 what does this mean that is the pump of 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.170
 gasoline has approximately the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.940
 force of 15 pounds of pressure that is 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.560
 totally inadequate 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.110
 what can it be to walk 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.660
 this engine in over so we're going to 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.910
 proceed to change the pump that is in 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.220
 the tank 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.430
 and then we're going to 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.060
 pass the video to see how it is 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.800
 you can change the both 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.210
 for now we are going to connect everything 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.190
 again from the original form 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.520
 let's do the other video then 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.520
 Thank you
