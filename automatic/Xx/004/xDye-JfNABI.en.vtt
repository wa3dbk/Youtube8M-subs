had and ramped it up to a Lander eyes
degree<00:01:09.600> though<00:01:10.440> at<00:01:10.560> least<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.070> managed

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
degree though at least here they managed

degree though at least here they managed
to<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.910> funny<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.330> entertaining<00:01:12.420> at

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
to make it funny and entertaining at

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.450 
to make it funny and entertaining at
least<00:01:17.060> Jackson's<00:01:18.060> uppers<00:01:18.770> kinda<00:01:19.770> reasonable

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
least Jackson's uppers kinda reasonable

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.400 
least Jackson's uppers kinda reasonable
it<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:21.000> splendid<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.570> sure<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.140> didn't

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
it was splendid I sure but didn't

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.620 
it was splendid I sure but didn't
frustrate<00:01:22.890> me<00:01:23.040> or<00:01:23.160> anything<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.300> cool

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
frustrate me or anything so it's cool

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.359 
frustrate me or anything so it's cool
lander<00:01:25.320> ization<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.770> understandable

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
lander ization was understandable

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.889 
lander ization was understandable
because<00:01:26.460> Apple<00:01:26.910> Bloom<00:01:27.030> even<00:01:27.240> said<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.780> she

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
because Apple Bloom even said that she

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.600 
because Apple Bloom even said that she
was<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.229> overreacting<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.250> thought

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
was just overreacting I thought

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.920 
was just overreacting I thought
Applejack<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.300> couldn't<00:01:30.570> handle<00:01:30.810> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
Applejack just couldn't handle this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
Applejack just couldn't handle this
milestone<00:01:31.290> my<00:01:32.220> reasoning<00:01:32.580> behind<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
milestone my reasoning behind this is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.820 
milestone my reasoning behind this is
that<00:01:33.300> she's<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.690> been<00:01:33.869> overprotective<00:01:34.259> ever

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
that she's just been overprotective ever

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.770 
that she's just been overprotective ever
since<00:01:35.040> her<00:01:35.130> parents<00:01:35.280> died<00:01:35.820> she<00:01:36.360> lost<00:01:36.509> two

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
since her parents died she lost two

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.999 
since her parents died she lost two
people<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.229> she's<00:01:37.410> not<00:01:37.530> gonna<00:01:37.680> lose<00:01:37.860> another

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
people and she's not gonna lose another

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
people and she's not gonna lose another
so<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.789> that's<00:01:38.940> some<00:01:39.149> spaghetti<00:01:39.539> sauce

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so like that's some spaghetti sauce

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.180 
so like that's some spaghetti sauce
gonna<00:01:40.020> kill<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.530> probably<00:01:40.679> has<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> higher

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
gonna kill you it probably has a higher

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.410 
gonna kill you it probably has a higher
chance<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.550> doing<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.850> than<00:01:42.060> winning<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
chance of doing that than winning the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
chance of doing that than winning the
lottery<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.990> thought<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.319> only<00:01:43.470> real<00:01:43.830> bad<00:01:44.130> part

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
lottery I thought the only real bad part

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.190 
lottery I thought the only real bad part
about<00:01:44.640> AJ<00:01:45.300> was<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> foaming<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
about AJ was the foaming of the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
about AJ was the foaming of the
furniture<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.130> was<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> bit<00:01:47.610> much<00:01:47.819> but

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
furniture and that was a bit much but

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.370 
furniture and that was a bit much but
the<00:01:48.360> rest<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:48.929> that's<00:01:49.080> well<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the rest like then that's well the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.650 
the rest like then that's well the
apples<00:01:49.709> was<00:01:49.830> realistic<00:01:50.190> apples<00:01:51.090> hurt<00:01:51.270> okay

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
apples was realistic apples hurt okay

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.240 
apples was realistic apples hurt okay
that's<00:01:52.170> something<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.410> disagree<00:01:52.830> but<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> still

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that's something I disagree but it still

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.309 
that's something I disagree but it still
felt<00:01:53.459> it<00:01:53.550> was<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.000> touch<00:01:54.240> overblown<00:01:54.750> again

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
felt it was just a touch overblown again

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.320 
felt it was just a touch overblown again
not<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.619> bad<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.979> pinkie<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.729> fill<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> vanilla

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
not as bad as pinkie and fill it vanilla

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
just found it lazy about the sequence if

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.490 
just found it lazy about the sequence if

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
a cliche even if it may have been just a

I<00:05:10.240> had<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.540> similar<00:05:10.870> opinion<00:05:11.290> I<00:05:11.650> really<00:05:12.100> did

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
I had a similar opinion I really did

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.650 
I had a similar opinion I really did
like<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.610> episode<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.150> dialogue<00:05:13.510> was

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
like the episode but the dialogue was

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.600 
like the episode but the dialogue was
rather<00:05:13.870> clunky<00:05:14.169> with<00:05:14.440> its<00:05:14.590> wording<00:05:14.919> the<00:05:15.430> only

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
rather clunky with its wording the only

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.800 
rather clunky with its wording the only
thing<00:05:15.760> I<00:05:15.820> really<00:05:16.000> don't<00:05:16.180> understand<00:05:16.570> is<00:05:16.660> the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
thing I really don't understand is the

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.940 
thing I really don't understand is the
hate<00:05:16.990> this<00:05:17.169> episode<00:05:17.500> seems<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:17.860> have

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
hate this episode seems to have

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.129 
hate this episode seems to have
accumulated<00:05:18.280> as<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.479> can't<00:05:19.690> think<00:05:19.870> of<00:05:19.930> too<00:05:20.110> many

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
accumulated as I can't think of too many

accumulated as I can't think of too many
