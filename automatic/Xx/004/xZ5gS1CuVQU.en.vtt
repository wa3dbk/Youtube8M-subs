00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
can improve the looks of it by say

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.009 
can improve the looks of it by say
adding<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.650> light<00:02:44.650> switch<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.549> before<00:02:45.909> that

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
adding a light switch so before that

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.360 
adding a light switch so before that
make<00:02:47.019> sure<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.379> pre<00:02:47.739> compose<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.909> your<00:02:49.299> our

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
there's any changes you can simply

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.229 
there's any changes you can simply
reflect<00:02:55.659> from<00:02:55.810> inside<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.400> then<00:02:57.609> when<00:02:57.940> we<00:02:58.060> do

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
reflect from inside and then when we do

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.530 
reflect from inside and then when we do
the<00:02:58.599> light<00:02:58.900> sweet<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.349> looks<00:02:59.590> like<00:02:59.829> it's<00:03:00.040> like

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
the light sweet it looks like it's like

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.589 
the light sweet it looks like it's like
shining<00:03:01.540> across<00:03:02.139> the<00:03:04.620> logo<00:03:05.620> itself<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:07.150> put<00:03:07.420> a

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
shining across the logo itself so put a

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:16.190 
shining across the logo itself so put a
frame<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:09.430> start<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:10.090> frame<00:03:10.389> at<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.659> end

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.080 

so<00:03:17.200> now<00:03:17.349> that<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.680> got<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:17.920> down

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.620 

I'll<00:03:22.959> make<00:03:23.380> logo<00:03:24.550> disappear

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.059 

once<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.720> make<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.020> big<00:03:29.260> then<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.739> make<00:03:29.920> it

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
once you make it big then you make it

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.800 
once you make it big then you make it
small<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:35.250> now<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.310> have<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.849> general<00:03:37.180> idea<00:03:37.540> of

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
small so now we have the general idea of

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:45.000 
small so now we have the general idea of
how<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:39.430> whole<00:03:39.459> logos<00:03:40.060> with<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.300> look<00:03:44.010> because

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
how the whole logos with a look because

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.030 
how the whole logos with a look because
we<00:03:45.910> can<00:03:46.090> now<00:03:46.239> put<00:03:46.480> in<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.870> sauna<00:03:47.110> facts<00:03:50.040> in

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
we can now put in the sauna facts in

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.620 
we can now put in the sauna facts in
this<00:03:51.160> case<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.700> looks<00:03:51.730> like<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> couple<00:03:52.540> of

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
this case it looks like a couple of

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.630 
this case it looks like a couple of
switches<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.319> whooshes<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.040> whatnot<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:54.970> I

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
switches and whooshes and whatnot so I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.180 
switches and whooshes and whatnot so I
have<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.940> lot<00:03:58.299> of<00:03:58.480> solid<00:03:58.959> facts<00:03:59.230> because<00:03:59.560> we

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
have a lot of solid facts because we

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.039 
have a lot of solid facts because we
have<00:04:00.310> been<00:04:00.489> doing<00:04:00.819> videos<00:04:01.299> for<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.569> very<00:04:01.870> long

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
have been doing videos for a very long

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.050 
have been doing videos for a very long
time<00:04:02.080> so<00:04:02.500> we<00:04:03.190> have<00:04:03.310> light<00:04:03.610> breeds<00:04:03.910> of

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
time so we have light breeds of

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.530 
time so we have light breeds of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
soy effect you really have to sell that
idea<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.620> it's<00:04:30.490> very<00:04:31.140> happening<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.440> that

idea that it's very happening and that

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
idea that it's very happening and that
would<00:04:33.010> be<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.280> sound<00:04:33.610> for<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:34.229> so<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:36.400> timing

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
would be the sound for it so the timing

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.890 
would be the sound for it so the timing
of<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.240> is<00:04:37.539> very<00:04:38.410> crucial<00:04:39.330> sometimes<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:40.479> also

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
of it is very crucial sometimes you also

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.800 
of it is very crucial sometimes you also

for<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:49.390> in<00:04:49.510> this<00:04:49.600> case<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:51.090> have<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.270> side

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
for you so in this case I have a side

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:59.760 
for you so in this case I have a side

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
effect of say waters protein so up in

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.170 
effect of say waters protein so up in
the<00:04:59.950> water<00:05:00.160> spotting<00:05:00.840> sample<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.970> then<00:05:03.970> I

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
the water spotting sample and then I

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.440 
the water spotting sample and then I
think<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:04.780> doing<00:05:06.300> water

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
think of doing water

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.629 
think of doing water
animation<00:05:08.490> so<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.810> can<00:05:10.810> find<00:05:11.020> in<00:05:11.610> places<00:05:12.610> like

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
animation so you can find in places like

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.510

in<00:05:28.730> this<00:05:28.850> case<00:05:30.070> since<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.250> had<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.460> water<00:05:31.820> sign<00:05:32.030> in

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
in this case since I had a water sign in

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.410 
in this case since I had a water sign in
fact<00:05:32.330> I<00:05:32.510> added<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.170> water<00:05:33.500> effect<00:05:34.060> over<00:05:35.060> because

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
fact I added a water effect over because

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.050 
fact I added a water effect over because
the<00:05:35.540> background<00:05:35.900> is<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:37.750> beggar<00:05:38.750> is<00:05:38.930> a<00:05:38.990> rather

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
the background is a beggar is a rather

white and the water festival we can

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.380 
white and the water festival we can
really<00:05:43.310> see<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.700> water<00:05:43.990> so<00:05:45.610> simply<00:05:46.610> put<00:05:47.210> in

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
really see the water so simply put in

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.840 
really see the water so simply put in
the<00:05:47.630> kink<00:05:47.990> effect<00:05:48.560> so<00:05:49.190> that<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:49.430> can<00:05:49.580> change

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
the kink effect so that you can change

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.230 
the kink effect so that you can change
the<00:05:50.000> color<00:05:50.300> of<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:50.540> water<00:05:50.750> to<00:05:51.050> us<00:05:51.260> more

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
the color of the water to us more

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.760 
the color of the water to us more
cocktails<00:05:53.240> color<00:05:53.570> so<00:05:53.900> in<00:05:54.050> this<00:05:54.380> case<00:05:54.590> we

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
cocktails color so in this case we

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.100 
cocktails color so in this case we
choose<00:05:55.010> group<00:05:57.190> there<00:05:58.190> you<00:05:58.310> have<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:59.600> final

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110
