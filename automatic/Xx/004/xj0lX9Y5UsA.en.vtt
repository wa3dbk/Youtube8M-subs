not an engine guy here's the odometer

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.700 
not an engine guy here's the odometer
but<00:00:44.430> I'll<00:00:44.550> show<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> tire<00:00:45.150> tread<00:00:45.710> right

just to show you the car here's your

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.630 
just to show you the car here's your
odometer<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.830> mean<00:01:09.830> your<00:01:09.950> speedometer<00:01:10.490> it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
odometer I mean your speedometer it

odometer I mean your speedometer it
looks<00:01:10.790> like<00:01:10.939> it's<00:01:11.150> staying<00:01:11.479> pretty<00:01:11.630> stable

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
looks like it's staying pretty stable

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.810 
looks like it's staying pretty stable
right<00:01:12.229> now<00:01:12.880> sometimes<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.090> goes<00:01:14.180> boom

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.310 

and<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.450> kind<00:01:17.660> of<00:01:17.720> goes<00:01:17.840> up<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.260> down

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
and it kind of goes up and down

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.140 
and it kind of goes up and down
sometimes<00:01:18.860> but<00:01:19.220> right<00:01:19.490> now<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:19.850> kind<00:01:20.060> of

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
sometimes but right now it's kind of

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.930 
sometimes but right now it's kind of
stable<00:01:21.010> we'll<00:01:22.010> see<00:01:22.160> if<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.370> can<00:01:22.400> hear<00:01:22.700> this

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so I did find out a few things about it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:55.190 
so I did find out a few things about it
it<00:01:43.930> has<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:45.510> let's<00:01:46.510> see

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
autonomy - okay it's electronically

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.449 
autonomy - okay it's electronically
tuned<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.810> 500<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.190> 400<00:02:23.190> horsepower

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
tuned and and it's 500 to 400 horsepower

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.420 
tuned and and it's 500 to 400 horsepower
is<00:02:23.700> at<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.850> 7<00:02:24.209> 500<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> 700<00:02:25.650> horsepower<00:02:25.890> so

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
is at a 7 500 to 700 horsepower so

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.449 
is at a 7 500 to 700 horsepower so
that's<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.000> okay

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
that's what this is okay

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.330 
that's what this is okay

shift kit in it too so I'll show you how

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.720 
shift kit in it too so I'll show you how
that<00:02:41.310> works

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that works

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:50.960 
that works
hold<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.450> please<00:02:42.660> end<00:02:42.930> up

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
when I drop into the gears it's like

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.600 
when I drop into the gears it's like
this<00:02:53.790> first<00:02:55.200> second<00:02:56.200> third<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.220> mean<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.490> like

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
this first second third I mean it's like

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.280 
this first second third I mean it's like
it's<00:02:57.850> really<00:02:58.240> tight<00:02:58.630> it's<00:02:58.810> like<00:02:58.900> from<00:02:59.050> here<00:02:59.230> to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
it's really tight it's like from here to

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.990 
it's really tight it's like from here to
here<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.680> it's<00:02:59.830> in<00:02:59.980> gear<00:03:00.220> that's<00:03:00.520> it

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
here and it's in gear that's it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.410 
here and it's in gear that's it
it's<00:03:01.720> like<00:03:01.840> real<00:03:02.110> tight<00:03:02.410> shifting<00:03:03.360> okay<00:03:04.410> bye
