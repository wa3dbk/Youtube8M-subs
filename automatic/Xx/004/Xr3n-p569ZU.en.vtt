00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 and two of vr this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.010
 teach how to delete the records of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.300
 your operating system in this case is going to 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.309
 be windows 7 is basically delete 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.760
 all the garbage all that no longer 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.010
 we occupy in our computer and it's far 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.100
 stored on the hard drive and then we 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.599
 cause space or things that are things 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.340
 that not even we see is not 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 if you have very saturated what is this your 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.910
 hard drive is going to free up space and goes 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.059
 to clear the cache of our 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.399
 browser and it's going to be a little bit 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.950
 keep is like a maintenance type at 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.790
 operating system if you guys like that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.470
 they want to call him 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.730
 let's go eraser let's clear the 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.480
 records let's clean the system 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.670
 how this is done is not very easy what 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:07.240
 only thing we have to do is 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.860
 this press the home key r and we're going 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.050
 to write what is 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.140
 percent theme 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.220
 we close percent and give you the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.770
 to accept 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.540
 all these all this family do not 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.980
 appears a lot but you can 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:32.760
 appear up to 10 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:35.970
 10 20 and 30 do not call me that's 32 gb 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.520
 they are temporary files of the system not 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.000
 I know if you guys knew that windows 7 is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.160
 keep up what is a click that you 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.980
 das is going to store it going 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.540
 storing it is stored and goes 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.550
 turning into garbage there are that appear 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.260
 little ones in this case, not you and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.740
 you will know that so much garbage 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.520
 appear we select everything 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.520
 initiated forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.360
 we select one and control 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.500
 and we eliminate everything 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.750
 eliminate let's go yes 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.420
 it tells me that this can not be eliminated 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.130
 you can eliminate kids because then that 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.200
 probably the program is 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.740
 using things like just 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.240
 let omit omit omit and it's going 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.770
 to eliminate this we leave those that do not 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.780
 you can delete it out after we go 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.710
 to go to what started and we're going to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.600
 write event viewer viewer 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.600
 events here in our appears 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.560
 once being in this little eye what 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.150
 let's do is 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.390
 is to go to windows registry 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.250
 application 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.640
 we wait a moment to dedicate all 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.640
 the applications 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.830
 in trash that is not used 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.260
 Once we are there, we click 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.980
 right we give you empty record and 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.690
 erase the security ones we go to 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.050
 leave ok 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.610
 those of installation we have zero you 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.420
 do not count them appear among the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.750
 delete the same as the application step 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.170
 system 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.760
 I do not know about you when they appear like 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.390
 let's empty 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.390
 something weird 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.210
 and we all close now 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.960
 now we are going to go here in what is 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.030
 started team we selected the disk 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.890
 hard and we give him 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.430
 properties after we must release 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.430
 space 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.460
 we wait a moment 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.340
 depending when your disc is 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.630
 hard is the time it will take 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.210
 that usually there are many people 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.900
 that does not do this since it was bought 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:18.140
 your side does not erase the files or 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:23.090
 the trash then be in slow motion the 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.460
 set this once disappear is 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.520
 this little window 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.449
 having this little window 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.009
 and select all these crimes 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:38.009
 disappear meter let's accept in 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.009
 records 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.350
 to accept 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.550
 announce 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.550
 we update 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.990
 and you, if you never had 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.210
 Done will free up disk space 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.620
 hard this time because I'm not going 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.970
 to release nothing not because I already had 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.820
 done before this now let's go to what 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.580
 what is home 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.289
 control Panel 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.180
 Internet options Internet networks will 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.969
 we are going to give here in the present where 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.050
 delete all tabs are marked 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.050
 if you give him the link 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.620
 mode singer is finishing the 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.389
 goat bacteria 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.000
 Once we finish, we give 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.300
 to accept 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.620
 we close really update and that 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.080
 it would be basically what is the 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.990
 operating system maintenance very 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.590
 simple and very basic I hope you serve them 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:49.480
 of something this video we see in the 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.480
