00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.670 
alright guys so here is the mandroid
action<00:01:33.390> figure<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> looks<00:01:33.900> pretty<00:01:34.229> big<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
action figure it looks pretty big I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.830 
action figure it looks pretty big I
believe<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> same<00:01:35.520> base<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.630> Iron

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
believe it's the same base as the Iron

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.170 
believe it's the same base as the Iron
Monger<00:01:37.140> built<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> serious<00:01:38.009> figure<00:01:38.310> obviously

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
Monger built a serious figure obviously

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.810 
Monger built a serious figure obviously
a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.329> bit<00:01:39.450> different<00:01:40.220> upper<00:01:41.220> body<00:01:41.430> but

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
a little bit different upper body but

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.039 
a little bit different upper body but
the<00:01:42.000> legs<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> arms<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.750> pretty<00:01:42.869> much

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the legs and the arms are pretty much

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.859 
the legs and the arms are pretty much
the<00:01:43.140> same<00:01:43.350> overall<00:01:44.280> maybe<00:01:44.759> maybe<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.689> same

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the same overall maybe maybe the same

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.020 
the same overall maybe maybe the same
upper<00:01:46.170> body<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.649> they<00:01:46.799> maybe<00:01:46.979> put<00:01:47.579> an<00:01:47.670> extra

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
upper body but they maybe put an extra

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.300 
upper body but they maybe put an extra
layer<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.420> top<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.840> armor<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.470> can't<00:01:50.220> be

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
layer on top for the armor but can't be

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
layer on top for the armor but can't be
too<00:01:50.640> sure<00:01:51.060> I'd<00:01:51.299> never<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.229> is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
too sure I'd never got that but this is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.780 
too sure I'd never got that but this is
still<00:01:52.470> pretty<00:01:52.530> nice<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.579> looks

still pretty nice I like how it looks

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.270 
still pretty nice I like how it looks
pretty<00:01:54.659> simplified<00:01:55.079> linking<00:01:55.740> sculpt<00:01:56.100> but

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
pretty simplified linking sculpt but

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.480 
pretty simplified linking sculpt but
very<00:01:56.579> effective<00:01:57.180> nonetheless<00:01:58.369> still<00:01:59.369> looks

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
very effective nonetheless still looks

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.480 
very effective nonetheless still looks
really<00:01:59.549> nice<00:01:59.790> overall

close<00:02:04.479> definitely<00:02:05.479> like<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.689> detail<00:02:06.110> looks

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
close definitely like the detail looks

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.949 
close definitely like the detail looks
pretty<00:02:07.100> good<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.090> paint<00:02:08.450> job<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.720> know

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
pretty good now the paint job you know

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.600 
pretty good now the paint job you know
it's<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.130> plain<00:02:10.130> plastic<00:02:11.030> silverish<00:02:12.610> plastic

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.820 
it's a plain plastic silverish plastic
not<00:02:13.910> really<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> paint<00:02:14.450> job<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.140> texture

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
not really a paint job but the texture

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.699 
not really a paint job but the texture
in<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.790> see<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.150> looks<00:02:17.330> pretty<00:02:17.540> good

not<00:04:14.079> that<00:04:14.230> bad<00:04:14.379> either<00:04:14.409> so<00:04:15.219> it's<00:04:15.340> still<00:04:15.579> pretty

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
not that bad either so it's still pretty

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.400 
not that bad either so it's still pretty
cool<00:04:16.030> looking<00:04:16.359> figure<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.810> know<00:04:16.930> it's<00:04:17.199> just<00:04:17.259> a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
cool looking figure you know it's just a

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.590 
cool looking figure you know it's just a
nice<00:04:17.560> bill<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.889> figure<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.220> have<00:04:18.449> some<00:04:19.449> people

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
nice bill to figure to have some people

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.670 
nice bill to figure to have some people
like<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:20.019> some<00:04:20.049> people<00:04:20.169> don't

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
like it some people don't

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.020 
like it some people don't
I<00:04:20.739> think<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.070> lot<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.310> people<00:04:21.579> do<00:04:21.669> like<00:04:21.880> it

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
I think a lot of people do like it

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.189 
I think a lot of people do like it
though<00:04:22.060> because<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.630> could<00:04:22.750> have<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.930> nice

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
though because you could have a nice

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.499 
though because you could have a nice
army<00:04:23.620> full<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:23.949> these<00:04:24.100> which<00:04:24.820> would<00:04:24.970> be<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.270> lot

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
army full of these which would be a lot

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:26.460 
army full of these which would be a lot
of<00:04:25.630> money<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.900> think

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
of money I think

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.580 
of money I think
but<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.940> imagine<00:04:28.389> having<00:04:28.509> to<00:04:28.840> at<00:04:28.990> least<00:04:29.380> two

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
but you imagine having to at least two

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.100 
but you imagine having to at least two
of<00:04:29.740> these<00:04:29.889> just<00:04:30.460> standing<00:04:30.880> side-by-side<00:04:31.479> I'll

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
of these just standing side-by-side I'll

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.460 
of these just standing side-by-side I'll
be<00:04:32.169> pretty<00:04:32.440> cool<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.680> have<00:04:32.830> for<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.610> picture

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
be pretty cool to have for a picture

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.290 
be pretty cool to have for a picture
let's<00:04:35.470> get<00:04:35.680> into<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:36.130> little<00:04:36.639> bit<00:04:36.729> more<00:04:36.850> details

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
let's get into a little bit more details

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.330 
let's get into a little bit more details
overall<00:04:37.870> on<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.199> figure<00:04:38.500> like<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.740> city<00:04:39.039> has<00:04:39.310> a

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
overall on this figure like a city has a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.490 
overall on this figure like a city has a
cannon<00:04:39.910> up<00:04:40.030> here<00:04:40.210> which<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.419> pretty<00:04:40.660> cool<00:04:40.960> and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
cannon up here which is pretty cool and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.020 
cannon up here which is pretty cool and
he<00:04:41.530> has<00:04:41.740> some<00:04:41.919> weapons<00:04:42.280> on<00:04:42.400> his<00:04:42.580> arm

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
he has some weapons on his arm

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.210 
he has some weapons on his arm
pretty<00:04:43.479> nice<00:04:43.630> also<00:04:44.110> on<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.800> one<00:04:44.979> looks<00:04:45.190> like

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
pretty nice also on this one looks like

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.240 
pretty nice also on this one looks like
it's<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.610> Gatling<00:04:46.360> gun<00:04:46.919> connected<00:04:47.919> into<00:04:48.130> his

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
it's a Gatling gun connected into his

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.820 
it's a Gatling gun connected into his
arm<00:04:48.460> looks<00:04:48.970> pretty<00:04:49.240> nice<00:04:51.240> into<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.830> it's

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
arm looks pretty nice into that it's

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.310 
arm looks pretty nice into that it's
pretty<00:04:54.009> cool<00:04:54.360> not<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.509> much<00:04:55.690> not<00:04:56.169> the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
pretty cool not that much not the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.839 
pretty cool not that much not the
biggest<00:04:56.680> detail<00:04:57.039> and<00:04:57.190> paint<00:04:57.430> but<00:04:57.639> I<00:04:57.669> think

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
biggest detail and paint but I think

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:58.980 
biggest detail and paint but I think
it's<00:04:57.970> pretty<00:04:58.120> effective<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:58.630> good<00:04:58.750> enough

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
it's pretty effective and good enough

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.020 
it's pretty effective and good enough
maybe<00:04:59.500> give<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.830> nice<00:04:59.979> black<00:05:00.310> wash<00:05:00.580> on<00:05:00.849> that

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
maybe give you a nice black wash on that

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.540 
maybe give you a nice black wash on that
to<00:05:01.270> make<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.479> look<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.990> little<00:05:02.440> bit<00:05:02.650> better<00:05:02.800> but

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
to make it look a little bit better but

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.029 
to make it look a little bit better but
still<00:05:03.699> very<00:05:04.300> decent<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.289> over<00:05:05.470> here<00:05:05.740> he<00:05:05.860> has<00:05:06.009> a

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
still very decent and over here he has a

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.589 
still very decent and over here he has a
huge<00:05:06.430> blade<00:05:06.849> if<00:05:07.539> you<00:05:07.660> want<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.900> call<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:08.139> that

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
huge blade if you want to call it that

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.969 
huge blade if you want to call it that
this<00:05:10.599> was<00:05:10.750> striking<00:05:11.199> I<00:05:11.289> guess<00:05:11.440> like<00:05:11.620> there's

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
this was striking I guess like there's

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.360 
this was striking I guess like there's
something<00:05:13.199> so<00:05:14.199> overall<00:05:14.590> definitely<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.130> really

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
something so overall definitely a really

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.129 
something so overall definitely a really
cool<00:05:15.550> figure<00:05:15.760> I'm<00:05:16.030> finally<00:05:16.720> happy<00:05:16.870> to

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
cool figure I'm finally happy to

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.159 
cool figure I'm finally happy to
actually<00:05:17.889> have<00:05:18.039> this<00:05:18.159> guy<00:05:18.310> fully<00:05:19.210> built<00:05:19.840> and

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
you know I first bought the wave of

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.020 
you know I first bought the wave of
figures<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.919> only<00:05:24.070> bought<00:05:24.400> like<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.970> think

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
figures I only bought like I think

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.270 
figures I only bought like I think
Captain<00:05:25.419> America<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:25.840> Bucky<00:05:26.050> had<00:05:26.919> the<00:05:27.070> head

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
Captain America and Bucky had the head

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.040 
Captain America and Bucky had the head
and<00:05:27.490> ding<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.699> leg<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.090> didn't<00:05:28.270> think<00:05:28.780> anything

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
and ding a leg and didn't think anything

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.460 
and ding a leg and didn't think anything
of<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.740> slowly<00:05:30.520> slowly<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.539> started<00:05:31.659> to<00:05:32.320> buy

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.230 
of it and slowly slowly I started to buy
more<00:05:32.770> figures<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.370> I<00:05:33.400> realized<00:05:33.789> oh<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.000> have

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.969 
more figures and I realized oh I have
all<00:05:34.419> these<00:05:34.509> pieces<00:05:34.750> I<00:05:34.990> think<00:05:35.199> I'm<00:05:35.560> almost<00:05:35.680> done

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
all these pieces I think I'm almost done

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:36.420 
all these pieces I think I'm almost done
actually

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
actually

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.659 
actually
and<00:05:36.759> I<00:05:37.240> actually<00:05:37.419> was<00:05:37.690> so<00:05:38.460> definitely<00:05:39.460> pretty

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669

cool<00:05:39.699> from<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.270> half<00:05:40.479> and<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:41.320> know<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.470> lot<00:05:41.620> of

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
cool from the half and I know a lot of

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.050 
cool from the half and I know a lot of
people<00:05:41.919> actually<00:05:42.009> have<00:05:42.220> more<00:05:42.580> than<00:05:42.759> one<00:05:42.909> of
