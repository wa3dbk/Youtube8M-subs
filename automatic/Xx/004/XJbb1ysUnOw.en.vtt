00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.769
 you are careful when you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.809
 write a romance to three things do not 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.070
 do not rush the first part 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.020
 the mistake I see most often 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.630
 be committed by perpetrators who begins 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 in romance writing is to go 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.289
 too fast on the beginning of the relationship 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 we know we want the characters 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 end up together but it takes them 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.109
 give time to get to know each other 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.880
 we have to find something else another 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.880
 intrigue in the context that allow 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.010
 to nurture this relationship is to bring 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.559
 gradually privacy your reader 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750
 will not hang so much if you give it to him 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.270
 the meeting followed by the passage to the act 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.620
 both characters must be 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.640
 get to know each other after not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.320
 necessarily to know each other well but 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.510
 any case be in a situation their 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.770
 intimacy and foster it's during 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.000
 this layer the reader is projected 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.949
 in their relationship it's very important 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.329
 not to neglect this phase 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.070
 be careful to mix obstacles 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.879
 external and internal obstacles if 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.320
 the characters are themselves 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.000
 responsible for the failure of the relationship 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.199
 actors ' emotions will be more 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.339
 strong but for the characters 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.470
 be responsible for the relationship of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.659
 the failure of the relationship they have to 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.510
 have an emotional flaw that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.430
 forces to sabotage their relationships 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 must not do not be afraid 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 to do too much at the moment of the breakup 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 when you are going to have the clash 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.090
 do not leave any exit 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.490
 put yourself in a stalemate 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.110
 we really need to feel that the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.939
 relationship is impossible from this 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.070
 stage there that the offending character has 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.500
 really made a big mistake and that he 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.290
 will have to really really drooled for 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 may succeed in regaining the other and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.159
 it's not won from advanced - it will be won 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.600
 more advanced the your reader will tell himself 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.950
 ah but it's impossible now he 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.110
 will never be able to catch up on 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 that shot there the more you hooked it 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.649
 the more it would be interesting for you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.210
 after developed more it will be hard to 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.790
 write but it would be interesting 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.079
 combining this is the romantic intrigued and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.689
