00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.349
 hello you love that nice you again 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.180
 is there since there was yes yes one 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.560
 little time now no video from me 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.779
 now it was just me 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.939
 had a lot to do and therefore 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 not for video shoot, for example 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 videos have come cut 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 but now I'm back and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.489
 today there is a small dm from me 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.860
 was again busy shopping at dm again 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.079
 and if you want to know what I have there 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 Everything packed in my shopping bag 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.260
 have then stay tuned and then go 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.809
 it's already happening 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.940
 Let's start with the first product and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.019
 though that is a concealer you were 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.789
 again on the search 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:57.899
 and that is the p2 concealer matty 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.329
 fine perfect and I yalcin 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.550
 already tested twice and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.620
 I really have to say that 's right 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.430
 I'm going to be really good 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.229
 add a little review and yes 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 I think it is definitely from the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.080
 consistency really well and also by the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.850
 ceiling force now has two euro 95 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.600
 tasted and I think that's right 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.600
 class 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.470
 the second product what I with in the gm 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.660
 This blue shampoo has been taken 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.610
 from sopa you will be safe now 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.560
 ask to wait year I buy flat 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.460
 shampoo if I have red hair 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.850
 but that is related to me 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.010
 me also a hair color 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.650
 for example, blondierung bought 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.920
 for example 2 and that was the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.600
 concealer fell under it and that 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.450
 is that once garnier not crack that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:04.980
 Hair color bright nature clubs and once 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.550
 from Schwarzkopf the l1 + + extremely up 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.190
 brighter and yes I have mine again 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.780
 Hair blondes in this time since me 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.090
 found that my red 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.910
 hair color unfortunately in the blond hair 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.980
 not really staying in there 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.440
 60 insanely fast and it looks 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.360
 just unpleasant if after this 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.730
 plans to come through again and I feel 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.160
 it just so the hair color then 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.870
 somehow very dirty and acts 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.510
 not beautiful bright red anymore 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.970
 yes everything just looks very neglected 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.000
 I will definitely do that one 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.320
 Therefore, turning another video would be 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.120
 Of course, if you like the whole thing 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.190
 because of that a channel is interested 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.850
 Subscribe that he will see the same then 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.620
 when the video is then uploaded 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.910
 and yes we can definitely 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.300
 be curious and I hope, of course 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.230
 that what is going on with all this red 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.740
 pigments in the hair and in addition I have 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.340
 me still with dm this intense mask 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.280
 bought from barea and that is one thing 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.620
 intensive care h mask with vanilla and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.400
 almond oil for stressed and 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.950
 damaged hair and cabaret or 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.990
 For example dm has a little bit that 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.300
 sortiment switched over all this 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:27.360
 things like this intense moisture 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.980
 with for example the orange became yes 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.990
 removed from the assortment 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.950
 That's why I needed a little one now 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.920
 alternative search and then have me 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.170
 opted for this intensive care and 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.410
 I hope that's just fine that is now 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.739
 with vanilla and almond oil and I think 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.920
 she really really good 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.770
 and yes you do that after, so to speak 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.470
 one has washed the hair in the hair 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.820
 and then lets this about it yes 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.920
 always two to three minutes 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.530
 act and then you play that 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.450
 whole again and I hope that 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.130
 whole helps just when I'm back 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.070
 my hair for her and in these 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.530
 of course madly damaged and he 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.130
 I hope that 's a little bit 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.790
 maybe pick up the damage yes say 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.169
 me once 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.930
 which has now cost a euro 95 and 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.730
 yes, I'm really looking forward to the 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.020
 to try intensive mask 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.940
 and if you then of course in any 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.190
 if the whole report a little 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.350
 which has brought and I still know 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.480
 very sweet and I have one 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.900
 new toothbrush needed and there i have 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.630
 this taken me and that is 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.980
 a limited edition, so to speak 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:48.910
 a style and care hard fh i say 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:53.260
 already toothbrush and yes that has such a 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.550
 funny cool retro design and has 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.320
 cost one euro 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.610
 and that's why I have it very simple 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.160
 taken so that it was actually 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.200
 already with the little dm it was probably 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.970
 not the crazy exploit now 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.950
 I hope the video has you of course 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.620
 Nevertheless, we like to have one 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.510
 Thumb up there if you have the video 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.540
