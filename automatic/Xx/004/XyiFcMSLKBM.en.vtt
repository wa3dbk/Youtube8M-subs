the<00:00:02.700> first<00:00:02.939> thing<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.330> did<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.720> pain<00:00:04.080> at<00:00:04.290> the

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
the first thing I did with a pain at the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.639 
the first thing I did with a pain at the
patient<00:00:05.000> history<00:00:06.000> next<00:00:06.750> I'll<00:00:06.899> measure<00:00:07.170> we

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
patient history next I'll measure we

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.600 
patient history next I'll measure we
using<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.849> standard<00:00:09.809> balance<00:00:10.230> or<00:00:10.610> electronic

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
using a standard balance or electronic

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.609 
using a standard balance or electronic
scale<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.389> don't<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.690> either<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.139> those

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.840 

however<00:00:16.619> when<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> patient<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.550> must<00:00:17.730> be

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
however when you a patient they must be

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.320 
however when you a patient they must be
sure<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.449> remove<00:00:18.869> any<00:00:19.160> extra<00:00:20.160> closing<00:00:20.490> or

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
sure and remove any extra closing or

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.410 
sure and remove any extra closing or
heavy<00:00:21.480> clothing<00:00:21.779> after<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:23.189> away<00:00:24.029> then<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
heavy clothing after you away then you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.990 
heavy clothing after you away then you
sure<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.840> measure<00:00:25.050> their<00:00:25.289> height<00:00:25.529> using<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
sure that measure their height using the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.849 
sure that measure their height using the
measuring<00:00:27.630> that's<00:00:27.810> pull<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> balance

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
measuring that's pull on the balance

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.679 
measuring that's pull on the balance
scale<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.820> an<00:00:29.910> accurate<00:00:30.300> reading<00:00:30.480> the

scale for an accurate reading the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.860 
scale for an accurate reading the
patient<00:00:31.080> must<00:00:31.170> be<00:00:31.489> shoeless<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:33.750> would

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
patient must be shoeless and you would

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.920 
patient must be shoeless and you would
send<00:00:34.110> ahead<00:00:34.440> beats<00:00:34.680> directly<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.489> head

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.910

you<00:02:13.950> should<00:02:13.980> look<00:02:14.190> at<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> respirations

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
you should look at the respirations

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.729 
you should look at the respirations
however<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.629> say<00:02:15.840> off<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.019> patient<00:02:16.530> know

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
however you say off the patient know

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.910 
however you say off the patient know
you're<00:02:17.010> looking<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.370> respirations<00:02:18.920> because

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
you're looking for respirations because
