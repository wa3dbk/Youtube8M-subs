00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
about the importance of the bottomlands

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.850 
about the importance of the bottomlands
in<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:27.880> area<00:00:28.210> when<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.079> Sabine<00:00:29.349> River<00:00:29.470> floods

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.650 
in the area when the Sabine River floods
they<00:00:30.099> turned<00:00:30.340> to<00:00:30.429> wetlands<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.029> they<00:00:31.150> filter

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
they turned to wetlands and they filter

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.630 
they turned to wetlands and they filter
the<00:00:31.990> sediment<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:32.980> pollution<00:00:33.250> that<00:00:33.550> are

the sediment and the pollution that are
in<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.790> water<00:00:33.970> it's<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.570> water<00:00:34.720> that<00:00:34.839> we

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
in the water it's the water that we

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.509 
in the water it's the water that we
eventually<00:00:35.260> drink<00:00:35.739> so<00:00:35.920> it's<00:00:36.070> important<00:00:36.489> that

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
eventually drink so it's important that

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:37.549 
eventually drink so it's important that
it's<00:00:36.760> clean

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it's clean

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.979
