 and I physics the laws of thermodynamics law 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 0 of the thermodynamics if two objects a and b 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.389
 out of technical contact with each other 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.650
 each thermal equilibrium with the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 third object 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 then the ahb objects are found 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.939
 thermal equilibrium 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.210
 we have the example one before contact 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.260
 we have to be different from different tea 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.660
 of tv 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.040
 the first object came into contact with it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 with objects and then object b entered 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.649
 in contact with the object if the result 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.980
 of this standing experiment a equal to tb and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.800
 even if the temperature of objects between the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.649
 thermal equilibrium its application in 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.000
 dentistry occurs during the making 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.489
 dentures 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.699
 the value is applied to resin but mention 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.770
 of the total prosthesis in the bath with 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.530
 heated water 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.050
 by finding the water temperature at 65 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.329
 degrees Celsius at resin temperature 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.630
 trying to reach equilibrium 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.180
 temperature when the temperature of the resin 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.570
 reach the value close to 65 degrees 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.750
 celsius cleavage of the molecules occurs 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.100
 of benzoyl peroxide forming 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.340
 free radicals 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 This stage of the reaction 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.909
 polymerization process which is 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 esoteric teacher to solve mia 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.710
 also causes the temperature to rise 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.060
 so the temperature of the resin 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.369
 continues to increase 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.070
 even after reaching the thermal equilibrium 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.310
 with the bath water according to the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.549
 monomers are being consumed in the reaction 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.770
 the amount of heat generated is decreased 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.649
 which promote the drop in temperature of the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.570
 resin around 90 minutes 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.000
 increases the temperature of the water and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.860
 consequently it is resin resin 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.290
 establish a large mining pole 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.549
 still while the first law of 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.610
 thermodynamics 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.549
 the first law of thermodynamics then 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.160
 an energy conservation law 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.660
 being announced now is the assignment 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.300
 God's inner energy 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.970
 the theme is expressed through the difference 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.070
 between the amount of kahlo exchanged with 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.260
 environment and the work carried out 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.360
 during processing 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.310
 we have as an example during a 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.860
 the gas can exchange energy 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.380
 with the environment in two ways 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.050
 heat and work 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.170
 its application in dentistry is due to 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.370
 anthological compressor where the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.070
 atmosphere enters the cylinder at low 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.950
 pressure soon after it is compressed by the 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.440
 cylinder resulting in a variation of 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.260
 work and consequently a variation 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.280
 of internal energy dubai second law of the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.230
 thermodynamics 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600
 making a comparison between the first 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.700
 and the second law of thermodynamics 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.890
 we can say that while the first 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.110
 law of thermodynamics establishes 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.490
 conservation of energy in any 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.560
 transformation 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.810
 the second law establishes conditions for 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.140
 that the thermodynamic transformations 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.720
 may occur and not in the second law 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.610
 of thermodynamics involves situations in which 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.140
 that value is transformed into other 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.480
 forms of energy 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.060
 its application in dentistry is due to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.370
 sterilization greenhouses where the energy 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.640
 is transformed into electric horse and 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.980
 consequent increase in temperature and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.950
 exteriorization of utensils the third 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.540
 ent of entropy thermodynamics is the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.600
 of particle disorder that 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.330
 constitute the material the law therefore 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.630
 provides a reference point for the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.820
 determination of the entropy value 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.090
 observations when the system receives callus 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.090
 that greater than zero your entropy increases 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.450
 when the system serves to heat me 90 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.940
 its entropy decreases if the system does not 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.760
 exchange I say that is equal to zero 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.500
 its entropy remains constant its 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.050
 application in dentistry occurs in the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.480
 making a long glass using to be 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.640
 initially in the solid state to 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.880
 receive its normal state of 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.450
 entropy or being altered 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.790
 your initial physical state to the state 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.620
 liquid with this being to adapt and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.620
 models the dental model
