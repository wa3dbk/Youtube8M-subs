at<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.130> base<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.729> furniture<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.899> is

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
at the base of the furniture this is

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.649 
at the base of the furniture this is
lined<00:01:50.469> with<00:01:50.649> talcum<00:01:51.130> powder<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:51.939> bedbugs

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
lined with talcum powder and bedbugs

lined with talcum powder and bedbugs
cannot<00:01:53.380> crawl<00:01:53.740> out<00:01:53.979> of<00:01:54.159> here<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:54.490> if<00:01:54.639> they're

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
cannot crawl out of here so if they're

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.819 
cannot crawl out of here so if they're
trying<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.119> come<00:01:55.359> to<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.779> bed<00:01:55.959> they're<00:01:56.529> caught

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
trying to come to the bed they're caught

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.620 
trying to come to the bed they're caught
in<00:01:56.859> this<00:01:57.130> outer<00:01:57.399> ring<00:01:57.759> if<00:01:58.179> they're<00:01:58.450> coming

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
in this outer ring if they're coming

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.120 
in this outer ring if they're coming
from<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.170> bed<00:01:59.409> they're<00:01:59.679> caught<00:01:59.889> in<00:02:00.039> this

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
from the bed they're caught in this

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.190 
from the bed they're caught in this
entering<00:02:00.609> so<00:02:00.819> it<00:02:00.969> also<00:02:01.149> helps<00:02:01.630> us<00:02:01.749> detect

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
entering so it also helps us detect

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.489 
entering so it also helps us detect
where<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.920> bedbugs<00:02:03.340> are<00:02:03.490> coming<00:02:03.819> from<00:02:03.999> if<00:02:04.499> you

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
where the bedbugs are coming from if you

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.499 
where the bedbugs are coming from if you
don't<00:02:05.770> have<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.009> light<00:02:06.279> infestation<00:02:07.090> if<00:02:07.299> you've
