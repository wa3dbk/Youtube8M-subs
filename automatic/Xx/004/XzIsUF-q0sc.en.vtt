 who speaks to you today is I want to do this 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.660
 video tutorial on how to register a 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 seems babette log many of you now me 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 they're saying what the fuck you need after that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.230
 battisti has been out for more than a year and is 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.330
 because there has been there are people who 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.750
 maybe they don't know how to do it yet they don't have 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.260
 did not and never knew how to do it 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.260
 so maybe 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.860
 to help these people then it is me 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.400
 was also requested by my friend 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.840
 so I want better I want to do 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.070
 also for this 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.300
 indeed, I apologize for having 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.040
 forgotten for it was right to 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.400
 then remember the first step e 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.800
 write origin on the search engine 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.470
 which is practically the store site 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.150
 of electronic cars which is important from 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.590
 all that pc player have the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.170
 profile origins because they make us 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.340
 practically to be able to then buy ad 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.650
 example because you add up 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.510
 battlefield and know how to click then 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.330
 practically high now on the directors 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.950
 of and insert our email address 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.570
 it is important to insert in this point 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.650
 the e- mail address associated with 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.450
 playstation network 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.950
 then the same email address because 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.170
 you put us in charge of making the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.070
 recording on psn on playstation 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.600
 network 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.180
 I invented a house here 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.530
 in fact I wrote battlefield 3 test a 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.950
 snail hotmail.it 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.680
 but so here therefore practically 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.649
 we will put the public identity with which 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:35.229
 then all 5 c ie conclude with 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:37.060
 the studies on origin therefore remitted if not 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.930
 I remember why it says it's too long me 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.030
 know why I took evidence goes well here 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.890
 can my little mistakes and others 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.170
 I'll do with the fucking security code 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.940
 to see if you fuck to see if 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.159
 we are a computer that if you register 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.740
 automatically a faq 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.640
 I called it youtube test will be the name 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.619
 with which appear mo in the playstation 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.869
 network that we would understand with 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.180
 scooters we will disappear sorry subet blog 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.070
 so youtube test will be the name with 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.739

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.570

 that is, the nasa code is not like this 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.959
 well organized and we continue therefore 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.760
 with putting born birth dates e 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.860
 important to put it is important 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.269
 if you want it, it doesn't seem to me that 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.799

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.540

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.090
 origin for which once this is done 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.840

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.620

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.160
 search engines down here for one 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.980
 question of practicality 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.610
 I have already written written in fact if me 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.260
 I decide 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.790
 because here the audio recorded after that 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.340
 I was recording without having entered 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.980
 the microphone for which you see best level 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.830
 I arrived at was traveling a 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.380
 attack which took over just write the 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.210

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.710
 battlefield 3 snail test 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.910
 hotmail.it 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.130
 the password you put on origin 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.160
 always small case 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.990
 iban code all coordinate code 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.130
 Banking away saying time did this

 to your beautiful pistol m 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:39.790
 1911 if I am not mistaken and for which it is 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.790
 important 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.530
 as you can see it is very easy to do these 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.270
 these proceedings really very much 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.780
 simple 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:53.770
 it takes just three minutes I don't 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.770
 folded 7 just to explain things 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.870
 then ok, here click here if you have put 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.550
 at the same time a soldier does not appear 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.040
 because I created one but one passes 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.470
 milano which has by chance so now though if 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.180
 you have 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.130
 put as a password what 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.370
 used on playstation network 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.960
 in fact , come and see you 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.200
 a little your soldier I don't remember now 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.730
 well if then it is necessary when insert 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.410
 in the game to play to beat faith vi 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.760
 will say that you have registered then 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.680
 you must accept the contract 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.600
 even the only one makes it a very thing 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.580
 simple enough to do what the says 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.650
 I don't remember playstation though 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.180
 specifically if it had something happens 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.800
 I generally care so if you have 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.290
 registered the apples you use on 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.510
 playstation network and youtube test of 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.580
 your name will actually appear 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.490
 soldier with your rank with yours 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.680
 level and so on 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.380
 m 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.440
 something wonderful to communicate e 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.560
 get to know other people and for and then 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.940
 of course it is also nice to make oneself 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.380
 cocks a little the cocks of the young gods 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.509
 others make sense to me 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.810
 the statistics see how you can see 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:03.300
 to the taxi driver via flame bf3 ceschi tumini 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.949
 f3c years backlog reason so that 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.840
 in metal good because we can also 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.449
 better or communicating with me from the bona 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.889
 so we can also use them 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.889
 you can make everyone's cocks for example 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.479
 here I got my cocks 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:17.910
 everyone should get my cocks i 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:22.520
 his dicks and therefore mine 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:24.930
 statistics is the name of the clan to which 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.889

 I still like it more viewed 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.820

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.620
 the people who really do 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.570
