scarred<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.650> when<00:01:16.770> I

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
scarred and then from that we do when I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
scarred and then from that we do when I
saw<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> bit<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> passing<00:01:17.670> mcgurthey<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.119> girl

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
saw a bit of passing mcgurthey one girl

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.880 
saw a bit of passing mcgurthey one girl
surely<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.170> lucky<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.560> turn

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
surely it was a bit lucky with that turn

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.170 
surely it was a bit lucky with that turn
to<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.159> honest<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> defender<00:01:21.030> should

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
to be honest because the defender should

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
to be honest because the defender should
be<00:01:21.299> doing<00:01:21.540> better<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.799> tips<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> keeper

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
be doing better but it tips the keeper

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
be doing better but it tips the keeper
and<00:01:23.790> guess<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.689> nil<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> they're<00:01:25.650> from

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and guess it to to nil and they're from

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
and guess it to to nil and they're from
that<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.580> work<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.850> through<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.119> Podolski

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that we work it through to Podolski

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.780 
that we work it through to Podolski
throw<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.439> girl<00:01:28.710> keeper<00:01:29.130> comes<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.610> God

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.149 
I was quite funny about to watch that at
the<00:01:37.530> time<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.100> just

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the time because it would just

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.039 
the time because it would just
ridiculous<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.119> went<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
ridiculous I like go went in but that

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
ridiculous I like go went in but that

pretty<00:01:55.290> nicely<00:01:55.530> into<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> top<00:01:56.130> corner<00:01:56.159> in

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
pretty nicely into the top corner in

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.219 
pretty nicely into the top corner in
fact<00:01:56.880> well<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.299> wasn't<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> best<00:01:57.719> pinner<00:01:57.960> but

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
fact well it wasn't the best pinner but

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.870 
fact well it wasn't the best pinner but
it<00:01:58.320> went<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> list<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.280> then<00:01:59.759> we're

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it went in on the list and then we're

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.639 
it went in on the list and then we're
swinging<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.329> corner<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.469> at<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
swinging a corner this is just at the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.289 
swinging a corner this is just at the
end<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> first<00:02:02.100> half<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.000> clear<00:02:03.270> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
end of the first half you just clear it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.420 
end of the first half you just clear it
and<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> smash<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.200> into<00:02:04.320> make<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.740> six<00:02:05.100> nil

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
and then I smash it into make it six nil

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.940 
and then I smash it into make it six nil
so<00:02:05.869> absolutely<00:02:06.869> smashed<00:02:07.320> him<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.740> half

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so absolutely smashed him in that half

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.900 
so absolutely smashed him in that half
but<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.459> make<00:02:08.610> sure<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.789> get<00:02:08.849> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
but you just make sure you get a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.330 
but you just make sure you get a
consolation<00:02:09.450> goal<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.989> Fernanda<00:02:10.560> Nia<00:02:10.739> but

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
we're going to get a few more

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.680 
we're going to get a few more
us<00:02:12.760> because<00:02:12.970> we<00:02:13.120> don't<00:02:13.300> really<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.569> to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
us because we don't really like to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.080 
us because we don't really like to
concede<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.520> probably<00:02:15.520> give<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> bit<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:15.970> a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
concede and probably give a bit of a

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.280 
concede and probably give a bit of a
taste<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.360> his<00:02:16.450> own<00:02:16.569> medicine<00:02:16.629> with<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.140> girl

stripped back their from Podolski and

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.790 
stripped back their from Podolski and
then<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.420> made<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.660> seven<00:02:20.080> for<00:02:20.319> some<00:02:20.470> reason

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
then that made it seven for some reason

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.410 
then that made it seven for some reason
he<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:20.920> passes<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.519> straight<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.940> me<00:02:22.090> and
