00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.920 

now<00:00:27.520> let's<00:00:27.730> see<00:00:27.850> if<00:00:27.910> we<00:00:28.029> can<00:00:28.150> get<00:00:28.270> across

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
there on the right there were two fires

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.780 
there on the right there were two fires
that<00:00:41.570> severely<00:00:42.050> destroyed<00:00:42.590> that<00:00:42.830> section<00:00:43.370> one

that severely destroyed that section one

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.100 
that severely destroyed that section one
in<00:00:44.000> 88<00:00:44.330> and<00:00:44.600> 89<00:00:44.720> and<00:00:45.350> one<00:00:46.100> sometime<00:00:46.670> in<00:00:47.080> 90<00:00:48.080> and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.710 

but<00:01:28.820> this<00:01:29.090> was<00:01:29.360> indeed<00:01:31.960> probably<00:01:34.570> okay<00:01:35.570> just

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
but this was indeed probably okay just

over there this is what's here now let's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.280 
over there this is what's here now let's
take<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.580> look

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
might be a Meredith look at the cab it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
might be a Meredith look at the cab it's

it takes a lot of well here we are let's

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.559 
it takes a lot of well here we are let's
go<00:03:12.470> back<00:03:12.710> to<00:03:12.920> ground

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.869

I<00:04:11.060> don't<00:04:11.750> know<00:04:11.840> how<00:04:11.960> well<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.340> vibrating

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
I don't know how well that vibrating

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.460 
I don't know how well that vibrating
sound<00:04:13.640> is<00:04:13.850> translating<00:04:14.630> for<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.900> microphone

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
sound is translating for the microphone

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.250 
sound is translating for the microphone
but<00:04:15.910> it's<00:04:16.910> nowhere<00:04:17.180> near<00:04:17.329> as<00:04:17.540> bad<00:04:17.900> as<00:04:18.079> it

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
but it's nowhere near as bad as it

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.120 
but it's nowhere near as bad as it
sounds<00:04:20.109> now<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.170> have<00:04:21.380> another<00:04:21.590> smoother

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
sounds now you have another smoother

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:34.500 
sounds now you have another smoother
part<00:04:30.010> this<00:04:31.010> kind<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.460> harsh<00:04:31.760> on<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.060> slow<00:04:32.330> down

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
part this kind of harsh on the slow down

00:04:34.510 --> 00:05:06.570 
part this kind of harsh on the slow down
hey<00:04:37.810> time<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.960> end<00:04:39.050> it

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.740 

and<00:05:07.180> finally

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.540 

wonder<00:05:13.750> where<00:05:13.930> though<00:05:14.110> well<00:05:14.680> motor<00:05:15.370> room<00:05:15.670> is

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
wonder where though well motor room is

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:33.250 
wonder where though well motor room is
and<00:05:18.259> open

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.280 

and<00:05:34.260> there<00:05:34.440> it<00:05:34.560> goes<00:05:38.420> my<00:05:39.420> ground<00:05:39.690> light<00:05:39.930> buzzer

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
and there it goes my ground light buzzer

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.970 
and there it goes my ground light buzzer
work<00:05:40.530> it's<00:05:40.830> just<00:05:41.070> very<00:05:41.520> hard<00:05:41.760> to<00:05:42.180> see<00:05:42.450> just
