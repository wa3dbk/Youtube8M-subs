maintenance really easy to repair so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.290 
maintenance really easy to repair so
it's<00:00:51.350> going<00:00:51.470> to<00:00:51.530> last<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:51.950> long<00:00:52.220> time<00:00:52.489> and

it's going to last you a long time and
has<00:00:53.540> gripped<00:00:53.810> technology<00:00:54.590> what<00:00:55.220> this<00:00:55.340> is<00:00:55.460> it

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
has gripped technology what this is it

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.700 
has gripped technology what this is it
has<00:00:55.820> added<00:00:56.239> contact<00:00:56.989> points<00:00:57.320> under<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
has added contact points under the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.830 
has added contact points under the
bindings<00:00:58.340> just<00:00:58.579> this<00:00:58.880> just<00:00:59.149> increases<00:00:59.750> the

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
bindings just this just increases the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.290 
bindings just this just increases the
edge<00:00:59.989> hold<00:01:00.320> on<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.220> board<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:01.670> as<00:01:02.030> it's<00:01:02.210> a

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
edge hold on the board and as it's a

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.210 
edge hold on the board and as it's a
rocker<00:01:02.480> board<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:03.410> not<00:01:03.500> going<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.829> wash<00:01:03.980> out

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
rocker board it's not going to wash out

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.040 
rocker board it's not going to wash out
when<00:01:04.970> you're<00:01:05.120> like<00:01:05.239> going<00:01:05.479> into<00:01:05.600> them<00:01:05.780> really

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
when you're like going into them really

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.320 
when you're like going into them really
they're<00:01:06.200> nice<00:01:06.409> turns<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:07.460> has<00:01:07.670> rhythm<00:01:08.000> walls

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
they're nice turns it has rhythm walls

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.649 
they're nice turns it has rhythm walls
so<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.229> is<00:01:09.350> abs<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:09.979> urethane<00:01:10.310> sidewalls<00:01:10.659> on

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
so this is abs and urethane sidewalls on

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.210 
so this is abs and urethane sidewalls on
the<00:01:11.780> board<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:12.560> has<00:01:12.710> made<00:01:12.890> some<00:01:13.010> really

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
the board this has made some really

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.000 
the board this has made some really
durable<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:13.970> this<00:01:14.240> helps<00:01:14.540> dampen<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.650> the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
durable and this helps dampen the the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.080 
durable and this helps dampen the the
ride<00:01:16.190> if<00:01:16.340> you're<00:01:16.430> hitting<00:01:16.610> any<00:01:16.729> cruddy<00:01:17.000> stuff

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
ride if you're hitting any cruddy stuff

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.170 
ride if you're hitting any cruddy stuff
on<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.450> snow<00:01:17.770> butter<00:01:18.770> Glasson<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:19.549> what<00:01:20.060> this

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
on the snow butter Glasson so what this

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.149 
on the snow butter Glasson so what this
is<00:01:20.360> is<00:01:20.630> by<00:01:20.870> laminates<00:01:21.409> in<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.650> board<00:01:21.830> this

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
is is by laminates in the board this

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.920 
is is by laminates in the board this
just<00:01:22.400> makes<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.700> board<00:01:22.940> really<00:01:23.479> really<00:01:23.780> fun

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
just makes the board really really fun

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.620 
just makes the board really really fun
to<00:01:24.080> ride<00:01:24.260> really<00:01:24.710> forgiving<00:01:25.190> forgiving<00:01:25.909> if

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
to ride really forgiving forgiving if

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.030 
to ride really forgiving forgiving if
you<00:01:26.780> lots<00:01:27.049> just<00:01:27.290> starting<00:01:27.590> out<00:01:27.680> this<00:01:27.799> could<00:01:27.950> be

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
you lots just starting out this could be

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.620 
you lots just starting out this could be
a<00:01:28.070> really<00:01:28.370> really<00:01:28.580> good<00:01:28.729> board<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.150> learn<00:01:29.270> and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
a really really good board to learn and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.039 
a really really good board to learn and
learn<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.900> ride<00:01:30.080> on<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.400> I'd<00:01:31.520> say<00:01:31.760> this

if you're a more an advanced rider I'll
go<00:01:44.930> for<00:01:45.080> something<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.380> bit<00:01:45.409> more<00:01:45.740> stiffer<00:01:46.100> and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
go for something a bit more stiffer and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.570 
go for something a bit more stiffer and
faster<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:48.380> it's<00:01:48.650> not<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.100> good<00:01:49.130> for<00:01:49.310> just

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
faster and it's not so good for just

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.490 
faster and it's not so good for just
pure<00:01:50.119> gybing<00:01:50.510> stuff<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.020> if<00:01:51.140> you're<00:01:51.290> into

pure gybing stuff but if you're into
