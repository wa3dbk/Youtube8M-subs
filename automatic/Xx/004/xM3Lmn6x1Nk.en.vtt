00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.020 
difficult to get it to hang it doesn't
fight<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:51.980> doesn't<00:00:52.250> have<00:00:52.400> a<00:00:52.430> whole<00:00:52.670> lot<00:00:52.700> of

fight you it doesn't have a whole lot of

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.710 
fight you it doesn't have a whole lot of
weight<00:00:53.210> it's<00:00:54.200> not<00:00:54.380> very<00:00:54.620> stiff<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:56.540> can

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
weight it's not very stiff so it you can

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.440 
weight it's not very stiff so it you can
get<00:00:56.870> all<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.250> blisters<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.280> buckles<00:00:59.150> out<00:00:59.300> of

Dale's<00:01:01.910> about<00:01:02.120> ready<00:01:02.390> for<00:01:02.480> this<00:01:03.489> there<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:04.520> go

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
Dale's about ready for this there you go

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.270 
Dale's about ready for this there you go
so<00:01:06.350> now<00:01:06.500> we're<00:01:06.650> going<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.830> treat<00:01:07.040> that

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
so now we're going to treat that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.540 
so now we're going to treat that
vertical<00:01:07.880> quarter<00:01:09.100> with<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.310> kerdi-band

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
vertical quarter with the kerdi-band

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.420 
vertical quarter with the kerdi-band
instead<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.470> tying<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.710> together<00:01:12.890> with<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
instead of tying it together with the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.460 
instead of tying it together with the
actual<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.420> process<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:14.900> seamless

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
actual so the process is seamless

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.080 
actual so the process is seamless
there's<00:01:15.740> no<00:01:15.890> wait<00:01:16.160> time<00:01:16.430> there's<00:01:16.670> no<00:01:16.820> cure

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
there's no wait time there's no cure

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.930 
there's no wait time there's no cure
time<00:01:17.330> on<00:01:17.990> any<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.590> aspects<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:19.369> if

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.760 
time on any of the aspects of this if
you<00:01:20.090> use<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.270> traditional<00:01:20.570> order<00:01:21.110> bed<00:01:21.410> which

you use a traditional order bed which

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.850 
you use a traditional order bed which
you<00:01:21.920> can<00:01:22.160> do<00:01:22.490> with<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.330> Coeur<00:01:23.479> D<00:01:23.600> drain<00:01:23.860> you

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
you can do with the Coeur D drain you

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.080 
you can do with the Coeur D drain you
can<00:01:24.890> use<00:01:25.130> traditional<00:01:25.280> mortar<00:01:25.820> bad

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
can use traditional mortar bad

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.390 
can use traditional mortar bad
assemblies<00:01:26.660> then<00:01:27.259> simply<00:01:27.740> put<00:01:27.920> kerning<00:01:28.250> over

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
assemblies then simply put kerning over

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.640 
assemblies then simply put kerning over
the<00:01:28.490> top<00:01:28.700> or<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.119> can<00:01:29.270> use<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.600> foam<00:01:29.840> if<00:01:30.440> you

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
the top or you can use the foam if you

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.930 
the top or you can use the foam if you
do<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.950> mortar<00:01:31.190> bed<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.520> course<00:01:31.700> you're<00:01:31.850> going

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
do the mortar bed of course you're going

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.430 
do the mortar bed of course you're going
to<00:01:32.000> have<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.270> pack<00:01:32.479> that<00:01:32.720> one<00:01:32.930> day<00:01:33.140> wait

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
to have to pack that one day wait

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.260 
to have to pack that one day wait
overnight<00:01:33.770> come<00:01:34.520> back<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> next<00:01:34.880> day<00:01:35.180> to

actually<00:01:35.540> quickly<00:01:36.050> put<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.890> parry<00:01:37.160> on<00:01:37.369> and

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
actually quickly put the parry on and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.030 
actually quickly put the parry on and
put<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.700> rest<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.149> Coeur<00:01:38.300> D<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.540> I<00:01:39.040> bet

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
put the rest of the Coeur D on I bet

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.969 
put the rest of the Coeur D on I bet
most<00:01:40.250> people<00:01:40.610> think<00:01:40.820> about<00:01:40.940> their<00:01:41.450> shower

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
most people think about their shower

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.530 
most people think about their shower
much<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.190> same<00:01:43.369> way<00:01:43.520> they<00:01:43.670> think<00:01:43.880> about<00:01:43.970> their

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
much the same way they think about their

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.260 
much the same way they think about their
health<00:01:44.800> in<00:01:45.800> other<00:01:45.920> words<00:01:46.100> until<00:01:46.880> something

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
health in other words until something

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.330 
health in other words until something
goes<00:01:47.390> wrong<00:01:47.720> they<00:01:48.470> don't<00:01:48.649> think<00:01:48.770> about<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.100> too

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
goes wrong they don't think about it too

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.120 
goes wrong they don't think about it too
much<00:01:49.369> at<00:01:49.640> all<00:01:50.080> well<00:01:51.080> if<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:51.649> think<00:01:51.830> about<00:01:51.890> your

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
much at all well if you think about your

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.460 
much at all well if you think about your
shower<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.179> way<00:01:53.300> it's<00:01:53.479> subjected<00:01:54.140> to

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
shower and the way it's subjected to

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.389 
shower and the way it's subjected to
moisture<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.479> drying<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.929> they<00:01:57.679> use<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.220> lot

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
moisture and drying and they use a lot

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.859 
moisture and drying and they use a lot
of<00:01:58.520> times<00:01:58.789> we<00:01:59.000> don't<00:01:59.090> give<00:01:59.300> too<00:01:59.420> much<00:01:59.569> thought

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
of times we don't give too much thought

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.260 
of times we don't give too much thought
about<00:02:00.319> the<00:02:00.530> probability<00:02:01.369> or<00:02:01.520> prospect<00:02:02.090> for

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
about the probability or prospect for

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.210 
about the probability or prospect for
leakage<00:02:02.750> well<00:02:03.319> it's<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.530> good<00:02:03.619> thing<00:02:03.679> sluder

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
leakage well it's a good thing sluder

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.070 
leakage well it's a good thing sluder
