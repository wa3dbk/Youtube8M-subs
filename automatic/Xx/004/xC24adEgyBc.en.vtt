00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 Hello everyone, let's talk about this 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.089
 fancy stuff like responsive design 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.099
 probably heard many of these concepts even 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.710
 those who do not have sites and who are not engaged 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.670
 development that is people far from power 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.750
 why this fashionable just people 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.270
 potential customers who are not 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.039
 are experts in the field ie 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.109
 ordinary people who turn in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.990
 companies or private developers and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.500
 have quite normal and and fair 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.880
 desire to get a quality product 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.769
 quality result of work up to which 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 they do not pay before someone 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.860
 try to find out as a rule 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 in the Internet 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.750
 What is a template or quality 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.969
 the site of what constitutes quality 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 the desire is formed again absolutely 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.030
 adequately and any normal person so 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.870
 and come to before handling 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.000
 somewhere 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.680
 not to be a complete layman because if 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.390
 you're contacting the developer alone 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.129
 not fix and recommendations but just by 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 ad there is a possibility that you 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.730
 get poor quality work yes what 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.920
 there to talk about some private 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 freelancers if there are offices 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.489
 physical address where they sit 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.670
 uncles and aunties with glasses and smart 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.200
 kind of fooling naive people and their people 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.700
 think of all follows well here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.080
 once again come to trust the professionals 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.580
 they know their stuff therefore 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.530
 worry about nothing 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.659
 This is especially true of small towns 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.409
 where this so-called studio can be 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.880
 generally 1 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.650
 but it really is a terrible thing 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 Of course a couple sitting there such mediocrity 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 nothingness just want to face 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.740
 spit it full of charlatans especially 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.350
 when they see that a person is solvent 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.909
 and this question is full 0 your then 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.439
 in general, of course, first of all 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.869
 man himself is guilty because 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.150
 appeals to such people first of all he 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.490
 himself big cities such offices of course 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.500
 smaller but not there too but the reason 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.079
 why I think there are fewer of them 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.189
 that mediocrity alone is not 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.140
 competitive so here's something i 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.060
 distracted from the topic a person goes to the Internet 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 and reads how good it should be 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.200
 template or site and here's after hiking 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.360
 Internet man in the head settles that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700
 quality website should be adaptive 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.380
 at the same time when you ask him what is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.119
 Responsive site is usually a person 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.710
 difficult to answer well and 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.750
 Respectively need further judgment 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.890
 looks like responsive design or doesn't need it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.390
 unable 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.060
 let's briefly analyze what 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.759
 responsive website and when use 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.040
 responsive design optimal 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.840
 when not very responsive website or 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 adaptive template or 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.739
 responsive design is when one and that 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.560
 the site is correctly displayed on 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.180
 various devices like on monitors 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.120
 different resolutions and on mobile 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.769
 devices tablets and smartphones that 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.480
 same night correct but correct it 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.519
 when everything is displayed as needed 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.349
 nowhere nothing swims moving down and so 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.060
 further and when using adaptive 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.069
 design man came for example with 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.269
 the smartphone should not have difficulty 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.859
 in the use of the site 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.269
 he should not do any extra 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.940
 movements increase or decrease 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.980
 page scale engine somehow and so 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.170
 Further, that is all here these moments on 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.730
 which person spends time and nerves and 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.379
 which actually do 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.879
 use of the site is inconvenient at 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.920
 small screen devices 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.540
 they must be completely absent well 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.430
 let's look at how it should look 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.920
 adaptive template on the example of the site 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.639
 channel here is the site and then everything seems to be without 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.530
 comments 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:23.310
 So I reduce the window and see what 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:24.569
 There is a working menu this is so that 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:35.840
 century went to the site with a mobile 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:38.300
 I will not have any devices 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.610
 in obtaining the site information and at 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:51.349
 using the site itself the person is not 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:51.970
 get everything quite comfortable if the person 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:04:01.990
 will go in the plan 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:03.220
 This he will receive about the next well from 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:09.550
 normal normal 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:17.049
 he will soon get a full site and that's what 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:18.820
 this is not a responsive design but that is 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.980
 page content does not adjust 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.770
 to the window size in the browser 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.260
 now let's talk about when 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.850
 responsive dinner design and when not very 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.830
 here it is actually more than 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.930
 obviously depends on a number of reasons i 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.150
 bring the key you have to ask yourself 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.580
 question if you have a mobile version of the site 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.680
 mobile version is when a visitor with 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.290
 mobile device does not fall on 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.390
 big site she optimized it 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.920
 for mobile version and second 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.020
 The question you must answer is 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.370
 what percentage of visitors come to your 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.140
 mobile site 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.000
 information can be obtained using 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.770
 different metrics for the right solution 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.480
 you just need to directly answer two 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.090
 these questions and further logically 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.110
 reason well, for example, if the percentage 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.310
 visitors from mobile devices 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.580
 is up 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.870
 Well, let it be 0.35 percent of what 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.300
 the option will then be optimal 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.400
 mobile version or responsive design 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.290
 but the answer here is obvious the bulk 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.090
 this is a visitor from computers at that time 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.250
 as a tiny percentage of users 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.910
 Mobile devices also will not be 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.040
 deprived 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.020
 and with a normal level of comfort can 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.030
 continue to use the site that is 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.740
 adaptive design option 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.479
 although with such a tiny percentage 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.370
 Visitors from mobile devices can 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.410
 give up on both and just 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.360
 use the regular version of the site without 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.979
 responsive design and now 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.690
 consider completely the opposite 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.270
 the situation will not go far and 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.640
 take everything too in contact I think neither 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.950
 for whom it is no secret that u to k huge 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.169
 percentage of mobile users and yes who 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.630
 then you can say that in in to to rule 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.729
 mobile applications for smartphones but 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.280
 actually share of users 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.200
 mobile version is also very big well 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.180
 given these numbers it will be right 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.500
 make a responsive design and or make 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.110
 optimized for mobile 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.520
 device version of the site answer again 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.100
 obvious that is everything here is enough 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.590
 just lying on the surface and what 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.030
 concerns mobile versions of sites 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.340
 applications for the site in the future also 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.390
 let's talk about them more substantively but on 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.390
 today all bye
