 hello girls how are i am sarah and today 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.830
 I'm going to teach you how to make a new 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.809
 makeup technique known as 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.940
 strobe say that streaming 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.770
 displaced the touring that is this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 technique that we saw super strong the year 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 past of kim kardashian where the face 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.220
 we did like all the contours with 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.019
 two different tones one darker and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 one clearer now everything teach how 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.310
 the provinces are made super easy all 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 there is streaming is to give the maximum 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.320
 potential of light to your face unlike 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.450
 of the contour what we are going to need 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.100
 they are only illuminators forget about 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.379
 bronze forget about darker shades 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.329
 let's give light to the whole face is 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:55.020
 good easy first important point 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:57.420
 up to the cheeks second point 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.219
 important this part of the forehead but 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.629
 be careful when you put it if you have 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.309
 the oily skin I do not recommend it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.010
 because it's going to look more greasy 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.010
 still then avoid this technique 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:33.750
 the following are below the cheekbone the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:44.700
 chin in the arch of the eyebrow the tip 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:53.820
 of the nose this part of above in the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:55.170
 eyebrow and inside the eyes and with 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.850
 a brush of these we are going to blur 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.479
 any trace of dust that remains 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.479
 extra 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.439
 I'm going to put a little bit of blues on the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:17.360
 cheek bone remember to remove the 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:19.459
 excess of all brushes the last 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.410
 step is to seal everything with a fixative and 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.220
 it was all this wonderful balloon 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.220
 chequen see it 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.890
 Well, he did not even say that they saw 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.590
 has nothing complicated is nothing 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.150
 difficult this technique is not for everyone in 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.920
 the truth is that the face shines 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.750
 pretty and if you're not used to 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.849

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.830
