00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.710
 on Wednesday 26 to Sunday 31 March the English manchester the World Cup 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.880
 track cycling place there were also a lot on the wk is expected of course 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.409
 theo bos 9 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:12.970
 it's going very well 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.910
 I have been able to prepare well I have no waiting so no injuries 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.429
 or whatever did not get sick 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.839
 they just managed to stick to the schedule and then it will be nice 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.219
 achenteh you are that he will soon wait and see how it goes 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.099
 manchester and fast lane 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.099
 he buys the format is good 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.900
 it is therefore waiting 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.670
 together with timveldt and teun mulder bos you can be a candidate on the part 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340
 team sprint 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 it is annoying but i get bored but form 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.410
 so I always look at my second round split time 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.050
 I often see that as a qualification for how the sprint works 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.650
 is still there compared to the opponents 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.489
 think france an example that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.760
 really be that we thought that we are very close 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 In addition, you must also be possible, but the training started in the run-up to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.320
 the wk 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.110
 marco very satisfied in copenhagen with the world cup competition for possible must 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.250
 have been around for five weeks already 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 He is the top form to come 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.550
 and I actually made a very heavy disappointment what I actually found 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.270
 it was just tough that I ever 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.250
 well done and that is very well done chimney that we hope the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.420
 developments there still go back that way 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.860
 how did the training feel that the train felt 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.330
 the man is done it is where i look at the treasure that theo netherlands 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.960
 2 and I a little less and and vice versa 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.260
 yes I think now I go very well for what price bullet in the station of 8 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
 and that while ordinary one confidential 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.550
 in addition to the team sprint compasses also look out at the individual sprint 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.719
 I think I'll see if I can choose 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.149
 To win the competitions what is there then just hope it will be more efficient 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.360
 you don't have it in control and the sprintster is good 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.930
 but not but after most important part 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.320
 2 but if I could be champion team sprint again about the report 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.009
 keirin nothing else but satisfied after the break 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.709
 so that's a bit of the approach 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.990
 I'm just going for a world title won 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.889
 I hope it's on the sprinters 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.639
 the report on Wednesday, March 60 in Manchester, the World Cup on the track
