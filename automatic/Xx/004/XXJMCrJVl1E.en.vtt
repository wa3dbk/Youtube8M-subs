00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.690
 so people now comes the final result 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.309
 and we have another windows called 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.839
 our bed is next door if we are 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.289
 we can die right away if 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.640
 They run so fast but they are open 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.800
 very hard but I am at the server me 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:53.190
 exactly on the server this is not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:55.520
 in English we should have heights 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520
 exit 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.420
 no less not fail to stand the stand 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.310
 yes I do not have to set a block 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.530
 right now you 're coming over and blessing 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.360
 do not even get strong on the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.580
 side up so one direction left 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.070
 directions 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 yes have high if I just easy 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:40.690
 Maybe we are excited 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.690
 are 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:56.240
 but my god i go straight on though 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.740
 now especially our pony he is the same 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.849
 next door that is if someone dies from 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.259
 We then have the chance that we 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.630
 make the way 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.940
 But you can also give it that way 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:14.319
 are a close thing or over 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.319
 the one she sees the race away again 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:28.910
 I do not know where my god is 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.910
 Country left away here 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.220
 or I have something to serve 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.220

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:02.690

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.690
 fall off and I go up there ok 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.520
 Do not open the door 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.520

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:38.340
 You can hear them waiting 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.350
 about golden levies which businesses 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.160

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.640

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.640
 obstructed 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.730

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.860

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.780
 As the attacker Christian attacked more 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.780

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.100

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.510
