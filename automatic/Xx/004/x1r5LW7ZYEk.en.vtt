go back here and then you have your
labels<00:00:50.010> also<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> left<00:00:50.670> side

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.880 

it<00:00:57.870> takes<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.230> while<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.530> lose<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.920> torn<00:00:59.310> spot

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890

it takes a while to lose and torn spot
you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.040> see<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.280> nice<00:01:02.520> budget<00:01:02.760> see<00:01:03.090> like

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you can see we have nice budget see like

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780 
you can see we have nice budget see like
reading<00:01:03.690> books<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.790> pick

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
reading books then you can just pick

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.440 
reading books then you can just pick
them<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.980> after<00:01:07.980> it<00:01:08.250> loads<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.670> with

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
them and after it loads you can with

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.850 
them and after it loads you can with
good<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.900> takes<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.229> while<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> low<00:01:16.620> because

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
good so it takes a while to low because

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
good so it takes a while to low because
it<00:01:17.130> probably<00:01:17.250> has<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> lot<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> pages<00:01:17.940> yes<00:01:18.330> 400

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it probably has a lot of pages yes 400

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
it probably has a lot of pages yes 400
pages<00:01:19.080> while<00:01:19.950> their<00:01:20.130> loads<00:01:20.370> I<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.640> show<00:01:20.790> you
