so I played paper toss here and

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.540 
so I played paper toss here and
obviously<00:01:42.730> this<00:01:43.530> screen<00:01:44.530> rotation<00:01:44.980> was<00:01:45.340> not

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
obviously this screen rotation was not

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.050

kind<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:45.970> me<00:01:47.010> but<00:01:48.010> again<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:48.730> is<00:01:48.880> not

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
kind to me but again this is not

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.480 
kind to me but again this is not
anything<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:50.800> won't<00:01:50.950> find<00:01:51.160> on<00:01:51.340> other

gigahertz<00:02:04.780> processor<00:02:06.090> could<00:02:07.090> be<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.270> little

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
gigahertz processor could be a little

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.430 
gigahertz processor could be a little
bit<00:02:07.720> more<00:02:08.020> responsive<00:02:09.929> finally<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.990> tried<00:02:11.080> the
