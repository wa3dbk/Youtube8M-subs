to<00:01:44.580> read<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.480> just<00:01:45.660> put<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.140> bit<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:46.830> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
to read so I just put a little bit and I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:11.390 
to read so I just put a little bit and I
through<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> back<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> bin

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.059 

so<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.430> gave<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.760> go<00:02:13.120> shake<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.930> about<00:02:14.200> 10

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.249 
I was doing it while you can really see
here<00:04:51.789> like<00:04:51.970> my<00:04:52.090> eyes<00:04:52.240> like<00:04:52.539> cheering<00:04:52.990> up<00:04:53.110> when

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
here like my eyes like cheering up when

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:02.900 
here like my eyes like cheering up when
i<00:04:53.319> was<00:04:53.440> doing<00:04:53.560> this

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.880 

so<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:03.940> get<00:05:04.270> this<00:05:04.420> process<00:05:04.990> for<00:05:05.200> about<00:05:05.440> 10

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
so I get this process for about 10

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.800 
so I get this process for about 10
minutes<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.370> put<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:06.850> put<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.420> in<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.540> left

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
minutes I put the put it in the left

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.840 
minutes I put the put it in the left
hand<00:05:07.960> side<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.620> white<00:05:08.770> hat<00:05:08.980> side<00:05:09.250> flight

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
hand side and the white hat side flight

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.970 
hand side and the white hat side flight
distance<00:05:10.030> for<00:05:10.450> about<00:05:10.630> 10<00:05:10.870> minutes<00:05:11.050> until<00:05:11.350> was

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
distance for about 10 minutes until was

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:56.220 
distance for about 10 minutes until was
okay

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.540 

so<00:05:57.230> I<00:05:57.260> didn't<00:05:57.590> decide<00:05:57.860> it<00:05:57.920> just<00:05:58.220> to<00:05:58.310> put<00:05:58.520> a

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
so I didn't decide it just to put a

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.280 
so I didn't decide it just to put a
little<00:05:58.730> bit<00:05:58.880> of<00:05:58.940> hair<00:05:59.180> guy<00:05:59.330> to<00:05:59.390> talk<00:05:59.720> because<00:06:00.170> I

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
little bit of hair guy to talk because I

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.530 
little bit of hair guy to talk because I
want<00:06:00.500> this<00:06:00.680> and<00:06:01.000> call<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.120> us<00:06:02.240> to<00:06:02.330> be<00:06:02.420> like

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
want this and call it us to be like

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.450 
want this and call it us to be like
stayin<00:06:02.990> out<00:06:03.110> for<00:06:03.440> a<00:06:03.800> little<00:06:04.010> bit<00:06:04.130> at<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.370> top

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
stayin out for a little bit at the top

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:20.340 
stayin out for a little bit at the top
so<00:06:04.880> it<00:06:04.940> is<00:06:05.030> fading<00:06:05.390> out<00:06:05.510> from<00:06:06.020> life<00:06:06.350> to<00:06:06.560> god

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.270 

I<00:06:21.600> did<00:06:22.600> this<00:06:22.780> process<00:06:23.410> by<00:06:23.620> about<00:06:23.800> five<00:06:24.040> minutes

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
I did this process by about five minutes

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:38.820 
I did this process by about five minutes
as<00:06:24.520> well<00:06:24.730> so<00:06:25.090> that<00:06:25.840> didn't<00:06:26.170> take<00:06:26.320> that<00:06:26.350> long

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.100 

okay<00:06:39.830> now<00:06:40.040> i'm<00:06:40.160> all<00:06:40.340> done<00:06:40.700> and<00:06:41.480> i<00:06:41.600> left<00:06:41.870> this

after i finish washing it and i also

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.900 
after i finish washing it and i also
condition<00:07:06.860> it<00:07:06.950> as<00:07:07.070> well<00:07:07.250> and<00:07:07.430> this<00:07:07.520> is<00:07:07.640> how<00:07:07.760> it

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
condition it as well and this is how it

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.780 
condition it as well and this is how it
looks<00:07:07.940> and<00:07:08.300> i<00:07:08.360> have<00:07:08.510> to<00:07:08.630> dry<00:07:08.900> my<00:07:08.930> hair<00:07:09.670> and<00:07:10.670> i

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.980 

so<00:07:16.460> this<00:07:16.610> is<00:07:16.730> how<00:07:16.820> the<00:07:16.850> color<00:07:17.210> looks<00:07:17.480> straight

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.540 
so this is how the color looks straight
after<00:07:18.320> the<00:07:18.530> inside<00:07:18.830> i<00:07:19.070> just<00:07:19.220> put<00:07:19.460> a<00:07:19.490> little

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
after the inside i just put a little

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.610 
after the inside i just put a little
better<00:07:19.940> on<00:07:20.030> too<00:07:20.360> much<00:07:20.510> my<00:07:20.720> hair<00:07:20.960> and<00:07:21.140> this<00:07:21.500> is

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.620 
better on too much my hair and this is

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.430 
better on too much my hair and this is
how<00:07:21.800> the<00:07:22.160> color<00:07:22.460> was<00:07:22.700> but<00:07:23.330> i<00:07:23.360> wanted<00:07:23.780> a<00:07:24.110> bit

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
dark but that was my fault because I

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.700 
dark but that was my fault because I
chew<00:07:26.450> the<00:07:26.570> rest<00:07:26.720> of<00:07:26.840> the<00:07:26.900> color<00:07:27.140> in<00:07:27.350> the<00:07:27.530> bin
