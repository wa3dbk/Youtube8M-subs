00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello and welcome file rebate 04 and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.480
 in today's video I bring another video of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.470
 tactics this time we are with tactics 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.330
 of 442 as we see that of 442 a is a 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.830
 more neutral tactic is worth where the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.640
 middle centers are at the same height 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.720
 but if we put the tactic of 442 go 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.369
 we won a fifth defender let's say and a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.230
 third attacker from playmaker worth 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 this tactic we lose balance in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.140
 midfield but we gain solidity 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.310
 defensive and one more man attacking in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.410
 change with the 442 to lose that man 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.630
 attacking and that man defending but 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.660
 we gained more solidity in midfield and 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.960
 balance is worth saying that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.800
 you choose the tactic of 442 that more you 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.460
 like it and let's see what tactics we should 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.239
 use 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.540
 ok let's see the style of game is going to 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.640
 being hard is always worth it because if not 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.380
 will attack with much weakness we have the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.940
 option to move the ball that also goes 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.250
 well we have four midfielders here 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.570
 four defenses and two forwards also 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 we can move the ball perfectly 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.430
 but an option that would be very good and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.750
 interesting would be to open the game for the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.210
 bands because we have here two 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.700
 interiors that can reach us and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.920
 center any ball or play by 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.080
 the bands that we would not have with another 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.850
 tactics like that of 433 that we play with 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.390
 three midfielders are we playing with 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 men in the bands then 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.080
 another would also be quick kick 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.640
 which is what I was using in the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.490
 global subscribers and I was 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.530
 quite well with the 4-4-2 was a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.250
 tactics or a style of game that I was 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.710
 fairly good 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.030
 then the forwards we would have it only 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.369
 attack the midfielders in neutral and 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.100
 the defenses I like to have them 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.880
 holding back we can also if 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.920
 we are brave to put them here supporting 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.960
 to the midfield that would also be a 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.350
 option or even advancing the defense 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.790
 by the sides and the central back is worth 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.650
 that will be incorporated but having here 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.440
 the interiors I think we could 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.290
 let stand back 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.630
 of advanced tactics I like the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.420
 mark man to man for when 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.010
 we are holding it back but the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.240
 marking in area also goes well because 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.500
 the left center for example protects 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.270
 in the position of the left side 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.250
 It's worth it in case you miss the 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.030
 player here you have the center that you 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.100
 does the coverage having the defense 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.060
 so far the tactics of out of play 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.680
 would be no and if we advance the defense 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.990
 a little bit in these two cases 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 then we would put tactics out of 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.620
 game like that so that the opponents fell 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.310
 but in our case as they are behind 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.260
 nothing the mentality depends on how 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.750
 you want your team to play if you want 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.540
 that is more defensive we would put more 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.230
 neutral if you want it to be a team 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.510
 alante offensive we would put to the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.390
 speed if we open play by the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.400
 bands we could 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.470
 have quick play the ball is worth to 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.810
 that the balls go fast to the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.700
 bands and if we want ketchup have fast 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.990
 we also play fast is worth in our 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.830
 case we are going to put to open game the 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.350
 bands and the pressure is going to be 75% in 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.880
 all in all the practices that 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.310
 let's use vale because it's a pressure 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.940
 perfect the players press a lot 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.230
 but they hold you more without getting tired because 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.440
 if you put it one hundred percent in two 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.300
 parties are busted imos and nothing 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.580
 guys, I hope you liked this one 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.580
 video and see you in the next goodbye
