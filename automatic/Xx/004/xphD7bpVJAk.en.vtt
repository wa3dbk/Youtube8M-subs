doing<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.800> field<00:01:54.099> and<00:01:54.340> we<00:01:54.910> come

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
doing that in this field and we come

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.740 
doing that in this field and we come
across<00:01:55.179> this<00:01:55.630> anthill<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.580> these<00:01:57.580> arms<00:01:58.179> they

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
across this anthill and these arms they

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.249 
across this anthill and these arms they
were<00:01:58.840> rolling<00:01:59.590> these<00:01:59.770> fly<00:02:00.099> lovers<00:02:00.640> like

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
were rolling these fly lovers like

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.960 
were rolling these fly lovers like
collecting<00:02:02.259> them<00:02:02.440> in<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:03.039> rolling<00:02:03.399> them<00:02:03.670> into

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
collecting them in and rolling them into

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.889 
collecting them in and rolling them into
their<00:02:04.090> nest<00:02:04.300> I<00:02:04.450> guess<00:02:04.599> they<00:02:04.690> were<00:02:04.750> going<00:02:04.869> to

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
their nest I guess they were going to

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.029 
their nest I guess they were going to
eat<00:02:05.080> them<00:02:05.259> or<00:02:05.380> something<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.709> was<00:02:05.800> really

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
eat them or something it was really

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.150 
eat them or something it was really
weird<00:02:06.220> but<00:02:06.910> these<00:02:07.209> are<00:02:07.479> ads<00:02:07.860> running<00:02:08.860> all<00:02:09.130> over

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
weird but these are ads running all over

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.000 
weird but these are ads running all over
the<00:02:09.429> place<00:02:09.989> wildly<00:02:10.989> mindlessly<00:02:11.650> just

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
the place wildly mindlessly just

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.220 
the place wildly mindlessly just
scrambling<00:02:12.520> all<00:02:12.760> over<00:02:12.909> and<00:02:13.629> we<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.959> know<00:02:14.079> we'd

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
scrambling all over and we you know we'd

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.020 
scrambling all over and we you know we'd
pick<00:02:14.500> one<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:14.950> watch<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.730> see<00:02:15.790> what<00:02:15.969> it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
pick one and watch it and see what it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.550 
pick one and watch it and see what it
does<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.450> some<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.959> them<00:02:17.110> will<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:17.379> run

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
does and some of them will just run

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.420 
does and some of them will just run
around<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:18.040> sir

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
around in sir

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.490 
around in sir
calls<00:02:18.579> for<00:02:18.790> about<00:02:19.000> two<00:02:19.870> minutes<00:02:20.079> and<00:02:20.409> were

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
calls for about two minutes and were

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.740 
calls for about two minutes and were
like<00:02:20.650> what<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.099> earth<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.790> am<00:02:22.120> trying<00:02:22.569> to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
like what on earth is that am trying to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.039 
like what on earth is that am trying to
do<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:25.150> scrambling<00:02:25.629> around<00:02:25.750> like

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
do and it's scrambling around like

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.440 
do and it's scrambling around like
really<00:02:26.560> all<00:02:26.799> over<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.159> place<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.579> just

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
really all over the place and just

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.509 
really all over the place and just
thinking<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.319> earth<00:02:29.469> is<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:30.159> trying<00:02:30.400> to

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
thinking what on earth is it trying to

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.780 
thinking what on earth is it trying to
achieve<00:02:30.939> through<00:02:31.599> doing<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.079> but<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.760> know

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
achieve through doing that but you know

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.759 
achieve through doing that but you know
obviously<00:02:34.120> they<00:02:34.870> aren't<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.230> intelligent

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
obviously they aren't that intelligent

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.759 
obviously they aren't that intelligent
as<00:02:35.889> far<00:02:36.099> as<00:02:36.189> creatures<00:02:36.430> go<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.560> yes<00:02:38.560> you've

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
as far as creatures go and yes you've

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.589 
as far as creatures go and yes you've
got<00:02:38.889> these<00:02:39.040> ants<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.760> were<00:02:39.969> you<00:02:40.180> know<00:02:40.209> we<00:02:40.420> put

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
got these ants that were you know we put

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.800 
got these ants that were you know we put
a<00:02:40.629> rock<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.290> way<00:02:41.469> and<00:02:42.180> they<00:02:43.180> climb<00:02:43.420> onto<00:02:43.780> a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
a rock in the way and they climb onto a

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.390 
a rock in the way and they climb onto a
rock<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.109> start<00:02:44.439> running<00:02:44.560> around<00:02:44.889> on<00:02:45.040> top<00:02:45.189> of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
rock and start running around on top of

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.580 
rock and start running around on top of
it<00:02:45.549> or<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.659> know<00:02:46.689> golf<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.230> random

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
it or just you know golf and random

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.649 
it or just you know golf and random
roots<00:02:47.829> so<00:02:48.069> yeah<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:48.819> can<00:02:48.969> understand<00:02:49.450> what

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
roots so yeah we can understand what

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:50.729 
roots so yeah we can understand what
they<00:02:49.780> were<00:02:49.810> doing<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.170> seems<00:02:50.409> so<00:02:50.560> pointless

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
they were doing it seems so pointless

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.369 
they were doing it seems so pointless
and<00:02:51.129> then<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:51.849> wondered<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.689> if<00:02:52.870> there's<00:02:53.139> some

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
and then I wondered that if there's some

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.159 
and then I wondered that if there's some
more<00:02:53.919> important<00:02:54.519> purpose<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.329> humans<00:02:56.079> are

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
more important purpose that humans are

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.289 
more important purpose that humans are
supposed<00:02:56.439> to<00:02:56.500> be<00:02:56.620> responsible<00:02:57.220> for<00:02:57.790> rather

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
supposed to be responsible for rather

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.909 
supposed to be responsible for rather
than<00:02:58.419> being<00:02:58.659> kind<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.019> self<00:02:59.290> centered<00:02:59.739> about

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
than being kind of self centered about

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.429 
than being kind of self centered about
everything<00:03:00.430> we're<00:03:00.669> doing<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.319> know

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
everything we're doing and you know

up as a topic of thought and it is a

up as a topic of thought and it is a
little<00:04:03.250> bit<00:04:03.430> weird<00:04:03.729> when<00:04:03.909> you<00:04:04.000> think<00:04:04.030> about<00:04:04.239> it

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
little bit weird when you think about it

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
messes with your head a little bit but

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.330 
messes with your head a little bit but
what<00:04:06.639> if<00:04:06.790> there's<00:04:07.060> some<00:04:07.299> reason<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:08.049> we're

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
what if there's some reason that we're

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.559 
what if there's some reason that we're
around<00:04:09.340> some<00:04:09.879> reason<00:04:10.209> that<00:04:10.299> we're<00:04:10.449> not

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
around some reason that we're not

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.580 
around some reason that we're not

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
we can't expect ourselves to realize

we can't expect ourselves to realize
what<00:04:16.840> our<00:04:17.199> purpose<00:04:17.409> is<00:04:17.919> but<00:04:18.519> surely

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
what our purpose is but surely

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.270 
what our purpose is but surely
self-existence<00:04:19.870> should<00:04:20.139> be<00:04:20.320> one<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:21.099> the

self-existence should be one of the

self-existence should be one of the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
highest priorities there by the way in

highest priorities there by the way in
the<00:04:23.530> gameplay<00:04:23.979> I<00:04:24.190> did<00:04:24.729> shoot<00:04:25.449> and<00:04:25.599> plot<00:04:25.720> my

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
the gameplay I did shoot and plot my

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.390 
the gameplay I did shoot and plot my
throwing<00:04:26.110> knife<00:04:26.229> at<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.380> same<00:04:26.560> time<00:04:26.770> but<00:04:27.310> it

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
throwing knife at the same time but it

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.519 
throwing knife at the same time but it
didn't<00:04:27.610> quite<00:04:27.639> work<00:04:27.820> properly<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:28.779> you<00:04:29.409> have

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:29.529 
didn't quite work properly so you have

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.439 
didn't quite work properly so you have
to<00:04:29.740> bear<00:04:30.099> with<00:04:30.130> me<00:04:30.430> on<00:04:30.520> that<00:04:30.669> one<00:04:30.820> but

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
to bear with me on that one but

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.409 
to bear with me on that one but
within<00:04:31.719> the<00:04:32.110> topic<00:04:32.949> for<00:04:32.979> this<00:04:33.419> commentary

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
within the topic for this commentary

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.779 
within the topic for this commentary
yeah<00:04:34.749> that's<00:04:34.990> just<00:04:35.080> what<00:04:35.379> I<00:04:35.409> wanted<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.949> bring

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
yeah that's just what I wanted to bring

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.299 
yeah that's just what I wanted to bring
up<00:04:37.059> and<00:04:37.270> pond<00:04:37.599> it<00:04:37.809> and<00:04:37.990> think<00:04:38.289> about<00:04:38.409> you<00:04:39.279> know

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:39.309 
up and pond it and think about you know

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:43.230 
up and pond it and think about you know
maybe<00:04:41.129> this<00:04:42.129> isn't<00:04:42.339> all<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.610> coincidence<00:04:42.849> and

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
maybe this isn't all a coincidence and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.029 
maybe this isn't all a coincidence and
that's<00:04:43.419> where<00:04:43.599> kind<00:04:43.809> of<00:04:43.930> religion<00:04:44.469> and<00:04:44.979> all

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
that's where kind of religion and all

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.799 
that's where kind of religion and all
those<00:04:45.219> sorts<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.669> things<00:04:45.729> come<00:04:46.180> in<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.689> know

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:46.809 
those sorts of things come in you know

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.749 
those sorts of things come in you know
where<00:04:47.020> science<00:04:47.409> science<00:04:48.069> can<00:04:48.219> explain<00:04:48.249> so

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
where science science can explain so

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.700 
where science science can explain so
much<00:04:48.969> up<00:04:49.240> until<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:50.169> point<00:04:50.379> that<00:04:50.529> I've

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
much up until the point that I've

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.070 
much up until the point that I've
reached<00:04:50.949> now<00:04:51.249> and<00:04:51.550> when<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.419> go<00:04:52.569> beyond<00:04:52.930> that

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
reached now and when you go beyond that

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.260 
reached now and when you go beyond that
are<00:04:53.439> we<00:04:53.710> expected<00:04:54.339> you<00:04:54.490> know<00:04:54.819> there's<00:04:55.120> some

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
are we expected you know there's some

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.959 
are we expected you know there's some
kind<00:04:55.509> of<00:04:55.569> divine<00:04:55.930> purpose<00:04:56.589> who<00:04:57.129> knows<00:04:57.400> and<00:04:57.699> to

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 
kind of divine purpose who knows and to

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.269 
kind of divine purpose who knows and to
be<00:04:58.059> honest<00:04:58.330> who<00:04:58.779> cares<00:04:59.080> bear<00:04:59.379> there<00:04:59.559> it's<00:05:00.039> just

be honest who cares bear there it's just
something<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.669> found<00:05:00.699> interesting<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.870> think

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
something I found interesting to think

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.529 
something I found interesting to think
about<00:05:02.259> and<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.979> enjoy<00:05:03.789> making<00:05:03.909> other<00:05:04.210> people

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
about and I enjoy making other people

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.350 
about and I enjoy making other people
think<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:05.580> sorry<00:05:06.580> if<00:05:06.729> you've<00:05:06.879> just<00:05:07.089> got<00:05:07.210> back

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
think so sorry if you've just got back

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.969 
think so sorry if you've just got back
from<00:05:07.389> a<00:05:07.599> day<00:05:07.719> of<00:05:07.749> school<00:05:08.199> or<00:05:08.439> work<00:05:08.650> or<00:05:08.830> whatever

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
from a day of school or work or whatever

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.089 
from a day of school or work or whatever
in<00:05:09.249> your<00:05:09.370> head<00:05:09.550> hurting<00:05:10.180> at<00:05:10.509> the<00:05:10.949> concept<00:05:11.949> of

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
in your head hurting at the concept of

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.300 
in your head hurting at the concept of
this<00:05:12.279> but<00:05:12.610> it<00:05:13.509> is<00:05:13.569> just<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.110> thought<00:05:14.710> process<00:05:14.919> i

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
this but it is just a thought process i

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.920 
this but it is just a thought process i
literally<00:05:15.729> thought<00:05:15.879> i<00:05:16.210> would<00:05:16.419> share<00:05:16.689> and

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
literally thought i would share and

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.989 
literally thought i would share and
actually<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.039> bit<00:05:18.189> where<00:05:18.520> I<00:05:18.550> talked<00:05:18.849> about

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:18.999 
actually the bit where I talked about

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.869 
actually the bit where I talked about
this<00:05:19.479> long<00:05:19.900> gameplay<00:05:20.439> might<00:05:21.039> not<00:05:21.219> sync<00:05:21.580> up<00:05:21.699> now

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
this long gameplay might not sync up now
