 adolf in Scotland addiction this is not 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.090
 just a new flag and anthem 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.070

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.139
 scattered numbers and forecasts 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.820
 which seems to lead more

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 The procedure for joining the EU is simply not 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.559

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.329
 just so take and throw out the Scots 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.890
 which are already part of it if 5 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.840
 million citizens will vote for 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 independence of your country then by experience 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 communicating with European diplomats and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.350
 politicians I know that they will accept this 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 choice for another elite club in 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.920
 which is confirmed by supporters 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.670
 Scotlandâ€™s independence will succeed 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 yourself very uncomfortable 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.119

 forecasts until the referendum there are only 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.080
 100 days and now only one thing is clear
