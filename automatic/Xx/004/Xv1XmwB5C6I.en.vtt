00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.770 
Teeter on the brink of being broken they
just<00:01:30.560> push<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.550> limits<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.420> what<00:01:32.660> the

you<00:03:31.890> start<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.190> look<00:03:32.280> at<00:03:32.430> all<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:33.150> writing

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
you start to look at all the writing

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.300 
you start to look at all the writing
that's<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.720> GTA<00:03:34.050> for<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.710> fact<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.130> all

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
that's in GTA for the fact that it all

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.310 
that's in GTA for the fact that it all
has<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.550> be<00:03:36.120> up<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.540> quality<00:03:36.990> standard

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
has to be up to this quality standard

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.710 
has to be up to this quality standard
that<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.650> volume<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.460> so<00:03:38.580> crazy<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.210> it

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
that the volume is just so crazy that it

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.420 
that the volume is just so crazy that it
must<00:03:40.020> be<00:03:40.170> much<00:03:40.380> more<00:03:40.560> difficult<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:41.070> do<00:03:41.220> this

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
must be much more difficult to do this

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.190 
must be much more difficult to do this
than<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.790> do<00:03:41.910> just<00:03:42.150> an<00:03:42.240> episode<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.750> TV<00:03:42.870> show
