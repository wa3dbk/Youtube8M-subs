drive side this mechanism here should be

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.790 
drive side this mechanism here should be
considered<00:04:44.910> effectively<00:04:46.669> non<00:04:47.669> serviceable

to remove would suggest that we just

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.520 
to remove would suggest that we just
