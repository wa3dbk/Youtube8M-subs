don't do it looks like you draw exactly
what<00:03:03.730> we<00:03:03.880> said<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.420> try<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.019> think<00:03:05.230> about<00:03:05.739> too

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
what we said we try and think about too

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.990 
what we said we try and think about too
much<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:07.150> do<00:03:07.660> one<00:03:08.170> line<00:03:08.500> at<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.920> time<00:03:09.040> alright

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
much just do one line at a time alright

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.150 
much just do one line at a time alright
she<00:03:10.209> starred<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.780> top<00:03:10.989> corner<00:03:11.230> there<00:03:11.920> the
