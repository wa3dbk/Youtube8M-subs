this into three pieces like a regular
braid<00:01:52.340> now<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.400> i'm<00:01:53.549> looking<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
braid now if i'm looking in the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.929 
braid now if i'm looking in the
viewfinder<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.869> because<00:01:55.229> i'm<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.189> anywhere

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
viewfinder it's because i'm not anywhere

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.710 
viewfinder it's because i'm not anywhere
near<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.360> me<00:01:57.689> right<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:59.430> yeah<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.030> then

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
near a me right now so yeah and then

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.289 
near a me right now so yeah and then
what<00:02:00.780> you're<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:02.180> instead<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
what you're going to do is instead of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.450 
what you're going to do is instead of
reading<00:02:03.479> over<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> regular<00:02:04.830> braid<00:02:05.189> you're

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
reading over like a regular braid you're

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.609 
reading over like a regular braid you're
going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> braid<00:02:05.880> under<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:07.080> do<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> regular

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
going to braid under so do a regular

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:16.110 
going to braid under so do a regular
braid<00:02:08.069> about<00:02:08.399> two<00:02:08.610> times

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.300 

so<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:17.239> your<00:02:17.420> garden<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:18.049> small<00:02:18.739> little<00:02:18.980> brain

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
so now your garden a small little brain

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.729 
so now your garden a small little brain
just<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.670> few<00:02:19.849> times<00:02:20.110> go<00:02:21.110> ahead<00:02:21.409> and<00:02:21.620> start

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
just a few times go ahead and start

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.770 
just a few times go ahead and start
adding<00:02:21.920> pieces<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.269> difference<00:02:23.540> between

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
adding pieces and the difference between

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.350 
adding pieces and the difference between
this<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.290> French<00:02:24.560> braid<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.360> you're

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
this and a French braid is that you're

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600 
this and a French braid is that you're
adding<00:02:26.750> pieces<00:02:27.019> but<00:02:27.530> you're<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:28.159> under

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
adding pieces but you're going under

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.280 
adding pieces but you're going under
instead<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.330> over<00:02:29.659> so<00:02:29.870> that's<00:02:29.930> pretty

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
instead of going over so that's pretty

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.050 
instead of going over so that's pretty
much<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.470> only<00:02:30.620> difference<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.849> I'm<00:02:31.909> going<00:02:32.030> to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
much the only difference so I'm going to

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.520 
much the only difference so I'm going to
go<00:02:32.150> ahead<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.450> turn<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.959> your<00:02:32.989> ass<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.290> see<00:02:33.470> me

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
go ahead and turn to your ass and see me

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.259 
go ahead and turn to your ass and see me
and<00:02:33.829> you're<00:02:34.040> gonna<00:02:34.099> add<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.400> piece<00:02:34.849> of<00:02:34.909> hair

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269

little<00:06:49.310> bit<00:06:49.400> bigger<00:06:50.200> just<00:06:51.200> because<00:06:51.560> it's<00:06:51.890> just

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
little bit bigger just because it's just

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.350 
little bit bigger just because it's just
we<00:06:52.130> went<00:06:52.310> into<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:52.580> wild<00:06:52.880> she's<00:06:53.060> not<00:06:53.210> gonna

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
we went into the wild she's not gonna

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.030 
we went into the wild she's not gonna
want<00:06:53.450> it<00:06:53.780> too<00:06:53.990> tight<00:06:54.260> I<00:06:54.440> mean<00:06:54.590> she's<00:06:54.710> not<00:06:54.860> gonna

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040

want it too tight I mean she's not gonna
be<00:06:55.240> too<00:06:56.240> precise<00:06:56.540> about<00:06:56.660> Howard<00:06:56.990> braid<00:06:57.200> is

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 
be too precise about Howard braid is

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.300 
be too precise about Howard braid is
because<00:06:57.620> she's<00:06:57.740> me<00:06:57.890> running<00:06:58.130> through<00:06:58.250> the

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
because she's me running through the

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.930 
because she's me running through the
wild<00:06:58.640> trying<00:06:59.630> to<00:07:00.310> save<00:07:01.310> her<00:07:01.490> life<00:07:01.610> basically

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
wild trying to save her life basically

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.360 
wild trying to save her life basically
and<00:07:02.480> stay<00:07:03.140> alive<00:07:03.380> so<00:07:03.830> I<00:07:03.860> don't<00:07:04.130> think<00:07:04.190> she's

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
and stay alive so I don't think she's

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.360 
and stay alive so I don't think she's
didn't<00:07:04.580> care<00:07:04.700> too<00:07:04.820> much<00:07:04.850> but<00:07:05.300> I<00:07:05.980> like<00:07:06.980> it<00:07:07.130> the

messy version of it better I'm gonna go

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.600 
messy version of it better I'm gonna go
ahead<00:07:09.500> just<00:07:09.680> turn<00:07:09.890> around<00:07:09.980> to<00:07:10.220> guess<00:07:10.340> and<00:07:10.520> see

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610
