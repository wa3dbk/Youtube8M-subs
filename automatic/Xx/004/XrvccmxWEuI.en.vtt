Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira and all
that<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.860> think<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.699> argument<00:00:56.850> against<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that I think the argument against it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
that I think the argument against it
though<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.899> he's<00:00:58.260> 36<00:00:58.800> years<00:00:58.859> old<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
though is that he's 36 years old you

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
though is that he's 36 years old you
know<00:00:59.879> he'll<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.239> 37<00:01:00.870> by<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> end<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
know he'll be 37 by the end of the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.080 
know he'll be 37 by the end of the
season<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.879> should

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
season is that really so when we should

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
season is that really so when we should
be<00:01:03.239> investing<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.049> league<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> team<00:01:04.979> well

be investing in as league as a team well

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.740 
be investing in as league as a team well
that's<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.729> counter<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.450> that's<00:01:06.570> my

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that's not counter and that's my

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
that's not counter and that's my
argument<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.310> want

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.700 
better than the next guy playing that
position<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> look<00:01:28.590> at

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
position and if you look at

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
position and if you look at
Philadelphia's<00:01:29.220> roster<00:01:29.670> he<00:01:30.119> comes<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.600> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
Philadelphia's roster he comes in I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
think he's better at whether he's a
left-wing<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.780> attacking<00:01:34.110> midfielder<00:01:34.920> he's

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
left-wing or attacking midfielder he's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.590 
left-wing or attacking midfielder he's
gonna<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.520> better<00:01:35.700> than<00:01:35.820> who<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.390> right
