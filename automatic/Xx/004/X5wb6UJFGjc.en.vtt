 good guys this is the new iphone 6 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:16.009

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.009
 show here in the box 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:27.920
 I bought here in Miami at the mall. 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.920
 16 giga mall adventure 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:38.730
 I approve more than 16 gb the size of 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.100
 memory is with the tax are 694 the 695 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.629
 dollars 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.629
 I'll open the trading here now. 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.539
 choose the color at the front black tile and 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.539
 Grey 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:16.229
 Today the well closed bottom also not 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 taking a knife 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:40.330
 I would have unlocked for use in Brazil 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:45.869
 everything brand new gray very light very light 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:50.069
 and much end of the total in June volume 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.659
 When did you call the muffler? 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.950
 if here I do not know what a button is 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:11.950
 new I do not know 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:19.629
 the chip tray that I do not even know if it has 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:23.940
 three neighbors to inject metal time 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.940
 You 're not a merchant earphone . 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:35.080
 container loaded with a charge of the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.830
 power 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.830
 that's right 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.810
 perhaps some common good instruction 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.810
 thing 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:02.060
 It takes a little bit I do not remember because 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.060
 the last iphone was 1 to 1
