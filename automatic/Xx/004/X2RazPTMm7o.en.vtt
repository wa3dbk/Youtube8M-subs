the for a GT got to the top speed as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.100 
well as the carbon is there so this
fraud<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> entire<00:01:41.369> length<00:01:41.640> gaps<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> same<00:01:42.899> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
fraud is entire length gaps the same so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
fraud is entire length gaps the same so
the<00:01:43.140> top<00:01:43.380> speed<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> same<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.250> well<00:01:44.430> which

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the top speed is the same as well which

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.969 
the top speed is the same as well which
is<00:01:44.610> interesting<00:01:45.030> man<00:01:45.710> interesting<00:01:46.710> love

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
is interesting man interesting love

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.310 
is interesting man interesting love
here's<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> Bingle<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.479> interesting<00:01:49.020> snap

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
here's a Bingle it was interesting snap

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.859 
here's a Bingle it was interesting snap
on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.860> actual<00:01:50.220> lap<00:01:50.460> track<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> track<00:01:51.659> where

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
on the actual lap track on a track where

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109 
on the actual lap track on a track where
you're<00:01:52.470> gonna<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.860> use<00:01:53.070> everything<00:01:53.939> put

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
you're gonna have to use everything put

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.609 
you're gonna have to use everything put
together<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> factors<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> car

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
together all the factors of the car

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.920 
together all the factors of the car
that's<00:01:56.310> where<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.600> huge

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that's where that you see huge

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.399 
that's where that you see huge
difference<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.079> intensity<00:02:01.079> of

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
difference and you see the intensity of

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.170 
difference and you see the intensity of
the<00:02:01.590> acceleration<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> carbon<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.030> there

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the acceleration of the carbon is there

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.840 
the acceleration of the carbon is there
as<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.810> shoots<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.399> sort<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.670> gives

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
as it shoots out and that sort of gives

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.940 
as it shoots out and that sort of gives
the<00:02:05.939> information<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> corner<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the information that on a corner the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.990 
the information that on a corner the
carbon<00:02:08.250> laser<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> shoot<00:02:08.879> out

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
carbon laser is going to shoot out

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
carbon laser is going to shoot out
quicker<00:02:09.239> than<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:10.110> furrow<00:02:10.319> GT<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.039> get

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
quicker than the furrow GT so you get

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.699 
quicker than the furrow GT so you get
some<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.550> idea<00:02:11.910> what<00:02:12.360> these<00:02:12.989> two<00:02:13.230> cars<00:02:13.530> would

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
some one idea what these two cars would

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.000 
some one idea what these two cars would
do

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
do

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.009 
do
on<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.370> track<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.330> which<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.750> will<00:02:15.870> be

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
on the track and which one will be

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.619 
on the track and which one will be
quicker<00:02:16.349> but<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.069> want<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.310> find<00:02:17.489> out<00:02:17.700> how

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
quicker but we want to find out how

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.199 
quicker but we want to find out how
quick<00:02:19.079> is<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.860> from<00:02:20.069> one<00:02:20.280> another<00:02:20.579> that

what<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> hell<00:02:25.409> we<00:02:25.470> are<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.769> quick<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.220> thought

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
what the hell we are so quick I thought

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.369 
what the hell we are so quick I thought
we<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.519> choices<00:02:26.700> talk<00:02:27.120> holy<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.870> mother<00:02:28.079> fish

initial impact for a GT 327 I repeat
this<00:02:36.180> multiple<00:02:36.569> times

although the visual impact looks very
immense<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:39.840> that's<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.109> the<00:02:40.290> bumper<00:02:40.620> for

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
immense but that's just the bumper for

immense but that's just the bumper for
NASA<00:02:41.099> pretty<00:02:41.430> much<00:02:41.549> stayed<00:02:41.790> intact<00:02:42.470> so

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
NASA pretty much stayed intact so
