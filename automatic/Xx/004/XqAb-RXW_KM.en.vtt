 on the day of the wedding the first thing that 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.230
 you must think is that the godmother exercises 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.779
 host of the guests when they go 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.849

 [Music] 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.409
 the godmother besides the bride is the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.629
 only wedding figure that can be 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.789
 allow the luxury of going long in 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.630
 any situation and type of ceremony 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.890
 either in the evening or at night 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.200
 [Music] 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.230
 depending on fashion or seasons 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.550
 the color palette can vary 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.400
 slightly so that this is not a 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.470
 problem I give you some simple guidelines 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.379
 for weddings day uses colors 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.630
 soft or warm for the ceremonies of 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.820
 late you can bet on more colors 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.610
 intense and dramatic like the green 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.230
 emerald burgundy sapphire blue or 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.520
 purple 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.280
 [Music] 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.320
 in the Anglo-Saxon countries the target does not 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.750
 it's only reserved for the bride but 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.469
 also all the bridal courtship dresses 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.049
 this color 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.450
 remember precisely pippa in the 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.700
 wedding of his sister Kate Middleton without 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.710
 However, in Spain we do not have this 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.530
 custom so the white would be 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.780
 totally ruled out another different case 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.729
 is the black one at first this 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.860
 color was related to mourning 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.469
 but nowadays things have 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.909
 changed a lot so we have the weddings of 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.369
 the singer of black eyed peas fergie 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.289
 avril lavigne or more back in time 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.470
 that of marilyn monroe with joe dimaggio 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.179
 who used this color so if 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.099
 you want to wear a dress in color 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.440
 Black always has the good pleasure 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.650
 of the bride 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.530
 [Music] 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.840
 The pamela is used only for 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.970
 day weddings and only it was advised to take her 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.509
 if you are used to wearing some 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.130
 type of hat or hair accessory 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.530
 The blanket is reserved for 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.170
 weddings of greater crest and if the godmother goes 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.170
