going but we're at the ground level

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.780 
going but we're at the ground level
we'll<00:04:03.319> be<00:04:03.439> at<00:04:03.620> eight<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:04.069> ten<00:04:04.250> schools<00:04:04.549> next

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
year competing once it's an emerging

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.159 
year competing once it's an emerging
sport<00:04:06.829> we'll<00:04:07.129> be<00:04:07.250> at<00:04:07.519> 10<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.909> 15<00:04:08.030> very<00:04:08.870> quickly

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169

and<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:10.129> think<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.489> will<00:04:10.639> be<00:04:10.669> one<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
and I think that will be one of the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.420 
and I think that will be one of the
fastest<00:04:12.470> growing<00:04:12.560> emerging<00:04:12.889> sports<00:04:13.280> that

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
fastest growing emerging sports that

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.039 
fastest growing emerging sports that
have<00:04:13.519> come<00:04:13.669> through<00:04:13.699> the<00:04:14.299> n-c-double-a<00:04:14.780> it's

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
have come through the n-c-double-a it's

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.539 
have come through the n-c-double-a it's
hard<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.319> believe<00:04:15.409> how<00:04:15.739> far<00:04:15.949> we've<00:04:16.130> come<00:04:16.159> in

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
hard to believe how far we've come in

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.219 
hard to believe how far we've come in
such<00:04:16.639> a<00:04:16.760> short<00:04:16.849> period<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.329> time<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.900> lot<00:04:18.109> of

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
such a short period of time but a lot of

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.170 
such a short period of time but a lot of
times<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:19.039> kind<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.310> keep<00:04:19.459> us<00:04:19.669> focused

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
times just to kind of keep us focused

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.360 
times just to kind of keep us focused
