00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.710 
know where we're spending too much time
sort<00:02:05.040> of

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
sort of

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.660 
sort of
you<00:02:06.380> know<00:02:06.470> not<00:02:06.620> running<00:02:06.920> fast<00:02:07.070> laps<00:02:07.430> on<00:02:07.610> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
sort of trying to get past and we sort

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.260 
sort of trying to get past and we sort
of<00:02:13.100> need<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.310> be<00:02:13.430> running<00:02:13.700> with<00:02:13.820> with<00:02:14.120> people

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that are quicker than us so we can you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.760 
that are quicker than us so we can you
know<00:02:16.370> really<00:02:16.580> start<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.000> learn<00:02:17.120> from<00:02:17.360> them<00:02:17.540> and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
know really start to learn from them and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.720 
know really start to learn from them and
you<00:02:18.770> know<00:02:18.890> hopefully<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.310> our<00:02:19.430> pace<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.610> little

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
you know hopefully get our pace a little

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.300 
you know hopefully get our pace a little
better<00:02:20.030> stoner<00:02:20.720> will<00:02:20.930> join<00:02:21.170> 30<00:02:21.560> other<00:02:21.800> drivers

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
better stoner will join 30 other drivers

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.900 
better stoner will join 30 other drivers
for<00:02:22.340> practice<00:02:22.940> from<00:02:23.540> Friday
