00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.480
 calculates 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.509
 5 6th 2-1 tango 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.879
 to subtract fractions with different denominators 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.290
 the first thing we will do is reduce reduce the fractions ap common 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.820
 denominator 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.189
 For this we will look for the minimum 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.729
 multiple of the denominators that in this case are six 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.649
 and 8 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.049
 for that we break down into prime factors 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.660
 These so-called lens 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.960
 6 between two 3 between three 1 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 82 4 between two 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.860
 between two 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.570
 therefore the sixes by three 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.340
 ice chÃ¡vez 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.330
 two 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.150
 to the cube 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.540
 the least common multiple are the common factors and not as private 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.100
 to the greatest exponent 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.450
 how do we have them on 2? 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.870
 that the greatest exponent is here 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.240
 and not common we have the 3 therefore 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.650
 minimum common multiple multiple forgiveness 3 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.380
 by two cubed 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.140
 that is 3 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.550
 with eight aliens 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.440
 24 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.520
 so we will write as a common denominator 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 and the nominators are as follows 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.630
 24 peoplethe denominator 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.160
 and what they get out of the year 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.170
 24 between 6 4 by five 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.270
 twenty 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.810
 and the same with the other fraction 24 between 8 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.290
 3 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.670
 2-1 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.670
 - 3 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 be 20 we subtract 3 our 17 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.300
 and we keep the common denominator 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.480
 as you can not simplify the result is 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.619
 17 match 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.349
 for 24
