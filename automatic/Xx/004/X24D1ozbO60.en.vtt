00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.750
 I looked at the sign that says 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.149
 fine jewelry 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.839
 the piglet for the paper in my hand 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.839
 and I went into the store 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.519
 the door closed the ppc bike was a small shop and there was no one behind 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.669
 the counter 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.669
 I screamed the home, someone there. 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.509
 the Lord appeared behind the curtain 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.550
 in the back with jeweler's eyeglasses and asked 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.550
 I can help you, it's your son, yes. 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 I bought turkey - I was in the world and someone told me I should look 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 I have a question, a wagon. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 I thought I had several 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
 I think this is interesting 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.910
 he took out a small glass box 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.910
 carefully placed it on the counter 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.570
 I did not believe what I was seeing. 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.870
 looks like a golf ball but it was a pearl 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.210
 it's perfection 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.410
 perfectly round 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.800
 more impressive than anything I've ever seen 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.920
 should be in the dci museum 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.170
 is beautiful 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.060
 I've never seen anything like it. 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.710
 I did not know that this existed 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.250
 I would like to have it 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.189
 I do not have enough money for something like that. 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580
 I would like you to keep it. 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.950
 more and it will cost everything 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.820
 everything you own 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.330
 view all the carriers you had seen 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 many that I carried with me at that moment 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.219
 but I could not take my eyes off the river 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.650
 credible treasure 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.330
 in front of me 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
 done deal 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.259
 of cyrus 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.450
 I have to have 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.069
 whatever the price I opened my portfolio and said I have these pearls am 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.860

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.689

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:32.659
 the promising one of my retirement has some jewels also stored in the 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.459
 Bank 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.179
 Can I give you the key? 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.380
 thaw 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.380
 the contents of my pockets at the counter 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:42.279
 What is this, an old man asked. 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:47.029
 I have some change for lunch, I'll need it too, whatever I have 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.029
 the man looked at the counter and support or administer agents what is this 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.849
 are my car's findings 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.949
 I'll need them too. 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.619
 my car 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.359
 ok 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.809

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.509

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:11.799
 but it's alright 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.799
 The house is too. 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.199
 worth it 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.839
 I think we can live in the cottage has a cottage 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.159
 Okay, I get it. 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.859
 You can have the cottage too. 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.849
 The question is ChÃ¡vez. 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.789
 that is all 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.459
 now you are my gift 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.119
 friend 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:35.539
 the old points or 1 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.189
 and looked me straight in the eye 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.159
 so slowly 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.159
 held out his hands 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.659
 and said here to be 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:45.569
 coli 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.679
 fixedly for my new treasure 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.339
 and said 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.649
 thank you 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.239
 thank you very much 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.239
 I do not believe in my luck. 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.559
 I got scared 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.299
 I started going out 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.799
 the body said 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.539
 finally the whole country 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:06.529
 already said 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.569
 I gave everything I had 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.149
 you do not understand 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.159
 on here 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.669
 the man stretched out his hands and said 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.349
 we both know 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.129
 the value of the pearl 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.499
 But I want you to have these things too. 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.870
 here is your retirement 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.460
 your savings 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.349
 the key of the house and the car 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.909
 the operators who bought 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.990
 technically minimal 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.990
 But I want you to enjoy them. 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.630
 Can not be serious, I'm dead serious. 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:49.150
 days enjoy these things but remember who owns them air of 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
 Sometimes I would send some people to you. 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.580
 maybe they need to use the car to have transportation or from the house to 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.230
 to shelter 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.790
 with the money to get out of some difficulty 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.790
 You can use these things and enjoy them. 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.560
 but remember that they belong to me and sometimes I want you to 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.279
 share people accounts 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.240
 I do not know what to say 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.330
 replied the boy 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
 How do you say thank you? 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.569
 The old man smiled and said 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.479
 just stay tuned 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.110
 my explosions 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.710
 I will give news
