 like tennis with lace and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.860

 summer the so-called pastel colors 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.929
 these are a classic that give everything 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.890
 type of skin and they will be used throughout 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.500

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.170
 a Caribbean spirit and full to some 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.840

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.519
 a proposal that we saw last year 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.549
 but it was not very popular this year 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.670
 bet again on this proposal and 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.730
 they brought us these sandals with a 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.040
 Delicate touch is good because we are going to 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.959
 be a bit comfortable apart that is not going to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.599
 add a few centimeters of 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.860
 stature the prop tops come back again 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.900
 in fashion 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.730
 since we saw her last season in 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.950
 many girls and they were liked by 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.410
 many bloggers this proposal came from 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.780
 the hand of di that there is no proposal 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.310
 very young that will not let be 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.070
 the fashion to which we are a little more 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.740

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.040
 hot time but the funniest thing about 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.770
 this is that we're going to see the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.490
 transparency almost always in black 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.850
 although black is autumn-winter they do not go 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.550
 to bring this season many pieces with 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.860
 these colors so do not forget to 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.580

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.800
