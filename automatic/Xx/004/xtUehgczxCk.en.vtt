 I am a modeler around I specify 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.860
 model makers and non- modelist what I 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.869
 do me this is the model auxi fixe 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.660
 we work on two axes the first 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.050
 the axes is essentially the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.700
 reproduction in small series and this 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.180
 reproduction the asfl to different 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.570
 scales 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.510
 the second axis is the unique piece in 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.030
 Large scale general on order 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.140
 on the small series the essence of the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.890
 work is going to be a search 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.390
 iconographic 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.010

 unique 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.180
 there we absolutely need the real 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.489
 car available so as to make 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.019
 a series of photos on real

 models that will be followed by a 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.579
 series of diagrams to prepare for the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.409
 listing 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.570
 then there is the code statement that goes 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.220
 serve to establish a very plan 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.600
 accurate and then the plane frictions 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.289
 will be done there we started the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.289
 indications only 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.700
