00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
I've got a little bit of foil around the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.509 
I've got a little bit of foil around the
bottom<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.990> looked<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.860> one<00:00:11.010> day<00:00:11.160> just<00:00:11.429> to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
bottom I looked in it one day just to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.070 
bottom I looked in it one day just to
see<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.820> was<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.660> saw<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> little

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
see what was going on and saw a little

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.600 
see what was going on and saw a little
bit<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> algae<00:00:13.740> starting<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> grow<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.309> there

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
bit of algae starting to grow in there

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.430 
bit of algae starting to grow in there
so<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.210> means<00:00:15.330> light<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:15.900> penetrating

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
so that means light was penetrating

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.900 
so that means light was penetrating
through<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> side<00:00:16.890> walls<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.550> container

and went ahead and sealed it up on the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.370 
and went ahead and sealed it up on the
sides<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.150> should<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.420> okay<00:00:21.779> now<00:00:21.990> just

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

so many different methods that people

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.139 
so many different methods that people
could<00:00:46.140> incorporate<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:47.370> grow<00:00:47.579> food<00:00:47.850> around

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
could incorporate to grow food around

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.549 
could incorporate to grow food around
the<00:00:48.300> house<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.930> way<00:00:49.079> they<00:00:49.140> don't<00:00:49.320> necessarily

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the house the way they don't necessarily

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.830 
the house the way they don't necessarily
have<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.520> soil<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
have to have soil they don't have to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.619 
have to have soil they don't have to
spend<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> lot<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.289> time<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.160> yes<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.180> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
spend a lot of time to it but yes it is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.380 
spend a lot of time to it but yes it is
interesting<00:00:55.170> yes<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.430> very<00:00:56.460> productive

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
interesting yes it is very productive

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.439 
interesting yes it is very productive
but<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.649> opinion<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.640> will<00:00:59.789> never<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.270> able

quality<00:03:02.760> beets<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.299> was<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.019> little<00:03:04.260> bit<00:03:04.380> worried

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
quality beets I was a little bit worried

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.309 
quality beets I was a little bit worried
early<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:05.220> because<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:06.180> had<00:03:06.450> loaded<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.049> ground

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
early on because I had loaded the ground

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.289 
early on because I had loaded the ground
with<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> goat<00:03:07.829> manure<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.880> know<00:03:08.940> we're

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
with the goat manure and I know we're

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.940 
with the goat manure and I know we're
talking<00:03:09.480> about<00:03:09.750> root<00:03:10.079> crops<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.680> they<00:03:10.769> don't

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
talking about root crops and they don't

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.400 
talking about root crops and they don't
necessarily<00:03:11.610> need<00:03:11.790> quite<00:03:12.510> as<00:03:12.690> much<00:03:12.900> nitrogen

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
necessarily need quite as much nitrogen

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.830 
necessarily need quite as much nitrogen
but<00:03:14.069> things<00:03:14.819> have<00:03:15.090> come<00:03:15.269> along<00:03:15.510> quite<00:03:15.810> nicely

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
but things have come along quite nicely

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.110 
but things have come along quite nicely
the<00:03:16.739> first<00:03:16.980> ones<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.519> planted<00:03:17.819> were<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
the first ones that I planted were the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.960 
the first ones that I planted were the
ones<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.600> little<00:03:18.840> bed<00:03:18.989> right<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.970> I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
ones in this little bed right here and I

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.110 
ones in this little bed right here and I
don't<00:03:21.269> know<00:03:21.450> for<00:03:21.690> sure<00:03:23.510> but<00:03:25.010> is<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.940> big

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
don't know for sure but is that big

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.400 
don't know for sure but is that big
enough<00:03:27.359> I<00:03:29.000> think<00:03:30.000> that's<00:03:30.389> about<00:03:30.540> what<00:03:31.319> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
enough I think that's about what the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.710 
enough I think that's about what the
size<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.920> beets<00:03:32.130> supposed<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.609> be<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.970> reckon

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
size of beets supposed to be I reckon
