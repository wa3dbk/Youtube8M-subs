try<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.740> get<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> end<00:02:47.190> zone<00:02:47.250> right

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
try and get in the end zone right

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.270 
try and get in the end zone right
because<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.760> ended<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.210> fumbling<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.280> that's

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
because we ended up fumbling and that's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.500 
because we ended up fumbling and that's
what<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.490> 49ers<00:02:50.670> rules<00:02:51.060> that's<00:02:51.210> why<00:02:51.330> they<00:02:51.450> are

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
what the 49ers rules that's why they are

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.020 
what the 49ers rules that's why they are
so<00:02:52.370> overpowered<00:02:53.370> when<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.610> comes<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.880> this

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
so overpowered when it comes to this

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.530 
so overpowered when it comes to this
game<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.960> fact<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.350> they<00:02:56.250> hit<00:02:56.700> hard<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
game is the fact that they hit hard the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.990 
game is the fact that they hit hard the
computer<00:02:57.990> with<00:02:58.530> them<00:02:58.740> CPU<00:02:59.160> his<00:02:59.400> sticks<00:02:59.700> will

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
computer with them CPU his sticks will

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.870 
computer with them CPU his sticks will
jar<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.630> ball<00:03:00.810> loose<00:03:01.050> in<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:02.040> happens<00:03:02.730> often

stop them we would have taken our field
goal<00:03:32.940> but<00:03:33.120> figure<00:03:33.990> we'll<00:03:34.170> catch<00:03:34.440> them<00:03:34.560> off

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709
