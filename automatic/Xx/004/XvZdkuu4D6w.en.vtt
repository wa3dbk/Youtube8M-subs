00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
two seconds to reload or cool down in my

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
two seconds to reload or cool down in my
opinion<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.830> find<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> gunner<00:01:05.610> machine<00:01:06.060> gun

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
opinion I find the gunner machine gun

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.719 
opinion I find the gunner machine gun
just<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.619> too<00:01:07.860> weak<00:01:08.130> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
just to be a little bit too weak it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.969 
just to be a little bit too weak it's
not<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> damage<00:01:09.479> model<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.990> think<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> damage

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
not the damage model I think the damage

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.539 
not the damage model I think the damage
model<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.580> pretty<00:01:11.760> good<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.270> 25<00:01:12.900> maximum<00:01:13.770> 108

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
model is pretty good at 25 maximum 108

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.999 
model is pretty good at 25 maximum 108
meters<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.930> means<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.259> four<00:01:16.470> bullet<00:01:16.770> kill

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
meters so that means a four bullet kill

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.399 
meters so that means a four bullet kill
and<00:01:17.400> poor<00:01:17.970> below<00:01:18.240> kill<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.750> right<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and poor below kill is all right but the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.649 
and poor below kill is all right but the
problem<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.119> rate<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.420> fire

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
problem is I think it's the rate of fire

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.679 
problem is I think it's the rate of fire
at<00:01:22.070> 550<00:01:23.070> rounds<00:01:23.220> per<00:01:23.490> minute<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.970> think<00:01:24.119> it's

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
at 550 rounds per minute I think it's

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.140 
at 550 rounds per minute I think it's
just<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.320> too<00:01:25.590> low<00:01:25.920> maybe<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.939> they

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
just a bit too low maybe if they

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.710 
just a bit too low maybe if they
increase<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.930> 650<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> will

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
increase it at 650 or so I think it will

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
increase it at 650 or so I think it will
be<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:30.990> much<00:01:31.140> better<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.520> get

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
be with much better because you can get

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
be with much better because you can get
more<00:01:33.000> blows<00:01:33.240> downrange<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.530> way

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
more blows downrange and in a way

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740 
more blows downrange and in a way
suppress<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> enemy<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.270> can't<00:01:36.570> fire

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
suppress the enemy so they can't fire

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
suppress the enemy so they can't fire
back<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:38.250> kill<00:01:38.460> them<00:01:38.610> much

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
back at you and you can kill them much

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
back at you and you can kill them much
easier<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.079> let's<00:01:40.409> move<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> gunner

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
easier so let's move on to the gunner

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
easier so let's move on to the gunner
optic<00:01:41.759> section<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> first<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
optic section and first we have to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.130 
optic section and first we have to
default<00:01:44.009> gunner<00:01:44.340> resume<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.869> a

so<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.739> don't<00:02:19.950> use<00:02:20.130> irnv<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.390> kind<00:02:21.720> of

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
so I just don't use irnv and I kind of

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.710 
so I just don't use irnv and I kind of
flank<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.350> irnv<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.450> bit<00:02:24.540> too

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
main bout tanks it is a black and white

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.390 
main bout tanks it is a black and white
night<00:02:33.870> vision<00:02:34.260> system<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.860> shows<00:02:35.130> heat

signatures<00:02:35.940> across<00:02:36.360> all<00:02:36.600> ranges<00:02:37.110> so

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
signatures across all ranges so

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.759 
signatures across all ranges so
basically<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.700> gunner<00:02:39.030> irnv<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:40.200> black<00:02:40.590> and

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
basically the gunner irnv but black and

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.150 
basically the gunner irnv but black and
white

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
white

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.090 
white
I<00:02:41.190> switched<00:02:42.060> between<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.050> zoom<00:02:43.530> because

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
I switched between this and zoom because

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.970 
I switched between this and zoom because
I<00:02:44.580> find<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.300> would<00:02:45.510> be<00:02:45.630> very<00:02:45.930> useful<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.440> see

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
I find this would be very useful to see

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.940 
I find this would be very useful to see
enemy<00:02:47.430> mines<00:02:47.700> or<00:02:48.030> slams<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.590> warm<00:02:49.800> my

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
enemy mines or slams so I can warm my

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.300 
enemy mines or slams so I can warm my
teammates<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.640> my<00:02:51.030> driver<00:02:51.920> lastly<00:02:52.920> we<00:02:53.130> have

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
teammates and my driver lastly we have

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.820

the gunner upgrade section and first we

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.979 
the gunner upgrade section and first we
have<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.250> gunner<00:02:56.550> belt<00:02:56.850> feeder<00:02:57.090> which<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
have the gunner belt feeder which is the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.440 
have the gunner belt feeder which is the
default<00:02:58.500> configuration<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.730> is<00:03:00.209> an

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
default configuration on it it is an

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.660 
default configuration on it it is an
enhanced<00:03:00.989> mechanism<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.680> reduces<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.459> time

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
enhanced mechanism that reduces the time

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.059 
enhanced mechanism that reduces the time
it<00:03:02.730> takes<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> reload<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.560> takes<00:03:04.739> us<00:03:04.860> down

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
it takes to reload and it takes us down

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.300 
it takes to reload and it takes us down
from<00:03:05.489> 2<00:03:05.760> seconds<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.540> 0.8<00:03:07.200> seconds<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.860> that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
from 2 seconds to 0.8 seconds and that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.880 
from 2 seconds to 0.8 seconds and that
is<00:03:08.519> pretty<00:03:08.819> good<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.299> my<00:03:09.390> opinion<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:10.530> we

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
is pretty good in my opinion then we

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.770 
is pretty good in my opinion then we
have<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.280> gunner<00:03:11.579> proximity<00:03:12.120> scan<00:03:12.180> which<00:03:12.750> is

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
have the gunner proximity scan which is

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.140 
have the gunner proximity scan which is
