00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
all that kind of stuff happens so it was

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.010 
all that kind of stuff happens so it was
kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> important<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.939> think<00:01:26.939> about<00:01:27.060> how<00:01:27.960> we

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
kind of important to think about how we

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.899 
kind of important to think about how we
wanted<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.400> could<00:01:29.670> still

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
wanted to do this that we could still

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
wanted to do this that we could still
continue<00:01:30.299> having<00:01:30.750> good<00:01:30.960> content<00:01:31.320> our

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
continue having good content our

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.260 
continue having good content our
channels<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.000> gonna

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
channels I think this is really gonna

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.149 
channels I think this is really gonna
open<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.049> doors<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.350> us<00:01:34.530> especially

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
open up a lot of doors for us especially

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
open up a lot of doors for us especially
for<00:01:35.520> docking<00:01:35.759> dog<00:01:35.880> because<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:37.049> he

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
for docking dog because I think he

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.359 
for docking dog because I think he
wanted<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.409> start<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> new<00:01:37.799> series<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> long

got<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> lot<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.159> new<00:01:44.280> games<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.790> I'm<00:01:44.909> thinking

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
got a lot of new games and I'm thinking

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.960 
got a lot of new games and I'm thinking
maybe<00:01:46.140> some<00:01:46.439> more<00:01:46.619> sandbox<00:01:47.280> games<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> kind<00:01:47.909> of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
maybe some more sandbox games to kind of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.109 
maybe some more sandbox games to kind of
add<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.360> variation<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.909> picked

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
add some variation to it I just picked

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.950 
add some variation to it I just picked
up<00:01:51.270> since<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.320> sims<00:01:52.530> 3<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.070> Steam<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:54.899> know

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
up since the sims 3 on Steam and I know

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.880 
up since the sims 3 on Steam and I know
you're<00:01:55.170> thinking<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.560> kind<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> weird

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
you're thinking that's kind of a weird

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.969 
you're thinking that's kind of a weird
game<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.299> buying<00:01:57.810> taught<00:01:58.380> me<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> sandbox

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
game to be buying taught me the sandbox

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
game to be buying taught me the sandbox
game<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.460> would<00:01:59.729> actually<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
game it would actually it is but the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.350 
game it would actually it is but the
reason<00:02:01.530> why<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> bought<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.759> what

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
reason why I bought it was because what

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.520 
reason why I bought it was because what
you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.020> actually<00:02:04.140> build

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you can do is you can actually build

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.230 
you can do is you can actually build
like<00:02:04.799> custom<00:02:05.130> houses<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.670> furnish<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
like custom houses and furnish them and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.819 
like custom houses and furnish them and
stuff<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.869> love<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.200> idea<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.649> that's

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
stuff and I love that idea so that's

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.990 
stuff and I love that idea so that's
kind<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.069> something<00:02:08.250> else<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.580> maybe

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
kind of something else they can maybe

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400 
kind of something else they can maybe
try<00:02:09.239> sometime

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
try sometime

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.680 
try sometime
I<00:02:10.680> probably<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.790> hack<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> game<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
I probably just like hack the game and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.030 
I probably just like hack the game and
