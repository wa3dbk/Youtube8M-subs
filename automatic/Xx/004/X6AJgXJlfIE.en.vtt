us this was on my first attempt at
creating<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.080> seed<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.390> what<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.630> got<00:00:28.199> was

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
creating a seed and what I got was

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.070 
creating a seed and what I got was
surprising<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.060> what<00:00:30.480> you're<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> want

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
so you could see better hope we can see

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.340 
so you could see better hope we can see
that<00:01:59.870> a<00:01:59.900> little<00:02:00.170> better<00:02:01.930> i'm<00:02:02.930> going<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.200> try

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
that a little better i'm going to try

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.060 
that a little better i'm going to try
and<00:02:03.440> move<00:02:03.650> around<00:02:03.830> here<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.340> little<00:02:04.520> bit<00:02:05.950> as<00:02:06.950> you

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
and move around here a little bit as you

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.070 
and move around here a little bit as you
can<00:02:07.280> see<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:08.869> cannot<00:02:09.229> see<00:02:09.590> any<00:02:09.920> land<00:02:11.080> for

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
can see you cannot see any land for

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.580 
can see you cannot see any land for
miles<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:17.330> just<00:02:17.480> start<00:02:17.870> out<00:02:18.110> on<00:02:18.410> an

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
miles and you you just start out on an

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.890 
miles and you you just start out on an
island<00:02:18.800> basically<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:21.550> it's<00:02:22.690> kind<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.780> like

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
island basically and it's kind of like

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.960 
island basically and it's kind of like
survival<00:02:24.530> island<00:02:26.950> except<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.070> was<00:02:28.310> created

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
survival island except this was created

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.990 
survival island except this was created
by<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> world<00:02:30.250> seed<00:02:31.250> which<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.000> crazy<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.520> it'll

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
by a world seed which is crazy so it'll

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.060 
by a world seed which is crazy so it'll
start<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.480> off<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.020> one<00:02:36.290> tree<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.920> here

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
start you off you have one tree on here

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.780 
start you off you have one tree on here
mmm<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:41.270> got<00:02:41.450> sand<00:02:41.959> over<00:02:42.290> there<00:02:42.500> under<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
know if you can see it very well hold on

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.070 
know if you can see it very well hold on
this<00:02:57.080> is<00:02:57.290> lagging<00:02:57.980> really<00:02:58.280> bad<00:02:58.660> turn<00:02:59.660> my<00:02:59.810> view

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
this is lagging really bad turn my view

this is lagging really bad turn my view
distance<00:03:00.440> down<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:00.980> was<00:03:01.250> trying<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.610> look<00:03:01.760> for

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
distance down I was trying to look for

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.890 
distance down I was trying to look for
land<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.570> couldn't<00:03:03.050> see<00:03:03.170> any<00:03:03.670> it's<00:03:04.670> crazy

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.020 

but<00:03:10.500> yeah<00:03:10.799> basically<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:14.030> 1.8
