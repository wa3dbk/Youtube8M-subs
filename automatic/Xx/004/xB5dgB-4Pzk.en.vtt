element of standardized work is TAC time
this<00:00:47.720> is<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:47.930> heartbeat<00:00:48.409> of<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.860> process<00:00:49.309> it

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
this is the heartbeat of the process it

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.790 
this is the heartbeat of the process it
tells<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:50.510> how<00:00:50.659> long<00:00:50.899> your<00:00:51.140> process<00:00:51.530> should

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
tells you how long your process should

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.189
