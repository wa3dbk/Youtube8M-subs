00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
top of the root system I don't want to

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.490 
top of the root system I don't want to
bury<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.250> pseudobulbs<00:05:29.940> at<00:05:30.090> all

bury the pseudobulbs at all

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.180 
bury the pseudobulbs at all
that<00:05:31.500> will<00:05:31.710> cause<00:05:31.890> rot<00:05:33.350> and<00:05:34.350> you<00:05:34.830> want<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.070> make

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
that will cause rot and you want to make

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
that will cause rot and you want to make
sure<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.230> plant<00:05:37.470> is<00:05:37.620> secure

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
sure that the that the plant is secure

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.730 
sure that the that the plant is secure
this<00:05:39.210> plant<00:05:39.570> here<00:05:39.840> I<00:05:39.900> might<00:05:40.170> have<00:05:40.350> to<00:05:40.470> go<00:05:40.560> down

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
this plant here I might have to go down

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.360 
this plant here I might have to go down
and<00:05:40.920> get<00:05:41.010> some<00:05:41.070> of<00:05:41.370> my<00:05:41.990> my<00:05:42.990> bonsai<00:05:43.470> wire<00:05:43.770> and

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
and get some of my my bonsai wire and

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.370 
and get some of my my bonsai wire and
wire<00:05:44.730> it<00:05:44.790> across<00:05:45.270> just<00:05:45.540> to<00:05:45.690> hold<00:05:45.870> it<00:05:46.020> in<00:05:46.110> place

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
wire it across just to hold it in place

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.650 
wire it across just to hold it in place
so<00:05:46.650> it<00:05:47.100> doesn't<00:05:47.130> budge<00:05:47.610> around<00:05:48.030> so<00:05:48.390> it<00:05:48.510> won't

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
so it doesn't budge around so it won't

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.770 
so it doesn't budge around so it won't
move<00:05:48.890> but<00:05:49.890> for<00:05:50.700> now<00:05:50.820> this<00:05:51.030> will<00:05:51.180> be<00:05:51.270> fine<00:05:51.510> it

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
move but for now this will be fine it

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.200 
move but for now this will be fine it
doesn't<00:05:52.110> seem<00:05:52.290> to<00:05:52.410> want<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.620> move<00:05:52.800> very<00:05:53.010> much

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
doesn't seem to want to move very much

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.380 
doesn't seem to want to move very much
it<00:05:54.210> seems<00:05:54.330> pretty<00:05:54.630> secure<00:05:54.930> in<00:05:55.260> its<00:05:55.410> place<00:05:55.680> I

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
it seems pretty secure in its place I

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.020 
it seems pretty secure in its place I
will<00:05:57.390> keep<00:05:57.540> you<00:05:57.660> posted<00:05:58.050> on<00:05:58.140> this<00:05:58.670> this<00:05:59.670> plant

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
and maybe in a few months we'll see some

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.950 
and maybe in a few months we'll see some
root<00:06:03.900> development<00:06:04.500> and<00:06:05.400> I'll<00:06:05.810> let<00:06:06.810> you<00:06:06.930> know

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
how it's going again I think this plant

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.360 
how it's going again I think this plant
will<00:06:10.080> make<00:06:10.200> a<00:06:10.230> full<00:06:10.440> recovery<00:06:10.500> I<00:06:10.980> don't<00:06:11.220> have

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
will make a full recovery I don't have

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.020 
will make a full recovery I don't have
any<00:06:11.930> any<00:06:12.930> worries<00:06:13.320> about<00:06:13.440> that<00:06:13.880> orchids<00:06:14.880> are

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
any any worries about that orchids are

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.280 
any any worries about that orchids are
pretty<00:06:15.740> pretty<00:06:16.740> resilient<00:06:17.510> as<00:06:18.510> long<00:06:18.900> as<00:06:19.080> for

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
pretty pretty resilient as long as for

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.460 
pretty pretty resilient as long as for
the<00:06:19.350> most<00:06:19.500> part<00:06:19.770> they<00:06:19.920> get<00:06:20.070> the<00:06:20.370> correct<00:06:20.880> care

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470

if you're not giving it the proper

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.970 
if you're not giving it the proper
environments<00:06:25.140> it<00:06:25.230> needs<00:06:25.380> to<00:06:25.530> grow<00:06:25.650> obviously

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
environments it needs to grow obviously

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.030 
environments it needs to grow obviously
it<00:06:26.490> won't<00:06:26.640> won't<00:06:27.000> do<00:06:27.270> well<00:06:27.510> but<00:06:28.230> for<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:28.920> most
