honestly think that this can be tighter

like two or three times relight it and
it'll<00:04:03.810> still<00:04:04.020> work<00:04:04.080> just<00:04:04.200> fine<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.680> can<00:04:04.980> be

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
it'll still work just fine I can be

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
yeah see how sliding like that sits wet

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.610 
yeah see how sliding like that sits wet
slides<00:05:13.320> up<00:05:13.530> watch<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.640> gotta<00:05:14.790> fix<00:05:15.030> that

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
slides up watch I gotta fix that

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.170 
slides up watch I gotta fix that
same<00:05:16.620> thing<00:05:16.830> take<00:05:17.010> another<00:05:17.280> paper<00:05:17.430> towel<00:05:17.700> that

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
same thing take another paper towel that

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.540 
same thing take another paper towel that
you<00:05:18.270> got<00:05:18.419> ripped<00:05:18.630> it's<00:05:18.840> fold<00:05:19.020> in<00:05:19.110> half<00:05:19.400> wrap<00:05:20.400> it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
you got ripped it's fold in half wrap it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.709 
you got ripped it's fold in half wrap it
around<00:05:20.640> it<00:05:20.940> this<00:05:21.300> might<00:05:21.510> even<00:05:21.539> be<00:05:21.750> too<00:05:21.900> thick

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
around it this might even be too thick

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.579 
around it this might even be too thick
I<00:05:22.889> think<00:05:23.889> it'll<00:05:23.979> work<00:05:24.339> wrap<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.789> around<00:05:24.849> it

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:25.589 
I think it'll work wrap it around it

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:28.019 
I think it'll work wrap it around it
kind<00:05:26.589> of<00:05:26.619> push<00:05:27.279> it<00:05:27.399> all<00:05:27.519> in<00:05:27.549> make<00:05:27.879> sure<00:05:27.909> you

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
kind of push it all in make sure you

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:36.689 
kind of push it all in make sure you
don't<00:05:28.089> cover<00:05:28.299> the<00:05:28.449> whole<00:05:29.339> take<00:05:30.339> this<00:05:35.549> as<00:05:36.549> you

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
don't cover the whole take this as you

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.489 
don't cover the whole take this as you
can<00:05:36.849> see<00:05:36.999> it's<00:05:37.569> another<00:05:37.809> sliding<00:05:38.169> it's

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:38.499 
can see it's another sliding it's

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:40.350 
can see it's another sliding it's
sitting<00:05:38.739> still<00:05:38.919> it's<00:05:39.729> kind<00:05:39.969> of<00:05:40.029> tilted

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
sitting still it's kind of tilted

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.909 
sitting still it's kind of tilted
because<00:05:40.569> the<00:05:40.749> paper<00:05:40.989> towel<00:05:41.169> on<00:05:41.289> one<00:05:41.439> side<00:05:41.679> is

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
because the paper towel on one side is

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.459 
because the paper towel on one side is
pushed<00:05:42.669> over<00:05:42.819> which<00:05:43.479> is<00:05:43.599> fine<00:05:43.809> I<00:05:43.839> mean<00:05:44.019> you<00:05:44.319> can

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
pushed over which is fine I mean you can

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.749 
pushed over which is fine I mean you can
smoke<00:05:44.649> out<00:05:44.769> of<00:05:44.889> this<00:05:44.979> just<00:05:45.189> that's<00:05:45.399> one<00:05:45.610> way

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
smoke out of this just that's one way

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.039 
smoke out of this just that's one way
that<00:05:45.789> you<00:05:46.239> know<00:05:46.360> make<00:05:46.599> your<00:05:46.719> grounds<00:05:46.959> a<00:05:47.019> little

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:47.049 
that you know make your grounds a little

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:49.199 
that you know make your grounds a little
better<00:05:47.319> you<00:05:48.279> can<00:05:48.399> do<00:05:48.489> this<00:05:48.610> with<00:05:48.729> hoses<00:05:48.879> too

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:49.209 
better you can do this with hoses too

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:50.209 
better you can do this with hoses too
it's<00:05:49.419> the<00:05:49.479> same<00:05:49.659> concept

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:50.219 
it's the same concept

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.409 
it's the same concept
my<00:05:51.219> home<00:05:51.339> is<00:05:51.519> actually<00:05:51.639> do<00:05:51.969> not<00:05:52.119> have<00:05:52.299> your

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:53.649 
towels on there right now which I'm

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:54.959 
towels on there right now which I'm
probably<00:05:54.069> gonna<00:05:54.279> put<00:05:54.519> them<00:05:54.639> on<00:05:54.729> there<00:05:54.849> because

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:54.969 
probably gonna put them on there because

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:57.689 
probably gonna put them on there because
they<00:05:55.360> always<00:05:55.509> fall<00:05:55.809> out<00:05:56.369> Seth<00:05:57.369> doesn't<00:05:57.550> even

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
they always fall out Seth doesn't even

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:58.829 
they always fall out Seth doesn't even

00:05:58.829 --> 00:05:58.839 
have a ground for his house it's just a

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.679 
have a ground for his house it's just a
paper<00:05:58.989> towel<00:05:59.199> and<00:05:59.439> it<00:06:00.399> works<00:06:00.550> just<00:06:00.669> fine<00:06:00.849> but

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:01.689 
paper towel and it works just fine but

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.059

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:03.069 
this big ol ground probably worked

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:04.439
