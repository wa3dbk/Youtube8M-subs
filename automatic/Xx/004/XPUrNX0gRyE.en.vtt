00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
healthy planting of this recently and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.770 
healthy planting of this recently and
this<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> very<00:00:14.280> useful<00:00:14.580> plant<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.330> certain

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
this is a very useful plant in certain

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320 
this is a very useful plant in certain
areas<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.859> what<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.060> ground

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
areas so what it is is it's a ground

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.710 
areas so what it is is it's a ground
cover<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.279> semi<00:00:20.699> succulent<00:00:21.480> and

cover it's a kind of semi succulent and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.400 
cover it's a kind of semi succulent and
it's<00:00:22.650> incredibly<00:00:23.310> drought<00:00:24.210> resistant<00:00:24.930> this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
it's incredibly drought resistant this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.439 
it's incredibly drought resistant this
particular<00:00:25.830> planting<00:00:26.670> has<00:00:26.939> never<00:00:27.210> been

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
particular planting has never been

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.500 
particular planting has never been
watered<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.890> irrigation<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:30.119> only<00:00:30.269> gets

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
watered with irrigation it only gets

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.030 
watered with irrigation it only gets
whatever<00:00:30.840> seasonal<00:00:31.560> rainfall<00:00:31.830> shows<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.700> and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
whatever seasonal rainfall shows up and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.330 
whatever seasonal rainfall shows up and
it's<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.600> I'd<00:00:36.600> say<00:00:36.690> three<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.710> four<00:00:38.010> inches

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
it's about I'd say three to four inches

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.729 
it's about I'd say three to four inches
deep<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.879> most<00:00:39.149> places<00:00:39.450> where<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.110> has<00:00:40.260> room<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
deep in most places where it has room to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.470 
deep in most places where it has room to
spread<00:00:40.980> out

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
spread out

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.119 
spread out
also<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> end<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> day<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
also this is the end of the day and the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.600 
also this is the end of the day and the
flowers<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.640> closed<00:00:45.180> down<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.710> red<00:00:46.950> apple<00:00:47.190> I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
flowers have closed down the red apple I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
flowers have closed down the red apple I
guess<00:00:47.850> comes<00:00:48.210> from<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> color<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> flower

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
guess comes from the color of the flower

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.240 
guess comes from the color of the flower
and<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:51.660> should<00:00:51.870> also<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> bees

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and you should also know that the bees

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.060 
and you should also know that the bees
love<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.210> plant<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:55.350> you've<00:00:55.559> got<00:00:55.770> issues

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
love this plant if you've got issues

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.910 
love this plant if you've got issues
with<00:00:56.340> honeybees<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.840> should<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.680> this

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
with honeybees you should not have this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.729 
with honeybees you should not have this
around<00:00:59.340> where<00:00:59.609> people<00:00:59.640> are<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.750> that

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
around where people are going to be that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.609 
around where people are going to be that
said<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:02.730> inexpensive<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.379> low

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
said it's a very inexpensive and low

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.250 
said it's a very inexpensive and low
water<00:01:04.949> solution<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> bank<00:01:06.420> cover<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.080> can

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
water solution as a bank cover you can

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.840 
water solution as a bank cover you can
see<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.159> sprawled<00:01:08.610> out

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
see it's just kind of sprawled out

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.469 
see it's just kind of sprawled out
around<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.580> you'll<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.760> notice<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
around here and you'll also notice that

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
around here and you'll also notice that
it's<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> stopped<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> shadow<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it's kind of stopped in the shadow of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.240 
it's kind of stopped in the shadow of
these<00:01:15.119> larger<00:01:15.780> shrubs<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.590> around<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
these larger shrubs that are around it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
these larger shrubs that are around it
and<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> warmer<00:01:20.250> inland<00:01:20.729> Valley<00:01:21.080> gets

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and this is a warmer inland Valley gets

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.030 
and this is a warmer inland Valley gets
in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> 90s<00:01:22.890> during<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.460> summer<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:25.040> even

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
in the 90s during the summer and so even

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.480 
in the 90s during the summer and so even
in<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.340> heat<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:27.180> plant<00:01:27.570> has<00:01:27.840> been<00:01:27.869> able<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
in this heat this plant has been able to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.830 
in this heat this plant has been able to
survive<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.790> no<00:01:30.060> water<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.750> years<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.630> be

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
survive on no water for years it can be

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.880 
survive on no water for years it can be
propagated<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:35.900> cuttings<00:01:36.900> probably<00:01:37.530> flats

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
propagated from cuttings probably flats

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.760 
propagated from cuttings probably flats
is<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> easiest<00:01:38.700> thing<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.350> gets<00:01:40.560> any

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
is the easiest thing and if it gets any

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.170 
is the easiest thing and if it gets any
kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.280> irrigation<00:01:42.110> and/or<00:01:43.110> fertilizer

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
kind of irrigation and/or fertilizer

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
kind of irrigation and/or fertilizer
this<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.420> take<00:01:45.659> off<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> rocket<00:01:46.590> it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
this will take off like a rocket it's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.870 
this will take off like a rocket it's
very<00:01:47.340> easy<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:48.000> grow<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:49.310> when<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> gets<00:01:50.640> just

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
very easy to grow and when it gets just

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.889 
very easy to grow and when it gets just
a<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.409> kindness<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.340> really

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
a little bit of kindness it can really

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.870 
a little bit of kindness it can really
cover<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:55.079> area<00:01:55.229> quickly<00:01:55.680> there's<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.579> honey

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
cover an area quickly there's a honey

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.950 
cover an area quickly there's a honey
bee<00:01:58.189> that's<00:01:59.189> most<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> wanted<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
bee that's most of what I wanted to and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.870 
bee that's most of what I wanted to and
it's<00:02:01.110> also<00:02:01.290> very<00:02:01.500> deer<00:02:02.100> resistant<00:02:02.700> this

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it's also very deer resistant this

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240 
it's also very deer resistant this
particular<00:02:03.270> site<00:02:03.810> has<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.500> deer<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
particular site has a lot of deer and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.670 
particular site has a lot of deer and
they've<00:02:05.880> chewed<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.869> everything<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
they've chewed just about everything and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.469 
they've chewed just about everything and
they're<00:02:07.829> leaving<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.310> alone<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> deer

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
they're leaving this alone so the deer

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
they're leaving this alone so the deer
leave<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.899> alone<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.860> very<00:02:11.129> drought

leave this alone it's very drought

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.970 
leave this alone it's very drought
resistant<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.440> little

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
resistant and just a little

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.649 
resistant and just a little
water<00:02:14.099> will<00:02:14.340> green<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.849> up<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.450> looks

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
water will green this up and it looks

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.380 
water will green this up and it looks
really<00:02:16.080> nice<00:02:16.260> when<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:16.800> got<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> little<00:02:18.000> care

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
really nice when it's got a little care

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.220 
really nice when it's got a little care
for<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.310> that's<00:02:20.310> apt<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.909> that's<00:02:21.299> apt<00:02:21.659> Ania

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
for it so that's apt it that's apt Ania

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.229 
for it so that's apt it that's apt Ania
cordifolia<00:02:23.299> red<00:02:24.299> apple<00:02:24.810> oh<00:02:25.230> by<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.739> way

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
cordifolia red apple oh by the way

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.839 
cordifolia red apple oh by the way
temperature-wise<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:28.590> gets<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.250> mid

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
temperature-wise this gets in the mid

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.570 
temperature-wise this gets in the mid
20s<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.660> lowest<00:02:31.049> temps<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.799> area<00:02:32.220> are

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
20s the lowest temps in this area are

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.309 
20s the lowest temps in this area are
the<00:02:32.610> low<00:02:33.090> 20s<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.709> survives<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.610> so

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
the low 20s and this survives that so

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.170 
the low 20s and this survives that so
probably<00:02:37.319> best<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.890> coastal<00:02:38.400> areas<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:39.060> it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
probably best in coastal areas but it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.509 
probably best in coastal areas but it
does<00:02:39.390> survive<00:02:39.840> some<00:02:40.170> pretty<00:02:40.379> hard<00:02:40.680> frost<00:02:41.099> here

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
does survive some pretty hard frost here

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.909 
does survive some pretty hard frost here
and<00:02:42.230> also<00:02:43.230> heat<00:02:43.560> as<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:44.040> mentioned<00:02:44.519> earlier
