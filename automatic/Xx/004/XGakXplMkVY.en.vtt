00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 grover have come more like our 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.269
 actions I bring an idea one more analysis 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 that everything could be called that could 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.230
 pass the next one was in the next 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.059
 game of zombies that is to black ops 3 or 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.580
 as nobody is going to call the truth 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.320
 is sure in an analysis of what is going to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.029
 happen in that game and I'm also going to do 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.320
 an analysis of the end of origins and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.390
 let's say that a summary of all the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.189
 story of zombies since recently 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.710
 came out a little bit a little bit more 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 time and I started to see all the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.279
 Absolutely all details 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.380
 details of what we have of zombies and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.210
 came a conclusion that I did not imagine 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.680
 that we could have with this ending and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.200
 Now I like a little more the end 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.420
 I do not love him but I like it better than before 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.059
 end of the vikings anyway and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.190
 good to explain this we have to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.140
 first analyze the end of the end that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.969
 we had the origin of this scene where 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.190
 come out domains playing one is called sham 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.280
 and another one is called ed and we have to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.710
 analyze it in a moment the scene 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.660
 samantha tells edward that what 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 save and tomorrow is the turn the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.769
 this is an important fact to remember 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.250
 a morning was the one of eduardo the day 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.900
 following 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.820
 edward after 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.430
 then the zombie story we can 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080
 separate in two in the time that I'm going to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.030
 this blanket and in the time that plays 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.740
 edwards but at the end of the day is the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.810
 same story or come to the same 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.610
 mats and just one follows the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.920
 another's story then we could 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 say that the maps that samantha have 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.380
 controlled that is history lovers 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.820
 they use the real girl are not the ones that come out 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.710
 with the yellow fingers in themselves but 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.140
 would be the following list that analyze 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.470
 it would be origins nights of a totem 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.229
 verrückt shi no numa of reese and urine 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.570
 again the controllers would be of 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.290
 risk 500 team ascension carlos de 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.600
 extension and the moon transit time rights 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.060
 and buried and I will explain why 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.250
 I think this and going as fast 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.080
 possible because if you do not forget do 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.180
 too long and the truth what 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.090
 I want is to be entertained understand 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.130
 all in the shortest time possible and good 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.720
 the origin is the first origins because 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.820
 they saw that the repeated times the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.650
 first let's say you 're not loving be 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.600
 but what happens before it arrives 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.319
 that blanket and all that bottle blankets 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.569
 why 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.129
 to call it some way then 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.769
 let's say that what happens is that 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.870
 christopher pierre of the parents and I put 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.180
 some attention what I read but I'm 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.790
 I miss the parents brings that maxis 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.680
 is with christoph in more they start to 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.480
 investigate and create but let's say that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.129
 machinery much more advanced than what 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.939
 has the other countries in the first 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.730
 World War 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.620
 then say you sent a spy 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.900
 by calling some way from each country 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.430
 of Japan send attack from Russia send to 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.060
 nicola and the united states will send 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.250
 elche 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.439
 the three meet there when they arrive and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.269
 everything is very let's say it's already 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.469
 invaded by zombies with already come to see 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.790
 everything there 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:55.829
 maxis sick maxis 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.419
 we get sick or the doctor passes 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.189
 christopher highlights the brain and I know 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.480
 puts or makes plans to be the 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.700
 maximum 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.340
 after passing all this say 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.690
 that origins after two pass 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.880
 they manage to survive I got follower and 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.350
 jeans 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.590
 everyone in their country maxis and forgiveness is 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.230
 going to 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.360
 germany the let's say they take out the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.920
 brain if they get a body for the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.140
 gift of that body we still do not know 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.450
 how it looks or how that is called axis that 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.730
 we knew before is the maxi has the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.500
 matisse's brain but the body does not 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.769
 and there happens everything we know about the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.170
 zombie story has 35 a 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.060
 secret organization of ruiz a factory 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.260
 of transport weapons we all already know 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.440
 what happened you see 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.640
 all that happened whether that's the story 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.099
 happens after that let's say that as 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.500
 they arrive to griezmann a spy of 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.180
 usa called peter ya know peter moore 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.390
 in shrill luma they send a group of 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.400
 rescue to the nose of the hotel die in 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.079
 collapsed in brno collapses to another group 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.780
 another rescue group and it just comes out of a 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.590
 civilian and they take it to the eagle level and 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.989
 they make him 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.390
 let's say that certain experiments and 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.370
 Then the double parade works memory 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.160
 same as the previous two know to 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.949
 nicolás and taquile on memory and 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.780
 none of them is able to remember what 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.919
 that happened in origins to call it by 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.209
 put it like that 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.620
 then they come to have and if it happens 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.030
 absolutely everything we know of 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.460
 the story are vicious visuals of 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.889
 week travels on the teleporter 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.690
 reach the moon builds the base of 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.979
 riff and all that and samantha in cloth for 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.509
 me here let's say and what's important 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.729
 and in samantha's story we could 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.469
 suppose because like zombies all are 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.289
 suppose there's let's say a fine story 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:45.150
 we could put that with the with the 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.639
 pyramid samantha travel origins to ask 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.529
 help to be released happens what 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.289
 we know in old virgins and there ends 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.419
 samantha's turn the next day 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.180
 edward's turn this turn 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.180
 eduardo and comes again to lewis but in 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.499
 place of something that smells men origins 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.879
 let's say they continue kino bertotti bone 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:05.219
 overheating between the conveyor 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.120
 they arrive here noberto ting then they go to 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.800
 ascension 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.919
 then they reach ascension and see this 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.210
 doctor doctor duct the best of man 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.449
 good they release the doctor who is 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.589
 stuck in the dimension of samantha and 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.300
 Samantha is chasing him 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:22.139
 ascension then goes to carlos de adif 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.180
 get get the golden blood then 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.949
 is based on wound and gets the stone 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.979
 of little the meteor like that dani abalo 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.680
 we are taking out they change more with 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.229
 samantha after that 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.999
 we go to transit there they light the first 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.430
 tower of ruiz ignites the second tower 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:40.350
 burj and turn on the third tower 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.770
 interesting stofan enters the body 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.810
 of samuel and martín if we succeed 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.450
 liberate tries to destroy this dimension 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.310
 now sorry if I did it fast but it's 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.530
 that I just had to make a 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.360
 quick summary then forgiveness is 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.920
 quite something just know what 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.420
 important is that they have understood more or 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.400
 less the idea of what it is of what 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.830
 I'm saying if you have not understood if 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.510
 have any questions or complaints 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.640
 some can put the comments to 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.860
 answer and try to try 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.720
 answer them now 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.000
 now very interesting to turn on 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.440
 bullying that pass two finals on 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.870
 next map is not origin is the 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.430
 next map we do not know which ones here 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.580
 I put the image of burden of bullying 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.460
 and we can see it say a blueprint 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.530
 or a blue map to that right 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.090
 top that the logo belay three five 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.880
 This is going to be the next map of the 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.040
 next game now what can happen in 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.110
 this game we are going to follow the story of 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.210
 edward maybe yes he can not 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.520
 let's go back in history this blanket and 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.220
 let's go back to the point of view of the 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.410
 characters that we know let's say what 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.450
 christopher nicolaita active and dem yes 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.850
 but let's say that from tame we are in the 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.010
 world that would be the story of that blanket 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.500
 where they are divided let's say certain 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.150
 way we could call it in fact from 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.730
 certain way we can put muslera in 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.170
 the samantha timeline but 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.180
 converted in a certain way because the 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.000
 true of week besides doubles that 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.740
 it's a blanket but you could get in 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.700
 certain point because that blanket came in 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.530
 inside the pyramid but the body is 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.780
 sorry the airsoft body does not have that 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.460
 blanket and has everything that has happened 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.200
 to be like that is confusing to understand but 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.460
 I think that I hope that with this they are 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.470
 understood and I do not have to do is another 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.360
 video or the next in the next 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.070
 game we can continue the burrito 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.110
 we can continue from the view of 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.420
 samantha let's say that it's the turn of the 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.370
 Samantha's turn then resumes from 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.050
 where edward left her there is they have the 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:36.610
 Christ's body 'end resumed from there 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.560
 can happen several things this I do 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.840
 because let's say it's an analysis of the 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.490
 final screen well done since when 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.770
 he came out can not analyze it too 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.630
 another and I had not understood it see a little 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.620
 understanding the fact I do not know if there's already 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.979
 further back 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.389
 a theory like this I hope not but 

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:53.830
 let's say it's an interesting one and 

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.020
 I think very valid then let me 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.370
 you who are human should you 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.380
 There are some comments that you think of this 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.120
 theory is but not valued boring 

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.139
 much my number see all our 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.139
 audio videos
