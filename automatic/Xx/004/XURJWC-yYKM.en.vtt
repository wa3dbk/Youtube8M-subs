00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.860
 in progress 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.630
 we can do a map operation whiteout 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.379
 always a bit of play, it is 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 the pre-release of battlefield 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.460
 community cde dingsbums me too 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.990
 and here's a heli maybe 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.060
 I can come in then we can 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.119
 map right from the top and a bit 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.099
 so we are emily has good 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.570
 worked then we can from times 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.920
 I want to look at it from the other one 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.189
 do not want to try now 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280
 here 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.260
 I had to believe it anyway 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.360
 turn off here was seen 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.129
 very bad with the snow we come 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.129
 we make the well -tried tactic 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.239
 Both should have been great and then 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.100
 Let's get each case now 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.960
 will or will not stand 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.870
 or not, but it is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.239
 picture and that's okay so we can 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.660
 the cd a final map was alluding 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660
 abort, stop 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:10.119
 oh my god is that no or what is 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 that just got us that 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.140
 killed 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.759
 is it somehow to vulture medium 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.580
 just mini smaller I come all the way 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.680
 clearly the hitmeister are huge 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.330
 no and god i thought it the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.820
 passes over me now okay we have a 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:31.659
 snowmobile monument consists in the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.420
 meadow and now there's ok oh my god it 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.560
 turns out to be just like a jet ski I do 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.990
 guess that we're in here 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.590
 drive up can be super okay then think 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.590
 Let's see the flag 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:52.950
 how sting what is that I want 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.830
 shoot it what it is 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.250
 seems to be pretty strong where god 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.450
 no again listing what is that 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.710
 I can not stand it 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.020
 Although any level it and I 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:21.030
 I also want to shoot with it that is so 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:22.410
 something normal that's all we have 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.570
 the hedi under shot so it must be 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.750
 okay, the corpse is flying okay now 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.380
 the tank was still behind the tank 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:36.000
 of course here 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.120
 he shoots what is that it does not have 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.440
 I also want to kill myself 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.330
 again the level 2 or he squats the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.010
 all the time is just made so bumm boom 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.610
 like canister ammo at the tank 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:55.520
 somehow saw 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:03:00.500
 colleague it is not serious o my 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:07.130
 god what is that a sc 42 okay there are 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:10.280
 very many, designer again 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.530
 just wait and from there maybe 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.000
 I'm just too bad and it is 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.709
 actually a shit is because you know 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.820
 It is not my first and here 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.200
 on it is a new device what killed 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.560
 is one's turn 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.989
 No, I'll look at it now 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.670
 is also the other lever 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.770
 he might be fine with me now 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.640
 that the other is I am here now 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.410
 Top I'm up here has since 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.410
 quickly down to the device 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.240
 Yes 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.030
 oh my god is the thing overboard lick 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:56.180
 It has never been so easy on my ass 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:56.180
 to shoot hello there is 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:05.040
 and also infantry oh my god not 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.450
 are you serious 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.550
 hello dice please patchen that is much too 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.340
 everything went strong i will be the one 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.090
 I would like on armor so I want now 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.090
 just in kempten 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.880
 but it squeaks it's old and 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.350
 squeaks and is completely overboard 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.120
 yes it starts a bit boring 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.290
 the device but generally if now 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.800
 someone so thinks okay i want everything 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.170
 destroyed armor before the thing finished 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800
 funny and again I think what is oh 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.200
 my God 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.449
 he drives himself okay we have to go from 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.070
 look outside 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.510
 he has like that 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.510
 ah ok i understand 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.830
 oh God 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.780
 Unfortunately I have to 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.820
 front is that according to the snow franz 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.950
 Dealers not in the display 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.700
 tension and only suffers from the floor 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.560
 of the helmut kohl 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.530
 there is nothing left of her 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.720
 that is why one of god is his 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.300
 I come here have taken away ok oh 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.400
 my god eighth street is so consistent 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.870
 just a mouse click look at that when 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.620
 the mouse moves that way 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.780
 quickly back and forth okay now time 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.160
 at which game was that one 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.050
 at borderlands and the vehicles 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:34.910
 Be with the mouse controls as well 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:36.920
 it okay okay that's pretty clear 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.070
 that could be on it 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.640
 automatically makes the making 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.640
 self-employed 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.760
 the erding or anti everything like that 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.200
 Let's call it a pinch now 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.470
 we redistributed to it times 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.910
 there comes from god and i would say 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.220
 had no chance where I first 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.220
 magath had to accept behind me 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.180
 yes i would say that thing 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.700
 is quite powerful so we 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.290
 Remember us when we get here on the new 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.930
 maps I do not know if it's up 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.520
 the other 142 out there when we leave 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.890
 want to fly the new maps heli or 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.230
 Somewhat airy is hoping in it 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.480
 we're killed by it and it's weird 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.730
 that he does not shoot so it shoots 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.530
 on the heli but look that meets 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.550
 So completely down and I can 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.790
 do not mind 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.380
 but that's bad that's the heli 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.880
 So press on the ground or stop 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.990
 Side throws depending on where of mine 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.460
 if you hit from the left or 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.510
 If you hit the right one ends up directly 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.740
 on the floor if you are from behind 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.750
 you are hit just wonderful 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.350
 seen would have no one to do something against 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.660
 can 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.150
 The heli just got on the samples 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.530
 pressed as if the provider canal 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.020
 He was simply pressed to the ground 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.640
 and just exploded because of that 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.140
 shut chemistry values against which no one 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.150
 and that's just not possible 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.000
 clearly because these are just mini balls 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.610
 fly again and it can be so quiet 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.970
 Do a little more harm to one 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.740
 mediation eels cannon 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.000
 but that is one way and pushes away 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.700
 everything you saw live event 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.770
 that also hits the soldiers themselves 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.350
 behind apparently and not exactly 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.620
 little still has 20 percent live after 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.080
 a hit portal tank who long silently 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.990
 unfortunately you saw that 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.720
 he does not care about me 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.710
 ok now you are allowed myself to my god he 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.330
 was not at all under 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.180
 control so now are on the server 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.770
 in the year 15 people on it no idea 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.139
 all killed are now the same 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.690
 over I have now so I say 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:39.300
 that was my first round on the new one 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:43.560
 my stand like map operation skin and 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.560
 maybe you can smb leaping up 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:50.949
 I sports it would be cool 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:52.270
 ok in any case the next few days 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:55.360
 we will be one or the other 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.380
 play here and us again 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.630
 look a little closer 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.880
 if you liked it and you guys 

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.320
 on fine then joy then let it 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.860
 just a rating because that would me 

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.979
 very pleased 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.419
 I say goodbye now and say to 

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:10.110
 to the next the people until then here 

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:10.110
 see you again tomorrow
