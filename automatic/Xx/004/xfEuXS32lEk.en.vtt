00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.860 
going to just close that now usually
the<00:04:26.470> front<00:04:26.800> door<00:04:27.040> would<00:04:27.250> open<00:04:27.280> up<00:04:27.580> first<00:04:27.880> but

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
the front door would open up first but

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.629 
the front door would open up first but
that's<00:04:29.080> fine<00:04:29.320> because<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:30.100> hard<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.430> do<00:04:30.610> that

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639
