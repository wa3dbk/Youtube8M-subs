00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
attempting to remake is a mass polymorph

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.709 
attempting to remake is a mass polymorph
deck<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.570> blue<00:00:09.990> black<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:11.509> this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.660> the

deck it is blue black and this is the
deck<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.170> absolutely<00:00:13.530> loved<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.519> M<00:00:14.820> 10

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
deck that I absolutely loved for M 10

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.390 
deck that I absolutely loved for M 10
and<00:00:15.570> then<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.320> short<00:00:16.650> period<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.920> time<00:00:17.010> where

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
and then that short period of time where

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.939 
and then that short period of time where
M<00:00:17.520> 10<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> m11<00:00:18.240> were<00:00:18.720> both<00:00:19.439> standing<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
M 10 and m11 were both standing you

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.650 
M 10 and m11 were both standing you
could<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.189> both<00:00:20.369> masts<00:00:20.850> polymorph<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.539> on

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
could have both masts polymorph and on

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.259 
could have both masts polymorph and on
or<00:00:21.810> polymorph<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:23.160> I'm<00:00:23.490> trying<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.939> bring<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
or polymorph but I'm trying to bring it

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.060 
or polymorph but I'm trying to bring it
back<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.990> at<00:00:25.109> least<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.470> me<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> want<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> bring

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
back or at least for me I want to bring

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.070 
back or at least for me I want to bring
it<00:00:26.160> back<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.789> love<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.750> idea<00:00:28.019> of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it back because I love the idea of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.689 
it back because I love the idea of
getting<00:00:28.289> multiple<00:00:28.830> creatures<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.400> without

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
getting multiple creatures out without

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.980 
getting multiple creatures out without
having<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> pay<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.150> cost<00:00:30.510> at<00:00:30.689> all

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
having to pay the cost at all

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.490 
having to pay the cost at all
so<00:00:32.210> main<00:00:33.210> backbone<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.930> deck<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> math

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
so main backbone of this deck is math

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.020 
so main backbone of this deck is math
polymorph<00:00:35.040> that's<00:00:35.460> your<00:00:35.670> bread<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.880> butter

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
polymorph that's your bread and butter

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.979 
polymorph that's your bread and butter
and<00:00:36.870> then<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.239> three<00:00:39.540> fatties

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and then I like to have three fatties

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.000 
and then I like to have three fatties
the<00:00:40.770> first<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.399> being<00:00:41.700> amrok<00:00:42.059> ooh<00:00:42.620> he's<00:00:43.620> just

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the first one being amrok ooh he's just

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.090 
the first one being amrok ooh he's just
you<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.300> say<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.570> win<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.559> bottom<00:00:46.920> I

gained<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.829> you're<00:00:53.820> killing<00:00:54.180> six<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.629> their

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
gained and you're killing six of their

everything every time you attack with

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.240 
everything every time you attack with
him<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.730> pretty<00:01:00.000> sweet<00:01:00.440> another<00:01:01.440> card<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
time you're playing Mass polymorph on

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.740 
time you're playing Mass polymorph on
turn<00:01:21.119> six<00:01:21.570> you're<00:01:22.560> able<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.830> figure<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.970> what

that<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> use<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.140> storm<00:01:31.500> tide

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that I like to use is storm tide

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
that I like to use is storm tide
Leviathan<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:33.479> puts<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> board<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
Leviathan a just puts the board on the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.450 
Leviathan a just puts the board on the
stand<00:01:34.500> still<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> better

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
stand still with you at a better

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.890 
stand still with you at a better
position<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.240> you're<00:01:36.390> still<00:01:36.600> able<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
position because you're still able to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.830 
position because you're still able to
attack<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.909> any<00:01:38.909> creatures<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.450> flying<00:01:39.479> an

attack with any creatures with flying an

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.179 
attack with any creatures with flying an
island<00:01:40.140> walk<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> those<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:43.950> three

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
island walk and so those are my three

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.670 
island walk and so those are my three
fatties<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.390> are<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.409> game

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
fatties that that are the the game

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.749 
fatties that that are the the game
winners<00:01:48.590> now<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:50.009> mirrored<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.490> besieged

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
winners now with mirrored and besieged

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.069 
winners now with mirrored and besieged
coming<00:01:51.180> outs<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.320> couple<00:01:53.130> new<00:01:53.930> cards<00:01:54.930> with

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
coming outs and a couple new cards with

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.539 
coming outs and a couple new cards with
a<00:01:55.110> new<00:01:55.290> game<00:01:55.470> mechanic<00:01:56.009> came<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.310> which

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
a new game mechanic came out which

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.880 
a new game mechanic came out which
really<00:01:57.360> helps<00:01:57.750> math<00:01:57.990> polymorph<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> that's

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580

to take one of their guys it's a for

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.160 
to take one of their guys it's a for

more fuel for math poly more and since

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.130 
more fuel for math poly more and since
Matt's<00:03:21.500> polymorph<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.840> entire<00:03:23.840> reason

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
Matt's polymorph is the entire reason

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.009 
Matt's polymorph is the entire reason

for this deck having four of them in 60
card<00:03:27.230> deck<00:03:27.440> seems<00:03:28.100> kind<00:03:28.550> of<00:03:28.610> low<00:03:28.820> so<00:03:29.600> having<00:03:30.050> a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
card deck seems kind of low so having a

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.250 
card deck seems kind of low so having a
couple<00:03:30.530> diabolic<00:03:31.040> tutors<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.670> pretty<00:03:32.390> pretty

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
couple diabolic tutors is pretty pretty

couple diabolic tutors is pretty pretty
good<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.450> main<00:03:35.930> reason<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.290> wanted<00:03:36.530> to

put black into it unless you search for

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.910 
put black into it unless you search for
mass<00:03:39.440> polymorph<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:42.140> just<00:03:42.620> makes<00:03:42.800> the

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
mass polymorph and it just makes the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.520 
mass polymorph and it just makes the
deck<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.130> lot<00:03:43.459> more<00:03:43.700> consistent<00:03:44.360> another<00:03:45.290> way
