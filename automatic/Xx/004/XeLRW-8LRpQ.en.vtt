00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.230
 thermaltake play even easier 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.420
 Hi all, Swami techno-kitchen again 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.820
 I don't seem to be sure 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.260
 the most expensive and the most unusual and the most 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.110
 Gasparyana what is in Russia 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.640
 This is Lake Baikal and those in the kitchen are lucky 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.980
 that she lives next to this great 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.500
 the lake drinks clean water and charges 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.390
 clean energy and we are doubly pleased that 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.910
 Russian series thermaltake company 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.950
 finished with baikal eldest 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.570
 one and a half thousand watts of power 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.880
 practical limit for modern 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.969
 dai power supplies for computers 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.140
 most servers say frankly 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.149
 fifteen hundred watts of power 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.519
 outrageous for a simple man in the street for 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.960
 just enough kilowatt nick like 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.570
 premium block exact option 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.579
 the model turned out to be slightly noisy from 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.890
 otherwise we would advise and 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.410
 install fast cars on the principle 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.199
 bought for life enough areas 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.120
 applications probably 2 1 is a maximalist 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.220
 who wishes to collect any iron 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.190
 200 mother days plus one hundred twenty eight 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.190
 gigabytes of memory + 2 2 types of video card 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.920
 + 16 hard drives and several drives 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.320
 also pump fans reobas and winds and 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.520
 other denizens of bliss computer and when 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.140
 this is another condition 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.710
 if the system is not going to 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.390
 work in the bedroom case 2 let's say 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.640
 you have a server room with not much 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.450
 good airing load baht 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.420
 five hundred seven hundred 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.460
 but the usual power units of 750 1000 watts 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.680
 do knot and heat 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.380
 especially in summer and from the fact that the load 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.110
 around the clock let's say a game server and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.850
 or server enterprise with calculations here 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.189
 then one and a half kilowatt does not show 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.700
 working even year-round and 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.560
 hourly power unit baikal him 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.750
 because it functions half 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.570
 load that is simply resting a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
 fan him hehe but they're noisy like 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.890
 just the same and so with tangible margin 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.960
 give heated air out before 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 We are walking the flagship line, but if 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.369
 compare with the other one and a half kilowatts 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.800
 nicknames it is rather a budget model in it 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.260
 although the Japanese capacitors gold efficiency 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.120
 but the components and circuitry are chosen 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.549
 so to give a half thousand in 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.470
 but for power reserve and no extra 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.629
 some buns like this 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.660
 samples from seasonic or enermax 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.140
 but at the same time, the model costs from 18000 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.420
 they are 25 thousand rubles as competitors 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.489
 filling n.h. very strong middle 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.590
 among OEM manufacturers of power supplies 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.870
 according to the model there is a twin brother 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.019
 forces a stone with a type and a half thousand 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.060
 a man moaning bad doesn't do business 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.069
 visible and again honest 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.530
 many users have been a bit 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.930
 Dissatisfied with the strength in the table since the company 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.299
 moved away from their premium meat so with your hands 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.010
 for withdrawing from premium and were surprised by the presence 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.250
 only 4 sky capacitors 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.359
 capacity is only 270 microfarads with voltage 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.120
 450 volts 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.290
 they are parallel 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.260
 therefore it is capaciously folded and 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.660
 makes the 1080 microfarad cost people 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.690
 archeology brought up to us is necessary on 2 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.130
 berating larger capacity and a simple circuit 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.420
 which is barely enough to 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.389
 meet the gold standard 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.950
 efficiency and in this criticism has its own truth 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.260
 probably the most powerful products again 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120
 be luxury 5 them if u take yes 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.090
 only maximalists they are not money 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.550
 consider that's why 850 watts Moscow 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.950
 It seems more elite model them or something and 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.500
 senior representative baikal gone if 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.599
 not state employees inheritance if 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.760
 compare with the same Moscow we remember 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.370
 they called the block very quiet here, but what 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.620
 Moscow has the same Baikal 14 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.810
 a little fan but it works on 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.390
 different speeds and that's if Moscow is not 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.459
 You can hear that Baikal is already simple, clearly 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.130
 hears at night and hear a little by day 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.410
 Loud model can not be called but quiet 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.310
 also colleagues agree with us 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.870
 and whip and see the graphs of their comparisons 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.760
 Baikal he for those users who 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.410
 even glad that there is no complete silence 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.620
 after all, in their opinion, the technique should 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.349
 work and good airflow and purge bail 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.450
 successful long-term work from this point 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.190
 of Baikal vouchsafe our hope 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.549
 installed in the power supply and 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.410
 manufacturing capacitors not jamicon 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.019
 high voltage this con low voltage 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.570
 liquid electrolyte as well as large 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.669
 the amount of polymer capacitors here 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.690
 if the Japanese nippon is flawless then 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.090
 japanese sneaking 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.919
 have an average user rating but 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.919
 the benefit of this capacitor was trusted day 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.360
 the main damage all hope that a half 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.789
 thousands of watts around the clock during 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.979
 few years these power supplies nobody 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.840
 will not test however 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.039
 confirm that even on excessive 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.169
 all line loads 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.389
 whether the issuance of power and a half thousand baht 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.760
 Baikal copes with the tests 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.669
 most often deviations from the norm are not higher 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.500
 two percent bravo enhance succeeded when 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.630
 simple scheme with not the most top 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.460
 to make candy 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.130
 we won't talk much 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.540
 let's say that the long is redundant and you donâ€™t 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.820
 enough for any buildings 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.800
 words which is very convenient for assembly 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.570
 all supplied systems where are the cables 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.300
 practically do not interfere with the air flow 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.880
 before the processor on the mother can be powered 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.520
 as well as any number of video cards and 16 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.700
 winchesters have 80 x that too 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.310
 enough and the flop is not forgotten all that 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.740
 need to remember about the length of the power supply 22 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.020
 centimeter though for smaller cases 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.210
 Brezhnev somebody buy well this what 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.460
 baikal as model actor table has 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.580
 non-standard network cable connector 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.010
 why this is done we do not know our 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.680
 look meaningless and it is 2 minutes after 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.110
 not absolutely quiet work simple so what 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.180
 you say power supply considering low 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.530
 the price for this is bronze but by my doctor 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.390
 Dress Well, let's go 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.390
 and you had an arina folder for now
