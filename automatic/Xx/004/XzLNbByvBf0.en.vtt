so<00:00:52.320> um<00:00:53.330> this<00:00:54.330> is<00:00:54.540> my<00:00:54.690> other<00:00:54.960> eye<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.650> that's<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so um this is my other eye so that's the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.390 
so um this is my other eye so that's the
one<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.670> no<00:00:56.880> lashes<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> one

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
one with no lashes and that's the one

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.100 
one with no lashes and that's the one
with<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.610> lashes<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:01.020> took<00:01:01.380> me

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
with the lashes this actually took me

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.410 
with the lashes this actually took me
too<00:01:04.110> long<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.710> 30<00:01:04.890> minutes<00:01:04.980> and<00:01:08.300> so<00:01:09.300> I'm

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
too long for like 30 minutes and so I'm

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.030 
too long for like 30 minutes and so I'm
not<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> explain<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
not really going to explain this but I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.060 
not really going to explain this but I
get<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> eyelash<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.320> tweezers<00:01:13.820> like<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
get the eyelash on tweezers like this

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.790 
get the eyelash on tweezers like this
then<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> dip<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.520> gloom<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.470> then<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.560> blow

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
then I dip in the gloom and then I blow

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.510 
then I dip in the gloom and then I blow
dry<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> glue<00:01:20.910> dries<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.420> faster

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
dry it so the glue dries a little faster

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.520 
dry it so the glue dries a little faster
for<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.640> 10<00:01:24.509> seconds<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.160> just<00:01:26.220> put

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
for like 10 seconds and then I just put

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.249 
for like 10 seconds and then I just put
the<00:01:28.530> rim<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.550> stick<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.259> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the rim and I just stick it on there and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.480 
the rim and I just stick it on there and
um<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.250> try<00:01:32.910> to<00:01:32.940> put<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.270> underneath<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
