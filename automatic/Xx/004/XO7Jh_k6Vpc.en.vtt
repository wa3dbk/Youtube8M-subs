00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 There we have 1 moody's wand 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.000
 i wanted to say all magic wand though 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.740
 So he has the actor 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.110
 But then carries a new rod but of it 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.019
 i know his iphone is newer 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.210
 replaced at user bellatrix la luna 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.609
 because his was lost 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.439
 relatively short with 27 to one with 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.510
 my favorite stebe was easy too 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.699
 But it is relatively easy 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.260
 still not the handle nicely and the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.300
 is also very good in the hand there 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.949
 is was relatively short but rather than 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.270
 hard enough until thick and the pressure 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.469
 rod and loves just in the grip here 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.690
 Maybe you can see it already 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.340
 bit her there the bright he comes into 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.309
 Business metal from the metal bars through 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.390
 every time I slate now 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.399
 had government hand arises here 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.920
 a sofa corner I slipped or 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.170
 somewhere on black paint completely 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.780
 I've always seen the muji 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.960
 the old died the new rod i ask 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.760
 not the old one, though 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 in addition to the new then put in comparison 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 which new is the mister 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.790
 is a relatively short work of the new 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.159
 season is really powerful there is 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.650
 damned over ten inches longer 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.180
 thick damn hard 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.220
 And in contrast to this one not here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.939
 especially suitable for a fight because 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.590
 It's a salami or what do I know 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.240
 There was no hand in hand 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.290
 tim wild or loaded i would have been 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.790
 not it is likely you can do that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.790
 He again in detail show 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.509
 but the man who has just one of 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.790
 which probably suitable for carrying around 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.220
 is these different dark and 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.689
 has bright gray tones and thereby falls 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.280
 just not directly on the mat only 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.509
 often with around and then again time 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.979
 a little bit the color 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.039
 so it looks good and also for 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.229
 the suitable and to wear 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.710
 And even if they are under all 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.119
 event action I almost do not think so 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.130
 if all knits always hold the chance 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.390
 to those with red velvet from covered 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:15.610
 house is designed covered discovered and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.610
 has red golden books
