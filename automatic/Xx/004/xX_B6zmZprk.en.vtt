00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:17.469 
through step by step how to get that off
so<00:01:15.329> let's<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.659> ahead<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> get<00:01:16.350> started

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
so let's go ahead and get started

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.819 
so let's go ahead and get started

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
example or slip joint pliers I'll get it

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.130 
example or slip joint pliers I'll get it
off<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:08.940> filters<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.479> place<00:02:09.509> when<00:02:09.959> we're<00:02:10.080> on

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
off with filters in place when we're on

the word Beaufort honey

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.010 
the word Beaufort honey
now<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.850> looks<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.180> those<00:02:15.330> already<00:02:15.780> drained

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
now it looks like those already drained

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.650 
now it looks like those already drained
out<00:02:16.260> well<00:02:16.860> once<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.520> remove<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.910> sensor<00:02:18.630> is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
out well once we remove that sensor is

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.540 
out well once we remove that sensor is
actually<00:02:19.080> going<00:02:19.230> draw<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.770> he<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.280> actually

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
actually going draw is he on actually

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.800 
actually going draw is he on actually
have<00:02:20.640> more<00:02:20.820> fuel<00:02:20.940> come<00:02:21.180> out<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:21.540> go<00:02:21.690> ahead

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
have more fuel come out so we go ahead

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.120 
have more fuel come out so we go ahead
and<00:02:21.900> tighten<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:24.770> move<00:02:25.770> on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
and tighten it up move on

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
and tighten it up move on
taking<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.780> filter<00:02:29.150> water<00:02:30.150> fuel<00:02:30.660> center<00:02:31.020> off

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.259 

it<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.810> plastic<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.830> don't<00:02:36.040> over<00:02:36.670> squeeze<00:02:37.000> or

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
it is plastic so don't over squeeze or

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.229 
it is plastic so don't over squeeze or
over-tighten<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.340> has<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.640> home<00:02:39.849> seal

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
over-tighten and it has this home seal

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.030 
over-tighten and it has this home seal
that<00:02:40.750> still<00:02:41.140> actually<00:02:41.349> comes<00:02:41.739> with<00:02:41.920> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
that still actually comes with the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.040 
that still actually comes with the
filter<00:02:42.400> as<00:02:42.519> well

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.720 

all<00:02:49.560> right<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.160> actually<00:02:50.460> didn't<00:02:50.610> have

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
all right this one actually didn't have

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.340 
all right this one actually didn't have

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
too much come out afterwards but here we

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.410 
too much come out afterwards but here we
go

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
go

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.930 
go
now<00:02:54.420> we<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.070> metal<00:02:56.070> canister<00:02:56.550> oh<00:02:56.640> I

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
now we get the metal canister oh I

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.540 
now we get the metal canister oh I
actually<00:02:57.750> use<00:02:58.140> an<00:02:58.350> old-style<00:02:58.770> old<00:02:59.220> filter

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
actually use an old-style old filter

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
on this to tell you what the diameter is

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.430 
on this to tell you what the diameter is
put<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:06.330> probably<00:03:06.870> when<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.140> buy<00:03:07.290> your

put you probably when you buy your
filter<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.550> can<00:03:08.940> go<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.060> your<00:03:09.180> local<00:03:09.270> parts

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
filter you can go to your local parts

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.120 
filter you can go to your local parts
store<00:03:09.750> or<00:03:10.020> kind<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.320> match<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.680> up<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.860> what

will<00:03:11.280> fit<00:03:11.660> if<00:03:12.660> we<00:03:12.780> tighten<00:03:12.960> down<00:03:13.080> these<00:03:13.380> going

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
will fit if we tighten down these going

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.500 
will fit if we tighten down these going
to<00:03:13.650> be<00:03:13.740> really<00:03:14.400> tight<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.270> take<00:03:15.480> your

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
to be really tight so just take your

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.760 
to be really tight so just take your
time<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.810> plants<00:03:19.170> gonna<00:03:19.320> fit<00:03:19.500> around<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
time and you plants gonna fit around the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.660 
time and you plants gonna fit around the
bottom<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.220> online<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:23.070> starts<00:03:23.460> spinning

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
bottom and online it starts spinning

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:32.630 
bottom and online it starts spinning
counterclockwise<00:03:31.040> now<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.100> go<00:03:32.280> get<00:03:32.460> more

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
counterclockwise now you go get more

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.190 
counterclockwise now you go get more
fuel<00:03:32.910> coming<00:03:33.150> out<00:03:33.330> again<00:03:33.600> just<00:03:33.870> go<00:03:33.990> ahead<00:03:34.050> and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
fuel coming out again just go ahead and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:50.559 
fuel coming out again just go ahead and
let<00:03:34.260> some<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.620> drain

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.110 

say<00:03:51.050> we<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.319> go<00:03:51.440> ahead<00:03:51.730> are<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.760> going<00:03:53.060> to

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
say we can go ahead are you going to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.869 
say we can go ahead are you going to
live<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.629> loop<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.200> o-ring<00:03:55.190> on<00:03:55.340> my<00:03:55.459> filter

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
live and loop on the o-ring on my filter

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.740 
live and loop on the o-ring on my filter
so<00:03:56.599> we<00:03:56.720> go<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.930> install<00:03:57.319> it<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:59.060> got<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.390> get<00:03:59.720> a

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
two fuel filters it's actually going to

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.720 
two fuel filters it's actually going to
be<00:05:35.170> a<00:05:35.200> display<00:05:35.890> on<00:05:36.130> your<00:05:36.340> instrument<00:05:36.700> cluster

message when it is due to be changed so

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.760 
message when it is due to be changed so
we<00:05:42.160> would<00:05:42.400> to<00:05:42.610> make<00:05:42.760> sure<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.030> reset<00:05:43.570> that<00:05:43.780> once

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
we would to make sure to reset that once

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.820 
we would to make sure to reset that once
we<00:05:44.890> get<00:05:44.980> back<00:05:45.460> on<00:05:45.640> the<00:05:45.730> ground<00:05:46.590> that<00:05:47.590> means

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
we get back on the ground that means

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.200 
we get back on the ground that means
also<00:05:48.040> at<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.310> same<00:05:48.400> time<00:05:48.460> you'll<00:05:48.820> be<00:05:48.940> doing

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
also at the same time you'll be doing

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.720 
also at the same time you'll be doing
both<00:05:49.480> filters<00:05:49.960> check<00:05:50.770> out<00:05:50.920> my<00:05:51.040> video<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.400> showed

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
both filters check out my video I showed

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.450 
both filters check out my video I showed
previously<00:05:52.570> that<00:05:53.170> has<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.590> fuel<00:05:53.920> filter<00:05:54.250> on

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
previously that has the fuel filter on

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.830 
previously that has the fuel filter on
the<00:05:54.700> front<00:05:54.730> being<00:05:55.270> replaced

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
the front being replaced

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.650 
the front being replaced
so<00:05:56.650> with<00:05:56.950> that<00:05:57.220> along<00:05:57.670> with<00:05:57.730> this<00:05:58.210> rear<00:05:58.450> one

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
so with that along with this rear one

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.500 
so with that along with this rear one
you'll<00:05:58.900> have<00:05:59.080> both<00:05:59.320> of<00:05:59.350> them<00:05:59.590> knocked<00:05:59.800> out

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
you'll have both of them knocked out

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.340 
you'll have both of them knocked out
doesn't<00:06:01.510> take<00:06:01.660> much<00:06:01.870> time<00:06:03.060> anybody<00:06:04.060> can<00:06:04.180> do<00:06:04.270> it

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
doesn't take much time anybody can do it

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.070 
doesn't take much time anybody can do it
and<00:06:05.350> when<00:06:05.470> you<00:06:05.560> go<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.710> crank<00:06:06.010> it<00:06:06.130> up<00:06:06.420> the<00:06:07.420> video

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
and when you go to crank it up the video

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.660 
and when you go to crank it up the video
I<00:06:08.110> showed<00:06:08.410> on<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.650> front<00:06:08.890> fuel<00:06:09.070> filters<00:06:09.400> I

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
I showed on the front fuel filters I

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.020 
I showed on the front fuel filters I
mentioned<00:06:10.480> that<00:06:10.600> it<00:06:10.930> may<00:06:11.170> take<00:06:11.440> a<00:06:11.470> few

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
mentioned that it may take a few

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.670 
mentioned that it may take a few
spinning<00:06:13.030> over<00:06:13.150> cycles<00:06:13.660> cool<00:06:13.870> finally<00:06:14.260> fills

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
spinning over cycles cool finally fills

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.950 
spinning over cycles cool finally fills

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
up both the rear filter and the front

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.110 
up both the rear filter and the front
filter<00:06:17.440> and<00:06:17.650> gets<00:06:18.430> all<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.610> air<00:06:18.790> out<00:06:18.970> of<00:06:19.000> the

filter and gets all the air out of the
system<00:06:19.270> you<00:06:19.720> could<00:06:20.500> be<00:06:20.620> looking<00:06:20.740> at

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
system you could be looking at

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.800 
system you could be looking at
approximately<00:06:22.290> 3/4<00:06:23.760> crank<00:06:24.760> attempts<00:06:25.270> and

approximately 3/4 crank attempts and

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.750 
approximately 3/4 crank attempts and
let's<00:06:26.260> say<00:06:26.410> each<00:06:26.590> crank<00:06:26.950> attempt<00:06:27.280> might<00:06:27.490> last

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
let's say each crank attempt might last

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.910 
let's say each crank attempt might last
about<00:06:28.210> pipe<00:06:28.900> I<00:06:29.080> wouldn't<00:06:29.350> let<00:06:29.410> it<00:06:29.470> last<00:06:29.740> one

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
about pipe I wouldn't let it last one
