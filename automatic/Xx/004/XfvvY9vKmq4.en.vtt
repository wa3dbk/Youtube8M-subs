fish<00:02:24.630> bombs

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.250 

I<00:02:28.310> think<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.120> hit<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.480> tentacles<00:02:30.020> and

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
I think you can hit the tentacles and

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.740 
I think you can hit the tentacles and
get<00:02:30.740> them<00:02:30.950> off

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
get them off

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.350 
get them off
like

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
like

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.550 
like
ah<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:34.290> too<00:02:34.620> slow

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.979 

I'll<00:02:39.830> get<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.250> hang<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.810> you're<00:02:41.810> not

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
I'll get the hang of it you're not

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.860 
I'll get the hang of it you're not
supposed<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.410> get<00:02:42.620> eaten<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.220> much<00:02:43.630> as<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.780> can

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
supposed to get eaten so much as you can

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.630 
supposed to get eaten so much as you can
see<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.170> takes<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.560> hard<00:02:45.800> when<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.130> get<00:02:46.340> eaten

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
see it takes a hard when you get eaten

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.270 
see it takes a hard when you get eaten
so

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
so

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.420 
so
not<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:48.850> good<00:02:49.120> idea

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
not a good idea

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.770 
not a good idea
also<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:51.629> to<00:02:51.810> have

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
also if you want to have

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.340 
also if you want to have
chance<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.560> grabbing<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.220> stupid<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:55.350> you

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
chance of grabbing that stupid I you

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.220 
chance of grabbing that stupid I you
better<00:02:56.560> clear<00:02:56.950> out<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.400> fish<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> little<00:02:57.970> bit

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
better clear out the fish a little bit
