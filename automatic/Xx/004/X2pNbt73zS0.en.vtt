jack our power key and our home ki minus
key<00:02:39.310> yes<00:02:41.340> today<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:43.510> let's<00:02:43.660> push<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:44.200> some

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
key yes today so let's push it in some

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.819 
key yes today so let's push it in some
short<00:02:45.070> compression<00:02:45.489> against<00:02:45.790> no<00:02:45.970> kin<00:02:46.120> it

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
short compression against no kin it

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.750 
short compression against no kin it
let's<00:02:47.829> check<00:02:48.810> speaker<00:02:49.810> output<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.519> this

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
let's check speaker output so this

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.759 
let's check speaker output so this
theater<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:55.049> comparison<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.380> nothing

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
theater and comparison so nothing

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.550 
theater and comparison so nothing
tactile<00:02:57.280> against<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.190> let's<00:03:00.519> play<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.600> it

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
tactile against it so let's play on it

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:20.680 
tactile against it so let's play on it
first

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:39.700 

and<00:03:21.690> then<00:03:22.129> seven

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.060 

so<00:03:40.710> there's<00:03:41.550> nothing<00:03:41.730> big<00:03:42.090> difference<00:03:42.720> on

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
so there's nothing big difference on

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.500 
so there's nothing big difference on
against<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:45.050> speaker<00:03:46.050> output<00:03:46.560> but<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.790> x7

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
against the speaker output but on the x7

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.140 
against the speaker output but on the x7
you<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.080> say<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.710> output<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.400> more

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
you can say that the output is more

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.730 
you can say that the output is more
spread<00:03:51.540> because<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.960> the<00:03:52.080> two<00:03:52.380> speakers

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
spread because of the two speakers

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.030 
spread because of the two speakers
output<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:53.760> still<00:03:54.510> depend<00:03:55.350> on<00:03:55.620> your<00:03:55.800> choice

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
output but still depend on your choice

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.930 
output but still depend on your choice
