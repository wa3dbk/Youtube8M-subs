00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.250
 miguel angel russo the rosario technician 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.839
 central talking to the press his 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.570
 last year's story that they were denied 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.629
 another opinion with expectation some 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.860
 guys have settled down we are seeing 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.889
 we are happy what we have achieved 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.950
 because we know and we know the time before 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.620
 that is not easy 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.390
 in a very delicate club moment I 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.570
 I am also very happy as it does not arrive 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.550
 to see does not have to get to the clubs 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.940
 when they are very bad or when they are well 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.110
 is not good is something that decided me to 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.110
 come and nothing else ready 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 I'm glad Javier has worked hard 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.170
 he has fought a lot 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.890
 the objectives good the man falls if 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.410
 instead of lifting 101 is the reality 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.560
 what is the message of what happened in 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.830
 these three years now now consummated 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.890
 this is central I did not say it when I arrived 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.290
 I did not say this is central to the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.940
 last and in the last weeks 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.640
 we chatted a lot, we know a lot, 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.980
 about the anxiety that had to be given 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.170
 time now time is already this was 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.820
 the day this was the opportune moment how 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.640
 it takes and not depend on anyone 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.880
 we ourselves thank the people who 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.420
 wine 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.369
 that does not have a court in a way 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.020
 awesome and good you have to follow 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.020
 Now you have to enjoy and follow 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.090
 this third rise for you 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.090
 to the room 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.720
 rice 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.030
 I do not want to see much time in the week 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.090
 a very big responsibility because 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.380
 When the club arrived, it was not good 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.380
 we have worked hard 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.530
 my son has once again had the joy of seeing 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.180
 to central at first is difficult too 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.010
 why 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.710
 a struggle to be a dad and not like 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.830
 trainer coach is another good thing 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.810
 we have been accommodating and a title 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.810
 special is a special achievement 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.640
 luckily I had a lot but good in 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.140
 this 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.319
 I think it has not been strengthened 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.230
 we have gone through difficult times not so much 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.330
 I neither the teacher nor there was with respect to 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.720
 group no 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.540
 and he responded a brilliant way that 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 has to be remembered for many things not 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.140
 for mainly because to calm down 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.810
 this club 4 date you deum 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.300
 the completion of a tournament is like the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.010
 big teams big clubs spend 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.630
 from one category to another miguel him 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.340
 they have taken out miguel they have taken a 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.680
 backpack those that some case of 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.500
 campus were still with that account 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.960
 pending descent 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.120
 in the fourth of which I play in the fourth 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.530
 but about all the objectives in the tec 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.410
 the good thing now we will go in search of more 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.090
 things that you said difficult that we repeat 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.950
 a campaign like the previous one is 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.620
 near the super anonymous I imagined 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.510
 when you arrived now I knew that I was going to 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.510
 be difficult or look what 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.120
 normally all the teams will 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.610
 it costs to reach that number not so 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.180
 Well, we'll look how you saw the wardrobe 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.819
 now well 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.819
 is going to stay came drawn
