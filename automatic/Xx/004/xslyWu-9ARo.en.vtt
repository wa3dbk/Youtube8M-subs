00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 let's not forget that the captain don he 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.149
 saved life to carol 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.250
 I just remembered that he is a spy 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.200
 alien and we just said that his 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.610
 people want to destroy our planet 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.710
 deaf observes and responds to situations 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.690
 related to any presence 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.610
 alien the avengers said 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.910
 that was going to help us and that's how 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910
 you do 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.309
 for what they did they write it great with 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.309
 We will be waiting for all your strength 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 we left the influence 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.790
 gravitational mercury and we 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.979
 we approach the sun the shields resist 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.540
 commander with voice at this distance the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.670
 solar wind incinerate any 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.070
 ship that could come from the earth and is 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.960
 very bright thank you update the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.909
 blog we come to the anomaly and 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.530
 we will start the investigation 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.560
 there is no energy from a wormhole 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.030
 but it is not active it is as if the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.899
 hole was open from the other side 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.479
 but not from this and that is possible not what 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.640
 I've consulted with scientists from the earth 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.789
 but communication so close to the sun 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.469
 It is difficult not to mention the delay 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.799
 signal takes 8 minutes to reach the 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.799
 land 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.210
 they came nose 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.250
 the big one is a warship that 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.140
 sends a message to the command center that 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.180
 are the guests one found whites 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.180
 hostile and is about to face them 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.200
 I just hope we endure the 8 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.530
 minutes it takes for the message to reach 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.530
 they 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.209
 can do nine minutes we're going in 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.209
 path
