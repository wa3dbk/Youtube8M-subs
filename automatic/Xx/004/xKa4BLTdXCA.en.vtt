00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.960
 it's sinbad captive bred 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:12.240
 representative super feline 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.870
 no lion and nothing ligger weighing 408 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.389
 kilograms 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 Sinbad is almost 100 times more than home 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.109
 cats and twice as heavy as a lion or 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.910
 tetra 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:29.369
 Dr. Bhagavan on the raised sinbad 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.140
 this bengal tiger weighs 226 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.899
 kilograms adult male 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.579
 he has a big head wide bones but 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.210
 he seems dwarf next to it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.800
 whether a huge gram of his head is almost two 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.260
 times bigger than the head of the Bengal tiger 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.820
 between the crown of the nose is so big 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.250
 the distance is huge 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.739
 design width of these huge jaws 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.039
 and wide bones makes it serious 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.710
 opponent good boy this leader 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 bred artificially 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:05.400
 they do not exist in the wild if 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.979
 the result of crossing a lion and a tigress in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.590
 the result was an incredibly large 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.570
 hybrid 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.240
 the size and weight of the parent game looks 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.160
 near him dwarfs 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.630
 only massive skull league by 40 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.610
 percent more lion or tiger skull 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.150
 them massive wide bones and they 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.920
 huge size of steam and lion together 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.680
 taken by scientists trying to understand why 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.690
 hybrids like ligro on a card so much 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.310
 more than their parents already know what 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.100
 ligers have no gene 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.070
 oppressive growth thanks to which they 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.560
 could be the usual size they live 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.540
 only in captivity but the degree of their development 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.540
 body has no equal in drive 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 remember sasha jumping tiger who 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.760
 took out prey at the height of three and a half 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.710
 meters sinbad can get item on 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.710
 the same height without taking off the ground
