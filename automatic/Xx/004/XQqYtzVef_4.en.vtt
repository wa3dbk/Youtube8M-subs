00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
here and feel for any grooves and if

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.290 
here and feel for any grooves and if
there's<00:02:24.770> any<00:02:24.920> grooves<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.820> it's<00:02:26.000> gonna<00:02:26.120> be

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
there's any grooves and it's gonna be

there<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:31.340> clutch<00:02:31.700> might<00:02:32.060> be<00:02:32.240> about<00:02:32.480> used

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
there so this clutch might be about used

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.660 
there so this clutch might be about used
up<00:02:33.110> but<00:02:33.380> we'll<00:02:33.500> throw<00:02:33.709> another<00:02:33.920> belt<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.490> it

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
up but we'll throw another belt on it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.490 
up but we'll throw another belt on it
see<00:02:34.850> how<00:02:34.940> long<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.330> last<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.900> last<00:02:36.140> belt

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
see how long it last this last belt

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.120 
see how long it last this last belt
lasted<00:02:38.020> about<00:02:40.900> three<00:02:41.900> or<00:02:42.050> four<00:02:42.260> years<00:02:42.590> but<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
lasted about three or four years but you

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.600 
lasted about three or four years but you
can<00:02:43.280> see<00:02:43.430> it's<00:02:43.580> starting<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.940> delaminate<00:02:45.610> come

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
can see it's starting to delaminate come

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.830 
can see it's starting to delaminate come
apart<00:02:48.400> hold<00:02:49.400> them<00:02:49.580> up<00:02:49.730> side<00:02:50.000> by<00:02:50.240> side<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.750> you

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
apart hold them up side by side and you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.970 
apart hold them up side by side and you
actually<00:02:51.019> see<00:02:51.410> yeah<00:02:53.410> there<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.560> actually

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
actually see yeah there is actually

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.740 
actually see yeah there is actually
almost<00:02:55.130> was<00:02:55.730> about<00:02:56.000> an<00:02:56.090> eighth<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.330> an<00:02:56.630> inch

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
almost was about an eighth of an inch

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.740 
almost was about an eighth of an inch
difference<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.640> can<00:02:58.940> see<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.420> belt

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
difference so you can see that a belt

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.210 
difference so you can see that a belt
slowly<00:03:00.019> burns<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> mean<00:03:00.800> that<00:03:00.950> that

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
slowly burns up and I mean that that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.340 
slowly burns up and I mean that that
eighth<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.640> an<00:03:01.760> inch<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.840> difference

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
eighth of an inch is the difference

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.800 
eighth of an inch is the difference
between<00:03:03.410> grabbing<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.459> sliding<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.570> look

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
between grabbing and sliding you look

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.229 
between grabbing and sliding you look
could<00:03:06.019> start<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.320> dry<00:03:06.680> rot<00:03:06.950> in<00:03:07.190> there<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.120> mean

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
could start a dry rot in there so I mean

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.420 
could start a dry rot in there so I mean
it<00:03:08.390> built<00:03:08.600> got<00:03:08.810> used<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.380> got<00:03:09.709> used<00:03:09.950> up<00:03:10.130> as<00:03:10.310> it

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
it built got used it got used up as it

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.600 
it built got used it got used up as it
should<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.050> put<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.260> new<00:03:12.410> belt<00:03:12.650> pretty<00:03:13.400> much

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
should so put in a new belt pretty much

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.310 
should so put in a new belt pretty much
repeat<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.180> process<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.720> want<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.930> go<00:03:15.050> around

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
repeat the process you want to go around

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.150 
repeat the process you want to go around
that<00:03:16.330> now<00:03:17.330> this<00:03:17.480> belt<00:03:17.750> will<00:03:18.040> probably<00:03:19.040> be<00:03:19.130> a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
that now this belt will probably be a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.890 
that now this belt will probably be a
little<00:03:19.370> bit<00:03:19.519> harder<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.850> go<00:03:20.030> on<00:03:20.180> but<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.420> stick

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
little bit harder to go on but you stick

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.140 
little bit harder to go on but you stick
it<00:03:21.019> on<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.410> rotate<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.010> around<00:03:22.130> until<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:22.940> pops

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
it on and rotate it around until it pops

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.810 
it on and rotate it around until it pops
in<00:03:23.950> done<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:26.690> easy<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.340> lot<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.700> guys

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
in done that easy I know a lot of guys

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.490 
in done that easy I know a lot of guys
like<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.120> remove<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.630> clots<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.290> and

like to remove the clots and this and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.750 
like to remove the clots and this and
that<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.860> mean<00:03:31.010> if<00:03:31.070> you're<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.250> going<00:03:31.580> for

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
gonna do is grease up all the way around

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.300 
gonna do is grease up all the way around
here<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.610> used<00:03:40.850> white<00:03:41.120> lithium<00:03:41.390> last<00:03:41.870> time<00:03:42.310> you

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
here I used white lithium last time you

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.009 
here I used white lithium last time you
could<00:03:43.489> use<00:03:43.670> pretty<00:03:43.970> much<00:03:44.060> anything<00:03:44.480> just<00:03:44.900> a

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
could use pretty much anything just a

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.610 
could use pretty much anything just a
grease<00:03:45.290> if<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:46.070> do<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.250> lot<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.519> mudding<00:03:47.030> and

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
grease if you do a lot of mudding and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.800 
grease if you do a lot of mudding and
water<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:49.730> drive<00:03:50.360> them<00:03:50.480> through<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.660> lot<00:03:50.780> of

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
water you drive them through a lot of

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.390 
water you drive them through a lot of
water<00:03:51.049> you'll<00:03:51.320> want<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.650> grease<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:52.070> just<00:03:52.280> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
water you'll want to grease it just to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.330 
water you'll want to grease it just to
seal<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:53.269> four-wheeler<00:03:54.110> will<00:03:54.500> be<00:03:54.620> next

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
seal it this four-wheeler will be next

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.310 
seal it this four-wheeler will be next
to<00:03:55.430> be<00:03:55.459> snorkelled<00:03:56.150> after<00:03:56.510> we<00:03:56.630> do<00:03:56.750> my<00:03:56.900> big<00:03:57.139> one

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
to be snorkelled after we do my big one

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.650 
to be snorkelled after we do my big one
but<00:03:57.889> for<00:03:58.040> now<00:03:58.160> we<00:03:58.220> just<00:03:58.400> seal<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.030> up<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.540> it

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
but for now we just seal this up and it

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.090 
but for now we just seal this up and it
should<00:03:59.840> be

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
should be

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.280 
should be
if<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.250> do<00:04:01.400> mainly<00:04:01.760> sand<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.720> trails<00:04:03.020> and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
if you do mainly sand and trails and

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.810 
if you do mainly sand and trails and
there's<00:04:03.440> really<00:04:03.620> no<00:04:03.830> need<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.220> seal<00:04:04.490> it<00:04:04.640> any

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
there's really no need to seal it any

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.610 
there's really no need to seal it any
more<00:04:05.060> than<00:04:05.300> what's<00:04:05.600> already<00:04:05.810> on<00:04:06.260> there<00:04:06.500> they

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
more than what's already on there they

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.260 
more than what's already on there they
already<00:04:06.860> seal

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
already seal
