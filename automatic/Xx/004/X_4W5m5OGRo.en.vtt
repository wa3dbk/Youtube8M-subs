00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
ahead and do self install where you can

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.670 
ahead and do self install where you can
actually<00:00:38.940> move<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.270> pot<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.719> yourself<00:00:40.140> using

doing<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> process<00:01:24.890> for<00:01:25.890> this

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
doing right now in the process for this

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429

and as I sits right now when the cranks

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.630 
and as I sits right now when the cranks
come<00:01:28.619> into<00:01:28.829> them<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.130> normally<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> would

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.359 
off the shelf to kind of speed things up
but<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.750> I'll<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.020> when<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.740> right

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
but what I'll do when I get to the right

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.679 
but what I'll do when I get to the right
side<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.790> I'm<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> send<00:01:39.540> them

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
side as I'm actually going to send them

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.569 
side as I'm actually going to send them
back<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> crank<00:01:40.380> set<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> they'll<00:01:41.159> install<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
back a crank set and they'll install it

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.399 
back a crank set and they'll install it
on<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.180> they'll<00:01:42.299> tape<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.869> your

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
on to that but they'll tape it your your

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.260 
on to that but they'll tape it your your
crank<00:01:43.649> arms<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.759> they'll<00:01:44.850> go<00:01:44.970> ahead<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
crank arms in and they'll go ahead and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.870 
crank arms in and they'll go ahead and
they'll<00:01:46.250> validate<00:01:47.250> they'll<00:01:47.430> check<00:01:47.610> them<00:01:47.759> in

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
they'll validate they'll check them in

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.010 
they'll validate they'll check them in
and<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.119> they'll<00:01:48.270> take<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> picture<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> them

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and then they'll take a picture of them

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
and then they'll take a picture of them
as<00:01:49.740> well<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.130> then<00:01:50.280> clean<00:01:50.549> them<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> their

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
as well as then clean them to their

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.969 
as well as then clean them to their
standards<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:52.140> they'll<00:01:52.259> go<00:01:52.380> ahead<00:01:52.470> install

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
standards then they'll go ahead install

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
standards then they'll go ahead install
the<00:01:53.250> unit<00:01:53.490> itself<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.720> now

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the unit itself and then right now

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.910 
the unit itself and then right now
they're<00:01:54.990> doing<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.170> bunch<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> testing<00:01:55.740> around

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
they're doing a bunch of testing around

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
they're doing a bunch of testing around
nasta<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.579> ahead<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.960> actually<00:01:57.960> doing

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
nasta going ahead and actually doing

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
nasta going ahead and actually doing
some<00:01:58.290> pressure<00:01:58.469> testing<00:01:58.920> basically

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
some pressure testing basically

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.870 
some pressure testing basically
simulating

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
simulating

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.749 
simulating
water<00:02:00.810> pressure<00:02:01.140> immersion<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.009> doing<00:02:02.640> what

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
water pressure immersion so doing what

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.280 
water pressure immersion so doing what
is<00:02:02.850> effectively<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.390> under<00:02:03.930> water<00:02:04.079> pressure

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
is effectively a under water pressure

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.620 
is effectively a under water pressure
test<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:04.829> they're<00:02:04.950> doing<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.280> dry<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.600> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
test but they're doing it dry it's a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.850 
test but they're doing it dry it's a
very<00:02:06.810> common<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.200> industry<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.740> that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
very common in industry to do it that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740 
very common in industry to do it that
way<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.970> they're<00:02:09.060> doing<00:02:09.239> some<00:02:09.450> ingress

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
way then they're doing some ingress

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.780 
way then they're doing some ingress
testing<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.259> well<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.129> kind<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.400> similar<00:02:11.640> like

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
testing as well so kind of similar like

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.300 
testing as well so kind of similar like
putting<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.420> shower<00:02:13.140> nozzle<00:02:13.440> on<00:02:13.709> it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
putting a shower nozzle on it

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.410 
putting a shower nozzle on it
and<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:14.820> after<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.120> they're<00:02:15.300> actually

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and then after that they're actually

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.940 
and then after that they're actually
riding<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.990> bit<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.260> short<00:02:16.530> loop<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.860> they

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
riding a bit of a short loop that they

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.890 
riding a bit of a short loop that they
have<00:02:17.130> across<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> number<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.450> different<00:02:18.750> test

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
have across a number of different test

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.570 
have across a number of different test
scenarios<00:02:19.230> including<00:02:19.650> high<00:02:20.010> cadence<00:02:20.250> slow

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
scenarios including high cadence slow

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.840 
scenarios including high cadence slow
cadence<00:02:20.760> high<00:02:21.450> gears<00:02:21.750> low<00:02:22.020> gears<00:02:22.400> etc<00:02:23.400> there

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
cadence high gears low gears etc there

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.280 
cadence high gears low gears etc there
will<00:02:24.120> probably<00:02:24.210> go<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.750> bit<00:02:24.990> more<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
will probably go to a bit more of a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.810 
will probably go to a bit more of a
randomized<00:02:25.710> testing<00:02:26.100> model<00:02:26.400> down<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.670> road

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
randomized testing model down the road

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.920 
randomized testing model down the road
but<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.240> now<00:02:27.300> they<00:02:27.510> want<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.720> make<00:02:27.810> sure

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
but for right now they want to make sure

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.750 
but for right now they want to make sure
everything<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.200> good<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:29.430> that's<00:02:29.550> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
everything is good to go so that's a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.330 
everything is good to go so that's a
quick<00:02:30.060> review<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.510> testing<00:02:30.810> piece<00:02:31.340> inside

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
quick review on the testing piece inside

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.140 
quick review on the testing piece inside
here<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.610> looks<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.790> we've<00:02:32.940> got<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
here it looks like we've got the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
here it looks like we've got the
QuickStart<00:02:33.540> guide<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:34.590> getting<00:02:34.800> everything

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
QuickStart guide for getting everything

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.400 
QuickStart guide for getting everything
ready<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> go<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.450> I'll<00:02:36.570> use<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.960> here<00:02:37.170> as<00:02:37.260> I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
ready to go so I'll use that here as I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.860 
ready to go so I'll use that here as I
said<00:02:38.040> things<00:02:38.190> up<00:02:38.460> but<00:02:38.910> that's<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.300> QuickStart

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
said things up but that's the QuickStart

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.860 
said things up but that's the QuickStart
guide<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.110> start<00:02:40.350> with<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.610> put<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.820> down

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
guide to start with and put that down

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.600 
guide to start with and put that down
looks<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.380> we've<00:02:43.500> got<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.650> sticker<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.340> two

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
looks like we've got a sticker of two

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.820 
looks like we've got a sticker of two
stickers<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:45.930> can<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.350> ahead<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.680> put

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
stickers so you can go ahead and put

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.730 
stickers so you can go ahead and put
that<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.150> something<00:02:48.150> meaningful<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.870> and

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
that on something meaningful to you and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.350 
that on something meaningful to you and
then<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:50.460> just<00:02:50.490> go<00:02:50.730> ahead<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.000> pull<00:02:51.210> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
then if we just go ahead and pull the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.090 
then if we just go ahead and pull the
whole<00:02:51.510> kit<00:02:51.900> out<00:02:53.690> inside<00:02:54.740> looks<00:02:55.740> like<00:02:55.800> just

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
whole kit out inside looks like just

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.340 
whole kit out inside looks like just
some<00:02:56.310> foam<00:02:56.700> protection<00:02:57.180> there<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.170> go<00:02:58.290> ahead

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
some foam protection there so go ahead

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.530 
some foam protection there so go ahead
and<00:02:58.470> leave<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.770> like<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.430> then<00:03:00.270> below

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and leave that like that and then below

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.120 
and leave that like that and then below
that<00:03:00.570> we've<00:03:01.020> got<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> standard<00:03:02.120> cr2032<00:03:03.120> battery

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
that we've got a standard cr2032 battery

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.050 
that we've got a standard cr2032 battery
two<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.220> them<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.460> case<00:03:05.670> they<00:03:05.790> put<00:03:05.970> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
two of them in this case they put in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.650 
two of them in this case they put in
there

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
there

the<00:03:36.810> plug<00:03:37.020> on<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.350> because<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.190> was

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
the plug on it because this was

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.580 
the plug on it because this was
installed<00:03:38.760> by<00:03:38.940> them<00:03:39.180> down<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.260> road<00:03:40.410> when

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
installed by them down the road when

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.110 
installed by them down the road when
they<00:03:40.680> start<00:03:40.860> doing<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> self<00:03:41.310> install<00:03:41.610> you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
they start doing a self install you

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.310 
they start doing a self install you
would<00:03:42.270> actually<00:03:42.540> be<00:03:42.630> installing<00:03:43.140> this

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
would actually be installing this

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.020 
would actually be installing this
particular<00:03:43.769> pod<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.250> then<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.459> box<00:03:44.670> shrinks

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
particular pod so then the box shrinks

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.030 
particular pod so then the box shrinks
even<00:03:45.120> more<00:03:45.450> it's<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.080> much<00:03:46.230> smaller<00:03:46.410> box<00:03:46.830> with

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
even more it's a much smaller box with

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.130 
even more it's a much smaller box with
just<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.340> spot<00:03:47.640> on<00:03:47.850> that's<00:03:48.090> epoxy<00:03:48.720> me<00:03:48.870> kind<00:03:49.110> of

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
just a spot on that's epoxy me kind of

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.509 
just a spot on that's epoxy me kind of
just<00:03:49.260> barely<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:49.920> edge<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.310> epoxy

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
just barely see the edge of the epoxy

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.400 
just barely see the edge of the epoxy
down<00:03:50.850> there<00:03:51.060> probably<00:03:51.870> pretty<00:03:52.080> hard<00:03:52.260> on<00:03:52.320> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
down there probably pretty hard on the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.170 
down there probably pretty hard on the
camera<00:03:52.739> actually<00:03:52.950> see<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:54.030> that's

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
camera actually see that but that's

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.420 
camera actually see that but that's
that's<00:03:54.630> as<00:03:54.810> simple<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.320> is<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.650> would<00:03:56.220> then

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
that's as simple as it is I would then

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.770 
that's as simple as it is I would then
open<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.790> up<00:03:56.850> here<00:03:57.000> if<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.300> wanted<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.660> get

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
open this up here if I wanted to get

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.660 
open this up here if I wanted to get
into<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.989> battery<00:03:58.230> compartment<00:03:58.519> so<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.580> can

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
into the battery compartment so you can

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.250 
into the battery compartment so you can
just<00:03:59.790> do<00:03:59.880> that<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.300> you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.870> see<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.200> I'm

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
just do that and you can see that so I'm

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.420 
just do that and you can see that so I'm
gonna<00:04:01.350> go<00:04:01.470> ahead<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.680> install<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.100> battery

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
gonna go ahead and install the battery

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.000 
gonna go ahead and install the battery
into<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.880> unit<00:04:03.180> there<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.540> don't<00:04:04.500> tell<00:04:04.739> then

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
into that unit there I don't tell then

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.370 
into that unit there I don't tell then
take<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.430> crank<00:04:06.060> arm<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.420> installed<00:04:07.140> onto

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
take this crank arm and installed onto

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.030 
take this crank arm and installed onto
my<00:04:08.070> bike<00:04:08.280> on<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.790> left<00:04:09.060> arm<00:04:09.989> side<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.500> then

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
my bike on the left arm side and then

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.710 
my bike on the left arm side and then
I'll<00:04:11.280> go<00:04:11.430> ahead<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.700> lock<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.090> place<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.660> this

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
I'll go ahead and lock in place and this

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.900 
I'll go ahead and lock in place and this
will<00:04:12.870> give<00:04:12.989> me<00:04:13.080> left<00:04:13.260> only<00:04:13.410> power<00:04:13.709> now<00:04:14.580> keep<00:04:14.790> in

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
will give me left only power now keep in

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.000 
will give me left only power now keep in
mind<00:04:14.940> with<00:04:15.480> left<00:04:15.720> only<00:04:15.959> power<00:04:16.169> at<00:04:16.859> least

initially<00:04:17.220> you're<00:04:17.910> gonna<00:04:18.030> see<00:04:18.269> some

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
initially you're gonna see some

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
long there we go a full dual sided power

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.050 
long there we go a full dual sided power
meter<00:04:39.680> no<00:04:40.250> different<00:04:40.580> than<00:04:40.669> something<00:04:40.910> like

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
meter no different than something like

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.730 
meter no different than something like
vector<00:04:41.569> or<00:04:41.870> one<00:04:42.020> of<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.169> other<00:04:42.289> dual<00:04:42.470> sided

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
vector or one of the other dual sided

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.559 
vector or one of the other dual sided
power<00:04:42.979> meters<00:04:43.220> on<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.400> market<00:04:43.699> so<00:04:44.330> that's<00:04:44.419> a

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
power meters on the market so that's a

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.990 
power meters on the market so that's a
quick<00:04:44.690> look<00:04:44.750> at<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.139> unboxing<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:46.099> the<00:04:46.400> four

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
quick look at the unboxing of the four

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.180 
quick look at the unboxing of the four
eyes<00:04:47.180> precision<00:04:47.720> power<00:04:47.930> meter<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:48.949> stay

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
eyes precision power meter and stay

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.890 
eyes precision power meter and stay
tuned<00:04:49.430> over<00:04:49.699> the<00:04:49.759> next<00:04:50.000> few<00:04:50.509> weeks<00:04:50.539> and<00:04:50.870> months

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
tuned over the next few weeks and months

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.620 
tuned over the next few weeks and months
as<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.289> go<00:04:51.440> into<00:04:51.620> deeper<00:04:52.340> testing<00:04:52.669> of<00:04:52.789> it<00:04:52.940> and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
as I go into deeper testing of it and

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.820 
as I go into deeper testing of it and
start<00:04:53.810> releasing<00:04:54.020> some<00:04:54.259> of<00:04:54.349> those<00:04:54.410> results

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
start releasing some of those results

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.910 
start releasing some of those results
thanks<00:04:55.520> for<00:04:55.639> watching
