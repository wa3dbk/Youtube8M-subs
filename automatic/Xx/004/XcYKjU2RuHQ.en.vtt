quick tip I've been using in Sim City
often<00:00:09.929> times<00:00:10.110> you've<00:00:10.349> run<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.620> water<00:00:11.120> when

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
often times you've run out of water when

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.789 
often times you've run out of water when
you<00:00:12.210> play<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.630> quite<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> while<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.500> notice

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
you play for quite a while you notice

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.860 
you play for quite a while you notice
that<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.639> water<00:00:14.849> table<00:00:15.059> starts<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.690> run<00:00:15.839> a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
that the water table starts to run a

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.500 
that the water table starts to run a
little<00:00:16.080> bit<00:00:16.230> dry<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.000> there's<00:00:18.000> no<00:00:18.090> real<00:00:18.330> way

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
little bit dry and there's no real way

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.010 
little bit dry and there's no real way
to<00:00:18.539> replenish<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.890> I've<00:00:19.980> discovered<00:00:20.340> is

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
to replenish it what I've discovered is

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.160 
to replenish it what I've discovered is
what<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.460> your<00:00:23.760> sewage<00:00:24.359> out

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
what you can do is use your sewage out

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
or your sewage processing plants which

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.689 
or your sewage processing plants which
takes<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.140> sewage<00:00:28.470> processes<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.460> back

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
takes your sewage processes that back

you<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> best<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you know the best way to do this is to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.760 
you know the best way to do this is to
extend<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:24.119> sewage<00:01:24.509> pumps<00:01:24.869> out<00:01:25.049> straight<00:01:25.740> in

extend your sewage pumps out straight in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.010 
extend your sewage pumps out straight in
a<00:01:25.920> row<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.810> you'll<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:29.150> if<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.689> then

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
a row and you'll see if we do this then

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
a row and you'll see if we do this then
we<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.229> kind<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.530> wrap<00:01:31.740> our<00:01:31.979> water<00:01:32.310> pumps

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
we can kind of wrap our water pumps

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.319 
we can kind of wrap our water pumps
around<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:34.700> now<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.790> course<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.210> need

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
around this now of course you don't need

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.350 
around this now of course you don't need
this<00:01:36.450> much<00:01:36.689> starting<00:01:36.990> off<00:01:37.340> but<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.299> to

these<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:00.990> gonna<00:02:01.140> basically<00:02:01.320> make<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:02.100> this

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
these are gonna basically make all this

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.090 
these are gonna basically make all this
soaked<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.240> water<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.780> then<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.770> year<00:02:05.040> is

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
soaked with water and then this year is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.609 
soaked with water and then this year is
going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> pump<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.079> that's<00:02:07.079> basically

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
going to pump it up and that's basically

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.410 
going to pump it up and that's basically
how<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:08.129> an<00:02:08.250> infinite<00:02:08.550> source<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.209> water

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
how you get an infinite source of water

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.020 
how you get an infinite source of water
now<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:10.979> here<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> water<00:02:11.670> table

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
now as you can see here the water table

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490 
now as you can see here the water table
is<00:02:12.120> medium<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.230> point

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is medium at this point

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
is medium at this point
actually<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:14.480> let's<00:02:15.480> consider<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.870> low<00:02:16.050> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
actually it's let's consider a low I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.260 
actually it's let's consider a low I
believe<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.040> um<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.180> I'm

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
believe here so um you know what I'm

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.550 
believe here so um you know what I'm
gonna<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.510> ahead<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> bunch<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.440> people

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
gonna go ahead and get a bunch of people

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.190 
gonna go ahead and get a bunch of people
living<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.390> we'll<00:02:21.390> see<00:02:21.690> how<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.020> works

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
living here and we'll see how this works

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.350 
living here and we'll see how this works
in<00:02:22.530> action<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.520> there's<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> bear<00:02:23.940> with<00:02:24.030> me<00:02:24.150> for

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
in action so there's a bear with me for

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.840 
in action so there's a bear with me for
a<00:02:24.390> few<00:02:24.720> minutes

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
a few minutes

people here so I'm gonna turn these all
off<00:02:58.920> at<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.459> point<00:02:59.790> yeah<00:03:00.780> see<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:02.100> believe<00:03:02.370> I

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
off at this point yeah see I believe I

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.180 
off at this point yeah see I believe I
already<00:03:03.180> turned<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.570> these<00:03:03.750> off<00:03:04.020> her<00:03:04.380> did<00:03:04.680> I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
already turned to these off her did I

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.040 
already turned to these off her did I
turn<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.239> one<00:03:06.420> off

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
turn that one off

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.160 
turn that one off
yeah<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.680> turn<00:03:09.070> these<00:03:09.250> off<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.840> there's<00:03:10.840> no<00:03:10.990> need

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
yeah I turn these off so there's no need

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.430 
yeah I turn these off so there's no need
to<00:03:11.710> have<00:03:12.400> them<00:03:12.520> all<00:03:12.640> going<00:03:13.240> at<00:03:13.360> once<00:03:13.570> like<00:03:14.200> one

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
to have them all going at once like one

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.180 
to have them all going at once like one
is<00:03:14.590> sufficient<00:03:16.020> now<00:03:17.020> if<00:03:17.290> anything<00:03:17.650> what<00:03:18.160> I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
is sufficient now if anything what I

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.760 
is sufficient now if anything what I
would<00:03:18.340> probably<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.750> turn<00:03:20.050> this<00:03:20.350> one<00:03:20.560> right

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
would probably do is turn this one right

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.310 
would probably do is turn this one right
here<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.670> see<00:03:21.880> my<00:03:21.970> mouse<00:03:22.180> pointer<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.600> here<00:03:22.810> I

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
here you see my mouse pointer is here I

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.220 
here you see my mouse pointer is here I
would<00:03:23.890> turn<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.460> one<00:03:24.730> on<00:03:24.940> because<00:03:25.270> it's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
would turn this one on because it's

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.010 
would turn this one on because it's
closest<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.860> water<00:03:27.190> pump<00:03:27.460> and<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:28.150> return<00:03:28.810> it

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
closest to a water pump and I return it

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.430 
closest to a water pump and I return it
hop<00:03:29.230> off<00:03:29.490> turn<00:03:30.490> that<00:03:30.700> one<00:03:30.880> on<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:33.010> let's<00:03:33.670> go

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
hop off turn that one on and let's go

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.260 
hop off turn that one on and let's go
here<00:03:35.440> let's<00:03:36.510> turn<00:03:37.510> this<00:03:37.780> one<00:03:38.140> on<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.940> turn

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
here let's turn this one on and turn

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.180 
here let's turn this one on and turn
this<00:03:40.450> off<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:42.840> yeah<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.110> should<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.320> good<00:03:44.410> now

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
this off so yeah that should be good now

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.280 
this off so yeah that should be good now
what's<00:03:45.370> gonna<00:03:45.460> happen<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:46.000> like<00:03:46.930> there<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.170> go

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
what's gonna happen is like there you go

what's gonna happen is like there you go
you<00:03:47.440> see<00:03:47.620> that's<00:03:47.770> filling<00:03:48.160> up<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:48.520> one

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
you see that's filling up and this one

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.740 
you see that's filling up and this one
is<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:48.790> going<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.030> start<00:03:49.180> draining<00:03:49.450> here

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
is just going to start draining here
