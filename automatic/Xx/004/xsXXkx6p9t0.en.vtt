00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
lot of work and I think the Republicans

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.770 
lot of work and I think the Republicans
are<00:05:58.190> starting<00:05:58.580> to<00:05:58.610> stand<00:05:58.910> together<00:05:59.030> on<00:05:59.480> some

are starting to stand together on some
principles<00:06:00.290> of<00:06:00.410> freedom<00:06:00.650> that<00:06:00.950> I<00:06:00.980> think<00:06:01.310> the

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
principles of freedom that I think the

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.670 
principles of freedom that I think the
American<00:06:02.300> people<00:06:02.450> are<00:06:02.900> going<00:06:03.110> to<00:06:03.200> take<00:06:03.380> two

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
and it's time we have a real debate

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.270
