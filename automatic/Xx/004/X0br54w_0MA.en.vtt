cell lipo battery 7.4 volt and I found

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.840 
cell lipo battery 7.4 volt and I found
that<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.160> rated<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.700> hundred

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that they are rated for about a hundred

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.350 
that they are rated for about a hundred

thing about these guys is that since the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.470 
thing about these guys is that since the
battery<00:00:45.899> where<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.140> wires<00:00:46.350> come<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> top

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
battery where the wires come up to top

00:00:47.480 --> 00:01:06.850 
battery where the wires come up to top
you<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.660> clip<00:00:48.899> these<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:55.039> with<00:00:56.039> no<00:00:56.190> problem

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
of resetting you need now the other

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.050 
of resetting you need now the other
battery<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:39.200> I've<00:01:39.350> also<00:01:39.530> got<00:01:39.860> now<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.760> fits

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
battery that I've also got now that fits

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.870 
battery that I've also got now that fits
is<00:01:41.330> a<00:01:41.990> little<00:01:42.350> smaller<00:01:42.650> capacity<00:01:42.890> it's<00:01:43.700> also

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
is a little smaller capacity it's also

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.300 
is a little smaller capacity it's also
two<00:01:44.060> cell<00:01:44.479> lipo<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:45.290> one's<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.560> four<00:01:45.770> thousand

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
two cell lipo this one's a four thousand

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.040 
two cell lipo this one's a four thousand
but<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.850> thirty<00:01:47.090> ciated<00:01:47.690> which<00:01:47.840> means

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
but this is thirty ciated which means

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.050 
but this is thirty ciated which means
it's<00:01:48.229> rated<00:01:48.440> for<00:01:48.470> 120<00:01:49.280> amps<00:01:49.610> instead<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.940> just

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
it's rated for 120 amps instead of just

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.900 
it's rated for 120 amps instead of just
100<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.320> do<00:01:51.800> have<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.979> little<00:01:52.160> less<00:01:52.430> runtime

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
100 so you do have a little less runtime

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.290 
100 so you do have a little less runtime
but<00:01:53.150> a<00:01:53.210> little<00:01:53.360> bit<00:01:53.510> more<00:01:53.690> power<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.260> and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
but a little bit more power to it and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.080 
but a little bit more power to it and
this<00:01:56.300> guy's<00:01:56.510> well<00:01:57.100> fits<00:01:59.229> no<00:02:00.229> muss<00:02:00.530> no<00:02:01.000> fuss<00:02:02.000> no

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
this guy's well fits no muss no fuss no

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.330 
this guy's well fits no muss no fuss no
