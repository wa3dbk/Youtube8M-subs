00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
tolerant actually writing it it kind of

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.020 
tolerant actually writing it it kind of
looks<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.830> little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.189> weird<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:38.610> i<00:01:38.790> don't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
looks a little bit weird because i don't

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.929 
looks a little bit weird because i don't
really<00:01:39.150> fit<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.740> um<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.280> like

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
really fit in it that well but um I like

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
really fit in it that well but um I like
it<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.200> normal<00:01:43.530> chopper<00:01:44.070> 2

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it you know I have the normal chopper 2

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.580 
it you know I have the normal chopper 2
so<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.030> three<00:01:45.869> wheeler<00:01:46.080> choppers

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so this is like three wheeler choppers

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.810 
so this is like three wheeler choppers
so<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.830> kind<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> collection<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
so it's kind of like a collection I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.469 
so it's kind of like a collection I
guess<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.450> um<00:01:49.579> I'm<00:01:50.579> pretty<00:01:50.610> happy<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
guess now so um I'm pretty happy and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.179 
guess now so um I'm pretty happy and
it's<00:01:51.810> pretty<00:01:51.960> cool<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.009> definitely

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it's pretty cool I think it's definitely

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.069 
it's pretty cool I think it's definitely
worth<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> grind<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.150> if<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.420> follow<00:01:54.750> my
