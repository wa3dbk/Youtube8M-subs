00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.569 
we have the octatrack and of course the
sound<00:00:46.140> card<00:00:46.410> right<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:48.770> we<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.950> separated

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
sound card right here we have separated

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.700 
sound card right here we have separated
every<00:00:51.120> track<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.840> different<00:00:52.170> parts<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.620> we

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
every track into different parts so we

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.069 
every track into different parts so we
have<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> kick<00:00:53.190> bass<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.090> leads

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
have the kick bass right here leads

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.400 
have the kick bass right here leads
different<00:00:55.739> lead<00:00:55.920> parts<00:00:56.309> from<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> track<00:00:57.410> here

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
different lead parts from the track here

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.580 
different lead parts from the track here
we<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.670> rhythms<00:01:00.030> exactly<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.410> have

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we have the rhythms exactly so we have

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.030 
we have the rhythms exactly so we have
if<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.370> click<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.719> just

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
if you click here you can see it's just

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.620 
if you click here you can see it's just
loops<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> rhythmic<00:01:06.060> parts<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
loops of the rhythmic parts in the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
loops of the rhythmic parts in the
tracks<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.560> choose<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
tracks so we can really choose if a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.700 
tracks so we can really choose if a
specific<00:01:08.880> rhythm<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.540> any<00:01:09.840> time<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.500> want

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
specific rhythm at any time that we want

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.520 
specific rhythm at any time that we want
so<00:01:11.369> I'm<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:11.820> launching<00:01:12.390> everything<00:01:12.960> just

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
so I'm then launching everything just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.160 
so I'm then launching everything just
closing<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.280> I'm<00:01:15.150> launching<00:01:15.509> everything

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
closing here I'm launching everything

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.160 
closing here I'm launching everything
with<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.740> launch<00:01:17.189> pad<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.630> instance<00:01:18.689> if

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
with this launch pad so for instance if

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.210 
with this launch pad so for instance if
I<00:01:19.290> click<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.840> see<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I click here you can see I have the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
I click here you can see I have the
rhythms<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> mixer<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
rhythms going on here on the mixer and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.499 
rhythms going on here on the mixer and
then<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.250> kick<00:01:26.460> places<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.119> these<00:01:27.299> two

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
then i have the kick places on these two

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.870 
then i have the kick places on these two
channels<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.920> i<00:01:29.040> launched<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> kick<00:01:29.670> bass

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
channels so if i launched the kick bass

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.039 
channels so if i launched the kick bass
for<00:01:30.150> instance

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.640 

so<00:01:35.049> I<00:01:35.080> can<00:01:35.409> cut<00:01:35.650> out<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.670> kick<00:01:36.880> bass<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
so I can cut out the kick bass and the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.340 
so I can cut out the kick bass and the
rhythm<00:01:38.650> is<00:01:38.770> still<00:01:39.010> playing<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:41.049> really

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
rhythm is still playing and it's really

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.100 
rhythm is still playing and it's really
good<00:01:41.500> because<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:41.979> gives<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.490> lot<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:43.110> freedom

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
good because it gives a lot of freedom

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.710 
good because it gives a lot of freedom
to<00:01:44.590> mix<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.950> tracks<00:01:45.220> together<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:46.570> of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
to mix the tracks together then of

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.899 
to mix the tracks together then of
course<00:01:46.990> we<00:01:47.200> have<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.350> deletes<00:01:48.220> which<00:01:48.700> I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
and then this is the octatrack so we

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.820 
and then this is the octatrack so we
have<00:02:17.920> two<00:02:18.190> inputs<00:02:18.670> here<00:02:19.350> which<00:02:20.350> are<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.620> lead

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
have two inputs here which are the lead

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.949 
have two inputs here which are the lead
channels<00:02:21.340> which<00:02:21.670> goes<00:02:21.970> into<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.540> octatrack

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
channels which goes into the octatrack

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.059 
channels which goes into the octatrack
and<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.030> we<00:02:25.180> can<00:02:25.360> add<00:02:25.630> more<00:02:26.110> effects<00:02:26.709> from<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
and so we can add more effects from the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.370 
and so we can add more effects from the
octatrack<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.850> we<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.090> also<00:02:28.269> add<00:02:28.630> loops<00:02:29.019> from

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
octatrack and we can also add loops from

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.780 
octatrack and we can also add loops from
the<00:02:29.560> octatrack<00:02:30.040> yeah<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.209> top<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.870> then

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the octatrack yeah on top of it and then

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.250 
the octatrack yeah on top of it and then
we<00:02:33.790> use<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.290> control<00:02:35.680> some<00:02:36.630> effects<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.870> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
we use this to control some effects in a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.140 
we use this to control some effects in a
