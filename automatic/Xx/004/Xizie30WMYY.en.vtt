onto<00:03:38.450> that<00:03:39.450> crease<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.500> apply<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> little

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
onto that crease just to apply a little

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.380 
onto that crease just to apply a little
bit<00:03:41.280> more<00:03:41.490> color<00:03:41.670> because<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:41.970> really<00:03:42.209> want

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
bit more color because I really want

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.710 
bit more color because I really want
that<00:03:42.570> intensity<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.740> side<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.720> lid

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
that intensity on that side of the lid

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.840 
that intensity on that side of the lid
of<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.290> crease<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.830> then<00:03:46.890> going<00:03:47.670> with<00:03:47.820> that

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
of the crease and then going with that

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.729 
of the crease and then going with that
silvery<00:03:48.420> color<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.990> i'm<00:03:49.110> just<00:03:49.290> applying<00:03:49.410> that

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
silvery color and i'm just applying that

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.500 
silvery color and i'm just applying that
all<00:03:50.010> over<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.489> lid<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.880> i'm<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.209> packing

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
all over the lid and i'm just packing

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.260 
all over the lid and i'm just packing
the<00:03:51.870> color<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.440> i<00:03:52.800> really<00:03:53.550> like<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.850> silver

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
the color on i really like this silver

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.970 
the color on i really like this silver
because<00:03:54.570> it's<00:03:54.750> not<00:03:54.840> like<00:03:55.020> other<00:03:55.290> silvers<00:03:55.800> that

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
because it's not like other silvers that

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.860 
because it's not like other silvers that
i've<00:03:56.100> tried<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.610> like<00:03:56.850> another<00:03:57.180> like<00:03:57.840> a

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:13.270 
little bit of a tint different color to

then applying a little bit on the lid

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.120 
then applying a little bit on the lid
like<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.220> eyeliner<00:04:26.090> kind<00:04:26.570> of<00:04:26.750> just<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.830> little

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.930 
not just because I really like that
those<00:04:36.410> colors<00:04:36.860> together<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.520> I'm<00:04:37.580> going<00:04:37.790> back

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
apply that on my tear duct just to make

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.970 
apply that on my tear duct just to make
my<00:04:41.840> eyes<00:04:42.620> look<00:04:42.680> more<00:04:43.100> awake<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:45.680> just<00:04:45.860> want

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
my eyes look more awake and I just want

my eyes look more awake and I just want
to<00:04:46.010> make<00:04:46.100> sure<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.280> blend<00:04:46.550> everything<00:04:46.790> out

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
to make sure I blend everything out

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.700 
to make sure I blend everything out
because<00:04:47.630> I<00:04:47.720> don't<00:04:47.870> want<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.200> look<00:04:48.350> harsh

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710

clean<00:05:30.800> under<00:05:31.130> the<00:05:31.280> eyes<00:05:31.430> just<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.300> looks<00:05:32.510> a

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
clean under the eyes just so it looks a

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.250 
clean under the eyes just so it looks a
little<00:05:32.780> bit<00:05:32.990> more<00:05:33.820> highlighted<00:05:34.960> and<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.110> want

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
little bit more highlighted and you want

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.420 
little bit more highlighted and you want
to<00:05:36.350> make<00:05:36.500> sure<00:05:36.530> you<00:05:36.800> blend<00:05:37.010> that<00:05:37.190> out<00:05:37.250> with

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
to make sure you blend that out with

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.830 
to make sure you blend that out with
your<00:05:37.610> finger<00:05:37.910> because<00:05:38.180> with<00:05:38.330> your<00:05:38.450> finger

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
your finger because with your finger

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.840 
your finger because with your finger
works<00:05:39.080> out<00:05:39.260> a<00:05:39.289> little<00:05:39.590> bit<00:05:39.800> better<00:05:40.130> than<00:05:40.580> using

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
works out a little bit better than using

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.500 
works out a little bit better than using
a<00:05:41.060> brush<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:42.130> then<00:05:43.130> I'm<00:05:43.669> just<00:05:43.910> going<00:05:44.210> with<00:05:44.300> my

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
a brush and then I'm just going with my

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.630 
a brush and then I'm just going with my
banana<00:05:44.870> bed<00:05:45.289> night<00:05:45.500> powder<00:05:45.800> and<00:05:46.280> i'm<00:05:46.430> using

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
banana bed night powder and i'm using

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.270 
banana bed night powder and i'm using
this<00:05:46.729> RC<00:05:47.150> cosmetics<00:05:47.720> brush<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:48.560> I'm<00:05:48.950> going<00:05:49.010> to

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
this RC cosmetics brush and I'm going to

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.270 
this RC cosmetics brush and I'm going to
set<00:05:49.820> the<00:05:50.539> foundation<00:05:50.900> that<00:05:51.410> I<00:05:51.470> applied<00:05:51.979> and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
set the foundation that I applied and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.040 
set the foundation that I applied and
this<00:05:52.880> one<00:05:53.030> works<00:05:53.240> very<00:05:53.450> well<00:05:53.570> because<00:05:53.960> it

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
this one works very well because it

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.960 
this one works very well because it
helps<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.500> highlight<00:05:54.979> and<00:05:55.160> bring<00:05:55.370> out<00:05:55.610> those

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970

features<00:05:56.419> you<00:05:56.600> want<00:05:58.630> and<00:05:59.630> then<00:05:59.660> I'm<00:06:00.350> going

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
features you want and then I'm going
