00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
shipping for newegg and so that was good

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.420 
shipping for newegg and so that was good
that<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.500> good<00:00:19.650> um<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:21.050> my<00:00:22.050> laptop<00:00:22.769> sorta

that was good um and my laptop sorta
kind<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.820> worked<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.269> not<00:00:24.330> really<00:00:24.630> well

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
kind of worked but not really well

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.410 
kind of worked but not really well
enough<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.439> anything<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.210> too

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
enough to do anything and it was too

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720 
enough to do anything and it was too
unstable<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.260> would<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:29.070> break<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
unstable and it would like just break it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
unstable and it would like just break it
ran<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> moment<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.320> keyboard

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
ran a moment and it the keyboard

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
ran a moment and it the keyboard
wouldn't<00:00:32.160> work<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> total

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
wouldn't work it was it was a total

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.319 
wouldn't work it was it was a total
disaster<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.969> really<00:00:36.239> really

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
disaster so I'm I was really really

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.760 
disaster so I'm I was really really
happy<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.809> got<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> parts<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> took<00:00:37.620> me

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
happy when I got the parts it took me

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.549 
happy when I got the parts it took me
quite<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.940> while<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.270> build<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
quite a while to build it just because I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.799 
quite a while to build it just because I
was<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.860> unsure<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.550> lot<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> things<00:00:41.940> so

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
was so unsure about a lot of things so

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.440 
was so unsure about a lot of things so
um<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.350> ended<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:44.940> asking

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
um I ended up just you know asking

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.880 
um I ended up just you know asking
people<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.050> doing<00:00:46.289> things<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
people if I was doing things right and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.260 
people if I was doing things right and
stuff<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.760> was<00:00:47.850> watching<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
stuff like that and I was watching a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.630 
stuff like that and I was watching a
tutorial<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.079> newegg<00:00:49.829> has<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.489> their

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
tutorial that newegg has on their

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
tutorial that newegg has on their
youtube<00:00:50.940> channel<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.930> made<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.110> fairly

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
youtube channel so it made it fairly

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
youtube channel so it made it fairly
straightforward<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.309> I'd<00:00:53.430> still<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.059> know

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
straightforward but I'd still you know

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.549 
straightforward but I'd still you know
it<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.539> first<00:00:54.750> time<00:00:54.930> building<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> computer

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it was my first time building a computer

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.310 
it was my first time building a computer
so<00:00:56.100> didn't<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:57.090> don't<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> lot

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so didn't really don't really know a lot

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.410 
so didn't really don't really know a lot
of<00:00:58.500> things<00:00:58.770> about<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.309> wasn't<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.850> confident

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
of things about it I wasn't as confident

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.529 
of things about it I wasn't as confident
as<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.870> could<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.199> been<00:01:01.410> um<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.329> my

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
as I could have been um if it was my

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
as I could have been um if it was my
like<00:01:04.019> second<00:01:04.439> or<00:01:04.559> third<00:01:04.739> time<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.970> did<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
like second or third time so I did that

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450 
like second or third time so I did that
and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.350> turned<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> was

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and then it turned out when I was

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
and then it turned out when I was
installing<00:01:09.240> windows<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.840> everything<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
installing windows and everything that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.940 
installing windows and everything that
uh<00:01:11.510> just<00:01:12.510> kept<00:01:12.780> blue<00:01:13.049> screening<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.890> just

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
uh just kept blue screening like I just

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.740 
uh just kept blue screening like I just
kept<00:01:14.250> getting<00:01:14.369> blue<00:01:14.700> screens<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.330> random

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
kept getting blue screens or random

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570 
kept getting blue screens or random
other<00:01:15.930> errors<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.560> crashes<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.250> stuff<00:01:17.460> like

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
other errors and crashes and stuff like

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.020 
other errors and crashes and stuff like
that<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.689> um<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.560> figured<00:01:20.549> out<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that and so um I figured out that one of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
that and so um I figured out that one of
my<00:01:21.119> ram<00:01:21.509> sticks<00:01:21.869> was<00:01:22.080> broken<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.710> had<00:01:23.130> eight

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
my ram sticks was broken I had eight

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
my ram sticks was broken I had eight
gigabytes<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.939> RAM<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.420> specs<00:01:24.720> will<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
gigabytes of RAM the specs will all be

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
gigabytes of RAM the specs will all be
in<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> description<00:01:25.950> by<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> way<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.240> will

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
in the description by the way and i will

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.230 
in the description by the way and i will
update<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:28.080> channel<00:01:28.439> info<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:28.950> well<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.369> just

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
need to put a list together which I

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.359 
need to put a list together which I
haven't<00:01:31.979> yet<00:01:32.189> um<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> ram<00:01:35.100> sticks

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
haven't yet um so one of the ram sticks

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
haven't yet um so one of the ram sticks
was<00:01:35.579> broken<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:35.970> i<00:01:36.600> had<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:38.150> send<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.990> because

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
was broken so i had to send the because

you can tell me a solution that I
haven't<00:02:24.600> already<00:02:24.750> tried<00:02:25.020> if<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:25.860> even

haven't already tried if it's even
somewhat<00:02:26.550> obvious<00:02:26.730> um<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:28.320> yeah<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.610> is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
somewhat obvious um but yeah so that is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.500 
somewhat obvious um but yeah so that is
where<00:02:29.880> i<00:02:29.910> met<00:02:30.180> with<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.810> um<00:02:32.150> recorded<00:02:33.150> some
