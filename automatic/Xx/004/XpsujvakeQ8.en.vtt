and<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:27.119> quite<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.869> way<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.109> floats<00:00:28.410> in

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and I quite like the way it floats in

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.720 
and I quite like the way it floats in
the<00:00:28.680> middle<00:00:29.010> there<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:31.399> squares<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.550> I've

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.780 
the middle there the squares that I've
used<00:00:33.110> mostly<00:00:34.110> are<00:00:34.380> two<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> half<00:00:35.040> inches<00:00:35.550> if

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
used mostly are two and a half inches if

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
used mostly are two and a half inches if
they're<00:00:36.000> full<00:00:36.300> squares<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:37.050> from<00:00:37.770> two<00:00:37.950> and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.880 
of an inch seam either side of that mark
line<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.570> when<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.049> cut<00:01:25.290> along<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> line

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
line then when you cut along the line

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.859 
line then when you cut along the line
you've<00:01:26.159> got<00:01:26.189> these<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.520> triangles<00:01:27.030> each<00:01:27.509> with

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you've got these two triangles each with

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.310 
you've got these two triangles each with
a<00:01:27.900> seam<00:01:28.530> at<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.740> base<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.360> these<00:01:30.360> will<00:01:31.200> each

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
a seam at the base and these will each

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.260 
a seam at the base and these will each
open<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> make<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> half<00:01:32.430> square<00:01:32.670> triangle

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
open up to make a half square triangle

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.870 
open up to make a half square triangle
and<00:01:33.570> I've<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.140> these<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.590> blue<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.430> pink

and I've got these in blue and in pink

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.530 
and I've got these in blue and in pink
for<00:01:36.259> each<00:01:37.549> pair<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.729> squares<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.299> sewed

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
for each pair of squares that I sewed

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
for each pair of squares that I sewed
together<00:01:39.720> I'll<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.860> half<00:01:41.100> square

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
together I'll get to half square

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.370 
together I'll get to half square
triangles<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.140> just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
triangles like this and now you just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
triangles like this and now you just
need<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.619> trim<00:01:44.040> off<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.460> corners<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.149> where

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
need to trim off the corners there where

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.600 
need to trim off the corners there where
the<00:01:45.600> triangle<00:01:46.500> tips<00:01:46.710> are<00:01:46.890> sticking<00:01:47.189> out<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the triangle tips are sticking out and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.700 
the triangle tips are sticking out and
these<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.930> two<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> half<00:01:49.470> inch

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
these will now be two and a half inch

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.670 
these will now be two and a half inch
squares<00:01:50.130> these<00:01:50.880> are<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> two<00:01:51.680> completed

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
got the one which is just slightly more

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.609 
got the one which is just slightly more

see in the middle here I've got a lot of
blue<00:02:09.030> squares<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.440> could<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.950> chose

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
blue squares and you could if you chose

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.690 
blue squares and you could if you chose
make

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
make

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.510

vermin two rectangles each pair of two
and<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> half<00:02:14.790> inch<00:02:15.030> squares<00:02:15.420> could<00:02:16.170> be

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and a half inch squares could be

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.259 
and a half inch squares could be
exchanged<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.160> four<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.640> half<00:02:17.670> inch<00:02:18.060> by

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
two and a half inch rectangle I've done

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.240 
two and a half inch rectangle I've done
it<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.150> way<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:21.599> squares<00:02:21.930> only<00:02:22.379> because

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
it this way with squares only because

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.430 
it this way with squares only because
then<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.360> wanted<00:02:24.629> to<00:02:24.750> make<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.170> scrap

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
then if you wanted to make it a scrap

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.410 
then if you wanted to make it a scrap
block<00:02:25.680> rather<00:02:25.950> than<00:02:26.310> using<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:26.819> one<00:02:27.150> color

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
block rather than using all one color

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.449 
block rather than using all one color
then<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.230> could<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.590> individual<00:02:29.250> squares

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
then you could have individual squares

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.460 
then you could have individual squares
all<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.000> way<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.660> know<00:02:30.780> within<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.290> all

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
all the way you know within it all

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.160 
all the way you know within it all
different<00:02:31.860> colors<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.390> look<00:02:33.540> at<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.810> code

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
different colors if you look at the code

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.949 
different colors if you look at the code
block<00:02:34.319> with<00:02:35.069> just<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.459> surround<00:02:35.880> laid<00:02:36.720> out

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
block with just a surround laid out

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.690 
block with just a surround laid out
first<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.590> think<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.860> makes<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.220> bit<00:02:38.370> easier

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
first I think it makes it a bit easier

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.940 
first I think it makes it a bit easier
to<00:02:38.760> see<00:02:38.910> how<00:02:39.180> everything<00:02:39.569> goes<00:02:39.599> together

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
to see how everything goes together

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.619 
to see how everything goes together
across<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.190> top<00:02:41.400> I've<00:02:41.610> got<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:42.090> one<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> half

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
across the top I've got a one and a half

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.120 
across the top I've got a one and a half
inch<00:02:42.870> by<00:02:43.049> twelve<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.470> half<00:02:43.500> inch<00:02:43.890> white

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
inch by twelve and a half inch white

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.089 
inch by twelve and a half inch white
strip<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.599> same<00:02:46.080> again<00:02:46.380> down<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.769> bottom

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
strip and the same again down the bottom

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.610 
strip and the same again down the bottom
here<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.090> next<00:02:48.390> row<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.750> our<00:02:49.019> two<00:02:49.380> black

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
here the next row in our two black

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.500 
here the next row in our two black
squares<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.340> two<00:02:50.640> white<00:02:50.819> squares<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.329> either

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
squares with two white squares on either

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.870 
squares with two white squares on either
side<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.260> again<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.069> same<00:02:53.489> at<00:02:53.670> top<00:02:53.849> and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
side and that again is same at top and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.600 
side and that again is same at top and
bottom<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.569> then<00:02:55.440> then<00:02:55.890> you've<00:02:56.280> got<00:02:56.430> one

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
bottom and then then you've got one

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.900 
bottom and then then you've got one
white<00:02:56.970> square<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:58.230> each<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:59.340> inside<00:02:59.700> from

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
white square in each just inside from

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.400 
white square in each just inside from
each<00:03:00.000> corner<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.569> you've<00:03:00.780> got<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.110> three

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
each corner so that you've got the three

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.890 
each corner so that you've got the three
of<00:03:01.530> them<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.250> each<00:03:02.370> corner<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.690> then

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
of them there in each corner and then

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.479 
of them there in each corner and then
the<00:03:04.049> rest<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.620> made<00:03:04.829> up<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.160> with<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the rest of it is made up now with the

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.910 
the rest of it is made up now with the
hoff<00:03:05.640> square<00:03:05.880> triangles<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.380> two<00:03:07.709> blue

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
hoff square triangles and the two blue

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.309 
hoff square triangles and the two blue
squares<00:03:08.280> they're<00:03:08.579> forming<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.569> outside<00:03:10.079> of

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
squares they're forming the outside of

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.470 
squares they're forming the outside of
the<00:03:10.440> lantern<00:03:10.920> now<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.519> whole<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> inside

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the lantern now the whole of the inside

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.030 
the lantern now the whole of the inside
of<00:03:12.599> this<00:03:12.720> now<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.319> filled<00:03:13.530> up<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.799> blue

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
of this now is just filled up with blue

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.309 
of this now is just filled up with blue
squares<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.150> thought<00:03:15.630> if<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.870> looked<00:03:16.049> at<00:03:16.170> it

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
squares so I thought if you looked at it

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.530 
squares so I thought if you looked at it
like<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.980> perhaps<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.489> quite<00:03:18.060> clear<00:03:18.359> as

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
like this it perhaps is quite clear as

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.330 
like this it perhaps is quite clear as
to<00:03:18.600> how<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.930> comes<00:03:19.139> together<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.920> then

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
to how it comes together and then

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.030 
to how it comes together and then
outsides<00:03:20.850> bottom<00:03:21.359> on<00:03:21.660> each<00:03:22.109> side<00:03:22.560> there<00:03:22.829> is

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
outsides bottom on each side there is

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.729 
outsides bottom on each side there is
two<00:03:23.609> and<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.760> half<00:03:23.940> inch<00:03:24.209> by<00:03:24.780> 16<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> half

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
two and a half inch by 16 and a half

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.979 
two and a half inch by 16 and a half
inch<00:03:25.980> white<00:03:26.250> strip<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.630> same<00:03:27.780> on

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
inch white strip and that's the same on

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.680 
inch white strip and that's the same on
both<00:03:28.170> sides<00:03:28.880> so<00:03:29.880> these<00:03:30.150> squares<00:03:30.450> together

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
both sides so these squares together

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.830 
both sides so these squares together
across<00:03:31.290> each<00:03:31.680> row<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.910> then<00:03:33.329> you'll<00:03:33.600> be<00:03:33.750> able

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
across each row and then you'll be able

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.530 
across each row and then you'll be able

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.879 
quilt block and you'll have to make two
of<00:03:44.459> these<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.079> layout<00:03:46.410> for<00:03:46.799> the

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
of these this is the layout for the

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.309 
of these this is the layout for the
second<00:03:47.310> Chinese<00:03:47.819> lantern<00:03:48.239> block<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.139> can

second Chinese lantern block as you can

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.099 
second Chinese lantern block as you can
see<00:03:49.470> it's<00:03:49.650> very<00:03:49.709> similar<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.700> first<00:03:51.109> the

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
see it's very similar to the first the

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.690 
see it's very similar to the first the
major<00:03:52.319> differences<00:03:52.889> are<00:03:53.190> that<00:03:53.220> I've<00:03:53.459> got

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
major differences are that I've got

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.460 
major differences are that I've got
these<00:03:53.850> black<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.630> half<00:03:54.780> inch<00:03:55.049> strips

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
these black one and a half inch strips

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.430 
these black one and a half inch strips
these<00:03:55.709> are<00:03:55.950> twelve<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> half<00:03:56.430> inches<00:03:56.940> long

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
these are twelve and a half inches long

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.430 
these are twelve and a half inches long
around<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.709> center<00:03:59.190> strip<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.000> up<00:04:00.720> here<00:04:01.139> I've

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
around the center strip and up here I've

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.890 
around the center strip and up here I've
got<00:04:01.739> these<00:04:01.950> two<00:04:02.250> are<00:04:02.519> now<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.269> four<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.870> half

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
got these two are now a four and a half

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.870 
got these two are now a four and a half
inch<00:04:04.200> by<00:04:04.380> one<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.799> half<00:04:05.010> inch<00:04:05.250> black<00:04:05.549> strip

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
inch by one and a half inch black strip

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.599 
inch by one and a half inch black strip
rather<00:04:06.480> than<00:04:06.810> two<00:04:07.139> black<00:04:08.010> torn<00:04:08.310> off<00:04:08.400> inch

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
rather than two black torn off inch

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.309 
rather than two black torn off inch
squares<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.599> I've<00:04:09.750> had<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.930> put<00:04:10.109> a<00:04:10.139> bit<00:04:10.290> of

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
squares so I've had to put a bit of

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.720 
squares so I've had to put a bit of
white<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.769> either<00:04:10.919> side<00:04:11.250> four<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.639> a<00:04:11.669> half

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
white on either side four and a half

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.270 
white on either side four and a half
inches<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.480> that's<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.440> 12<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:13.859> a<00:04:13.919> half<00:04:13.950> inch

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
inches and that's a 12 and a half inch

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.759 
inches and that's a 12 and a half inch
by<00:04:14.459> one<00:04:14.639> and<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.849> half<00:04:15.000> inch<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.540> top<00:04:15.780> the

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
by one and a half inch on the top the

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.279 
by one and a half inch on the top the
principle<00:04:17.220> now<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.760> same<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.750> squares

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
principle now is the same so the squares

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.259 
principle now is the same so the squares
together<00:04:19.440> across<00:04:19.859> each<00:04:20.070> row<00:04:20.310> then<00:04:20.909> sew<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
together across each row then sew the

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.710 
together across each row then sew the
rows<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.720> each<00:04:21.840> other

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
rows to each other

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.710 
rows to each other
then<00:04:22.900> add<00:04:23.170> the<00:04:23.410> outside<00:04:23.800> strips<00:04:24.450> I've<00:04:25.450> seen

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
then add the outside strips I've seen

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.150 
then add the outside strips I've seen
all<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:25.960> squares<00:04:26.260> together<00:04:26.470> across<00:04:26.980> each

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
all the squares together across each

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.890 
all the squares together across each
room<00:04:27.460> now<00:04:27.670> and<00:04:28.000> I'm<00:04:28.240> going<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.510> sew<00:04:28.660> all<00:04:28.690> the

room now and I'm going to sew all the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.660 
room now and I'm going to sew all the
rows<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.290> each<00:04:29.440> other<00:04:29.680> down<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.190> middle<00:04:30.430> here

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
rows to each other down the middle here

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.000 
rows to each other down the middle here
and<00:04:30.760> then<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.360> can<00:04:31.510> add<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.110> two<00:04:32.320> side<00:04:32.650> strips

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
and then I can add the two side strips

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.640 
and then I can add the two side strips
on<00:04:33.190> afterwards<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.170> finished<00:04:35.500> cut
