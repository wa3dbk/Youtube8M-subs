00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.210
 and so begins another fantastic week of 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.719
 I work in the plaza good morning 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.719
 Good Morning 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.950
 greater than the others every day what 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.290
 same or a little coal of 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.220
 princess turbo about to overtake 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.110
 to occupy closed the step let go of so much 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.779
 speed and start living life 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.050
 I have a life as soon as I accept it is the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.939
 miserable gray reality of your existing 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.939
 you will be much happier 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.329
 I wish I was a ball 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.329
 Let's see 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.990
 or not 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.930
 where 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.930
 what happened to me 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.780
 We will make you heal, nothing happens to me 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.740
 bad 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 nothing bad happens to you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.020
 be away from home the garden snail 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.110
 my name is turbo and I wish I could change 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.970
 the number 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 I'm a whip and I'm here 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.820
 I'm fast as a shadow but the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.890
 Shadows do not have to be fast 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.690
 I still see your speed and our 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.020
 dexterity will take us away snail from 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.020
 yard 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.039
 it's a snail 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.810
 all those snails believe in I do this 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.810
 for that reason the snail can not compete in 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.700
 a car race 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.700
 but it is the joy of Guerta brother 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.810
 listen to it, it kills you by running 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.000
 nights 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.650
 What if when you wake up tomorrow 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.400
 you have these powers, that's why I'm going to 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.400
 enjoy them today 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.620
 is thoroughly so 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.080
 moves so fast that the whole world 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.080
 low moral and toch√©
