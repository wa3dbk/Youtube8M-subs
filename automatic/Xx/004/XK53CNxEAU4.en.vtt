interesting<00:02:41.540> right<00:02:42.540> I'm<00:02:43.439> gonna<00:02:43.680> drive<00:02:43.829> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
interesting right I'm gonna drive the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.860 
interesting right I'm gonna drive the
Infiniti<00:02:44.459> not<00:02:45.150> because<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
Infiniti not because I think it's the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.420 
Infiniti not because I think it's the
fastest<00:02:46.379> car<00:02:46.409> here<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:46.920> actually<00:02:47.010> because<00:02:47.370> I

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
fastest car here but actually because I

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.280 
fastest car here but actually because I
think<00:02:47.489> it's<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.790> slowest<00:02:48.329> what<00:02:49.049> that'll<00:02:49.260> mean

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
think it's the slowest what that'll mean

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.080 
think it's the slowest what that'll mean
is<00:02:49.530> we<00:02:49.680> will<00:02:49.739> have<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> front-row<00:02:50.459> seat<00:02:50.610> of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
is we will have a front-row seat of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.610 
is we will have a front-row seat of
exactly<00:02:51.450> what's<00:02:51.659> going<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:51.989> ahead<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.230> us<00:02:52.409> as

exactly what's going on ahead of us as

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.289 
exactly what's going on ahead of us as
this<00:02:53.099> lock<00:02:53.310> disappear<00:02:53.819> into<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.090> distance

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
this lock disappear into the distance

this lock disappear into the distance
we're<00:02:55.290> not<00:02:55.379> going<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.680> anything

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
we're not going to do anything
