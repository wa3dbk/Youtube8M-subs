00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Finally he is there after 13 years 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.589
 is the second generation of the volvo 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.809
 xc90 is almost in front of the front door in june 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.049
 the launch and i am allowed now 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 currently on the d5 awd once it test drive 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.599
 not only is visually a nice car 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.100
 become in my eyes maybe 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.359
 even a bit better than the q7 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 but only on the edge 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.900
 ace also completely new architecture new 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.519
 Motor new infotainment is overall 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.439
 only a percent of the current volvo 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.279
 been adopted models that is the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.009
 kindersitz 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.710
 otherwise everything is completely new 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.070
 The striking thing about the front is how you look at it 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.870
 Here Thor's Hammer sees the quasi that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.690
 daytime running light is and also the whole 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.050
 Fabric is completely made of LED means also 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 who does not and also the dimming and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 reacts accordingly intelligently 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.190
 oncoming traffic 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.260
 Unfortunately, I'm traveling alone today 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.829
 That's why I have to look at this mass 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.570
 take care of information here yourself 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 it's just extremely much it is 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.489
 really a completely new came so 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.110
 this new as you in an English 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.750
 is really applies here because it 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 is all times platform scalable 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.810
 platform architect also the models 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.479
 until direction pregnant series 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.080
 In the near future, there will be air suspension among farmers 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:24.409
 new infotainment system completely new 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:30.750
 head up display drives new design 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.549
 megageil soundsystem new so actually 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.930
 he would have to be in the video here for three 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.430
 take hours because otherwise you actually 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.310
 I'll try anything hinbekommen 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.960
 nevertheless times is relatively scarce 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.280
 the wood comes here sweden what 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.689
 Installed here it feels very good 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.189
 an open castle is the buttons 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.579
 I can not compare anything to him 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.450
 In the world, there are cars in the world 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.320
 Do you really know more about it? 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.920
 Let's get high-quality sound system for 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.860
 home 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.840
 maybe there are such buttons in 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.520
 this rippled the soundsystem 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.600
 yourself is welcome by bose 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.470
 is genius 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.680
 It does not really work as I know it 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.709
 penetrate bass 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.959
 But this concert is a long time off 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.280
 Gothenburg is really coming through 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.840
 and that does not just come through here 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.939
 but also comes to the back of the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.200
 third row of seats because we have in 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:31.120
 in the roof sky behind two 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.709
 speakers and the system is like that 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.239
 made 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.620
 that 's because this crohn concert 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.989
 Concert hall setting then runs fire 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.150
 the speakers are the sounds 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.239
 different depending on position 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.359
 that means I have everywhere at the same time 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.810
 in principle the same sound as it 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.859
 it's just in a concert hall too 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.019
 not time-delayed but easy 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:00.849
 directly everything right at the safe one 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.810
 It has been proper work 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.669
 really good as well as well 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 the infotainment system is actually 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:12.280
 not a friend of touch but it is very 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.239
 very clear because even if 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.769
 not even a big thing 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.139
 for example, choose navigation 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.510
 the other options do not disappear 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.250
 completely but they just slip in 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.569
 down a bit means I have the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.979
 I always see the air conditioning I see 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.629
 whatever is going on for a music 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.139
 and i can be right with a top 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.419
 my turn 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.069
 you can change it and I can too 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.109
 always about this little inconspicuous one 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.590
 home-button as it actually is 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.639
 iphone is solved quite clever I come 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.409
 not back on my main screen 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.090
 no matter where I am just not yet active 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.699
 in the settings me mussed 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.530
 or if I'm just straight from 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:50.259
 a song just happen to be away 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.019
 press to drop here is the 5 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:55.120
 motor me through various other models 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.989
 already known and also in connection with 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.370
 the eight-course automatic of food 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.109
 actually works quite well it is 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.840
 still this little problem with 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.280
 approach such a 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.739
 only second is not quite as smith 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.530
 but otherwise first cream you can 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.319
 not say 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.889
 only the consumption is of course a bit 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.940
 about which one is specified 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.310
 if now at just one to one and a half 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.620
 liters of standard consumption but arrive 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.350
 a good two tons 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.789
 since the four-cylinder must ever 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.710
 But I also said the money 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.150
 would pay it because he is in mine 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.530
 eyes currently the most interesting car 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.919
 from infotainment system 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.810
 He sees luxury in this suv 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.789
 Simply phenomenal because he is with 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.669
 principle with the predecessor except these 1 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.740
 percent has nothing left to do and that 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.830
 I also find very pleasing in the design 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.020
 because the xc90 warm and closet and 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.110
 here we also have in principle 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.800
 this cabinet form but by certain 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.889
 Design lines are complete 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.090
 relaxed and that is why in mine 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.070
 eyes currently the most beautiful big suv there 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.990
 just right from the beginning to the end 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.949
 in this car i would like for the 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:16.440
 Four ladies would give this because of it 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.440
 Just think of it in the square
