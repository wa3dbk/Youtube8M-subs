rocketjump rocket jumps a really nice
AoE<00:01:42.680> ability<00:01:43.160> it's<00:01:43.700> got<00:01:43.970> lower<00:01:44.360> base<00:01:44.750> damage

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
AoE ability it's got lower base damage

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.700 
AoE ability it's got lower base damage
at<00:01:45.560> level<00:01:45.950> 1<00:01:46.160> but<00:01:46.400> it<00:01:46.790> builds<00:01:47.000> up<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.710> certainly

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
at level 1 but it builds up to certainly

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.880 
at level 1 but it builds up to certainly
respectable<00:01:49.460> base<00:01:49.640> damage<00:01:49.910> and<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:51.110> got<00:01:51.380> a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
high not a one point not a one-to-one

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.670 
high not a one point not a one-to-one
ratio<00:01:59.350> but<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.560> believe<00:02:01.370> it's<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.690> 0<00:02:03.140> point

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
ratio but I believe it's in the 0 point

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.820 
ratio but I believe it's in the 0 point
70<00:02:04.340> point<00:02:04.610> 8<00:02:04.820> range<00:02:05.120> kind<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:06.130> ratio<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:08.830> not

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
70 point 8 range kind of ratio it's not

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.680 
70 point 8 range kind of ratio it's not
amazing<00:02:10.130> for<00:02:10.520> damage<00:02:10.820> but<00:02:11.210> it<00:02:11.240> does<00:02:11.480> have<00:02:11.660> a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
amazing for damage but it does have a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.970 
amazing for damage but it does have a
very<00:02:12.020> large<00:02:12.230> AoE<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:13.270> more<00:02:14.270> importantly<00:02:14.980> it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
very large AoE and more importantly it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.040 
very large AoE and more importantly it
actually<00:02:16.730> refreshes<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.540> cooldown

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
actually refreshes the cooldown

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.530 
actually refreshes the cooldown
instantly<00:02:18.740> whenever<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.880> get<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.090> kill<00:02:20.390> or

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
instantly whenever you get a kill or

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.260 
instantly whenever you get a kill or
assist<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.830> makes<00:02:22.130> doing<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.580> lot<00:02:22.850> of<00:02:22.910> damage

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
assist this makes doing a lot of damage

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.570 
assist this makes doing a lot of damage
in<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.600> teamfight<00:02:23.900> where<00:02:24.470> your<00:02:24.590> team<00:02:25.310> is

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
interesting is that it's actually

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.320 
interesting is that it's actually
well<00:02:56.060> its<00:02:56.570> got<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.780> reduced<00:02:57.230> healing<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:58.330> the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
well its got the reduced healing and the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.220 
well its got the reduced healing and the
same<00:02:59.720> duration<00:03:00.620> as<00:03:00.920> ignite<00:03:01.930> think<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.080> this

damage and some amazing ratios it's

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.980 
damage and some amazing ratios it's
better<00:04:54.930> than<00:04:55.080> one<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.380> one<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:55.889> I<00:04:56.070> believe<00:04:56.160> a

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
better than one to one it is I believe a
