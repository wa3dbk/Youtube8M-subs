 You have already checked here in the high jump a matter with collectors of 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.289

 recently all over the world 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.429
 and I still 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.449
 but today we are going to take to know 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.720
 the ambassador of football what we are going to do in the right way for the wrong and 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 vice versa in the month of March 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.110
 they hired me where they came up with the idea of ​​creating this left over tables can 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.880
 be bought 3 thousand basic baskets to the good name 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.300
 let's attack the people feel the pressure 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.879
 We have to bring it here now. 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.719
 the event lasted four days 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.969
 itu - what was the first shirt 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.239
 we had so much pressure on the vote even without the other 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.990
 like the liquidation of a coffee shop of the 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.320
 little missing 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.010
 buy a t-shirt 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.460
 where you are 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.470
 after two days with two hours 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.700
 there my collection that I am able to predict with 77% this month 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.770
 but who wants to say with security are few but I saw that it had to give 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.020
 There was not a problem with the exchange. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.760
 the intricate 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.580
 each of these problems 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.860
 the problem is that we do not know what their situation is so I have one 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 possibility of an increase of 2 30 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 it is necessary to recognize the body often has a staff 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.780
 trying to protect democracy 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.330
 the intestine is a currency of its own 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.500
 the toucan answered 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.290
 the staff likes to leave the board 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.350
 and manages to bring get carry material was used 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.439
 and what was the most expensive shirt ever sold here on the arm 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.770
 in the history of the shirt more expensive not to be thinking because I was at home 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.240
 in a week 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.220
 he said 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.460
 cars that do not meet the first hand 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.780
 with a Flemish debt shirt I think I had skills 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.059
 comprises thirty real reporters 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.829
 my comrade told that the father of 350 real medical personnel 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.159
 I understood God from heaven. 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.159
 You surprise us because we lose the issues that are worthless. 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:27.230
 while very much rivalry that are not big enough at home well 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.410
 had the courage to propose the mouth shirt and now has recently stood out 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.389
 with the Flemish shirt 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.020
 obviously lost a little more with 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.100
 the appeal of the guild to liberators but the serpent 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.560
 mouth with him and his attorney the S-Pauline the Differential - 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.749
 Flamengo 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.589
 so it never passed even from the red family itself 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.089
 I had what we are doing. 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:52.099
 and now we are 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.239
 I know 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.029
 It will not work in the classroom itself. 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.049
 in fact it was a price or there are still some 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.449
 how you behave open to visitation 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:10.250

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.109
 the team up to the cup 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.339
 he surrendered 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.469
 Your football, the steering wheel is back. 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.569
 people err 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.859
 these reserves 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.169
 is a pre-assessment every day a big difference arises 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:26.819
 what I mean 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.819
 so it does not fit elsewhere in the show 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:49.739
