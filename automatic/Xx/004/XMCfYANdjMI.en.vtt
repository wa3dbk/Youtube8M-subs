00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
yeah basically I can't fault it because

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.430 
yeah basically I can't fault it because
it's<00:02:41.750> churned<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:43.750> I'm<00:02:44.750> running<00:02:45.019> for<00:02:45.079> 30<00:02:45.260> more

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
it's churned and I'm running for 30 more

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.420 
it's churned and I'm running for 30 more
kilowatts<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.400> about<00:02:47.650> 250<00:02:48.650> more<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.280> it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
kilowatts and about 250 more and it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.210 
kilowatts and about 250 more and it
meters<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.879> torque<00:02:50.709> which<00:02:51.709> gives<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.099> little

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
meters of torque which gives it a little

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.940 
meters of torque which gives it a little
bit<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.489> punch

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
bit of punch

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.610 
bit of punch
it's<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.310> effortless<00:02:55.760> on<00:02:55.939> the<00:02:56.030> sand<00:02:56.620> and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
it's just effortless on the sand and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.229 
it's just effortless on the sand and

fine rock crawling everything to the
auto<00:02:59.390> box<00:02:59.720> makes<00:03:00.019> everything<00:03:00.319> so<00:03:00.590> much<00:03:00.709> more

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
auto box makes everything so much more

descent<00:03:03.109> control<00:03:03.379> just<00:03:03.890> makes<00:03:04.069> everything

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
descent control just makes everything

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.030 
descent control just makes everything
just<00:03:05.150> make<00:03:05.299> something<00:03:05.480> beautiful

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
just make something beautiful

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.729 
just make something beautiful
so<00:03:07.760> basically<00:03:12.730> lancelin<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.150> then<00:03:14.780> sort<00:03:15.709> of

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
so basically lancelin and then sort of

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.500 
so basically lancelin and then sort of
midway<00:03:16.099> through<00:03:16.129> next<00:03:16.609> year<00:03:16.819> I'm<00:03:17.120> hoping<00:03:17.389> to

out to the Holland track you've probably
seen<00:03:27.109> my<00:03:27.560> other<00:03:27.769> videos<00:03:28.099> in<00:03:28.310> my<00:03:28.430> old<00:03:28.639> car

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
seen my other videos in my old car

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.229 
seen my other videos in my old car
spending<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.220> few<00:03:31.400> days<00:03:31.609> out<00:03:31.819> there<00:03:32.000> on<00:03:32.150> the

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
track itself you know I might stay in

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.839 
track itself you know I might stay in
one<00:03:35.239> place<00:03:35.389> for<00:03:35.720> an<00:03:36.199> idle<00:03:36.500> -<00:03:36.709> rather<00:03:37.579> than

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
one place for an idle - rather than

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.930 
one place for an idle - rather than
moving<00:03:38.060> on<00:03:38.299> every<00:03:38.569> day<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.900> here<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.940> here's

much<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:09.859> the<00:04:10.010> old<00:04:10.129> car<00:04:10.489> runs<00:04:10.940> through<00:04:11.150> the

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
much like the old car runs through the

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.990 
much like the old car runs through the
transfer<00:04:11.750> case<00:04:12.049> with<00:04:12.079> you<00:04:15.639> because<00:04:16.639> it's<00:04:16.789> very

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
transfer case with you because it's very

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.759 
transfer case with you because it's very
different<00:04:17.150> in<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.389> oil<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.409> what<00:04:18.560> all<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
different in the oil and what all the

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.649 
different in the oil and what all the
controls<00:04:19.130> doing<00:04:19.430> things<00:04:19.639> like<00:04:19.729> that<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.570> I'll

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
controls doing things like that and I'll

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.029 
controls doing things like that and I'll
be<00:04:20.750> showing<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.199> few<00:04:21.440> different<00:04:21.560> bits<00:04:21.889> and

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
be showing you a few different bits and

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.379 
be showing you a few different bits and
pieces<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.370> I'm<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.880> I've<00:04:22.970> done<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.300> the

on the if I would continuously freeway

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:22.570 
on the if I would continuously freeway
driving<00:05:16.810> but<00:05:19.330> yeah<00:05:20.330> it's<00:05:20.510> it's<00:05:21.580> pretty

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
driving but yeah it's it's pretty

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.610 
driving but yeah it's it's pretty
