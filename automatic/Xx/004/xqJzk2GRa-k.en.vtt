and I said that the governor he's on can

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.850 
and I said that the governor he's on can
I<00:03:05.360> tell<00:03:05.569> that<00:03:05.599> story<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.290> air<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.590> he<00:03:06.650> said

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.800 
I tell that story on the air and he said
you<00:03:06.980> know<00:03:07.239> absolutely<00:03:08.239> he<00:03:08.330> didn't<00:03:08.569> care<00:03:08.690> which

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.660 
you know absolutely he didn't care which
which<00:03:09.080> leads<00:03:09.290> me<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.500> believe<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:10.580> he

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
which leads me to believe that that he

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.479 
which leads me to believe that that he
