 December that you can vote and that 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.110

 last year and is that the truth is that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 also when we are in the photo world 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.690
 when I speak with you always I 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.829
 You say fuck that Bieber is in the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.289
 photographs of the day and the truth is that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.780
 if there are very good photographs during 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.039
 this month of December but well let's 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.750
 see what the 5 photographs have been 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 most voted, let's start with the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 fifth photograph that is the photograph 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.240
 of December 5th that has had 10 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.190
 votes let's see it let's go up to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 up what is this senator photograph 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.890
 when I with this photograph as 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.140
 photograph of the day I told you 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.120
 loved the light I loved those shades 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 blue yes it is true that women 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.570
 is a bit burned here this part of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.580
 armpit but you fix the lighting 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.680
 what does that water look like? 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.050
 so blue of that color so turquoise that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.090
 I loved the fourth picture 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.490
 It is the photograph of December 18 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.259
 who has 16 votes we will go down to 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.240
 on the 18th which is this photograph of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.770
 car is a photograph that maybe 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.009
 many of you can think that it is a 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.659
 photograph then taken we can say that 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.800
 would have usually because always 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.630
 we go in the car with the camera we have 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.190
 well the feeling of doing this kind of 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.560
 photographs but notice that it is a 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.390
 exhibition let's say long between 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 quotes because we can see how the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.110
 road lines are moved 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.340
 But look how perfectly all 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.979
 the interior of the car that we do not have 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.509
 nothing nothing moved something that is not easy and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.460
 I also believe that white work and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.500
 black is certainly a success in 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.450
 this photograph the third photograph 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.190
 Most voted is the photograph of the 31st 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.420
 December that is this photograph of 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.649
 this time a little bit like the one 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.630
 we had previously set as 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.160
 we have that wheel spinning around and like 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.260
 we have now these people who are here 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.910
 observing completely completely 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.050
 frozen is worth in this photograph another 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.360
 of things the lines fixed 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.640
 the circulars that this merry-go-round does and 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.960
 said ferris wheel this roundabout the second 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.760
 most voted photograph is photography 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.650
 of December 22 that this one has 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.360
 40 votes has been a month in which the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.700
 two first photographs have had a 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.230
 lot of votes and it has been the month with more 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.060
 that is, we have broken the record of 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.490
 votes that have been you two hundred-odd 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.560

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.300
 December with 40 votes that is this 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.400
 photograph of this girl is worth what 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.070
 say this photograph simply because 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.870
 the face that girl's smile is what 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.790

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.290
 all landscape photographs these months 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.700
 we already noticed that we are more in winter 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.320
 that there are fewer beach photographs 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.240
 although we have some photography still 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.590

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.740
 then we move on to an urban landscape like 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.910

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.979
