decided<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.710> different<00:00:41.340> time<00:00:41.579> would

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
decided that but a different time would

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.500 
decided that but a different time would
be<00:00:42.360> better<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.930> different<00:00:43.739> situation<00:00:44.510> but

be better a different situation but
right<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.190> one

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
right now it's just not the right one

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.650 
right now it's just not the right one
and<00:00:48.649> I'm<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.980> proud<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.360> accepted

and<00:00:55.190> I<00:00:56.190> made<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> final<00:00:57.120> cut<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.050> didn't

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and I made the final cut but I didn't
