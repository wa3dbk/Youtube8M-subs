00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
it was the it was just it was just the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.780 
it was the it was just it was just the
fact<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.960> I<00:02:56.080> was<00:02:56.230> by<00:02:56.410> myself<00:02:56.650> out<00:02:57.130> there<00:02:57.550> and

driver<00:03:57.190> eraser<00:03:58.000> eraser<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.540> mean<00:03:58.780> do<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:58.930> have

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
driver eraser eraser I mean do you have

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.100 
driver eraser eraser I mean do you have
any<00:03:59.320> special<00:03:59.590> qualities<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.310> make<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:01.110> that

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
any special qualities that make you that

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.560 
any special qualities that make you that
gives<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.440> edge<00:04:02.560> maybe<00:04:02.860> well<00:04:03.850> I<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:04.090> guess

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
gives you the edge maybe well I I guess

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.420 
gives you the edge maybe well I I guess
it's<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:05.230> really<00:04:05.560> depends<00:04:05.980> on<00:04:06.070> your

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
it's it really depends on your

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.480 
it's it really depends on your
personality<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:07.210> think<00:04:07.710> ideally<00:04:08.710> for<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.010> racing

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
personality I think ideally for a racing

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.120 
personality I think ideally for a racing
driver<00:04:09.640> it's<00:04:09.970> important<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.660> be<00:04:11.500> cool<00:04:11.860> calm

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
driver it's important to be cool calm

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.300 
driver it's important to be cool calm
and<00:04:12.160> collected<00:04:13.060> basically<00:04:13.750> because<00:04:14.310> you're

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
and collected basically because you're

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.710 
and collected basically because you're
dealing<00:04:15.610> with<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.760> lot<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:16.090> stresses<00:04:16.330> in<00:04:16.540> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
dealing with a lot of stresses in the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.539 
dealing with a lot of stresses in the
car<00:04:16.960> you're<00:04:17.380> dealing<00:04:17.680> with<00:04:17.710> pressure<00:04:18.070> from

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
car you're dealing with pressure from

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.660 
car you're dealing with pressure from
your<00:04:18.670> team<00:04:18.940> from<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:20.650> people<00:04:20.980> around<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.520> and

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
your team from the people around you and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.610 
your team from the people around you and
I<00:04:21.790> guess<00:04:22.000> all<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.360> that<00:04:22.510> comes<00:04:22.870> into<00:04:23.080> play<00:04:23.200> when

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
I guess all of that comes into play when

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.080 
I guess all of that comes into play when
you're<00:04:23.710> out<00:04:23.860> there<00:04:23.890> on<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.280> racetrack<00:04:24.460> but

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
you're out there on the racetrack but

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.600 
you're out there on the racetrack but
you<00:04:25.570> have<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.810> be<00:04:25.930> able<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.230> switch<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.370> off

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
you have to be able to switch that off

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.510 
you have to be able to switch that off
and<00:04:28.180> push<00:04:28.630> that<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:29.020> one<00:04:29.590> side<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.010> just<00:04:30.070> focus

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
and push that to one side and just focus

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.790 
and push that to one side and just focus
on<00:04:30.700> on<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.180> racing<00:04:31.600> basically<00:04:32.170> so<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.470> guess

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
on on the racing basically so I guess

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.180 
on on the racing basically so I guess
maybe<00:04:33.490> one<00:04:34.210> trait<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.750> I'm<00:04:34.960> kind<00:04:35.919> of<00:04:35.979> known

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
maybe one trait that I'm kind of known

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.370 
maybe one trait that I'm kind of known
for<00:04:36.490> is<00:04:36.580> just<00:04:36.820> being<00:04:37.000> cool<00:04:37.450> about<00:04:37.720> everything

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
for is just being cool about everything

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.870 
for is just being cool about everything
I'm<00:04:38.560> not<00:04:38.650> letting<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.340> pressure

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
I'm not letting the pressure

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.400 
I'm not letting the pressure
to<00:04:40.000> me<00:04:40.120> oh<00:04:40.270> cool<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.810> are<00:04:40.960> cool<00:04:41.380> you

the ranks granted rather the the biggest

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.390 
the ranks granted rather the the biggest
plan<00:07:31.020> is<00:07:31.200> obviously<00:07:31.530> Formula<00:07:31.950> one<00:07:32.100> what's<00:07:32.340> the

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
plan is obviously Formula one what's the

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.740 
plan is obviously Formula one what's the
what's<00:07:32.730> the<00:07:32.760> next<00:07:33.030> step<00:07:33.240> from<00:07:33.360> here

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750 
what's the next step from here

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.650 
what's the next step from here
well<00:07:34.260> the<00:07:34.800> now<00:07:35.190> I'm<00:07:35.340> in<00:07:35.490> GP<00:07:35.850> three<00:07:36.150> and<00:07:36.419> the

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 
well the now I'm in GP three and the

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.320 
well the now I'm in GP three and the
next<00:07:36.960> logical<00:07:37.620> step<00:07:37.980> would<00:07:38.310> be<00:07:38.370> GP<00:07:38.850> two<00:07:39.060> and

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
next logical step would be GP two and

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.240 
next logical step would be GP two and
then<00:07:39.960> this<00:07:40.140> would<00:07:40.320> be<00:07:40.470> the<00:07:40.620> last<00:07:40.770> step<00:07:41.070> before

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.250 
then this would be the last step before

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.180 
then this would be the last step before
Formula<00:07:41.850> One<00:07:42.030> so<00:07:42.450> depending<00:07:43.260> on<00:07:43.380> my<00:07:43.680> results
