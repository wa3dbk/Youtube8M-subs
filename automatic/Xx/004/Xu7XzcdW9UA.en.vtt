00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.260
 hello everyone again you Eugene 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.020
 see the second lesson on the program 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.349
 unity3d 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.330
 first lesson we learned interface blame 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:29.420
 in the second lesson I will introduce you to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:33.150
 building most elementary unity scene 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.230
 immediately apologize for the long 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.110
 lack of lessons and thanks to your 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.980
 requests and the fact that there was free 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:49.680
 time decided to write down 2 lesson 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:54.660
 and so for a start we will create on our scene 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:00.570
 well or a floor we will set a plane 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:08.250
 its from the cube and so the game object 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:13.580
 tried a per cube I started putting a cube in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:18.799
 origin on all three axes 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:24.990
 further by using the modifier scale 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:35.490
 compress it along the y axis and stretch it along x 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:39.630
 under this one for 100 units as you see our 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 the stage appeared now to us 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.210
 light source required 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.610
 click on the game object crit for 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:54.590
 and choose the type of light we take a point 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:59.210
 light source i.e. point light 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.210
 put it also the origin 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:25.790
 but on the y- axis we raise up by changing 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:25.790
 range parameter i.e. power per 100 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.730
 as you see on the scene appeared 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.069
 exact light source we can also 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.019
 change his light here the whole palette 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:44.510
 green red blue whatever you want 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:52.610
 choose the ones you need 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:03:00.989
 Well, now we will create the main character 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:04.680
 can be used in general for this 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.739
 go to the project tab in the folder 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.620
 standard sites find the director folder 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.049
 controller and we take either first person 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:20.370
 controller and boxer should controller well 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.549
 let's say first also put its beginning 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.549
 coordinates 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.700
 but let's raise it up a little bit along the y axis and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:43.000
 let's try to see what we did 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.000
 this click on the play button 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.590
 see that there is no we see nothing for 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.380
 In order to understand what we are starting 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:00.380
 better move better use not 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:16.700
 first person controller account person 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:22.880
 controller so try see what you 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:27.460
 started to control the character run by 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.460
 the stage is everything we did 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.260
