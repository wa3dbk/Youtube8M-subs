essentially<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.620> OLED<00:00:44.129> you've<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:44.489> cells

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
essentially with OLED you've got cells

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.369 
essentially with OLED you've got cells
that<00:00:45.059> emit<00:00:45.239> their<00:00:45.420> own<00:00:45.450> light<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.140> sit

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that emit their own light and they sit

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.510 
that emit their own light and they sit
right<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.680> next<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> glass

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
right up next to the glass

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.209 
right up next to the glass
these<00:00:48.090> things<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.600> hellishly<00:00:49.140> black<00:00:49.559> it's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
these things get hellishly black it's

nature documentary in action film these

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.630 
nature documentary in action film these
are<00:01:09.689> Billy<00:01:09.869> adept<00:01:10.260> machines<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.159> render

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
are Billy adept machines they can render

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.870 
are Billy adept machines they can render
all<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> beautifully

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
