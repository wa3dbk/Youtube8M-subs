go find a match here i am very high up

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.859 
go find a match here i am very high up
in<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.170> trophy<00:01:32.409> counts<00:01:32.799> 1600<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:34.570> for<00:01:34.750> my

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
in the trophy counts 1600 like for my

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.230 
in the trophy counts 1600 like for my
base<00:01:35.049> its<00:01:35.260> kind<00:01:35.440> of<00:01:35.530> high<00:01:35.650> so<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.490> may<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.119> a

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
base its kind of high so it may be a

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.289 
base its kind of high so it may be a
little<00:01:37.360> bit<00:01:37.570> harder<00:01:38.110> what's<00:01:38.979> seen<00:01:39.310> this<00:01:40.030> one

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
little bit harder what's seen this one

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.640 
little bit harder what's seen this one
be<00:01:40.420> really<00:01:40.750> easy<00:01:40.780> but<00:01:41.200> i<00:01:41.260> don't<00:01:41.409> think<00:01:41.439> it's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
be really easy but i don't think it's

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.550 
be really easy but i don't think it's
enough<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:43.049> we're<00:01:44.049> gonna<00:01:44.140> go<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:44.409> look<00:01:44.500> for

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
enough so we're gonna go and look for

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.640 
enough so we're gonna go and look for
over<00:01:45.150> 250,000<00:01:46.150> i'll<00:01:46.299> settle<00:01:46.810> for<00:01:46.900> 200<00:01:47.500> if<00:01:47.560> it

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
over 250,000 i'll settle for 200 if it

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.530 
over 250,000 i'll settle for 200 if it
comes<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:48.010> its<00:01:48.130> what<00:01:49.030> we<00:01:49.119> definitely<00:01:49.420> need<00:01:49.510> to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
comes to its what we definitely need to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
alright guys looking a little bit from

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.110 
alright guys looking a little bit from
this<00:02:13.599> base<00:02:13.890> from<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.920> pumps<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.790> stuff<00:02:15.819> like

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
this base from the pumps and stuff like

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.870 
this base from the pumps and stuff like
that<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.770> do<00:02:17.860> another<00:02:17.980> raid<00:02:18.250> on<00:02:18.520> sepa

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
that so we can do another raid on sepa

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.620 
that so we can do another raid on sepa
so<00:02:19.030> guys<00:02:19.209> if<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.750> don't<00:02:19.900> get<00:02:19.989> that<00:02:20.050> much

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630

so guys if we don't get that much
let's<00:02:20.780> go<00:02:20.840> ahead<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.110> see<00:02:21.350> how<00:02:22.160> much<00:02:22.310> exactly

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
let's go ahead and see how much exactly

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.780 
let's go ahead and see how much exactly
is<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.360> these<00:02:23.510> let's<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:23.870> if<00:02:23.960> it's<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.110> lot<00:02:24.790> it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
is in these let's see if it's a lot it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.240 
is in these let's see if it's a lot it
looks<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.240> so<00:02:26.660> we<00:02:26.780> can<00:02:26.930> go<00:02:27.140> for<00:02:27.410> all<00:02:27.890> of

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
looks like it is so we can go for all of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.210 
looks like it is so we can go for all of
these<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.640> we'll<00:02:29.120> see<00:02:29.930> how<00:02:29.990> much<00:02:30.020> man<00:02:30.230> gets<00:02:30.470> so

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
these and we'll see how much man gets so

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.730 
these and we'll see how much man gets so
place<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> few<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:31.910> these<00:02:32.000> here<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:33.350> my

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
easily we'll see how it goes Giants

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.000 
easily we'll see how it goes Giants
should<00:05:24.020> be<00:05:24.110> doing<00:05:24.290> a<00:05:24.320> little<00:05:24.470> bit<00:05:24.590> damaged<00:05:24.860> on

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
should be doing a little bit damaged on

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.070 
should be doing a little bit damaged on
those<00:05:25.130> walls<00:05:25.340> right<00:05:25.520> now<00:05:25.670> and<00:05:25.820> then<00:05:26.660> put<00:05:26.900> in

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
those walls right now and then put in

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.920 
those walls right now and then put in
Russia<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.800> goblins<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:31.570> looks<00:05:32.570> like<00:05:32.690> we<00:05:32.780> got

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
Russia the goblins and looks like we got

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.120 
Russia the goblins and looks like we got
we<00:05:33.110> didn't<00:05:33.260> get<00:05:33.350> that<00:05:33.440> much<00:05:33.590> guys<00:05:33.830> we're<00:05:34.040> not

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
we didn't get that much guys we're not

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.890 
we didn't get that much guys we're not
getting<00:05:34.370> into<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.700> center<00:05:34.970> arm<00:05:37.720> we<00:05:38.720> just

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
getting into the center arm we just

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.030 
getting into the center arm we just
can't<00:05:39.050> seem<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.290> get<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:39.500> let's<00:05:39.710> try<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:39.950> get

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
can't seem to get it let's try and get

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.400 
can't seem to get it let's try and get
these<00:05:40.190> pumps<00:05:40.970> and<00:05:41.150> then<00:05:41.390> we'll<00:05:41.540> see<00:05:41.690> okay<00:05:42.320> so

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
these pumps and then we'll see okay so

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.750 
these pumps and then we'll see okay so
now<00:05:42.530> the<00:05:42.590> goblins<00:05:42.920> are<00:05:43.040> channeling<00:05:43.520> towards

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
now the goblins are channeling towards

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.680 
now the goblins are channeling towards
the<00:05:43.850> center<00:05:44.090> if<00:05:44.180> they<00:05:44.240> can<00:05:44.270> break<00:05:44.510> through

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
the center if they can break through

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.540 
the center if they can break through
this<00:05:44.840> wall<00:05:44.900> then<00:05:45.590> we<00:05:45.710> can<00:05:45.860> get<00:05:46.010> it<00:05:46.100> very<00:05:46.340> easily

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
this wall then we can get it very easily

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.220 
this wall then we can get it very easily
but<00:05:47.420> it<00:05:47.660> looks<00:05:47.780> like<00:05:47.840> they're<00:05:48.050> being

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
but it looks like they're being

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.050 
but it looks like they're being
destroyed<00:05:48.740> by<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.860> mortars<00:05:52.340> and<00:05:52.430> stuff<00:05:52.700> so

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
destroyed by the mortars and stuff so

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.000 
destroyed by the mortars and stuff so
we'll<00:05:53.660> see<00:05:53.810> how<00:05:53.840> it<00:05:53.900> goes<00:05:53.990> they<00:05:54.710> should<00:05:54.890> be

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
we'll see how it goes they should be

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.030 
we'll see how it goes they should be
able<00:05:55.100> to<00:05:55.280> get<00:05:55.400> closer<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.270> it<00:05:56.360> right<00:05:56.540> here<00:05:56.780> and

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
able to get closer to it right here and

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.680 
able to get closer to it right here and
maybe<00:05:58.040> break<00:05:58.670> the<00:05:58.790> wall<00:05:58.970> nope<00:05:59.450> they're<00:05:59.630> not

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
maybe break the wall nope they're not

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.420 
maybe break the wall nope they're not
going<00:05:59.840> to<00:05:59.900> get<00:06:00.020> it<00:06:00.110> so<00:06:00.350> that<00:06:00.950> was<00:06:01.100> pretty<00:06:01.280> much

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
going to get it so that was pretty much

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.100 
going to get it so that was pretty much
a<00:06:01.490> failed<00:06:01.760> right<00:06:01.940> guys<00:06:02.150> but<00:06:02.540> we<00:06:02.780> can<00:06:02.900> go<00:06:03.050> ahead

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
a failed right guys but we can go ahead

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.490 
a failed right guys but we can go ahead
drop<00:06:04.100> to<00:06:04.310> their<00:06:04.460> see<00:06:04.730> if<00:06:04.790> it's<00:06:04.910> worth<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.300> and

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.330 

you<00:06:09.500> know<00:06:09.590> what<00:06:09.740> guys<00:06:09.830> I<00:06:10.010> don't<00:06:10.130> think<00:06:10.250> it's

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
you know what guys I don't think it's

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.440 
you know what guys I don't think it's
worth<00:06:10.490> it<00:06:10.550> but<00:06:10.670> we're<00:06:10.790> gonna<00:06:10.880> put<00:06:10.970> that<00:06:11.120> there

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
worth it but we're gonna put that there

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.720 
worth it but we're gonna put that there
and<00:06:11.630> we<00:06:12.380> can<00:06:12.500> at<00:06:12.560> least<00:06:12.650> get<00:06:12.890> a<00:06:13.130> decent<00:06:13.160> amounts

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
and we can at least get a decent amounts

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.810 
and we can at least get a decent amounts
from<00:06:13.970> this<00:06:14.120> raid<00:06:14.390> so<00:06:15.290> that<00:06:15.770> wasn't<00:06:16.250> going<00:06:16.670> as

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
from this raid so that wasn't going as

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.770 
from this raid so that wasn't going as
planned<00:06:16.850> we<00:06:17.150> should<00:06:17.270> have<00:06:17.360> had<00:06:17.450> a<00:06:17.480> little<00:06:17.600> more

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780

Giants and less archers but we did get a

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.660 
Giants and less archers but we did get a

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
decent amount so in the battle here and

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.830 
decent amount so in the battle here and
there<00:06:25.670> we<00:06:25.790> can<00:06:25.910> we<00:06:26.000> made<00:06:26.180> up<00:06:26.300> for<00:06:26.450> what<00:06:26.570> we<00:06:26.660> lost

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840
