I rather be a leader or follower and I

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:55.149 
I rather be a leader or follower and I

wasn't really sure what to say to that I

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.580 
wasn't really sure what to say to that I
I<00:01:55.490> feel<00:01:56.119> like<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.479> really<00:01:56.779> important<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.349> be

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
I feel like it's really important to be

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.499 
I feel like it's really important to be
a<00:01:57.619> leader<00:01:57.919> but<00:01:58.520> if<00:01:58.639> everyone<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.209> leader

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
a leader but if everyone is a leader

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.359 
a leader but if everyone is a leader
that's<00:02:00.020> how<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.229> lot<00:02:00.469> of<00:02:00.529> division<00:02:00.979> happens

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
that's how a lot of division happens

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.969 
that's how a lot of division happens
like<00:02:01.759> splitting<00:02:02.149> up<00:02:02.359> and<00:02:02.569> no<00:02:03.499> one<00:02:03.529> wants<00:02:03.919> to

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
like splitting up and no one wants to

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.099 
like splitting up and no one wants to
follow<00:02:04.130> because<00:02:04.479> what<00:02:05.479> is<00:02:05.599> a<00:02:05.630> leader<00:02:05.899> if

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
follow because what is a leader if

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.410 
follow because what is a leader if
there's<00:02:06.259> no<00:02:06.380> followers<00:02:06.859> and<00:02:07.099> what<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
there's no followers and what is a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.810 
there's no followers and what is a
follower<00:02:08.840> if<00:02:08.929> there's<00:02:09.110> no<00:02:09.229> leaders<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.580> gave

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
follower if there's no leaders so I gave

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.900 
follower if there's no leaders so I gave
some<00:02:11.240> sort<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.480> answers<00:02:11.900> saying<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.410> I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
some sort of answers saying that I

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.330 
some sort of answers saying that I
believe<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.570> important<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.100> both

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
believe that it is important to be both

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.580 
believe that it is important to be both
a<00:02:15.520> leader<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.180> follower<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.350> need<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
a leader and a follower but you need to

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.890 
a leader and a follower but you need to
know<00:02:17.620> you're<00:02:17.980> right<00:02:18.220> time<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:19.390> can't<00:02:19.660> always

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
know you're right time you can't always

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.960 
know you're right time you can't always
be<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.200> leader<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:21.280> can't<00:02:21.520> always<00:02:21.730> be<00:02:21.940> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
be a leader and you can't always be a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.790 
be a leader and you can't always be a
follower<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.170> know<00:02:23.320> when<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.530> step

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
follower you have to know when to step

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.290 
follower you have to know when to step
up<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.160> plate<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:24.640> then<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:25.270> to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
up to the plate but then you have to

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.960 
up to the plate but then you have to
know<00:02:25.540> when<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.780> kind<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.080> back<00:02:26.320> off<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.970> I

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
know when to kind of back off and I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.890 
know when to kind of back off and I
don't<00:02:28.030> know<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.330> really<00:02:28.540> like<00:02:28.720> that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
don't know if you really like that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.200 
don't know if you really like that
answer<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:29.560> apparently<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.250> failed<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:31.030> whole

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
answer but apparently I failed the whole

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.660 
answer but apparently I failed the whole
interrogation<00:02:31.870> or<00:02:32.170> whatever<00:02:32.440> part<00:02:32.860> might

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
interrogation or whatever part might

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.890 
interrogation or whatever part might
have<00:02:33.790> been<00:02:33.880> something<00:02:34.150> else<00:02:34.390> some<00:02:34.840> other

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
have been something else some other

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.960 
have been something else some other
reasons<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:35.620> that's<00:02:36.100> why<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.310> changed<00:02:36.550> my<00:02:36.790> major

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
reasons so that's why I changed my major

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.490 
reasons so that's why I changed my major
to<00:02:37.090> computer<00:02:37.270> science<00:02:37.600> because<00:02:38.290> i<00:02:38.320> figured

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
to computer science because i figured

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.530 
to computer science because i figured
that<00:02:38.830> i<00:02:39.280> don't<00:02:39.910> want<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.150> working

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
that i don't want to be working

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.330 
that i don't want to be working
stressful<00:02:41.020> police<00:02:41.230> jobs<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.920> stuff<00:02:42.130> like

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
stressful police jobs and stuff like

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.580 
stressful police jobs and stuff like
that<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:42.940> yeah<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:43.930> now<00:02:44.080> i'm<00:02:44.200> doing<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.470> whole

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that so yeah so now i'm doing a whole

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.740 
that so yeah so now i'm doing a whole
bunch<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.860> programming<00:02:45.460> and<00:02:45.640> learning<00:02:46.450> java

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
bunch of programming and learning java

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.040 
bunch of programming and learning java
code<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.350> all<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.680> stuff<00:02:47.830> but<00:02:48.870> anyway<00:02:49.870> I

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
code and all that stuff but anyway I

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
code and all that stuff but anyway I
just<00:02:50.350> thought<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.830> was<00:02:50.950> interesting

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
just thought that was interesting

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.590 
just thought that was interesting
because<00:02:51.400> i<00:02:51.550> remembered<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:51.940> i<00:02:52.090> was<00:02:52.390> looking

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
criminal justice because I really

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.350 
criminal justice because I really
enjoyed<00:03:11.560> computer<00:03:11.980> science<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.490> a<00:03:12.760> lot<00:03:13.270> of

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
enjoyed computer science it's a lot of

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.120 
enjoyed computer science it's a lot of
critical<00:03:13.660> thinking<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.200> really<00:03:14.770> different

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
critical thinking and really different

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.740 
critical thinking and really different
but<00:03:15.610> um<00:03:15.820> yeah<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.330> rejection<00:03:16.450> letter<00:03:17.580> just

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
but um yeah the rejection letter just

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.510 
but um yeah the rejection letter just
says<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.870> wasn't<00:03:20.080> qualified<00:03:20.380> was<00:03:21.070> not<00:03:21.250> ready

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
says I wasn't qualified was not ready

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.420 
says I wasn't qualified was not ready
was<00:03:21.910> not<00:03:22.090> my<00:03:22.270> time<00:03:22.600> but<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.380> was<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:23.800> whenever

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
was not my time but I was just whenever

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.980 
was not my time but I was just whenever
I<00:03:24.610> look<00:03:24.670> at<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.030> letter<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.360> always<00:03:25.780> think

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
I look at that letter I always think

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.170 
I look at that letter I always think
back<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.470> question<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.010> he<00:03:27.400> asked<00:03:28.090> me

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
back to that question that he asked me

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.640 
back to that question that he asked me
because<00:03:28.480> that's<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.930> one<00:03:29.170> question<00:03:29.620> that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
because that's the one question that

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.110 
because that's the one question that
just<00:03:29.950> couldn't<00:03:30.130> answer<00:03:30.580> right<00:03:30.730> away<00:03:30.790> because

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
just couldn't answer right away because

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.870 
just couldn't answer right away because
it<00:03:31.810> was<00:03:32.140> really<00:03:32.470> weird<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.920> wasn't<00:03:33.280> sure<00:03:33.610> what

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
it was really weird I wasn't sure what

this party quest I think I was leading
it<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.760> don't<00:03:54.940> think<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.209> was<00:03:55.300> doing<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.510> very

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
it and I don't think I was doing a very

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.400 
it and I don't think I was doing a very
good<00:03:55.750> job<00:03:55.870> or<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.620> don't<00:03:57.160> even<00:03:57.250> remember<00:03:57.610> but<00:03:58.330> um

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
good job or I don't even remember but um

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.660 
good job or I don't even remember but um
yes<00:03:59.410> so<00:03:59.650> what<00:03:59.800> do<00:03:59.860> you<00:03:59.980> guys<00:04:00.070> think<00:04:00.130> do<00:04:00.610> you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
yes so what do you guys think do you

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.040 
yes so what do you guys think do you
guys<00:04:00.760> think<00:04:01.000> it's<00:04:01.209> more<00:04:01.360> important<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.840> be<00:04:01.930> a

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
guys think it's more important to be a

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.790 
guys think it's more important to be a
leader<00:04:02.320> or<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.850> follower<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:05.290> guess<00:04:05.470> that

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
leader or a follower and I guess that

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.260 
leader or a follower and I guess that
just<00:04:05.950> determines<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.550> someone's<00:04:06.850> personality

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
just determines on someone's personality

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.229 
just determines on someone's personality
may<00:04:07.660> be<00:04:07.720> or<00:04:08.020> how<00:04:08.920> someone<00:04:09.250> acts<00:04:09.459> or<00:04:09.760> what<00:04:10.060> kind

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
may be or how someone acts or what kind

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.240 
may be or how someone acts or what kind
of<00:04:10.270> situation<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.930> is<00:04:10.959> but<00:04:11.770> I'm<00:04:11.860> just<00:04:11.980> really

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.300 
of situation it is but I'm just really
curious<00:04:12.489> because<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:14.130> don't<00:04:15.130> really<00:04:15.220> see

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
curious because I don't really see

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.820 
curious because I don't really see
myself<00:04:15.730> as<00:04:16.120> being<00:04:16.330> a<00:04:16.480> leader<00:04:16.720> because<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.290> to
