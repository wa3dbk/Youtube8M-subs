00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.400
 A) Yes 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.630
 and already back and torch our 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.179
 stones we have them all ready and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.369
 notice that in the necklace there are rings 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.079
 then we can help us cables like 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.880
 in previous deliveries with tubes 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.710
 round with pieces that are 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.500
 triangular if they do not have can go to 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.210
 where a carpenter or a carpenter and 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.979
 ask them to do some profiles 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.149
 in triangular shape in square shape and 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.940
 with that you can do your 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.500
 rings weld them a little and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.420
 a little bit of welding and the hammers 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.930
 so here we have the rings and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.339
 ready the idea of ​​teaching them how we're doing 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.589
 to assemble the necklace 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.939
 you can also help with chucks 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.339
 that are coming for questions of 

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:00.320
 alhambrismo you can make the rings 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.140
 twisted also notice here there is a 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.970
 rings wound that the more 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.520
 different components we put to 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.409
 necklace more unique pieces it seems we can 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.240
 to give you crystallites you can put 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.850
 what you want then 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.770
 having here all the components we 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.570
 we are going to weld or nothing but we already have 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.790
 here everyone on the table is supposed to 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.270
 you at home already know how to put a point 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.110
 of welding that we are going to do 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.440
 important california 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.900
 a long necklace sometimes people put 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.600
 they place stones on the neck part and 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.640
 It is very annoying to be upset 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.860
 thick you feel like if you had 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.500
 something here then the ideal that they 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.530
 I recommend that there are chains that come 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.060
 manufactured if they do not get these chains 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.270
 that they sell in stores where they sell 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.360
 jewelery supplies and things to assemble 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.160
 garments they make with rings made 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 for yourselves, you cut them and arms 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.670
 string for the piece to be the portion 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.580
 of the neck one that is simply 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.170
 surrounded by chains and do not go princess 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.200
 so what are we going to do and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.390
 Sugar what I do has the necklace 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.450
 it must be long enough to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.910
 I can put it on my head if it's more 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.770
 short we should finish it by the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.650
 back with a ring and a 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.489
 brooch 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.780
 and look here here we have some 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.659
