00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.220
 Excites or the opposite as you say 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.710
 as a size he has experienced this is bread 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.760
 eaten for you as you see this new 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.789
 experience in your face that I do not like 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.660
 I like challenges I like 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.690
 I've done my whole career 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.690
 I have it very clear and good 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.150
 it is important to do what I have to do 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:57.690
 I think he can not change the course of 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.750
 of a team but but it is important that 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.930
 there is a great synergy among all 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.110
 to be able to make this work 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.340
 because in the end for that he hires us 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.440
 for that we are here you have to be 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.740
 productive must be effective within 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.620
 of the field and good this attend to the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.950

 responsible immediately and good everything but 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.770

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:36.610

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.870

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.080
 change 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.140
 Well, if you put a good face on it, I think 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.979
 nothing I think 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.060
 you have to adapt quickly and we know what 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.310
 good I know 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.490
 the requirement and responsibility that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.650
 there's the percentage issue 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.190
 doing as I told you a while ago doing 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.320

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.830

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.220
 chivas were as less subscribe 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.640

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.319
 Look, I thank you, Chivas, he 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.240
 the one who gave me again the 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.190
 opportunity 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.190
 the one that put me back the showcase 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.849
 believe me that to pass of the years or the 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.370
 tournaments every time you learn to enjoy and 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.260
 you learn to enjoy the pressure you learn 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.200
 to enjoy every day 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.750
 what is your baggage? 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.510
 you make the most of it every day you have to 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.840
 surrender because you do not know when 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.190
 can this end then 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.900
 as I tell you if I want to extend my 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.019
 I race to remain productive 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.610
 very effective and giving results that is 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.990
 lengthen your career you have thirty six 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.300

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.590
 even when you would like to want to be 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.600
 who want even exceed Copied 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.650
 I think you're going to mark it 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.490
 checking 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.660
 go physically 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.319
 your body 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.319
 the reflections 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.650
 being on the court being able to function 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.700
 as it should be 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.540
 at this moment there is the rabbit that 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.049

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.280

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.829

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.670
