hi guys today I'm doing a size

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.840 
hi guys today I'm doing a size
comparison<00:00:01.530> slash<00:00:02.280> review<00:00:02.669> on<00:00:02.820> my

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
comparison slash review on my

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.940 
comparison slash review on my
helicopters<00:00:03.629> that<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.840> have<00:00:04.020> basically<00:00:04.589> just

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
helicopters that I have basically just

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.760 
helicopters that I have basically just
to<00:00:05.040> help<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.310> guys<00:00:05.490> out<00:00:06.230> the<00:00:07.230> flying<00:00:07.589> which

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
to help you guys out the flying which

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.259 
to help you guys out the flying which
one<00:00:07.980> would<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.610> next<00:00:08.849> best<00:00:08.910> helicopter

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
one would be the next best helicopter

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.589 
one would be the next best helicopter
for<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.139> lined<00:00:10.710> up<00:00:10.830> all<00:00:11.010> my<00:00:11.190> tails<00:00:11.599> they're

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
for you I lined up all my tails they're

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.160 
for you I lined up all my tails they're
basically<00:00:13.110> all<00:00:13.230> even<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.639> can<00:00:14.809> see<00:00:15.809> that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
basically all even and you can see that

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.810 
basically all even and you can see that
there<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.859> quite<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> big<00:00:17.779> distance<00:00:18.779> between

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
there is a quite a big distance between

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.519 
there is a quite a big distance between
the<00:00:20.820> Nano<00:00:21.619> blade<00:00:22.619> nano<00:00:22.949> CP<00:00:23.850> compare<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.689> 700

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the Nano blade nano CP compare the 700

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.900 
the Nano blade nano CP compare the 700
back<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:27.560> yes<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> tape

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
back here yes so I just put out a tape

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.269 
back here yes so I just put out a tape
measure<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> nano<00:00:31.410> blade<00:00:32.040> Nano

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
measure to and from the nano blade Nano

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.760 
measure to and from the nano blade Nano
to<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:34.040> beginning<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:36.390> net<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> end

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
to the beginning of the net the the end

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.900 
to the beginning of the net the the end
of<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> nano<00:00:38.370> blade<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.570> end<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> 700

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
of the nano blade to the end of the 700

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.549 
of the nano blade to the end of the 700
it's<00:00:41.910> about<00:00:42.120> five<00:00:42.329> feet<00:00:42.600> longer

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it's about five feet longer

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.970 
it's about five feet longer
so<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.969> roughly<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.539> didn't<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> exact

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so just roughly I didn't get the exact

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.430 
so just roughly I didn't get the exact
measurements<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
measurements on that so that's kind of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
measurements on that so that's kind of
what<00:00:49.590> you're<00:00:49.739> dealing<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.039> five<00:00:50.399> feet<00:00:50.670> from

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
what you're dealing with five feet from

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.580 
what you're dealing with five feet from
the<00:00:51.090> Nano<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> 700<00:00:52.760> I'll<00:00:53.760> start<00:00:54.300> off<00:00:54.480> by

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
the Nano to the 700 I'll start off by

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.459 
the Nano to the 700 I'll start off by
just<00:00:55.590> explaining<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:57.059> helicopters<00:00:57.690> well

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
just explaining the helicopters well

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.460 
just explaining the helicopters well
first<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.829> got<00:01:01.370> first<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> quad<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
first we got first we got the quad and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.780 
first we got first we got the quad and
some<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:04.920> helicopters<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.640> might

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
some some of these helicopters I might

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.910 
some some of these helicopters I might
not<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.090> exactly<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.439> say<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> wrong

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
not know exactly so if I say it wrong

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.600 
not know exactly so if I say it wrong
excuse<00:01:08.460> me<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> blade<00:01:09.840> Nano<00:01:10.880> CP<00:01:12.500> X

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
excuse me but we got the blade Nano CP X

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.840 
excuse me but we got the blade Nano CP X
then<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.729> got<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.030> blade<00:01:15.930> MCP<00:01:16.770> X<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.729> got

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
then we got the blade MCP X then we got

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.770 
then we got the blade MCP X then we got
the<00:01:17.970> blade<00:01:19.400> MCP<00:01:20.400> X<00:01:20.610> BL<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.479> we've<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the blade MCP X BL then we've got the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.609 
the blade MCP X BL then we've got the
blade<00:01:21.990> 130<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.650> blade<00:01:26.810> 453<00:01:27.810> d<00:01:28.020> that's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
blade 130 we got the blade 453 d that's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.810 
blade 130 we got the blade 453 d that's
converted<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:30.060> flybarless<00:01:30.509> unit<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.549> put

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
converted to flybarless unit and I put

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.870 
converted to flybarless unit and I put
the<00:01:33.150> 3gx<00:01:33.840> system<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.670> little

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the 3gx system on which just a little

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.140 
the 3gx system on which just a little
disclaimer<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:37.740> don't<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.030> at

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
disclaimer is I don't really like it at

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.090 
disclaimer is I don't really like it at
all<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.680> switching<00:01:40.890> out

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
all and I'm going to be switching out

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.780 
all and I'm going to be switching out
shortly<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.630> wanted<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> try<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.790> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
shortly so I just wanted to try that to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.700 
shortly so I just wanted to try that to
see<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> 3gx<00:01:45.899> system<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.500> don't

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
see if I like the 3gx system and I don't

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.870 
see if I like the 3gx system and I don't
so<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.729> switching<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:49.140> our<00:01:49.950> 7200<00:01:50.640> BX

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
so I'm switching it with a our 7200 BX

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.380 
so I'm switching it with a our 7200 BX
so<00:01:51.770> that's<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.890> me<00:01:53.040> personally<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.729> lot<00:01:54.210> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so that's just me personally a lot of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
so that's just me personally a lot of
people<00:01:54.720> probably<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.140> them<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.829> just

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
people probably like them but I just

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.730 
people probably like them but I just
think<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.420> ARS<00:01:57.960> are<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.320> little<00:01:58.560> bit

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
think that the ARS are a little bit

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.020 
think that the ARS are a little bit
better<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.219> enjoy<00:01:59.939> them<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:01.880> we<00:02:02.880> got

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
better and I enjoy them more so we got

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.190 
better and I enjoy them more so we got
that<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.130> got<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.490> blade<00:02:06.920> 450<00:02:07.920> X

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
that and then we got the blade 450 X

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.650 
that and then we got the blade 450 X
stock<00:02:10.200> except<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> servos<00:02:11.280> are<00:02:11.660> changed

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
stock except for the servos are changed

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.370 
stock except for the servos are changed
out

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
out

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.750 
out
then<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:13.920> got<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:15.050> align<00:02:16.050> for<00:02:16.680> 50l<00:02:17.160> dominator

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
then we got the align for 50l dominator

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.040 
then we got the align for 50l dominator
which<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.330> very<00:02:19.110> cool<00:02:19.320> very<00:02:19.500> powerful<00:02:20.720> then<00:02:21.720> we

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
which is very cool very powerful then we

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.970 
which is very cool very powerful then we
have<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:23.810> align<00:02:24.860> t-rex<00:02:25.970> 550d<00:02:26.970> FC<00:02:27.710> then<00:02:28.710> we<00:02:28.830> got

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
have the align t-rex 550d FC then we got

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.490 
have the align t-rex 550d FC then we got
the<00:02:29.220> last<00:02:29.460> newest<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.360> greatest<00:02:30.500> collection

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the last newest and greatest collection

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.640 
the last newest and greatest collection
is<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:32.390> t-rex<00:02:33.390> 700<00:02:34.050> DF<00:02:34.680> chv<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.360> that's<00:02:37.290> kind<00:02:37.620> of

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
is a t-rex 700 DF chv so that's kind of

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.120 
is a t-rex 700 DF chv so that's kind of
what<00:02:37.800> they<00:02:37.920> look<00:02:38.100> like<00:02:38.160> right<00:02:38.910> there<00:02:39.770> all<00:02:40.770> of

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
what they look like right there all of

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.240 
what they look like right there all of
them<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.460> it's<00:02:41.640> quite<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.330> huge<00:02:43.010> difference<00:02:44.010> on

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
them so it's quite a huge difference on

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.620 
them so it's quite a huge difference on
that<00:02:44.850> as<00:02:45.060> well

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
that as well

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.530 
that as well
as<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.710> see<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:49.970> kind<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> give<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
as you can see so kind of give you a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:08.820 
as you can see so kind of give you a
line<00:02:52.530> up<00:02:52.770> on<00:02:53.130> these

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.900 

and<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.910> go<00:03:10.030> from<00:03:10.300> top<00:03:11.490> so<00:03:12.490> that's<00:03:12.640> really

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
and you go from top so that's really

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.320 
and you go from top so that's really
hard<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.360> see<00:03:13.540> them<00:03:13.660> all<00:03:14.850> what<00:03:15.850> they<00:03:16.000> look<00:03:16.180> like

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
hard to see them all what they look like

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.780 
hard to see them all what they look like
they're<00:03:16.510> all<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:17.170> spread<00:03:17.530> out<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:18.670> basically

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
they're all so spread out but basically

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.060 
they're all so spread out but basically
the<00:03:19.290> nanos<00:03:20.430> or<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.640> micros<00:03:22.060> they're<00:03:22.330> all

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
the nanos or the micros they're all

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.320 
the nanos or the micros they're all
relatively<00:03:24.070> they<00:03:24.400> step<00:03:24.700> up<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:25.060> by<00:03:25.210> a<00:03:25.240> little

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
relatively they step up just by a little

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.020 
relatively they step up just by a little
bit<00:03:25.600> then<00:03:25.990> it's<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:27.040> large<00:03:27.280> leap<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.820> 450s

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
bit then it's a large leap to the 450s

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:47.910 
bit then it's a large leap to the 450s
so<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.480> then<00:03:32.880> then<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.200> 550<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:46.560> 750<00:03:47.560> is

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
so and then then the 550 and 750 is

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.780 
so and then then the 550 and 750 is
almost<00:03:48.160> as<00:03:48.340> Tallis's<00:03:48.730> at<00:03:48.850> 100<00:03:49.410> which<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.770> is<00:03:51.370> so

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
almost as Tallis's at 100 which it is so

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.870 
almost as Tallis's at 100 which it is so
but<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.290> landing<00:03:53.650> gear<00:03:53.860> on<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.130> 700<00:03:54.700> is

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
but the landing gear on the 700 is

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.470 
but the landing gear on the 700 is
shorter<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.620> 550<00:03:57.400> has<00:03:57.700> taller<00:03:58.030> landing

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
shorter and the 550 has taller landing

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.630 
shorter and the 550 has taller landing
gear<00:03:58.690> making<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.800> seem<00:04:00.010> like<00:04:00.220> it's<00:04:00.400> shorter

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
gear making it seem like it's shorter

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.220 
gear making it seem like it's shorter
but<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.750> 700<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.460> definitely<00:04:03.460> taller<00:04:03.730> and

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
but the 700 is definitely taller and

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.790 
but the 700 is definitely taller and
about<00:04:05.230> 5<00:04:05.470> pounds<00:04:05.680> heavier<00:04:06.070> jus<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:08.620> can

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
about 5 pounds heavier jus so you can

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.260 
about 5 pounds heavier jus so you can
even<00:04:08.950> see<00:04:09.070> on<00:04:09.460> the<00:04:09.610> 700<00:04:11.820> camera<00:04:12.820> doesn't<00:04:13.000> just

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
even see on the 700 camera doesn't just

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.870 
even see on the 700 camera doesn't just
you<00:04:13.390> justice<00:04:13.930> but<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:15.130> blaze<00:04:15.370> are<00:04:15.640> way

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
you justice but the blaze are way

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.229 
you justice but the blaze are way
thicker<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.660> grips<00:04:16.930> are<00:04:17.080> way<00:04:17.230> thicker

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
thicker the grips are way thicker

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.120 
thicker the grips are way thicker
compared<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.890> 550<00:04:21.030> right<00:04:22.030> there

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
compared to the 550 right there

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.460 
compared to the 550 right there
definitely<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.490> bigger<00:04:25.180> bigger<00:04:25.840> machine<00:04:26.260> on

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
definitely a bigger bigger machine on

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.180 
definitely a bigger bigger machine on
that<00:04:27.130> as<00:04:27.460> well<00:04:27.990> so<00:04:28.990> that's<00:04:29.500> how<00:04:29.620> much<00:04:29.770> longer

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
that as well so that's how much longer

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.000 
that as well so that's how much longer
the<00:04:30.490> blades<00:04:30.730> are<00:04:30.940> I'm<00:04:31.840> just<00:04:32.200> on<00:04:32.320> one<00:04:32.530> end<00:04:32.740> times

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
the blades are I'm just on one end times

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.520 
the blades are I'm just on one end times
that<00:04:33.100> by<00:04:33.310> 2<00:04:33.960> so<00:04:35.370> I'm<00:04:36.370> going<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.640> be<00:04:36.700> flying<00:04:36.940> the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
that by 2 so I'm going to be flying the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.130 
that by 2 so I'm going to be flying the
450<00:04:38.530> l<00:04:38.680> Dominator<00:04:39.370> more<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.240> flew<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:40.960> little

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
450 l Dominator more I flew it a little

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.600 
450 l Dominator more I flew it a little
bit<00:04:41.320> less<00:04:41.560> fall<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.820> flute<00:04:43.030> great<00:04:43.710> so

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.540 

anyways<00:04:49.470> just<00:04:50.470> wanted<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.860> show<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.190> little

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
anyways just wanted to show you a little

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:08.550 
anyways just wanted to show you a little
bit<00:04:51.730> more<00:04:52.030> on<00:04:52.180> all<00:04:52.360> these

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.379 

not<00:05:09.560> doing<00:05:09.889> too<00:05:09.919> much<00:05:10.249> talking<00:05:10.580> just<00:05:11.120> kind<00:05:11.360> of

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
not doing too much talking just kind of

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:25.330 
not doing too much talking just kind of
watch<00:05:11.509> it<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:12.860> see<00:05:13.039> what<00:05:13.219> it<00:05:13.310> looks<00:05:13.490> like<00:05:24.279> so<00:05:25.279> I

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
watch it to see what it looks like so I

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.749 
watch it to see what it looks like so I
can't<00:05:25.729> even<00:05:25.849> get<00:05:26.029> my<00:05:26.180> camera<00:05:26.659> full<00:05:27.370> fully<00:05:28.370> into

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
can't even get my camera full fully into

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.989 
can't even get my camera full fully into
the<00:05:28.789> whole<00:05:29.060> length<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:29.449> the<00:05:29.599> 700<00:05:31.810> maybe<00:05:32.810> I<00:05:32.990> can

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
the whole length of the 700 maybe I can

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:44.320 
the whole length of the 700 maybe I can
to<00:05:34.999> keep<00:05:35.240> going<00:05:35.479> up<00:05:36.249> but<00:05:37.839> yeah<00:05:43.029> I'm<00:05:44.029> going<00:05:44.240> to

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
to keep going up but yeah I'm going to

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.850 
to keep going up but yeah I'm going to
decide<00:05:44.689> on<00:05:44.900> which<00:05:45.020> one<00:05:45.080> is<00:05:45.379> going<00:05:45.529> to<00:05:45.589> be<00:05:45.710> the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
decide on which one is going to be the

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.159 
decide on which one is going to be the
best<00:05:46.069> one<00:05:46.400> that<00:05:46.639> I<00:05:46.699> like<00:05:46.849> finding<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.270> most<00:05:47.479> it

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
best one that I like finding the most it

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.350 
best one that I like finding the most it
might<00:05:48.349> not<00:05:48.499> be<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.740> 700<00:05:49.279> I<00:05:49.430> got<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.699> 700<00:05:50.180> just

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
might not be the 700 I got the 700 just

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.320 
might not be the 700 I got the 700 just
because<00:05:50.689> I<00:05:50.990> wanted<00:05:51.349> it<00:05:51.529> but<00:05:52.129> it<00:05:52.729> might<00:05:52.939> not<00:05:52.969> be

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
because I wanted it but it might not be

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.089 
because I wanted it but it might not be
the<00:05:53.449> most<00:05:53.569> enjoyable<00:05:53.990> to<00:05:54.349> fly<00:05:54.529> I'm<00:05:54.800> not
