00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.040
 advanced 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:20.890
 The dk was brightened with a soft 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:23.200
 brightened by two tones as desired 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.070
 brightness the hair shampoo kidney and 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.989
 neutralize with blonde aim care 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.849
 In this technique, intense red 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.610
 tones with color idea to each other 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.090
 placed around harmonic gradients 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 achieve 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.330
 divide at the top 43 corners from the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.920
 size of the triangles depends on 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.920
 Haircut and head per serving 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.800
 mahogany becomes red throughout the contour and 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.790
 neck area on neck length and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.790
 applied on top 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.360
 First, the triangles to the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.360
 worked on pages 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.789
 in the triangular section becomes on 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.460
 long thigh a small triangle 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.710
 divided and margoni red on the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.850
 approaches and copper red on lengths and 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.850
 applied on tips 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.659
 now each one slice at the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.280
 thigh side of the small triangle with 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.280
 purple red worked out 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 this way, the whole triangle becomes 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.070
 alternately in the same order with 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:58.130
 margoni red violet red and coppery red 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:02:00.259
 worked out margoni red is at the beginning 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.340
 and copper red always on lengths and 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.340
 applied on tips 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.540
 at the remaining two three corners becomes on 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.010
 approach mahogany red applied to the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.010
 Lengths and tips will be in 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.500
 horizontal slices marconi red violet 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.819
 red and copper red intuitively placed 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.819
 so worked free 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.090
 after the hair shampoo 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.680
 kidney and with wella professionals notch 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.680
 neutralize after treatment 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.540
 all 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.540
