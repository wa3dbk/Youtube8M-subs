00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
battery life is going to be so regarding

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.130 
battery life is going to be so regarding
the<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.460> other<00:00:41.640> specifications<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.600> all

android wear smartwatches has been
pretty<00:00:45.390> similar<00:00:45.719> which<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.350> internals

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
pretty similar which is the internals

but<00:00:53.670> still<00:00:53.940> everything<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.719> similar<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
but still everything is similar as you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.709 
but still everything is similar as you
can<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> running<00:00:56.820> Android<00:00:57.239> wear<00:00:57.539> which

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
can see it is running Android wear which

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.540 
can see it is running Android wear which
is<00:00:57.840> yet<00:00:58.050> another<00:00:58.109> big<00:00:58.620> similarity<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
is yet another big similarity it is the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
is yet another big similarity it is the
platform<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.210> most<00:01:00.840> smartphone<00:01:01.829> makers<00:01:02.219> are

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
platform that most smartphone makers are

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.429 
platform that most smartphone makers are
choosing<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.000> launch<00:01:03.750> their<00:01:03.989> smartwatches

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
choosing to launch their smartwatches

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.039 
choosing to launch their smartwatches
even<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:04.979> neil<00:01:05.159> has<00:01:05.430> launched<00:01:05.850> an<00:01:06.540> Android

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
even so neil has launched an Android

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.020 
even so neil has launched an Android
wear<00:01:07.290> smartwatch<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.040> Samsung<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.700> show<00:01:08.909> up

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
wear smartwatch and Samsung will show up

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
wear smartwatch and Samsung will show up
be<00:01:09.180> launching<00:01:09.510> more<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.380> those<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
be launching more so those are the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.070 
be launching more so those are the
similarities<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.360> when<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> comes<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
similarities but when it comes to the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
similarities but when it comes to the
differences<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.799> very<00:01:14.159> obvious<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
differences it is very obvious that the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
differences it is very obvious that the
number<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:15.900> difference<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> design<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
number one difference is the design the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.609 
number one difference is the design the
a<00:01:17.580> su<00:01:17.970> zhen<00:01:18.180> watch<00:01:18.390> has<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> very<00:01:18.930> pebble<00:01:19.409> like

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
always curve round not free like the SSN

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.230 
always curve round not free like the SSN
watch<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.210> mechanism<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
watch and then you have the mechanism to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.230 
watch and then you have the mechanism to
lock<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.780> which<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.290> pretty<00:01:58.880> crazy<00:01:59.880> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
lock it in which is pretty crazy in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
lock it in which is pretty crazy in
samsung<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.960> very<00:02:01.170> hard<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> lock<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.340> in

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
samsung it is very hard to lock it in

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.730 
samsung it is very hard to lock it in
the<00:02:02.790> first<00:02:03.060> few<00:02:03.270> times<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.710> of

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
the first few times and that's one of

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.590 
the first few times and that's one of
the<00:02:04.890> main<00:02:05.040> differences<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:06.000> moving<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the main differences now moving to the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.510 
the main differences now moving to the
bag<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.770> has<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.979> completely

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
bag you can see that it has a completely

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.479 
bag you can see that it has a completely
all<00:02:08.910> plastic<00:02:09.599> finish<00:02:09.810> while<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.679> ESN<00:02:11.250> watch

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
all plastic finish while the ESN watch

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.020 
all plastic finish while the ESN watch
on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> other<00:02:12.120> hand

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
on the other hand

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.449 
on the other hand
completely<00:02:13.630> stainless<00:02:13.959> steel<00:02:14.319> finish<00:02:14.590> with<00:02:15.280> a

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
completely stainless steel finish with a

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.670 
completely stainless steel finish with a
button<00:02:15.670> on<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.000> side<00:02:16.180> here<00:02:16.600> very<00:02:17.319> similar<00:02:17.650> to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
button on the side here very similar to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.590 
button on the side here very similar to
the<00:02:17.800> Samsung<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:19.090> there<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.420> also

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
the Samsung one and there is also

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.809 
the Samsung one and there is also
apparently<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.380> heart<00:02:20.770> rate<00:02:20.890> monitor<00:02:20.950> inside

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
apparently a heart rate monitor inside

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.480 
apparently a heart rate monitor inside
which<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.720> not<00:02:23.140> similar<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.680> what<00:02:23.860> Samsung<00:02:24.340> has

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
which is not similar to what Samsung has

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.610 
which is not similar to what Samsung has
but<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.970> does<00:02:25.180> what<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.600> same<00:02:25.810> way<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.230> then

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
but it does what the same way and then

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.110 
but it does what the same way and then
you<00:02:26.740> have<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.950> pogo<00:02:27.220> pins<00:02:27.430> for<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.730> charging

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
you have the pogo pins for the charging

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.670 
you have the pogo pins for the charging
unit<00:02:28.330> which<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.660> given<00:02:28.990> separately<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.650> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
unit which is given separately in the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.370 
unit which is given separately in the
box<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:31.000> they<00:02:31.300> go<00:02:31.480> that's<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.110> main

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
box so they go that's the main

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.590 
box so they go that's the main
differences<00:02:33.280> between<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:34.270> Asus<00:02:34.900> zen<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
differences between the Asus zen and the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.780 
differences between the Asus zen and the
Samsung<00:02:37.600> Galaxy<00:02:37.630> gear<00:02:38.500> life<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.400> both<00:02:39.640> these

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
Samsung Galaxy gear life so both these

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.520 
Samsung Galaxy gear life so both these
smart<00:02:40.090> watches<00:02:40.300> even<00:02:40.750> though<00:02:40.840> very<00:02:41.080> similar

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
smart watches even though very similar

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.370 
smart watches even though very similar
differ<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.580> lot<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.120> design<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.780> construction

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
differ a lot in design and construction

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.920 
differ a lot in design and construction
so<00:02:44.860> that's<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.730> quick<00:02:46.030> hands-on<00:02:46.360> comparison

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
so that's the quick hands-on comparison

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.720 
so that's the quick hands-on comparison
between<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.230> two<00:02:47.470> do<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.190> like<00:02:48.340> button<00:02:48.640> if

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
between the two do it the like button if

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.070 
between the two do it the like button if
you<00:02:48.790> liked<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.150> video<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.510> do<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.959> the
