as<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.710> demonstrated<00:00:08.220> before<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:09.030> only<00:00:09.389> times

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
as I demonstrated before the only times

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.390 
as I demonstrated before the only times
I<00:00:09.809> was<00:00:09.960> able<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.230> get<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> shows<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.980> converge

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
I was able to get the shows to converge

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.430 
I was able to get the shows to converge
in<00:00:11.519> any<00:00:11.759> 90-degree<00:00:12.330> angle<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.230> mean<00:00:13.320> there

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
in any 90-degree angle was I mean there

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.350 
in any 90-degree angle was I mean there
was<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.590> big<00:00:13.769> space<00:00:14.070> between<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.580> two<00:00:14.759> no

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
was a big space between the two no

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.939 
was a big space between the two no
matter<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.780> did<00:00:15.960> no<00:00:16.590> matter<00:00:16.619> where<00:00:16.920> I

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
matter what I did no matter where I

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.590 
matter what I did no matter where I
positioned<00:00:17.430> myself<00:00:17.460> or<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> camera<00:00:18.449> I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
positioned myself or the camera I

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.990 
positioned myself or the camera I
couldn't<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.410> any<00:00:19.650> 90-degree<00:00:20.220> convert<00:00:20.670> with

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
couldn't get any 90-degree convert with

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.720 
couldn't get any 90-degree convert with
the<00:00:21.150> shadows<00:00:21.449> closely<00:00:21.869> together<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.609> if<00:00:23.609> it

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the shadows closely together so if it

the shadows closely together so if it
wasn't<00:00:24.060> perspective<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.260> texture<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> the

let's<00:00:32.610> see<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> astronomers<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
let's see what the astronomers have to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.229 
let's see what the astronomers have to
say<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.500> I'm<00:00:35.399> Lisa<00:00:35.700> Moore<00:00:36.030> from

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
say about this I'm Lisa Moore from

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.560 
say about this I'm Lisa Moore from
Macquarie<00:00:36.630> University<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:38.300> could<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.420> tell

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
Macquarie University and could you tell

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.880 
Macquarie University and could you tell
me<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.809> opinions<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> Apollo<00:00:40.620> moon

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
me your opinions on the Apollo moon

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.660 
me your opinions on the Apollo moon
missions<00:00:41.600> well<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.899> don't<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.649> opinions<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
missions well I don't have opinions the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.340 
missions well I don't have opinions the
Apollo<00:00:44.969> moon<00:00:45.210> missions<00:00:45.570> were<00:00:45.629> an<00:00:45.809> amazing

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
Apollo moon missions were an amazing

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.770 
Apollo moon missions were an amazing
feat<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.190> occurred<00:00:47.640> between<00:00:47.850> 1969<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.960> 1972

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
feat that occurred between 1969 and 1972

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
feat that occurred between 1969 and 1972
in<00:00:51.780> fact<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> earliest<00:00:52.440> missions<00:00:52.829> started

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
in fact the earliest missions started

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
in fact the earliest missions started
before<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.879> orbiting<00:00:54.390> spacecraft<00:00:54.860> but

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
before then with orbiting spacecraft but

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
before then with orbiting spacecraft but
the<00:00:56.010> landing<00:00:56.309> missions<00:00:56.579> occurred<00:00:57.090> over<00:00:57.360> that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the landing missions occurred over that

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.349 
the landing missions occurred over that
three-year<00:00:57.780> period<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.399> 26<00:00:59.910> men<00:01:00.090> have

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
three-year period and so 26 men have

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.729 
three-year period and so 26 men have
walked<00:01:00.570> around<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> moon<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:01.620> it's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
walked around on the moon I think it's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.429 
walked around on the moon I think it's
just<00:01:01.890> amazing<00:01:02.430> an<00:01:02.670> amazing<00:01:03.270> feat<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.870> mankind

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
just amazing an amazing feat for mankind

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.730 
just amazing an amazing feat for mankind
and<00:01:05.250> what<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.180> comment<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and what is your comment on the on the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
and what is your comment on the on the
theories<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.729> moon<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.000> learning<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
theories that the moon out learning is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.380 
theories that the moon out learning is
actually<00:01:09.450> filmed<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.799> earth<00:01:11.210> well<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> think

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
actually filmed on earth well I think

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
actually filmed on earth well I think
anybody<00:01:12.930> who<00:01:13.229> knows<00:01:13.500> anything<00:01:13.799> about<00:01:13.950> science

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
anybody who knows anything about science

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
anybody who knows anything about science
and<00:01:14.670> photography<00:01:15.210> should<00:01:15.420> understand<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and photography should understand that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.960 
and photography should understand that
there<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.250> perfectly<00:01:17.729> reasonable

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
there are perfectly reasonable

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.320 
there are perfectly reasonable
explanations<00:01:18.869> why<00:01:19.670> certain<00:01:20.670> features<00:01:21.000> appear

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
explanations why certain features appear

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.840 
explanations why certain features appear
on<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> moon<00:01:22.080> pictures<00:01:22.520> I've<00:01:23.520> got<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.790> this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
on the moon pictures I've got in this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
on the moon pictures I've got in this
one<00:01:24.330> picture<00:01:24.630> from<00:01:24.750> Apollo<00:01:25.049> 17<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.890> you'd<00:01:26.040> like

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
one picture from Apollo 17 if you'd like

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.120 
one picture from Apollo 17 if you'd like
to<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> oh<00:01:27.500> sure<00:01:28.500> I'll<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> look<00:01:29.070> at

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to see it oh sure I'll have a look at

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.649 
to see it oh sure I'll have a look at
anything<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> show<00:01:29.820> me<00:01:29.970> yeah<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
anything you want to show me yeah you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
anything you want to show me yeah you
notice<00:01:30.869> how<00:01:30.990> these<00:01:31.140> shadows<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.100> one

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
notice how these shadows and this one

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.420 
notice how these shadows and this one
they're<00:01:32.430> converging<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> 90<00:01:33.299> degree<00:01:33.570> angle

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
they're converging at a 90 degree angle

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.260 
they're converging at a 90 degree angle
jerk<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.670> could<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> cause<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
jerk and that could be the cause of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.730 
jerk and that could be the cause of
perspective<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.049> rough<00:01:37.229> terrain<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.590> anything

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
perspective or rough terrain or anything

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.569 
perspective or rough terrain or anything
like<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:39.210> sure<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:41.100> could<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> do

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
like that I'm not sure it could be to do

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
like that I'm not sure it could be to do
with<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> fisheye<00:01:42.150> lens<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.659> could<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.110> do

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
with the fisheye lens it could be to do

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.810 
with the fisheye lens it could be to do
with<00:01:43.290> other<00:01:43.860> sources<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.310> light<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
with other sources of light in the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940 
with other sources of light in the
photograph<00:01:45.240> other<00:01:46.229> source<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> light<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
photograph other source of light but you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
photograph other source of light but you
know<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> only<00:01:47.700> light<00:01:48.030> source<00:01:48.060> they

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
know that the only light source they

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.469 
know that the only light source they
actually<00:01:48.720> did<00:01:48.899> bring<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.479> was

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
actually did bring was the was the was
