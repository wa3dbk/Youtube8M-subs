assessee<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> instructions<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.120> is

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
assessee the instructions this is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.090 
assessee the instructions this is
important<00:00:48.750> thing<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> easier<00:00:49.829> make<00:00:49.920> some

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
important thing so it easier make some

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.580 
important thing so it easier make some
shield<00:00:50.340> times<00:00:50.550> cause<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:50.969> five<00:00:51.410> fuses<00:00:52.410> and

shield times cause with five fuses and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.569 
shield times cause with five fuses and
the<00:00:53.399> first<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.879> again<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.920> don't<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
move that that would be a first fuel

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.599 
move that that would be a first fuel
that<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.550> is

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the bit what's changing things we take

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.929 
the bit what's changing things we take
out<00:01:02.070> fuels<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.899> confuse<00:01:03.899> three<00:01:04.430> remove<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
out fuels to confuse three remove the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.480 
out fuels to confuse three remove the
muffler<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> protective<00:01:07.200> covering<00:01:07.590> now

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
muffler just a protective covering now

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
muffler just a protective covering now
this<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> important<00:01:09.540> thing<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.810> this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this is the important thing that this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.469 
this is the important thing that this
what<00:01:10.830> name<00:01:11.010> got<00:01:11.250> these<00:01:11.369> two<00:01:11.580> fuels<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
what name got these two fuels is out you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.200 
what name got these two fuels is out you
must<00:01:12.659> put<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.280> inside<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
must put one inside that one like that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.109 
must put one inside that one like that
and<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.869> must<00:01:16.049> put<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> other<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:17.119> inside

and you must put the other one inside

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.850 
and you must put the other one inside
the<00:01:18.150> other<00:01:18.299> fuels<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> can

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the other fuels like that so as you can

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340 
the other fuels like that so as you can
see<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.000> connected<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.200> now

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
see there now connected that that is now

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.950 
see there now connected that that is now
connected<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.450> firework

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
connected now so that this firework

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.170 
connected now so that this firework
doesn't<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> children<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.369> back<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
doesn't this children not back out and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
doesn't this children not back out and
outer<00:01:27.509> position<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.470> once<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.860> stunt

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
outer position what I do is once a stunt

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.039 
outer position what I do is once a stunt
like<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:30.090> push<00:01:30.299> them<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> side

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
like that just push them down the side

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
like that just push them down the side
so<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.220> fact<00:01:32.460> that's<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.759> one

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so that's that's up fact that's that one

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.850 
so that's that's up fact that's that one
done<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.840> exactly<00:01:33.930> say<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.650> wrong

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
done so what exactly say with this wrong

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.880 
done so what exactly say with this wrong
take<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> fuels<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.479> fuels<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:37.740> this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
take this fuels out this fuels put this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.069 
take this fuels out this fuels put this
one<00:01:38.100> into<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:40.159> simple<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> simple

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
one into that one simple as it is simple
