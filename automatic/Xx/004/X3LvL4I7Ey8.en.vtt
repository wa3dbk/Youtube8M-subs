00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you can't start off at the battery just

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.479 
you can't start off at the battery just
connected<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.269> now<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:31.099> well<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.250> cuz<00:00:32.460> I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
connected right now but well this cuz I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.370 
connected right now but well this cuz I
kind<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> broke<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> battery<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:35.149> yeah<00:00:36.380> what

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
kind of broke the battery but yeah what

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.889 
kind of broke the battery but yeah what
happens<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.920> I'll<00:00:38.190> turn<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> key<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.120> it'll

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
happens is I'll turn the key and it'll

happens is I'll turn the key and it'll
do<00:00:40.110> absolutely<00:00:40.290> nothing<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.420> lights<00:00:42.420> and

would<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.820> put<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> battery<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:46.710> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
would I put the battery from this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.450 
would I put the battery from this
tractor<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.030> there<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.129> battery

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
tractor in there and I know that battery

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
tractor in there and I know that battery
works<00:00:50.700> too<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.870> does<00:00:52.079> nothing

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
works too it does nothing

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.580 
works too it does nothing
now<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:54.120> debate<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.690> don't<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.469> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
now I'm debate I don't know what it is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.119 
now I'm debate I don't know what it is
exactly<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.129> could<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> ignition<00:00:56.610> switch

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
exactly it could be the ignition switch

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.729 
exactly it could be the ignition switch
solenoid<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.609> sure<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.199> manually

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
solenoid I'm not sure but to manually

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.990 
solenoid I'm not sure but to manually
jump<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.489> looking<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
jump this I'm just looking at what I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
jump this I'm just looking at what I
think<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> solenoid<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> have

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
think is a solenoid I just like to have

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.350 
think is a solenoid I just like to have
an<00:01:05.309> opinion<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:08.030> I'm<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.210> quite

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
an opinion on what to do I'm not quite

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.039 
an opinion on what to do I'm not quite
familiar<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.960> type<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.229> solenoid

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
familiar with this type of solenoid

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.359 
familiar with this type of solenoid
because<00:01:13.049> I've<00:01:13.290> seen<00:01:13.530> some<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.130> doesn't

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
because I've seen some and it doesn't

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.480 
because I've seen some and it doesn't
look<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:15.680> any<00:01:16.680> kind<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.009> Intel<00:01:17.430> would

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
look like that any kind of Intel would

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
look like that any kind of Intel would
be<00:01:17.610> great<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> mostly<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
be great this is mostly going out to
