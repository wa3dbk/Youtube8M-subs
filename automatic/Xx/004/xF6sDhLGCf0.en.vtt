combining<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> colors<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.030> app<00:01:54.420> icon

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
combining all the colors of the app icon

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.289 
combining all the colors of the app icon
to<00:01:55.170> make<00:01:55.380> its<00:01:55.590> color<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:57.060> looks<00:01:57.240> really

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to make its color and it looks really

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.340 
to make its color and it looks really
cool<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:57.960> ahead<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.109> do<00:01:58.229> another

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
cool so we can go ahead and do another

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.319 
cool so we can go ahead and do another
test<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.039> there<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.249> go<00:01:59.310> that<00:02:00.060> looks<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.299> little

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
test so there you go that looks a little

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.330 
test so there you go that looks a little
bit<00:02:00.600> better<00:02:00.719> than<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.439> settings<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.039> but

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
bit better than the settings one but

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.590 
bit better than the settings one but
like<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.579> said<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.090> bump<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.420> up

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
like I said you can just bump this up

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.389 
like I said you can just bump this up
maybe<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:04.920> bit<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.249> do<00:02:05.310> another

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
maybe just a little bit and do another

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.540 
maybe just a little bit and do another
test<00:02:05.729> banner<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
test banner here so there you go and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.450 
test banner here so there you go and
then<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:10.170> also<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> said<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
then you also like I said you have this

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.309 
then you also like I said you have this
unicorn<00:02:11.940> effect<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.600> is<00:02:12.780> actually<00:02:13.080> pretty

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
unicorn effect this is actually pretty

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.010 
unicorn effect this is actually pretty
cool<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.430> let's<00:02:14.700> go<00:02:14.819> ahead<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.090> turn<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.960> on

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
cool so let's go ahead and turn that on

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.770 
cool so let's go ahead and turn that on
and<00:02:16.200> do<00:02:16.470> another<00:02:16.560> test<00:02:16.920> notification<00:02:17.819> as<00:02:18.510> you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and do another test notification as you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
and do another test notification as you
guys<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.110> see<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.740> basically<00:02:20.280> kind<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.700> just

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
guys can see it basically kind of just

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.100 
guys can see it basically kind of just
switches<00:02:22.800> between<00:02:22.950> all<00:02:23.430> different<00:02:24.000> colors<00:02:24.300> in

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
switches between all different colors in

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.140 
switches between all different colors in
that<00:02:25.319> banner<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.860> it's<00:02:26.130> actually<00:02:26.730> very<00:02:26.760> very

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
that banner so it's actually very very

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.360 
that banner so it's actually very very
noticeable<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.830> actually<00:02:28.980> bring<00:02:29.250> up

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
noticeable and if we actually bring up

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.040 
noticeable and if we actually bring up
the<00:02:29.490> color<00:02:29.700> alpha<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.480> saturation<00:02:31.020> a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the color alpha and the saturation a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.150 
the color alpha and the saturation a
little<00:02:31.260> bit<00:02:31.350> more<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.560> will<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.740> even<00:02:31.950> more

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
little bit more it will be even more

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.490 
little bit more it will be even more
noticeable<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.569> there<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.780> go<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.200> actually

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
noticeable so there you go it's actually

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.979 
noticeable so there you go it's actually
pretty<00:02:34.830> cool<00:02:35.190> looking<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.150> ask<00:02:36.360> me<00:02:36.659> so

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
pretty cool looking if you ask me so

pretty cool looking if you ask me so

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
this is the first section

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.820

basically do this for all the other
sections<00:02:43.110> as<00:02:43.230> well<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.430> lock

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
sections as well so we have the lock

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.910 
sections as well so we have the lock
screen<00:02:44.850> banners<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.570> as<00:02:45.690> well<00:02:45.920> basically

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
screen banners here as well basically

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.470 
screen banners here as well basically
kind<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> same<00:02:47.580> thing<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.240> have<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
kind of the same thing you do have the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.740 
kind of the same thing you do have the
option<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.400> underlying<00:02:50.400> blur<00:02:50.820> which<00:02:51.510> kind

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
option of a underlying blur which kind

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.180 
option of a underlying blur which kind
of<00:02:51.810> makes<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.080> notification<00:02:52.830> appear<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
of makes the notification appear a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.910 
of makes the notification appear a
little<00:02:53.340> bit<00:02:53.670> different<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.180> your<00:02:54.390> lock<00:02:54.630> screen

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
little bit different on your lock screen

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.290 
little bit different on your lock screen
and<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.220> also<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.820> unicorn

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
and then you also have the unicorn

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.090 
and then you also have the unicorn
affect<00:02:57.570> your<00:02:57.810> color<00:02:58.020> saturation<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
affect your color saturation and the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.310 
affect your color saturation and the
on/off<00:02:59.460> switch<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.930> said<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.260> is

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
on/off switch but like I said this is

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.810 
on/off switch but like I said this is
gonna<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.560> pretty<00:03:01.710> much<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.070> same<00:03:02.310> as<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
gonna be pretty much the same as the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.640 
gonna be pretty much the same as the
banner<00:03:03.120> notifications<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.350> we<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.500> go<00:03:04.560> ahead

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
banner notifications so we can go ahead

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.270 
banner notifications so we can go ahead
and<00:03:04.740> do<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.070> test<00:03:05.340> lock<00:03:05.880> screen<00:03:07.040> banner<00:03:08.040> right

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
and do the test lock screen banner right

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.520 
and do the test lock screen banner right
there<00:03:08.490> or<00:03:08.670> notification<00:03:09.360> rather<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.170> there

and switch off the underlying blur we

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.949 
and switch off the underlying blur we
can<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.280> another<00:03:17.430> test<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.480> there<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.660> go<00:03:18.780> as
