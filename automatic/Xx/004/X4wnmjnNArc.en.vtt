00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.509
 University of Tsukuba Hoshino Laboratory at Stereo EXPO 2010 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.429
 Of the operator's hands and arms based on the camera image 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.269
 Understand the motion, fast and highly accurate remote robot 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.519
 System to operate "Gesture Drive Robot 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.520
 Exhibited the "arm system" 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.490
 This system uses 2 cameras 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.750
 So how does the hand look like how the hand shape looks like 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.270
 Then how are the arms 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.660
 Recognize if it is moving 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.439
 When outputting to the robot based on the result 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.319
 Robot acts like human 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.350
 There is almost no time delay 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 The behavior is also very accurate 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.799
 The human hand is very different among individuals 

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.589
 We have a huge amount of individual differences 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.510
 We have a database for hand verification 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.179
 It is most similar to the hand seen in the camera from among them 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.619
 We developed technology to find things in high speed and high accuracy 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.850
 Most gesture recognition in the world 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.749
 It detects hand position and direction movement 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.750
 But what kind of hand is our system 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.020
 It will be possible to recognize it or 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.140
 Hand shape estimation based on two high-speed cameras 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.079
 Processing speed exceeds 100 times per second 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.259
 Accuracy boasts of top class in the world 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.609
 From now on, more of the accuracy of recognizing finger movements 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.549
 Of 3D display terminals to be improved 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.689
 We are planning to improve it for application to operation etc. 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.850
 For example, the main part of the information terminal is to use the touch panel 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.890
 If the display is two dimensional, the touch panel 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.649
 It is very convenient, but in the future this display 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.969
 It is likely to be three-dimensional 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.280
 The input must still be a gesture when it becomes solid 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.659
 At that time not only the movement of the arm but also the hand 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.780
 When human beings are able to recognize shapes, daily activities and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.249
 Just operate in the same way. 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.319
 You can use it the same way 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.850
 Because robots work in the same way as humans 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.860
 Robots do not need intelligence 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.370
 The robot follows the action of human beings 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.290
 It will be possible to work in another place
