00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.480
 I'll show you the tune changes. 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.660
 of the equilibrium axis 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:32.649
 this is the axis of equilibrium this is a 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:38.079
 media policy there are two 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:42.489
 pulley on the gear gear that is 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:45.850
 the country to a movement of the axis of 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:52.539
 balance and a pinch on the top and 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:56.949
 two on the bottom have to beat the 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:02.100
 two and below where it teaches is the one that is 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.100
 the symbolism of the axis of equilibrium 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 after riding with it when you have already 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.950
 it is at the point that you pick it up with the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.950
 two low high current 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.280
 brand with this mark in the chain 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.610
 This one is polished by black 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:41.600
 she has this dig in the top where 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:47.550
 that fits in this rush here 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:51.690
 she has to get uptight here that O 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.979
 stay right and fit here with 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.979
 this junction of vec 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:18.590
 the dog in the beak synchronizes the chop 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:24.410
 here of the internal current 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:28.640
 the axis of balance here and here 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.190
 the two marks of the balance pulley of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.459
 inside that is the three tires top two 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.340
 with where low 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:43.670
 this is the synchronization of the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:46.510
 balance then fitted the police the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.730
 baby here is good to put a screw 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.819
 runs a screw with a door that did not 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.900
 get out of position 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:06.890
 you may have a problem 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:09.459
 synchronizing the chain by fining who 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.459
 for 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:27.700
 the particularization of the internal current 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:27.700
 It's already done here here and here. 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:45.530
 the mission of the water 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:50.769
 distribution mounted on the point 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.769
 exhaust control intake control 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:33.490
 under the control the oil pump does not 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:38.750
 has nothing in the balance that the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:41.620
 variation easel 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.620
 of the intake control 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.509
 Paulo 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:17.520
 is to be saved here as I had said is good 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:19.680
 left-hand thread 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:25.340
 So you let go, you tighten up. 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.340
 pressing you suffer and that's it 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.740
 the colonization of the engine 2.0 tfsi
