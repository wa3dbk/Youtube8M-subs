year January 2010 so we're very excited
effect<00:00:33.750> we've<00:00:33.870> got<00:00:33.899> these<00:00:34.230> within<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.739> range

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
effect we've got these within the range

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.850 
effect we've got these within the range
now<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.489> they<00:00:35.969> replace<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.660> existing<00:00:36.960> Els

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
now and they replace the existing Els

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650 
now and they replace the existing Els
but<00:00:38.280> what<00:00:38.399> we've<00:00:38.489> got<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> brand<00:00:39.420> new

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
but what we've got here is a brand new

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.229 
but what we've got here is a brand new
binocular<00:00:40.320> they<00:00:40.980> look<00:00:41.250> very<00:00:41.280> similar<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
binocular they look very similar to the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.389 
binocular they look very similar to the
existing<00:00:42.989> model<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.040> we've<00:00:44.190> done

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
existing model but what we've done

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.090 
existing model but what we've done
really<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.030> reduce<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.899> size<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.739> physical

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
really is reduce the size the physical

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
really is reduce the size the physical
size<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> binocular<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.840> they're<00:00:48.989> more

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
size of the binocular so they're more

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.500 
size of the binocular so they're more
compact<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.489> first<00:00:50.730> thing<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> notice<00:00:51.420> about

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
compact the first thing you notice about

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.770 
compact the first thing you notice about
the<00:00:51.870> years<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.379> fact<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.780> economically

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the years is the fact that economically

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
the years is the fact that economically
they<00:00:55.199> fit<00:00:55.410> very<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:56.129> comfortably<00:00:56.670> into<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
they fit very very comfortably into the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.090 
they fit very very comfortably into the
hand

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
hand

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.670 
hand
brilliant<00:00:59.100> shape<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.000> they're<00:01:00.149> they're

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
brilliant shape so they're they're

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.189 
brilliant shape so they're they're
compact<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> full<00:01:03.270> size<00:01:03.539> up<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:03.870> size

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
compact and for a full size up but size

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.270 
compact and for a full size up but size
binocular<00:01:04.680> they're<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:06.320> user<00:01:07.320> friendly<00:01:10.280> so

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
binocular they're very user friendly so

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.960 
binocular they're very user friendly so
this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> rubber<00:01:12.799> coating<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this is a rubber coating that's on the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.990 
this is a rubber coating that's on the
body<00:01:15.150> shell<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.580> they're<00:01:17.580> very<00:01:17.759> durable

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
body shell so they're very durable

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
body shell so they're very durable
they're<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.140> robust<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.090> in

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
they're very robust so if you're out in

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.749 
they're very robust so if you're out in
all<00:01:21.479> types<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.080> fields<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.759> they're

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
all types of fields then they're

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.020 
all types of fields then they're
protected<00:01:24.950> they<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.100> light<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.850> they're

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
protected they are light because they're

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.600 
protected they are light because they're
a<00:01:27.060> magnesium<00:01:27.600> body<00:01:28.530> shell<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
a magnesium body shell there they are a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.270 
a magnesium body shell there they are a
lot<00:01:29.729> lighter<00:01:29.970> now<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.409> 16

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
lot lighter now we actually have 16

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.660 
lot lighter now we actually have 16
elements<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.909> glass<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.540> each<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> barrels

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
elements of glass in each of the barrels

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.880 
elements of glass in each of the barrels
so<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.570> key<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> try<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.500> make<00:01:37.619> them<00:01:37.799> as

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so it is key to try and make them as

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.090 
so it is key to try and make them as
light<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.369> possible

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
light as possible

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.740 
light as possible
and<00:01:40.400> with<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.670> magnesium<00:01:40.970> we<00:01:41.480> can<00:01:41.630> achieve

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
and with the magnesium we can achieve

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
and with the magnesium we can achieve
that<00:01:42.790> they<00:01:43.790> are<00:01:43.940> totally<00:01:44.420> waterproof<00:01:44.770> their

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
that they are totally waterproof their

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.700 
that they are totally waterproof their
nitrogen<00:01:46.130> field<00:01:46.790> which<00:01:47.750> means<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.440> they

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
nitrogen field which means that they

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.670 
nitrogen field which means that they
won't<00:01:49.190> up<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:50.390> if<00:01:50.510> you<00:01:50.540> know<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.960> nice<00:01:51.350> warm

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
won't up so if you know a nice warm

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.540 
won't up so if you know a nice warm
car<00:01:51.980> you<00:01:52.280> go<00:01:52.400> out<00:01:52.550> into<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.790> cold<00:01:53.030> environment

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
car you go out into a cold environment

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.800 
car you go out into a cold environment
internally<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.730> lenses<00:01:56.060> won't<00:01:56.270> mist<00:01:56.510> up<00:01:56.660> at

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
internally the lenses won't mist up at

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.250 
internally the lenses won't mist up at
all<00:02:00.640> well<00:02:01.640> we've<00:02:01.850> got<00:02:02.000> two<00:02:02.270> new<00:02:02.300> lenses<00:02:03.110> that

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
all well we've got two new lenses that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.650 
all well we've got two new lenses that
we've<00:02:03.440> put<00:02:04.400> into<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.760> binocular<00:02:05.240> one<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.630> a

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
we've put into the binocular one is a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.310 
we've put into the binocular one is a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
to use if it's cold anywhere in gloves

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.850 
to use if it's cold anywhere in gloves
then<00:02:41.090> with<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.540> large<00:02:41.810> focusing<00:02:42.410> wheel<00:02:42.590> it's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
then with this large focusing wheel it's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.990 
then with this large focusing wheel it's
easy<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:44.150> refocus<00:02:45.760> also<00:02:46.760> with<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
easy to to refocus also with the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.530 
easy to to refocus also with the
focusing<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.720> can<00:02:48.100> close<00:02:49.100> focus<00:02:49.520> down<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.510> a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
focusing you can close focus down to a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.040 
focusing you can close focus down to a
metre<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.140> half<00:02:51.730> no<00:02:52.730> problem<00:02:53.060> at<00:02:53.150> all

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
metre and a half no problem at all

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.620 
metre and a half no problem at all
so<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.680> very<00:02:54.770> quick<00:02:55.100> action<00:02:55.580> from<00:02:55.880> close

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
so it's a very quick action from close

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.490 
so it's a very quick action from close
up<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.590> long<00:02:58.580> distance

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
