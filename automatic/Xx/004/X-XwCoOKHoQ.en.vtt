00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.740 

I<00:00:35.840> gave<00:00:36.840> them<00:00:37.050> names<00:00:38.340> based<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.450> general

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I gave them names based on the general

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.660 
I gave them names based on the general

the road the first category the

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.480 
the road the first category the
shoestring<00:00:46.470> cyclists<00:00:47.010> being<00:00:47.220> one<00:00:47.370> that

shoestring cyclists being one that

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.030 
shoestring cyclists being one that
travels<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.970> shoestring<00:00:48.420> budget<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
travels on a shoestring budget and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.250 
travels on a shoestring budget and
they're<00:00:50.040> spending<00:00:50.340> basically<00:00:50.580> zero<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.450> $15<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
they're spending basically zero to $15 a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.790 
they're spending basically zero to $15 a
day<00:00:52.380> maybe<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.760> most<00:00:54.059> 30<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.650> would

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
day maybe at the most 30 but that would

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
day maybe at the most 30 but that would
kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> blow<00:00:56.489> their<00:00:56.640> budget<00:00:56.970> mostly<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
kind of blow their budget mostly the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.219 
kind of blow their budget mostly the
comfort<00:00:58.470> zone<00:00:58.620> around<00:00:58.890> $15<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:03.229> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
comfort zone around $15 and then the the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
comfort zone around $15 and then the the
high-end<00:01:04.650> group<00:01:04.979> because<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.820> easier<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
high-end group because they're easier I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.880 
high-end group because they're easier I
think<00:01:06.870> those<00:01:07.020> two<00:01:07.170> groups<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.530> easier<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
think those two groups are easier to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
think those two groups are easier to
distinguish<00:01:08.490> from<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.850> another<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:10.020> comfort

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
distinguish from one another the comfort

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.050 
distinguish from one another the comfort
cyclists<00:01:10.890> are<00:01:11.009> their<00:01:11.310> most<00:01:11.490> interested<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
cyclists are their most interested in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
cyclists are their most interested in
being<00:01:12.300> comfortable<00:01:12.810> they<00:01:13.320> don't<00:01:13.500> want<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
being comfortable they don't want to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.499 
being comfortable they don't want to
carry<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> weight<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:15.030> want<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.300> sleep

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
carry a lot of weight they want to sleep

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.640 
carry a lot of weight they want to sleep
in<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.690> bed<00:01:15.740> they<00:01:16.740> want<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.509> food<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.530> know

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
in a bed they want to have food you know

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.510 
in a bed they want to have food you know
made<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.910> just<00:01:21.350> readily<00:01:22.350> available

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
made for them or just readily available

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.570 
made for them or just readily available
so<00:01:23.520> they're<00:01:23.820> spending<00:01:24.110> between<00:01:25.110> 75<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.710> $100

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so they're spending between 75 and $100

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.200 
so they're spending between 75 and $100
a<00:01:26.610> day<00:01:26.729> generally<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.399> then<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.940> middle

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
a day generally and then the middle

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450 
a day generally and then the middle
range<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.930> call<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> economy<00:01:31.500> cyclist<00:01:32.160> because

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
range I call the economy cyclist because

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.249 
range I call the economy cyclist because
there's<00:01:32.700> some<00:01:32.910> something<00:01:33.899> they<00:01:34.020> need<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
there's some something they need to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920 
there's some something they need to
economize<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.970> somehow<00:01:35.970> although<00:01:36.390> maybe<00:01:36.750> it's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
economize on somehow although maybe it's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.570 
economize on somehow although maybe it's
not<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.140> very<00:01:37.410> precise<00:01:37.770> term<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.250> them<00:01:38.369> but

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
not a very precise term for them but

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.640 
not a very precise term for them but
they're<00:01:39.090> averaging<00:01:39.570> about<00:01:39.780> $50<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> day

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
they're averaging about $50 a day

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
they're averaging about $50 a day
meaning<00:01:41.010> that<00:01:41.280> some<00:01:41.520> days<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:41.940> may<00:01:42.060> spend

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
meaning that some days they may spend

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
meaning that some days they may spend
nothing<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.620> other<00:01:43.770> days<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.159> may<00:01:44.310> spend

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
nothing in other days they may spend

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.740 
nothing in other days they may spend
$100<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.420> 150<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> year<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.640> depends<00:01:48.630> on

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
$100 or 150 a year it just depends on

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.360 
$100 or 150 a year it just depends on
what<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.049> might<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.620> might<00:01:49.799> camp<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.340> a

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
what they might do they might camp for a

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.130 
what they might do they might camp for a
series<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.760> days<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.390> come<00:01:51.630> into<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.900> town

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
series of days and then come into a town

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
series of days and then come into a town
and<00:01:52.200> stay<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.799> nice<00:01:52.950> hotel<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.670> visit<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.970> lot

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and stay in a nice hotel and visit a lot

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.830 
and stay in a nice hotel and visit a lot
of<00:01:54.180> places<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:56.880> may<00:01:57.030> also<00:01:57.210> economize<00:01:57.810> on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
of places so they may also economize on

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.780 
of places so they may also economize on
time<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.770> travel<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.760> distance<00:02:00.270> where<00:02:01.790> so

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
time and travel more distance where so

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.700 
time and travel more distance where so
some<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> distances<00:02:03.960> break<00:02:04.229> down<00:02:04.409> based

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
some of the distances break down based

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.289 
some of the distances break down based
on<00:02:04.830> spending<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.490> wear<00:02:05.760> your<00:02:05.880> shoestring

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
on spending to wear your shoestring

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.350 
on spending to wear your shoestring
cyclists<00:02:06.900> will<00:02:07.080> travel<00:02:07.560> further<00:02:08.179> that's<00:02:09.179> one

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
cyclists will travel further that's one

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
cyclists will travel further that's one
way<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.630> can<00:02:09.690> save<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.170> money<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.250> more

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
way they can save on money is the more

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.039 
way they can save on money is the more
times<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.790> stop<00:02:12.030> means<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> more<00:02:12.660> money<00:02:12.870> you

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
times you stop means the more money you

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.320 
times you stop means the more money you
spend<00:02:13.350> generally<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> travel<00:02:15.000> longer

it happens to be a cyclist is doing that

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.280 
it happens to be a cyclist is doing that

much more frequently and at least in

much more frequently and at least in

terms of traveling within a region
they're<00:03:19.870> stopping<00:03:20.200> more<00:03:20.380> frequently<00:03:20.830> to

they're stopping more frequently to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.400 
they're stopping more frequently to
sleep<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.670> since<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.239> distances<00:03:22.780> are<00:03:22.840> not

quite<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.010> same<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.459> car<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.000> benefits

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
quite the same in a car so the benefits

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.390 
quite the same in a car so the benefits
to<00:03:25.660> rural<00:03:25.840> communities<00:03:25.989> are<00:03:26.560> really<00:03:26.769> high<00:03:27.069> and

to rural communities are really high and

to rural communities are really high and

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
and the the location is also very

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.600 
and the the location is also very
appealing<00:03:32.319> since<00:03:32.799> cyclists<00:03:33.160> prefer<00:03:33.489> to

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
appealing since cyclists prefer to

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.820 
appealing since cyclists prefer to
travel<00:03:33.850> less<00:03:34.890> busy<00:03:35.910> roads<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:38.110> lot<00:03:38.799> of

travel less busy roads and a lot of

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.740 
travel less busy roads and a lot of
times<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.580> rural<00:03:39.819> communities<00:03:40.299> are<00:03:40.540> where

transportation patterns that maybe are

transportation patterns that maybe are
no<00:03:45.430> longer<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.950> cyclist<00:03:48.370> is<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.549> really

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
no longer so the cyclist is a really

easier so I thought that was a good
example<00:04:38.830> of<00:04:39.010> it

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.660 

a<00:04:43.020> very<00:04:44.020> small<00:04:44.350> simple<00:04:44.860> thing<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.400> they<00:04:45.520> can

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
a very small simple thing that they can

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.510 
a very small simple thing that they can
do<00:04:45.820> is<00:04:46.150> put<00:04:46.420> bike-friendly<00:04:47.050> outside<00:04:48.010> I<00:04:48.280> don't

I would always do that so I think

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.900 
I would always do that so I think
businesses<00:05:43.900> that<00:05:44.080> understand<00:05:44.620> that<00:05:44.860> you<00:05:45.820> know

the<00:05:46.090> customer<00:05:46.480> service<00:05:46.810> is<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:46.990> really

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
the customer service is a really

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.740 
the customer service is a really
important<00:05:47.740> part<00:05:47.920> of<00:05:48.040> why<00:05:48.850> a<00:05:48.880> cyclist<00:05:49.510> would

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
important part of why a cyclist would

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.840 
important part of why a cyclist would
share<00:05:49.960> that<00:05:49.990> information<00:05:50.490> but<00:05:51.490> I<00:05:51.730> think

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
share that information but I think

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.610 
share that information but I think
that's<00:05:52.210> also<00:05:52.420> a<00:05:52.600> really<00:05:52.930> easy<00:05:53.080> thing<00:05:53.200> to<00:05:53.380> do

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
that's also a really easy thing to do
