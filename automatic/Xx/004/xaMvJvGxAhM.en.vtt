00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
generation in terms of hardware features

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.939 
generation in terms of hardware features
and<00:00:32.940> software<00:00:33.300> hardware<00:00:34.260> wise<00:00:34.410> Apple<00:00:34.829> has

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
and software hardware wise Apple has

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.470 
and software hardware wise Apple has
went<00:00:35.129> back<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> longer<00:00:35.910> rectangular

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
went back to the longer rectangular

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
went back to the longer rectangular
design<00:00:36.629> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> older<00:00:37.470> nanos<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:38.400> means<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
design of the older nanos which means a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
design of the older nanos which means a
bigger<00:00:39.000> higher<00:00:39.360> res<00:00:39.629> screen<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.589> video

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
bigger higher res screen so video

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
bigger higher res screen so video
functionality<00:00:41.460> has<00:00:41.610> returned<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.269> you<00:00:42.720> guys

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
functionality has returned and you guys

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.259 
functionality has returned and you guys
can<00:00:43.110> all<00:00:43.350> rejoice<00:00:43.530> because<00:00:44.159> once<00:00:44.760> again<00:00:45.089> you

the go to your heart's content on the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
the go to your heart's content on the
software<00:00:50.280> side<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:50.760> uses<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.089> grid<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
software side it now uses a grid and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.179 
software side it now uses a grid and
icon<00:00:51.989> system<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.890> looks<00:00:53.040> like<00:00:53.159> a

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:53.189 
icon system that looks like a

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:55.399 
icon system that looks like a
militarized<00:00:53.610> version<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> iOS<00:00:54.330> so<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
militarized version of iOS so the

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.049 
militarized version of iOS so the
interface<00:00:55.890> should<00:00:55.920> look<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.519> mirror<00:00:56.729> to<00:00:56.909> any

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
interface should look for mirror to any

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.270 
interface should look for mirror to any
Apple<00:00:57.390> user<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.439> the<00:00:58.619> first<00:00:58.860> time<00:00:59.009> ever
