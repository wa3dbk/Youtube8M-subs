extract<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.800> also<00:00:34.950> use<00:00:35.280> lemon<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
like lemon flavor or almond extract is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.700 
like lemon flavor or almond extract is
nice<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:40.230> well

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
nice as well

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.940 
nice as well
or<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.040> could<00:00:41.250> combine<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:42.059> together

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.910 

start<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.219> melting<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.239> butter<00:00:48.860> in<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
start with melting your butter in a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.279 
start with melting your butter in a
microwave<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.610> now<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.510> make<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
microwave and now we can make the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
microwave and now we can make the
frosting<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.610> basically<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.270> need<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
frosting so basically you just need to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.800 
frosting so basically you just need to
add<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.250> ingredients<00:01:00.000> into<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.050> bowl

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.550 

now<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.590> adding<00:01:07.740> vanilla<00:01:08.220> extract<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:12.560> can

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
now I'm adding vanilla extract you can

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.850 
now I'm adding vanilla extract you can
control<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> thickness<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:15.470> milk<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
control the thickness with milk if you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
control the thickness with milk if you
want<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.460> frosting<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> little

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
want your frosting to be a little

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.609 
want your frosting to be a little
thinner<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> add<00:01:19.590> more<00:01:19.920> milk

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.310 

make<00:01:27.619> sure<00:01:27.859> you<00:01:28.070> cover<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.429> frosting<00:01:29.060> with

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
make sure you cover the frosting with

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.149 
make sure you cover the frosting with
clear<00:01:30.320> plastic<00:01:30.619> wrap<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.460> prevent<00:01:31.670> crusting

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.859 

I'm<00:01:37.640> using<00:01:37.999> Emory<00:01:38.630> colors<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.319> color<00:01:39.560> my<00:01:39.740> icing

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
I'm using Emory colors to color my icing

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.069 
I'm using Emory colors to color my icing
you<00:01:41.869> can<00:01:42.049> also<00:01:42.229> use<00:01:42.619> Wilton<00:01:43.130> colors<00:01:43.490> although

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
you can also use Wilton colors although

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.450 
you can also use Wilton colors although
especially<00:01:45.079> Reds<00:01:45.350> are<00:01:45.649> really<00:01:45.950> hard<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.310> get

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
especially Reds are really hard to get

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.480 
especially Reds are really hard to get
so<00:01:46.789> if<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.539> can<00:01:47.840> find<00:01:48.200> Emory<00:01:48.799> colors<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.310> can

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
so if you can find Emory colors you can

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.910 
so if you can find Emory colors you can
use<00:01:49.959> Wilton<00:01:50.959> but<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.200> recommend<00:01:51.709> using

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
use Wilton but I recommend using

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.849 
use Wilton but I recommend using
americolor<00:01:52.630> 0my<00:01:53.630> sprinkles<00:01:54.229> or<00:01:54.469> sending

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
americolor 0my sprinkles or sending

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.260 
americolor 0my sprinkles or sending
sugars<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.280> can<00:01:55.990> use<00:01:57.130> whatever<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.609> like<00:01:58.640> to

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
sugars you can use whatever you like to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.349 
sugars you can use whatever you like to
use<00:02:00.189> whatever<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.429> have<00:02:01.609> on<00:02:01.640> hand<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.179> let's

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
use whatever you have on hand so let's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.690 
use whatever you have on hand so let's
get<00:02:02.539> started<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.259> have<00:02:04.130> some<00:02:04.959> sugar<00:02:05.959> trees

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
get started I have some sugar trees

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.089 
get started I have some sugar trees
sugar<00:02:07.700> cookie<00:02:08.060> trees<00:02:08.560> using<00:02:09.560> small<00:02:09.829> spatula

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
sugar cookie trees using small spatula

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.009 
sugar cookie trees using small spatula
or<00:02:10.670> if<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.849> don't<00:02:11.000> have<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> small<00:02:11.540> angled

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
or if you don't have a small angled

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.280 
or if you don't have a small angled
spatula<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.829> can<00:02:13.489> also<00:02:13.640> use<00:02:13.940> butter<00:02:14.120> knife

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.960 

this<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.440> probably<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.010> simplest<00:02:19.370> technique

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
this is probably the simplest technique

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.990 
this is probably the simplest technique
you<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:20.540> want<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.140> apply<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.099> very<00:02:22.489> thin<00:02:22.579> layer

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
you just want to apply a very thin layer

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.869 
you just want to apply a very thin layer
of<00:02:23.440> frosting<00:02:24.440> onto<00:02:24.799> your<00:02:25.280> cookie<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.760> then

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
of frosting onto your cookie and then

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.080 
of frosting onto your cookie and then
using<00:02:26.329> sprinkles<00:02:27.170> or<00:02:28.129> nonpareils

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
using sprinkles or nonpareils

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.470 
using sprinkles or nonpareils
you<00:02:29.269> can<00:02:31.359> sprinkle<00:02:32.359> some<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.660> those<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:33.200> top

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
you can sprinkle some of those on top

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.050 
you can sprinkle some of those on top
here<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.660> tool<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:37.370> really<00:02:37.670> handy

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
here is a tool that it's really handy

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.150 
here is a tool that it's really handy
usually<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:38.810> used<00:02:38.959> for<00:02:39.049> cakes<00:02:39.440> but<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.769> find

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
usually it's used for cakes but I find

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.490 
usually it's used for cakes but I find
it<00:02:40.310> works<00:02:40.549> really<00:02:41.000> well<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.510> cookies<00:02:42.109> like

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
it works really well on cookies like

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.780 
it works really well on cookies like
this<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:43.069> gives<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.150> nice<00:02:44.329> texture<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.790> it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
this to gives it a nice texture and it's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.970 
this to gives it a nice texture and it's
super<00:02:47.209> super<00:02:47.389> fast<00:02:47.720> I'm<00:02:48.109> using<00:02:48.380> small

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
super super fast I'm using small

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
stars you can find this in Michael's

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.149 
stars you can find this in Michael's
these<00:03:08.780> are<00:03:08.959> from<00:03:09.170> builtin<00:03:11.829> this<00:03:12.829> would<00:03:13.040> look

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
these are from builtin this would look

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:21.230 
these are from builtin this would look
really<00:03:13.370> pretty<00:03:13.640> on<00:03:13.790> white<00:03:14.180> icing

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.450 

here<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:21.930> have<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.170> mitten<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.980> I'm<00:03:23.040> starting

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
here I have a mitten so I'm starting

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.200 
here I have a mitten so I'm starting
with<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.510> green<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.770> then<00:03:26.280> using<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.820> same

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
with the green and then using the same

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.530 
with the green and then using the same
tool<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.780> did<00:03:27.990> for<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.830> trees<00:03:29.240> to<00:03:30.240> give<00:03:30.510> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
tool I did for the trees to give a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.340 
tool I did for the trees to give a
different<00:03:31.080> texture<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.480> then<00:03:33.480> sprinkles<00:03:34.200> on

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
different texture and then sprinkles on

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:48.430 
different texture and then sprinkles on
top

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.870 

this<00:03:49.040> frosting<00:03:49.670> will<00:03:50.030> crust<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.520> doesn't

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
this frosting will crust but it doesn't

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.210 
this frosting will crust but it doesn't
take<00:03:53.030> as<00:03:53.180> long<00:03:53.210> as<00:03:53.720> real<00:03:53.900> icing<00:03:54.140> I'd<00:03:54.560> say<00:03:54.770> 30

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
take as long as real icing I'd say 30

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.170 
take as long as real icing I'd say 30
minutes<00:03:55.430> tops

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
minutes tops

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.360 
minutes tops
perhaps<00:03:56.800> depends<00:03:57.800> on<00:03:57.890> where<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.250> are<00:03:58.280> located

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
perhaps depends on where you are located

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.880 
perhaps depends on where you are located
where<00:03:59.030> you<00:03:59.210> are<00:03:59.360> located<00:03:59.570> if<00:04:00.080> it's<00:04:00.260> too<00:04:00.500> humid

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
where you are located if it's too humid

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.320 
where you are located if it's too humid
where<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.430> are<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.790> may<00:04:01.940> take<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> little

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
where you are it may take a little

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.080 
where you are it may take a little
longer<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:03.440> generally<00:04:04.070> 30<00:04:04.250> minutes<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:04.940> it

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
longer but generally 30 minutes and it

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.480 
longer but generally 30 minutes and it
crusts<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.780> can<00:04:05.990> pack<00:04:06.710> them<00:04:07.010> or<00:04:07.190> store

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
crusts and you can pack them or store

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.110 
crusts and you can pack them or store
them<00:04:07.640> in<00:04:08.380> an<00:04:09.380> airtight<00:04:09.530> container<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.940> can

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
them in an airtight container you can

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.890 
them in an airtight container you can
also<00:04:14.270> pipe<00:04:14.600> with<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.110> frosting<00:04:16.900> really

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
also pipe with the frosting really

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.160 
also pipe with the frosting really
quickly<00:04:18.410> then<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.610> can<00:04:19.880> do<00:04:20.600> different<00:04:20.989> colors

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
quickly then you can do different colors

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.830 
quickly then you can do different colors
I'm<00:04:21.470> gonna<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:21.859> blue<00:04:22.450> snowflakes<00:04:23.450> these<00:04:23.720> are

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840

for<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.830> last<00:05:28.009> design<00:05:28.520> I<00:05:28.550> decided<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.330> make<00:05:29.449> a

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
for the last design I decided to make a

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.189 
for the last design I decided to make a
mini<00:05:30.099> star<00:05:31.099> and<00:05:31.430> doing<00:05:31.699> a<00:05:31.819> zigzag<00:05:32.270> line<00:05:32.300> dip<00:05:33.050> it

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
mini star and doing a zigzag line dip it

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.980 
mini star and doing a zigzag line dip it
into<00:05:33.580> silver<00:05:34.580> sanding<00:05:35.060> sugar<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.629> that's<00:05:35.810> it

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
into silver sanding sugar and that's it

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.110
