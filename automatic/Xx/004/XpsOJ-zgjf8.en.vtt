 hi all the boys are cirs 57 e 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:24.000
 today I do a little advertising today 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:28.330
 a group of kids he wanted 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.039
 to recreate a game of pokémon entitled 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.340
 pokémon ancient times 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.760
 then practically as you can guess 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.460
 from the title the pokémon this game yes 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.489
 based on the ancestors of the pokemon gods 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.890
 still only exist for now 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.260
 pokédex version available 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.790
 see the three starters and that will be 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.890
 also available while playing 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.780
 they were really very good too 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 especially to draw these these 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.610
 pokémon also to organize a nice game 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.170
 because in the preview I also saw that 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.700
 a nice game 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 as you can see I already have the pokédex there 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.020
 it's not that we need it so much I downloaded it 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.080
 from their website their facebook page e 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.760
 inter or in description and nothing about it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.470
 download and here are the cities 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.440
 you can also search as you can see 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.509
 sorted by weight type name number 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.820
 height 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.000
 now if we go to see there are various 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.130
 bari as varied as sicile various various 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 options in this pokédex for example 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 tell us general the number says the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.030
 type height and weight and his 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.710
 description his head is very robust 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 to resist the blows suffered during the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.530
 proof of flight tests 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.259
 as you can see the sprite at motion 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.910
 also very good I would say grass youth 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:03.450
 50 percent increase goes well 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:04.950
 the statistical skill okay the hp le 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.729
 what's this 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.250
 as soon as you stop we stop with the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:16.320
 cursor apply ultrà windows 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.830
 another screen moved name then 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.760
 plane aero leaf level 16 flying 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.660
 give 60 normal growth action 11 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.430
 whip you know it was my look I don't know if 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.010
 they also have the possibility of obtaining 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.250
 more than four moves then this thing 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.410
 already the verse is interesting 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.690
 for now it is not available to why 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.510
 still maybe they have to invent them not 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.010
 I know however you can information 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.380
 see the developers the designers 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.810
 they were really very good and mine 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.799
 opinion however we pass to the second 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:00.180
 pokémon Clauer try a fire 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:02.280
 then you can see that they come out here 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.740
 of the flames of his tail 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.020
 general formations number 4 of the pokédex 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.209
 fire type heights 45 cm weight 150 here 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.000
 the measurement units are absent 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.010
 limb patience length is reason 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.520
 of pride 3 more clauers are longer longer 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.980

 there are some there are vda arts 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.310
 however, we pass over statistics and 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.830
 oh well you see and statistics moved 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.110
 roar scratch brazier heart of a lion 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.680

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.700

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.600
