00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.870
 Today I spend a Tennenplatz «tiki-taca» Med on many request 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.240
 do I stop with all these Lakic and give and we need to 250 grams 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.420
 Lean quark 250 grams Yoko is that is about half of these guards 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.759
 something worse with 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.769
 and of course the most important thing is the kol kol a receive video cucumber i use 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.949
 because yes because the shell works with Red 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.190
 Garlic namely like to go so that's why Line 8 can be seen here 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.860
 which is still a bit damp in the SMI can many fresher than this one dries 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.400
 You sometimes get to buy a splash of lemon otherwise 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.040
 if for the taste 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.400
 since and permanent employees and a splash and 7 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.450
 Burkert especially prepared for you with this rast 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.480
 well then 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.410
 so that the short pieces are not too fine but not too coarse 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.430
 that's the downside to consistency 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.170
 I'll give it a go now, it's added to the quark 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.710
 Why 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 then the itching 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.800
 and now it has to be like that 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.050
 and that the main approach criticism is of course the bull hole 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.960
 a very good CHF to prepare the garlic a bit beforehand and the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.480
 to cut through many of them 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.530
 then he developed a very special aroma 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.180
 which then afterwards also in the subtitle benefit how much one 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.450
 Going into it is up to you. It can be a lot of banks 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.900
 have their be depending on how much you like 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.940
 I'll put it all in a street. Tech has about three little kids 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.190
 uses 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.180
 that's my favorite garlic better from Ikea which is super good and you have to 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.180
 not very active 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.129
 th 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.669
 and you can look this little kitten or even good 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.939
 and that still excerpt interest naturally nothing this is now for 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.299
 Knife at first it means that is not so is their opinion 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.059
 has like that 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:36.139
 Now I'm checked the whole time from the inside and consistency 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.900
 the consistency struggles to give up a little change 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.819
 anyway, about five hours to six hours past ten 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.609
 that another novel can develop botta now applies the decorating me 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 give something lemon kept that way 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.939
 of course, keep ill 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.670
 Of course, I can start fresh community leader 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.119
 that's especially good 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.119
 a little salt depending on how much taste 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.759
 a small dash of olive oil 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.899
 and something was 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 even one says yes maybe it was to look for Advent in the vertical 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:25.769
 but he just gives 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.229
 a little a spicy touch 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.229
 then I give the whole thing just behind it forever 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.019
 that already makes it different 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.099
 on
