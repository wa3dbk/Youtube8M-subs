can't get on until later in the spring
we<00:00:54.920> used<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.309> use<00:00:55.489> our<00:00:56.120> roll<00:00:56.720> board<00:00:56.960> plows<00:00:57.199> in<00:00:57.620> a

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
we used to use our roll board plows in a

we used to use our roll board plows in a
rotor<00:00:57.920> tiller<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.489> do<00:00:58.640> all<00:00:58.820> our<00:00:59.089> fields<00:00:59.660> very

small<00:01:00.710> residue<00:01:01.160> we<00:01:01.460> use<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.640> planet<00:01:02.089> junior

small residue we use a planet junior

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.710 
small residue we use a planet junior
planter<00:01:02.869> so<00:01:03.049> we<00:01:03.170> had<00:01:03.409> to<00:01:03.650> use<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:04.630> system<00:01:05.630> that

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
planter so we had to use a system that

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.719 
planter so we had to use a system that
had<00:01:05.810> very<00:01:05.960> little<00:01:06.170> residue<00:01:06.290> then<00:01:07.190> as<00:01:07.310> I<00:01:07.460> change

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
had very little residue then as I change

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.539 
had very little residue then as I change
planters<00:01:08.240> we<00:01:08.479> were<00:01:08.570> able<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:08.869> go<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.590> reduced

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
dry residue in the spring there's enough

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.359 
dry residue in the spring there's enough
residue<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.439> keep<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.680> weed<00:01:27.830> pressure<00:01:28.100> down

but<00:01:29.299> with<00:01:29.450> this<00:01:29.570> amount<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.930> pressure<00:01:30.170> I'm

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
but with this amount of pressure I'm

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.760

spin spreader and then we use the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.770 
spin spreader and then we use the
perfecter<00:01:39.980> to<00:01:40.160> turn<00:01:40.490> them<00:01:40.640> under<00:01:40.970> at<00:01:41.600> about

tangle up in the chisel plow this is our
chisel<00:01:55.640> plow<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:56.720> converted<00:01:57.200> using<00:01:57.320> this

about 20 years ago before that we
moldboard<00:02:00.050> plowed<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.000> harrowed<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.240> then

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
moldboard plowed and harrowed and then

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.870 
moldboard plowed and harrowed and then
we<00:02:03.020> moldboard<00:02:03.440> plowed<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.040> rototilled<00:02:04.580> as

we moldboard plowed and rototilled as

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.940 
we moldboard plowed and rototilled as
the<00:02:05.090> rotavator<00:02:05.510> or<00:02:05.870> rototiller<00:02:06.320> became<00:02:06.710> more

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the rotavator or rototiller became more

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.059 
the rotavator or rototiller became more
prevalent<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:08.869> saves<00:02:09.229> us<00:02:09.409> a<00:02:09.440> lot<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.800> time

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
prevalent this saves us a lot of time

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.520 
prevalent this saves us a lot of time
and<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.849> reduces<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.420> fracturing<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
and it reduces the fracturing of the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.289 
and it reduces the fracturing of the
soil<00:02:12.860> or<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.129> beating<00:02:13.610> up<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.909> soil<00:02:14.150> I

you'll<00:02:23.750> make<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.930> furrow<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.560> kills<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.980> soil

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
you'll make a furrow that kills the soil

you'll make a furrow that kills the soil
about<00:02:26.180> 12<00:02:26.659> inches<00:02:26.900> wide<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.560> shanks<00:02:27.920> are<00:02:28.069> 12

about 12 inches wide the shanks are 12
inches<00:02:28.519> apart<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:29.060> entire<00:02:29.299> field<00:02:29.659> gets

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
points will make it so that the big

points will make it so that the big
furrows<00:02:37.880> are<00:02:38.620> wiped<00:02:39.620> out<00:02:39.800> or<00:02:40.099> smoothed<00:02:40.400> over

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
and then the rake on back smooths it out

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.699 
and then the rake on back smooths it out
so<00:02:43.730> it's<00:02:43.849> almost<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.300> perfect<00:02:44.660> seed<00:02:45.050> bed<00:02:45.260> but

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
so it's almost a perfect seed bed but

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.110

it's<00:02:45.830> still<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.250> too<00:02:46.430> coarse<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.849> plant

there's a lot of trash that the chisel

principle as the chisel plow we have a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.490 
principle as the chisel plow we have a
set<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.269> aggressive<00:03:02.569> tines<00:03:02.989> in<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.260> front

that<00:03:03.860> are<00:03:03.920> spaced<00:03:04.250> about<00:03:04.519> four<00:03:04.790> inches<00:03:05.000> apart

that are spaced about four inches apart

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.690 
that are spaced about four inches apart
and<00:03:05.630> they<00:03:06.470> will<00:03:06.650> fracture<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.160> soil<00:03:07.430> more

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
and they will fracture the soil more

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.180 
and they will fracture the soil more
than<00:03:07.910> what<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.150> chisel<00:03:08.480> plow<00:03:08.630> did<00:03:09.100> then<00:03:10.100> we

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
than what the chisel plow did then we

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.140 
than what the chisel plow did then we
have<00:03:10.310> another<00:03:10.400> rake<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:12.140> will<00:03:12.350> flatten<00:03:12.739> the

ridges that the chisels make and will

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.770

also aerate with the slanted tines and

are the same as any other planter and
then<00:04:33.500> when<00:04:33.620> we<00:04:33.710> get<00:04:33.830> down<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.370> working

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
then when we get down to the working

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.480 
then when we get down to the working
unit<00:04:35.030> there's<00:04:35.720> a<00:04:35.810> shovel<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:37.039> clears<00:04:37.340> the

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
trash out of the way I set a disc and

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.279 
trash out of the way I set a disc and
opens<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.520> trench<00:04:40.789> and<00:04:41.090> then<00:04:41.690> another<00:04:41.870> set<00:04:42.169> of

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
opens the trench and then another set of

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.800 
opens the trench and then another set of
discs<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.770> presses<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.760> trench<00:04:44.000> closed

with<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.020> seed<00:04:45.230> in<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.500> so<00:04:46.010> it<00:04:46.220> really<00:04:46.250> moves

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
with the seed in it so it really moves

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.220
