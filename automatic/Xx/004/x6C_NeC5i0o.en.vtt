00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.270
 continue to be cursed with the comparative test 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.680
 moderate cr7 weber 9 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.919
 and yes I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.919
 watch 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.240
 in terms of comfort lies in our view of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.820
 voter clearly ahead 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.800
 because simply a softer material has 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.720
 this feels better on the foot 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.140
 all if at a buckle here 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.640
 the 50 is just a bit too stiff and 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.540
 he needs something too long for him 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.309
 einzuspielen 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.550
 that's why we find the rapper easy 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.550
 better 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.140
 From our point of view, the ball feeling 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.780
 balanced 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.880
 The 50 has a bit stiff 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.229
 material, however , this is not a disadvantage 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.229
 towards the parents 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.950
 that can 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.320
 As far as the processing is concerned, both are 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.590
 shoes really on a very high 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.230
 level 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.420
 However, we believe that the 50 something 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.190
 the durability is a little better 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.410
 cuts off mainly because its material 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.120
 just a bit stiffer and thus something 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.120
 seems to be more resilient 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.209
 450 angeles a bit more stable and therefore 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.940
 also on artificial turf against the wk 9 is 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.000
 a bit more flexible but the sole is not 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.209
 due to lawn designed in weight 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.130
 50 will win it about 15 grams lighter than 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.130
 the 900 is 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.900
 In this duel I would personally the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.790
 Nine preference is the comfort 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.120
 just a bit better 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.370
 The material is a little softer where I am 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.930
 with the messie something better bowl 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.709
 maybe that's been done 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.120
 also subjective is found in ball feel 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.609
 I'll be pretty soon 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.680
 similar but nevertheless one lies here the 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.340
 wafer 9 in front and that's it 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.470
 winner from my point of view in this duel 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.030
 yes i see it very similar to i think 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.520
 Each of the two shoes has its own 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.160
 own strengths and weakness, however 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.860
 I just put a lot of emphasis on comfort 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.810
 and since the wafer 9 cuts in the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.699
 cristiano ronaldo version easy 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.520
 much better off because he is on 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.410
 better to adjust the foot and me 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.270
 I just feel better overall 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.199
 that's why the winner is in me, too 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.509
 this duel of puppies in my view 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.720
 wins this duel of the wafers 9 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.330
 I think the material is very soft 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.349
 had a very good ball feeling 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.650
 but I have to say that Bernard 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:58.289
 50 in the very good flank better but also 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.199
 Therefore scorer could shoot 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.669
 I throw both highly recommended 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.930
 But shoes for me is the 9th 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.030
 in order to participate in the raffle 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.650
 should you rate that many and 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.810
 answer which question 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.780
 school falls through better of f50 fair 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.979
 or the puppy new cr7 it seems quite
