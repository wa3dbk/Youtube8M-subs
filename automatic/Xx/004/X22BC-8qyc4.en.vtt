office for windows but I don't agree
with<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.290> idea<00:02:28.800> because<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.370> use<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.580> Napoli

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
with that idea because the use of Napoli

with that idea because the use of Napoli
run<00:02:30.239> windows<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.870> get<00:02:31.050> viruses<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:33.200> that's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
run windows you get viruses so that's

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.850 
run windows you get viruses so that's
the<00:02:34.349> problem<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.690> am<00:02:37.050> trying<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.500> figure<00:02:37.830> it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the problem so I am trying to figure it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.380 
the problem so I am trying to figure it
out<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.340> trying<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.790> find<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.440> reason<00:02:40.950> why

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
out and trying to find the reason why

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.740 
out and trying to find the reason why
these<00:02:42.390> problems<00:02:42.930> occurs<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:44.160> found<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
these problems occurs and I found the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.289 
these problems occurs and I found the
cause<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.010> problems<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.819> cause<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
cause of the problems the cause of the

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.190 
cause of the problems the cause of the
problem<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:50.250> very<00:02:50.400> easy<00:02:50.790> just<00:02:51.239> one<00:02:51.810> snap

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
problem is it's very easy just one snap

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.250 
problem is it's very easy just one snap
of<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.440> finger<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:53.450> Microsoft<00:02:54.450> consoled<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
of a finger that Microsoft consoled the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.800 
of a finger that Microsoft consoled the
problems<00:02:55.769> but<00:02:57.200> they<00:02:58.200> won't<00:02:58.410> do<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:59.810> didn't

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
problems but they won't do it I didn't

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.559 
problems but they won't do it I didn't
say<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.890> do<00:03:02.959> but<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:03.989> said<00:03:04.440> one<00:03:05.599> do

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
say can do but I said one do

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.910 
say can do but I said one do
the<00:03:09.569> cars<00:03:10.459> in<00:03:11.459> order<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.849> be<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:13.769> know<00:03:13.860> she
