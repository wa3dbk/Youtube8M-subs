and up Apple has implemented a new
latitude<00:00:18.779> /<00:00:19.350> longitude<00:00:19.970> tracking<00:00:20.970> scheme<00:00:21.390> not

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
latitude / longitude tracking scheme not

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.679 
latitude / longitude tracking scheme not
some<00:00:22.109> not<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.830> much<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.070> tracking<00:00:23.670> scheme<00:00:24.000> but

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
some not so much a tracking scheme but

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.470 
some not so much a tracking scheme but
the<00:00:25.260> iphone<00:00:25.619> does<00:00:25.890> record<00:00:26.340> your<00:00:26.699> location<00:00:27.330> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the iphone does record your location and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.259 
the iphone does record your location and
as<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.590> part<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> itunes<00:00:29.460> sync<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.240> of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
as a part of the itunes sync it kind of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.709 
as a part of the itunes sync it kind of
sinks<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.859> information<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.369> itunes<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.210> in

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
sinks that information with itunes so in

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.330 
sinks that information with itunes so in
all<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:33.870> backups<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.649> itunes<00:00:35.040> there's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it kind it's kind of scary i guess i

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
it kind it's kind of scary i guess i
can't<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.600> those<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> who<00:00:43.170> are

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
worried about you know security and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.970 
worried about you know security and
things<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.930> which<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.590> all<00:00:46.739> should<00:00:46.950> be

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
things like that which we all should be

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.040 
things like that which we all should be
so<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.059> think<00:00:48.239> about<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:48.899> could

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
so when you think about it there could

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.580 
so when you think about it there could
be<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.480> probably<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> year<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.350> data

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
be you know probably like a year of data

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.389 
be you know probably like a year of data
stored<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.340> these<00:00:54.059> backups<00:00:54.600> maybe<00:00:55.079> i'll<00:00:55.890> s4

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
stored in these backups maybe i'll s4

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.430 
stored in these backups maybe i'll s4
datos<00:00:56.699> been<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.239> quite<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.449> while<00:00:57.690> so

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
datos been out for quite a while so

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.130

shocking actually now if you read your
privacy<00:01:03.629> policy<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.920> Apple<00:01:05.339> issues<00:01:06.500> then

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
privacy policy that Apple issues then

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.490 
privacy policy that Apple issues then
you'll<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.260> this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

when<00:01:18.360> they<00:01:18.450> saw<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.659> maps<00:01:19.049> detailing<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
when they saw the maps detailing the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.690 
when they saw the maps detailing the
tracking<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.979> that's<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> point<00:01:23.490> though

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700

the<00:01:24.180> point<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> jailbreak<00:01:25.140> community<00:01:25.170> has

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the point is the jailbreak community has

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.420 
the point is the jailbreak community has
responded<00:01:26.720> really<00:01:27.720> quickly<00:01:27.920> within<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.400> a

day<00:01:29.840> there<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> jailbreak<00:01:31.290> solution<00:01:31.710> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
day there is a jailbreak solution that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.850 
day there is a jailbreak solution that
is<00:01:32.250> available<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.759> stop<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:34.229> tracking<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
is available to stop the tracking and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.719 
is available to stop the tracking and
its<00:01:35.189> tracks<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.119> called<00:01:36.390> appropriately

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
its tracks and it's called appropriately

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.230 
its tracks and it's called appropriately
untracked<00:01:39.259> will<00:01:40.259> show<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:41.090> go<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> our

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
untracked will show you here go to our

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.039 
untracked will show you here go to our
changes<00:01:43.430> there<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.090> top<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
changes there it is right at the top so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
changes there it is right at the top so
what<00:01:46.290> untracked<00:01:46.770> does<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> same<00:01:47.820> guy

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
what untracked does is from the same guy

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.289 
what untracked does is from the same guy
who<00:01:48.030> did<00:01:48.180> Action<00:01:48.689> menu<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.799> etc<00:01:50.310> what

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
who did Action menu you know etc what

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.289 
who did Action menu you know etc what
this<00:01:51.479> does<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.820> continuously<00:01:53.820> cleans

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
this does is that it continuously cleans

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.270 
this does is that it continuously cleans
up<00:01:54.479> location<00:01:55.200> these<00:01:55.380> history<00:01:55.860> data<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
up location these history data in the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.630 
up location these history data in the
background<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.719> next<00:01:57.899> time<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.259> sync

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
background so the next time you sync

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.850 
background so the next time you sync
with<00:01:59.640> iTunes<00:02:00.170> there's<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.560> any

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
with iTunes there's not going to be any

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.389 
with iTunes there's not going to be any
tracking<00:02:02.250> data<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.810> file<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
tracking data in that file so it

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.490 
tracking data in that file so it
basically<00:02:05.729> runs<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.329> daemon<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
basically runs a daemon in the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.820 
basically runs a daemon in the
