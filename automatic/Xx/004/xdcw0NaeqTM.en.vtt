00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.880
 Alvaro Ormeño and Renny Vega spoke 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.130
 today with the media the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.230
 extra and monumental and both envisioned a 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.730
 hard duel on Saturday against audax though 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.690
 They hope to win to stay in the good 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.789
 path and good with a lot of responsibility 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.710
 especially because we know that as 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.109
 we say we are all final and the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.789
 last final that we have left to enter 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.919
 in the playoffs that we have and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 Well, God willing, the work that 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.920
 we have been doing in the weeks it will be 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.910
 see reflected the day knows the team does 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.730
 a long time that I could not baste 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.530
 a couple of wins followed like that is that 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 I think this is the opportunity 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.930
 to continue gaining confidence as 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.220
 team and obviously there's still the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.310
 possibility of staying out so 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.680
 the three points are very important yes 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.300
 well we know that the little I know 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.150
 with a very good team a team that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.100
 surely it will not complicate the 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.870
 substance of the premises and good little the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.939
 help you can say the playing field 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.710
 that we are not used to but good 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.710
 I do not think it is 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.759
 that nothing fails at that moment in the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.320
 game time the man at home then 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.030
 He commented that he is happy to return to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.409
 play as right side while 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.090
 The goalie hopes to demonstrate commitment 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.850
 with the institution classifying 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.740
 playoff to and make a good paper 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.229
 it is obviously the position that commands as 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.290
 to play during the previous tournament I 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.290
 touched in another place but but I see where 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.840
 I'm comfortable with the banana if it's 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.960
 How happy and hopeful to follow 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.930
 reaffirming week week to follow 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.110
 in the stellar team is also 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.580
 committed to the club with 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.130
 ourselves because we have a debt 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.659
 pending then the idea is to enter 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.729
 the properties because after I entered 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.039
 the playoff and everything starts from scratch and 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.520
 there he is already good and he is more attentive and 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.289
 wait for the team that touches us the ex 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.610
 gymnastics then confidenció a talk 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.399
 he had with his teammates after the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.720
 classic and expect a rematch goes just is 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.580
 classic the first thing I talked about in the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.560
 wardrobe was that 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.900
 if we had three weeks to reverse 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.380
 the bad image we had left and what 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 and that would be a nice 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.570
 ranch for us to face again 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.300
 to a team that is going through a very good 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.880
 moment but obviously playing a 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.640
 classic gives you one more important plus in 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.020
 one in a situation like being in 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.660
 playoffs that they are also with a 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.190
 parallel competition I do not know would be a 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.330
 cute party to me personally 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.220
 I would love to play with them again 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.930
 finally now half stressed that it 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.670
 seek to bring people identified with the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.290
 institution to inculcate you all 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.070
 in the monumental what colo means 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.840
 colo 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.330
 obviously what 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.530
 one who was born here in the club I 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.900
 like to see the stadium 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.120
 of people you meet me girls 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.180
 it seems very positive 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.390
 jaime see a guy identified with the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.490
 club juan gutierrez appetizer that 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.760
 He worked for a long time here he played here 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.760
 the club 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.190
 and that kind of person obviously that you 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.350
 can inculcate the little ones that 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.840
 they are working in cadets what 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.840
 it really is to play in colo colo
