as you can see as I go to hit if my bat
angle<00:00:56.700> is<00:00:58.100> working<00:00:59.100> down<00:00:59.310> below<00:00:59.760> my<00:00:59.940> hands

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
angle is working down below my hands

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.240 
angle is working down below my hands
like<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.690> supposed<00:01:00.990> to<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.710> lower<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
like it's supposed to the lower the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.690 
like it's supposed to the lower the
pitch<00:01:02.490> is<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:03.600> more<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.980> barrel<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.520> going

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
pitch is the more that barrel is going

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
pitch is the more that barrel is going
to<00:01:05.760> drop<00:01:06.000> slightly<00:01:06.510> below<00:01:06.690> my<00:01:06.960> hands<00:01:07.380> it's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
to drop slightly below my hands it's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.250 
to drop slightly below my hands it's
gonna<00:01:07.710> match<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:08.310> posture<00:01:08.850> angle<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.020> need

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
gonna match my posture angle but we need

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
gonna match my posture angle but we need
to<00:01:10.440> go<00:01:10.590> ahead<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.520> flexibility<00:01:12.390> in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to go ahead and have some flexibility in

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.720 
to go ahead and have some flexibility in
the<00:01:12.630> J<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.190> give<00:01:14.340> us<00:01:14.490> some

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
the J so that it can give us some

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.670 
the J so that it can give us some
accurate<00:01:15.090> feedback<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.020> premise<00:01:16.410> of<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
accurate feedback the premise of the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.660 
accurate feedback the premise of the
drill<00:01:16.980> is<00:01:17.370> to<00:01:17.640> start<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:18.200> wide<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.580> going

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
drill is to start off wide so it's going

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
drill is to start off wide so it's going
to<00:01:20.760> give<00:01:20.880> me<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> little<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.540> margin<00:01:21.990> for

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to give me a little bit more margin for

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
to give me a little bit more margin for
error<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.250> working<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.670> pitch<00:01:23.880> down<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
error so if I'm working a pitch down the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.870 
error so if I'm working a pitch down the
middle<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.200> come<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.860> contact<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
middle and I come down to contact you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.120 
middle and I come down to contact you
can<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.300> that<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.630> bat<00:01:27.810> head<00:01:28.050> moves<00:01:28.770> through

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
can see that the bat head moves through

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.030 
can see that the bat head moves through
and<00:01:29.400> does<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.390> hit<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:30.690> device<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.500> I'm

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
really work inside the ball you can

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.830 
really work inside the ball you can
adjust<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:44.190> outer<00:01:44.400> hook<00:01:44.790> device<00:01:45.150> of<00:01:45.479> course<00:01:45.720> I

adjust the outer hook device of course I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
adjust the outer hook device of course I
told<00:01:46.050> you<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.290> bent<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.190> can<00:01:47.310> bring<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.550> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
told you it bent and you can bring it a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.160 
told you it bent and you can bring it a
little<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:48.030> more<00:01:48.180> back<00:01:48.390> towards<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.960> catcher

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
little bit more back towards the catcher

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.690 
little bit more back towards the catcher
now<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.560> don't<00:01:49.770> want<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> get<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.310> extreme

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
now you don't want to get to an extreme

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.820 
now you don't want to get to an extreme
here<00:01:51.060> okay<00:01:51.660> because<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.020> can't<00:01:52.290> execute<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
here okay because we can't execute a

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.440 
here okay because we can't execute a
fundamentally<00:01:53.430> sound<00:01:53.640> stroke<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.150> still<00:01:54.330> hit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
fundamentally sound stroke and still hit

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.900 
fundamentally sound stroke and still hit
the<00:01:54.479> baseball<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.039> maybe<00:01:56.280> 45

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
the baseball but we can get maybe 45

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.969 
the baseball but we can get maybe 45
degrees<00:01:57.330> if<00:01:57.690> that's<00:01:58.200> 0<00:01:58.580> 45<00:01:59.580> degrees<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.020> we

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
degrees if that's 0 45 degrees and we

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.670 
degrees if that's 0 45 degrees and we
can<00:02:02.160> work

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.240 

and<00:02:08.150> still<00:02:09.150> execute<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> proper<00:02:10.290> properly

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and still execute a proper properly

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820

properly however if you execute the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.400 
properly however if you execute the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
fence drill incorrectly you're going to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.460 
fence drill incorrectly you're going to
rake<00:02:26.010> your<00:02:26.250> hands<00:02:26.550> along<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.150> fence<00:02:27.470> probably

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
rake your hands along the fence probably

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.890 
rake your hands along the fence probably
you<00:02:28.860> know<00:02:28.980> rake<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.790> know<00:02:29.880> $100<00:02:30.300> $200

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
you know rake your you know $100 $200

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.520 
you know rake your you know $100 $200
$300<00:02:31.530> bat<00:02:31.740> along<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> fence<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.410> know

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
$300 bat along the fence and you know

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.050 
$300 bat along the fence and you know
you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.860> also<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.610> fence<00:02:35.820> drill

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
you can also do the fence drill

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.790 
you can also do the fence drill
incorrectly<00:02:36.570> by<00:02:36.780> pulling<00:02:37.170> your<00:02:37.290> shoulder<00:02:37.620> off

incorrectly by pulling your shoulder off
so<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.400> really<00:02:38.970> feel<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.630> hit<00:02:39.840> trainer<00:02:40.140> is

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
so I really feel like the hit trainer is

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.990 
so I really feel like the hit trainer is
going<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.950> give<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.160> more<00:02:41.370> accurate<00:02:41.550> feedback
