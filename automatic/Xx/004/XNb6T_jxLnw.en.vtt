this is my 2d brewery mill that's the
electrical<00:00:09.059> box<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:11.780> hid<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.929> surprise<00:00:13.349> when<00:00:13.620> I

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
electrical box I hid the surprise when I

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.759 
electrical box I hid the surprise when I
when<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> purchased<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:16.010> thought<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.190> was<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:34.810 

to<00:00:23.779> 240<00:00:24.779> 480<00:00:25.430> motors<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.640> there<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:32.989> when<00:00:33.989> I

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
to 240 480 motors in there and when I

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.639 
to 240 480 motors in there and when I
started<00:00:35.820> working<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:37.079> became<00:00:37.469> apparent

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
started working on it it became apparent

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.030 
started working on it it became apparent
that<00:00:39.079> somebody<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.290> been<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that somebody had been in there and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.060 
that somebody had been in there and
changed<00:00:41.579> them<00:00:41.730> all<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> straight<00:00:43.760> 480<00:00:46.070> volts

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
changed them all to a straight 480 volts

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:57.639 
changed them all to a straight 480 volts
so<00:00:49.489> sort<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:52.820> awakening<00:00:53.820> moment<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:56.090> started

rusty rusty they were they took them
apart<00:01:23.430> those<00:01:23.820> switches<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.900> they're

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
apart those switches right here they're

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.510 
apart those switches right here they're
a<00:01:25.650> rotating<00:01:26.340> switch<00:01:26.990> they<00:01:28.220> operate<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a rotating switch they operate like that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.280 
a rotating switch they operate like that
and<00:01:30.090> there's<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> sriracha<00:01:31.290> tin<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:32.000> and

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
and there's a sriracha tin there and

and there's a sriracha tin there and
over<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> years<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:35.909> was<00:01:36.390> built<00:01:36.600> in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
over the years this thing was built in

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.910 
over the years this thing was built in
1942<00:01:37.700> over<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> years<00:01:39.090> metal<00:01:40.079> particles<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
1942 over the years metal particles and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.340 
1942 over the years metal particles and
dust<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.520> everything<00:01:41.869> else<00:01:42.869> had<00:01:43.049> collected

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
in there and when I first turned it on

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.499 
in there and when I first turned it on

ratchets had collected pieces of

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.339 
ratchets had collected pieces of
millings<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.200> forth<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.800> just<00:02:22.140> all<00:02:23.140> of

there<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.599> if<00:02:25.989> these<00:02:26.170> particles<00:02:27.069> would<00:02:27.370> get

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
there and if these particles would get

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.449 
there and if these particles would get
together<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.030> POW<00:02:28.420> smoke<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.380> start<00:02:30.220> fire

so that they a little more respectful or
what<00:02:50.290> they<00:02:50.440> are<00:02:54.269> anyway<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.709> 480<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.150> a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
what they are anyway the 480 this is a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.839 
what they are anyway the 480 this is a
test<00:02:58.569> this<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.620> 6<00:02:59.860> gauge<00:03:00.160> which<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.489> way

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
test this is 6 gauge which is way

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.690 
test this is 6 gauge which is way
overkill<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.510> don't<00:03:01.750> need<00:03:01.930> all<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.380> but<00:03:02.739> it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
overkill I don't need all of this but it

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:13.650 
overkill I don't need all of this but it
came<00:03:03.940> with<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:07.260> 482<00:03:08.260> 240<00:03:09.840> three-phase<00:03:12.299> 30<00:03:13.299> kV

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
came with this 482 240 three-phase 30 kV

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.250 
came with this 482 240 three-phase 30 kV
a<00:03:15.690> transformer<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:18.420> what<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.450> did<00:03:19.570> was<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.109> a

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
a transformer so what I did was is a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.750 
a transformer so what I did was is a
rewired<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.400> inside<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.709> hooked<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.670> up

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
rewired it inside and hooked it up

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.190 
rewired it inside and hooked it up
backwards<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.959> now<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.350> 2<00:03:26.590> 40<00:03:27.040> in

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
backwards so now I have 2 40 in

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.000 
backwards so now I have 2 40 in
three-phase<00:03:29.200> from<00:03:29.530> my<00:03:29.709> 3<00:03:30.040> phase<00:03:30.280> converter

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
three-phase from my 3 phase converter

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.949 
three-phase from my 3 phase converter
into<00:03:33.010> there<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.120> actually<00:03:34.269> end<00:03:34.569> of<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.720> box

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
into there and actually end of the box

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.830 
into there and actually end of the box
and<00:03:35.230> then<00:03:35.380> into<00:03:35.739> there<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.160> then<00:03:36.630> out<00:03:37.630> of

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
and then into there and then out of

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.680 
and then into there and then out of
there<00:03:38.019> at<00:03:38.139> 480<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.670> interestingly<00:03:39.970> that's<00:03:40.569> a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
there at 480 and interestingly that's a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.340 
there at 480 and interestingly that's a
delta

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
delta

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.590 
delta
that's<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:42.100> delta<00:03:44.220> configuration<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:46.180> there

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
that's a delta configuration in there

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.129 
that's a delta configuration in there
but<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.889> legs<00:03:48.160> when<00:03:49.000> they<00:03:49.120> get<00:03:49.359> over<00:03:49.510> here

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
but the legs when they get over here

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.610 
but the legs when they get over here
they<00:03:50.889> mimic<00:03:51.340> what<00:03:52.150> goes<00:03:52.450> in<00:03:52.690> on<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.109> on<00:03:53.410> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
they mimic what goes in on the on the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.740 
they mimic what goes in on the on the
three-phase<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:54.940> when<00:03:55.120> they're<00:03:55.269> going<00:03:55.450> into

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
three-phase so when they're going into

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.610 
three-phase so when they're going into
here<00:03:56.139> I<00:03:56.319> have<00:03:58.170> two<00:03:59.170> legs<00:03:59.440> at<00:04:00.239> 479<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:02.380> have

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
here I have two legs at 479 and I have

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.920 
here I have two legs at 479 and I have
one<00:04:02.859> leg<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.549> hot<00:04:03.730> leg<00:04:03.970> just<00:04:04.239> like<00:04:04.450> comes

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
one leg it's a hot leg just like comes

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.910 
one leg it's a hot leg just like comes
out<00:04:05.139> of<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:06.420> three-phase<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:07.989> runs

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
out of the three-phase and that runs

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.960 
out of the three-phase and that runs
about<00:04:10.739> 489<00:04:11.819> 493<00:04:13.019> in<00:04:14.019> there

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
about 489 493 in there

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.180 
about 489 493 in there
the<00:04:15.970> fellow<00:04:16.239> then<00:04:16.989> when<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.470> was<00:04:17.680> cleaning<00:04:17.979> it

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
the fellow then when I was cleaning it

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.990 
the fellow then when I was cleaning it
up<00:04:18.310> originally

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
up originally

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.860 
up originally
I<00:04:19.030> think<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:20.140> must<00:04:20.410> have<00:04:20.500> been<00:04:20.620> my<00:04:20.859> fault<00:04:21.160> I

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
I think it must have been my fault I

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.740 
I think it must have been my fault I
stuck<00:04:22.870> an<00:04:22.990> air<00:04:23.140> nozzle<00:04:23.620> down<00:04:23.800> inside<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:25.480> tube

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
stuck an air nozzle down inside the tube

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:34.560 
stuck an air nozzle down inside the tube
for<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:31.320> digital<00:04:32.320> readout<00:04:32.800> for<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.880> X<00:04:34.060> for

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
for the digital readout for the X for

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.470 
for the digital readout for the X for
the<00:04:34.660> y-axis<00:04:35.410> so<00:04:35.850> what<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:36.880> did<00:04:37.000> was<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.450> just

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
the y-axis so what I did was I just

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.350 
the y-axis so what I did was I just
temporarily<00:04:38.290> replaced<00:04:38.890> it<00:04:39.130> with<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:40.290> cheap<00:04:42.360> but

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
temporarily replaced it with a cheap but

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.390 
temporarily replaced it with a cheap but
very<00:04:43.630> effective

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.100 

little<00:04:48.780> readout<00:04:49.780> for<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.290> so<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:50.710> got<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:52.690> X's

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
little readout for that so I got the X's

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.380 
little readout for that so I got the X's
on<00:04:53.230> that<00:04:53.919> try<00:04:54.220> onyx<00:04:54.669> because<00:04:54.850> I<00:04:55.000> can't<00:04:55.210> find

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
on that try onyx because I can't find

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.250 
on that try onyx because I can't find
anybody<00:04:55.720> that<00:04:55.960> would<00:04:56.140> work<00:04:56.260> on<00:04:56.470> those<00:04:58.260> it's

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
anybody that would work on those it's

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.970 
anybody that would work on those it's
like<00:04:59.470> a<00:04:59.500> glass<00:04:59.890> bar<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.520> there<00:05:00.700> was<00:05:00.850> a<00:05:00.880> slider

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
like a glass bar and there was a slider

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.620 
like a glass bar and there was a slider
but<00:05:02.980> this<00:05:03.130> works<00:05:03.370> fine<00:05:03.669> so<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.750> got<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:06.630> y-axis

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
but this works fine so I got the y-axis

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.159 
but this works fine so I got the y-axis
on<00:05:07.840> here<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.230> the<00:05:08.350> x-axis<00:05:08.740> on<00:05:09.190> there<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:10.169> the

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
on here and the x-axis on there and the

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.780 
on here and the x-axis on there and the
fellow<00:05:11.410> I<00:05:11.500> bought<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.980> machine<00:05:12.310> from<00:05:12.520> I

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
fellow I bought the machine from I

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.790 
fellow I bought the machine from I
didn't<00:05:13.060> get<00:05:13.300> if<00:05:13.540> you'll<00:05:13.750> notice<00:05:14.110> down<00:05:14.140> here<00:05:14.350> I

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
didn't get if you'll notice down here I

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.120 
didn't get if you'll notice down here I
don't<00:05:15.220> have<00:05:15.780> an<00:05:16.780> air<00:05:16.990> pump<00:05:17.290> and<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.650> don't<00:05:17.710> have

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
don't have an air pump and I don't have

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.750 
don't have an air pump and I don't have
a<00:05:21.270> coolant<00:05:22.270> pump<00:05:22.540> both<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.500> those<00:05:23.620> had<00:05:23.890> been

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
a coolant pump both of those had been

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.140 
a coolant pump both of those had been
taken<00:05:25.150> off<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.630> think<00:05:26.490> they<00:05:27.490> were<00:05:27.550> basically

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
taken off I think they were basically

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.850 
taken off I think they were basically
using<00:05:28.270> this<00:05:28.810> machine<00:05:29.290> to<00:05:29.710> make<00:05:29.910> ATMs<00:05:30.910> and

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
using this machine to make ATMs and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.990 
using this machine to make ATMs and
graphite<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.100> everything<00:05:33.400> was<00:05:33.520> all<00:05:33.729> locked

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
graphite and everything was all locked

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.060 
graphite and everything was all locked
up<00:05:34.270> inside<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.900> spindle<00:05:35.320> I<00:05:35.350> had<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:35.620> drive<00:05:35.890> it

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
up inside the spindle I had to drive it

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.219 
up inside the spindle I had to drive it
out<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.250> there<00:05:36.550> once<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.630> got<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:37.930> out<00:05:38.020> and

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
out of there once I got it out and

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.520 
out of there once I got it out and
cleaned<00:05:38.470> up<00:05:38.650> it's<00:05:38.890> working<00:05:39.130> fine<00:05:39.520> now<00:05:40.530> but

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
cleaned up it's working fine now but

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.380 
cleaned up it's working fine now but

that<00:06:03.640> didn't<00:06:03.940> have<00:06:04.090> him<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.479> guy's<00:06:04.800> rigged<00:06:05.800> up

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
that didn't have him the guy's rigged up

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.180 
that didn't have him the guy's rigged up
a<00:06:06.100> deal<00:06:06.310> where<00:06:06.850> they<00:06:06.970> took<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:08.080> needle<00:06:08.800> the

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
a deal where they took the needle the

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.909 
a deal where they took the needle the
knee<00:06:09.400> wheel<00:06:09.669> it's<00:06:10.180> over<00:06:10.450> here<00:06:10.750> and<00:06:11.410> moved<00:06:11.740> it

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
knee wheel it's over here and moved it

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:12.930 
knee wheel it's over here and moved it
over<00:06:12.160> to<00:06:12.250> this<00:06:12.400> side

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
over to this side

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.990 
over to this side
and<00:06:13.030> then<00:06:13.750> they<00:06:13.930> built<00:06:14.200> one<00:06:14.380> of<00:06:14.410> these<00:06:15.000> to

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
and then they built one of these to

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.530 
and then they built one of these to
crank<00:06:16.300> with<00:06:16.540> and<00:06:17.460> actually<00:06:18.460> that<00:06:19.360> works

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
crank with and actually that works

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.600 
crank with and actually that works
pretty<00:06:19.810> difficult<00:06:20.050> good<00:06:20.380> I<00:06:20.620> built<00:06:21.190> that<00:06:21.370> and

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
pretty difficult good I built that and

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.130 
pretty difficult good I built that and
put<00:06:21.729> it<00:06:21.850> on<00:06:21.970> there<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.210> moved<00:06:22.450> it<00:06:22.600> around<00:06:22.870> and

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
put it on there and moved it around and

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.380 
put it on there and moved it around and
so<00:06:23.740> now<00:06:23.890> I<00:06:23.919> can<00:06:24.040> crank<00:06:24.370> this<00:06:24.580> up<00:06:24.760> and<00:06:24.940> down<00:06:25.120> but

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
so now I can crank this up and down but

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.640 
so now I can crank this up and down but
fortunately<00:06:26.039> this<00:06:27.039> machine<00:06:27.669> is<00:06:28.030> so<00:06:28.810> fantastic

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
fortunately this machine is so fantastic

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.770 
fortunately this machine is so fantastic
it

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
it

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.460 
it
you<00:06:31.410> know<00:06:31.530> I<00:06:31.560> I<00:06:31.920> built<00:06:32.280> this<00:06:32.520> on<00:06:32.880> here<00:06:33.870> one<00:06:34.139> set

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
you know I I built this on here one set

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.720 
you know I I built this on here one set
up<00:06:35.300> set<00:06:36.300> it<00:06:36.330> in<00:06:36.570> there<00:06:36.810> and<00:06:36.990> then<00:06:37.800> proceeded<00:06:38.700> to

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730 
up set it in there and then proceeded to

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.270 
up set it in there and then proceeded to
mill<00:06:39.030> this<00:06:39.210> whole<00:06:39.480> thing<00:06:40.440> with<00:06:40.740> without

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
mill this whole thing with without

mill this whole thing with without
unlocking<00:06:41.880> without<00:06:42.360> moving<00:06:42.720> without<00:06:42.990> doing

outside and inside diameters and and

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.000 
outside and inside diameters and and
knock<00:06:49.590> these<00:06:49.800> out<00:06:50.040> and<00:06:51.590> you<00:06:52.590> know<00:06:52.650> my<00:06:52.770> right

angle<00:06:53.160> tricks<00:06:53.580> a<00:06:53.700> little<00:06:53.940> rusty<00:06:54.450> but<00:06:54.480> it

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
angle tricks a little rusty but it

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.990 
angle tricks a little rusty but it
doesn't<00:06:55.410> require<00:06:55.560> a<00:06:55.919> lot<00:06:56.070> of<00:06:56.220> you<00:06:56.850> know<00:06:56.970> a

doesn't require a lot of you know a
little<00:06:57.210> common<00:06:57.570> sense<00:06:57.840> you<00:06:58.050> know<00:06:58.139> you<00:06:58.200> you

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
little common sense you know you you

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.340 
little common sense you know you you
knock<00:06:59.250> off<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.669> first<00:06:59.910> cut<00:07:00.210> here<00:07:00.480> and<00:07:01.050> then

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
you just go hit the rotary and you go

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.020 
you just go hit the rotary and you go
around<00:07:03.360> 90<00:07:03.840> degrees<00:07:04.220> knock<00:07:05.220> the<00:07:05.400> next<00:07:05.669> one<00:07:05.790> off

so<00:07:11.850> and<00:07:12.510> made<00:07:12.900> myself<00:07:13.080> a<00:07:13.500> little<00:07:16.400> spanner

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
so and made myself a little spanner

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.190 
so and made myself a little spanner
wrench<00:07:17.730> that<00:07:18.650> I<00:07:19.650> used<00:07:20.400> to<00:07:20.610> take<00:07:20.760> apart<00:07:21.150> the<00:07:21.419> the
