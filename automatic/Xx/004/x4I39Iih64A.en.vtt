from a couple friends is that when I
went<00:00:05.339> into<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:06.089> monster<00:00:06.750> farm<00:00:07.020> chamber<00:00:07.589> it

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
went into the monster farm chamber it

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.120 
went into the monster farm chamber it
was<00:00:08.099> impossible<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.790> see<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.769> I<00:00:10.769> didn't

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
was impossible to see and I didn't

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.220 
was impossible to see and I didn't
realize<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.059> video<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.480> YouTube<00:00:12.840> put<00:00:13.110> it

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
realize that the video on YouTube put it

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.970 
realize that the video on YouTube put it
up<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.590> dark<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:15.000> I've<00:00:15.150> done<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.870> come<00:00:16.859> in

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
up so dark so what I've done is come in

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.590 
up so dark so what I've done is come in
here<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.640> make<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:17.850> completely

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
here and make this completely

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200 
here and make this completely
non-functional<00:00:19.260> by<00:00:19.710> torching<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> hell<00:00:21.000> out

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
non-functional by torching the hell out

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.470 
non-functional by torching the hell out
of<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:22.350> laid<00:00:22.890> down<00:00:22.920> about<00:00:23.850> sixty<00:00:24.269> four

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
of it I laid down about sixty four

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.589 
of it I laid down about sixty four
torches<00:00:24.779> throughout<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.740> thing<00:00:26.359> so<00:00:27.359> anyway

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
torches throughout the thing so anyway

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.169 
torches throughout the thing so anyway
I'll<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> quick<00:00:29.160> walkthrough<00:00:29.340> again<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I'll do a quick walkthrough again this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.590 
I'll do a quick walkthrough again this
is<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:31.019> floor

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.330 

we'll<00:00:35.600> go<00:00:35.750> out<00:00:35.840> into<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.080> cavern<00:00:39.340> and

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
we'll go out into the cavern and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.140 
we'll go out into the cavern and
hopefully<00:00:40.430> now<00:00:41.180> see<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:42.590> there's<00:00:43.150> the

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
hopefully now see it that there's the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.300 
hopefully now see it that there's the
cactus<00:00:44.750> that<00:00:44.989> things<00:00:45.200> can<00:00:45.560> kill<00:00:45.890> themselves

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
cactus that things can kill themselves

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.410 
cactus that things can kill themselves
on<00:00:46.580> and<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.980> water<00:00:49.250> flows<00:00:49.580> down<00:00:49.850> from<00:00:49.880> above

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
on and the water flows down from above

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.260 
on and the water flows down from above
and<00:00:51.050> you'll<00:00:51.710> see<00:00:51.980> there's<00:00:52.400> a<00:00:53.050> break<00:00:54.050> in<00:00:54.080> the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
and you'll see there's a break in the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.970 
and you'll see there's a break in the
blocks<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:56.720> allows<00:00:56.960> them<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.260> drop<00:00:57.530> down<00:00:57.800> and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
blocks that allows them to drop down and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.580 
blocks that allows them to drop down and
drown

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.900 

I<00:01:01.650> just<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:03.620> all<00:01:04.620> this<00:01:05.220> water<00:01:05.489> comes

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
I just go up here all this water comes

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.510 
I just go up here all this water comes
from<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.540> single<00:01:06.930> row<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.290> blocks<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> top

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
from one single row of blocks of the top

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.020 
from one single row of blocks of the top
and<00:01:09.480> if<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.440> drop<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.100> elevation<00:01:11.729> every

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and if you drop the elevation every

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.710 
and if you drop the elevation every
seven<00:01:12.450> blocks<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:14.790> continue<00:01:15.120> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
seven blocks it will continue a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
seven blocks it will continue a
continuous<00:01:16.710> flow<00:01:17.690> and<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:20.550> will<00:01:20.729> push<00:01:21.000> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
continuous flow and it will push you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.620 
continuous flow and it will push you
along<00:01:21.300> constantly<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:25.820> anyway<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:27.300> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
along constantly so anyway so that's the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
along constantly so anyway so that's the
first<00:01:27.780> full<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.410> it<00:01:31.410> kind<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.770> alternates<00:01:32.250> you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
first full and it kind of alternates you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.249 
first full and it kind of alternates you
know<00:01:32.580> sometimes<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.450> i<00:01:33.510> run<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.899> machine

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
know sometimes when i run the machine

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.620 
know sometimes when i run the machine
this<00:01:35.130> floor<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.119> majority<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this floor will have the majority of the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.330 
this floor will have the majority of the
spawns<00:01:36.990> other<00:01:37.500> times<00:01:37.800> when<00:01:38.009> i<00:01:38.040> run<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
spawns other times when i run the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.850 
spawns other times when i run the
machine<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.360> floor<00:01:40.050> below<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
machine the floor below will have the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.480 
machine the floor below will have the
majority<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.310> spawns<00:01:42.200> i<00:01:43.200> rarely<00:01:43.619> gets<00:01:43.950> ponds

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
majority that spawns i rarely gets ponds

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.900 
majority that spawns i rarely gets ponds
out<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.880> both<00:01:45.090> places<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> same<00:01:45.990> time<00:01:46.910> so

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
out of both places at the same time so

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.320 
out of both places at the same time so
from<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.350> this

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
from here you can see that this

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
from here you can see that this
captain's<00:01:51.330> much<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> same<00:01:54.110> this<00:01:55.110> little

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
captain's much the same this little

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.410 
captain's much the same this little
structures<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> redirect<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:56.910> stream

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
structures just to redirect the stream

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
structures just to redirect the stream
into<00:01:57.840> another<00:01:58.080> direction<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:01.130> drop<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
into another direction it drop down and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.300 
into another direction it drop down and
we'll<00:02:02.850> go<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:03.830> one<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> building

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
we'll go out there one of the building

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.080 
we'll go out there one of the building
this<00:02:05.399> had<00:02:05.580> created<00:02:05.850> these<00:02:05.940> little<00:02:06.830> bypasses

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
this had created these little bypasses

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.420 
this had created these little bypasses
so<00:02:09.090> i<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.330> flip<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.660> peaceful<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.709> work<00:02:11.220> on

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
so i can flip it to peaceful and work on

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.400 
so i can flip it to peaceful and work on
the<00:02:11.610> structure<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.690> put<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> back<00:02:13.260> on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the structure and then put it back on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.740 
the structure and then put it back on
hill<00:02:14.220> normal<00:02:14.850> or<00:02:14.970> hard<00:02:15.410> until<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.500> things<00:02:16.770> out

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
hill normal or hard until we things out

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.120 
hill normal or hard until we things out
don't<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.020> really<00:02:19.260> did<00:02:19.560> different

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
don't think that I really did different

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.880 
don't think that I really did different
down<00:02:20.280> here<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.480> dug<00:02:21.690> these<00:02:21.900> side<00:02:22.290> tunnels

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
down here is I dug these side tunnels

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.460 
down here is I dug these side tunnels
just<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.970> extend<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.750> amount<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.140> space<00:02:25.410> that

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
just to extend the amount of space that

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.000 
just to extend the amount of space that
monsters<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.400> spawn<00:02:27.410> jury's<00:02:28.410> out<00:02:28.560> as<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
monsters can spawn jury's out as to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.470 
monsters can spawn jury's out as to
whether<00:02:29.130> or<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.550> actually<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.060> helping

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
whether or not that actually is helping

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.339 
whether or not that actually is helping
the<00:02:31.380> spawn<00:02:31.709> rate<00:02:32.690> some<00:02:33.690> ways<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.050> think<00:02:34.080> it's

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
the spawn rate some ways I think it's

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.440 
the spawn rate some ways I think it's
actually<00:02:34.530> hurting<00:02:34.860> with<00:02:35.099> spawn<00:02:35.370> rate

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.960 

but<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:39.770> I<00:02:39.800> may<00:02:40.010> end<00:02:40.129> up<00:02:40.280> filling<00:02:40.489> those<00:02:40.730> back

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
but so I may end up filling those back

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.150 
but so I may end up filling those back
in<00:02:41.000> at<00:02:41.360> some<00:02:41.569> point<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:45.260> that's<00:02:45.920> how<00:02:46.099> the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
in at some point but that's how the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.580 
in at some point but that's how the
structure<00:02:46.459> works<00:02:46.819> things<00:02:47.599> get<00:02:47.870> trapped<00:02:48.319> down

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
structure works things get trapped down

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.580 
structure works things get trapped down
here<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:52.120> morning<00:02:53.120> diamond<00:02:53.959> armor<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
here and morning diamond armor so the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.370 
here and morning diamond armor so the
current<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.099> very<00:02:57.069> resistant<00:02:58.069> so<00:02:59.140> like<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.170> said

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
current is very resistant so like I said

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.009 
current is very resistant so like I said
you<00:03:00.530> come<00:03:00.709> down<00:03:00.860> here<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.569> stand

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
you come down here and if you stand

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.180 
you come down here and if you stand
pretty<00:03:03.410> much<00:03:03.650> right<00:03:04.069> here<00:03:05.739> there's<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:06.830> slight

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
pretty much right here there's a slight

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.240 
pretty much right here there's a slight
slope<00:03:07.610> coming<00:03:08.060> around<00:03:08.239> from<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.480> back<00:03:08.569> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
slope coming around from the back and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.410 
slope coming around from the back and
then<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.370> slope<00:03:10.640> from<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:10.970> stuff<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:11.330> the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
then the slope from the stuff in the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.140 
then the slope from the stuff in the
front<00:03:11.950> will<00:03:12.950> carry<00:03:13.310> anything<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.880> drops

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
front will carry anything that drops

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.729 
front will carry anything that drops
behind<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.810> or<00:03:15.110> in<00:03:15.170> front<00:03:15.319> of<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.950> down

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
behind you or in front of you down

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.009 
behind you or in front of you down
anyway<00:03:18.739> that's<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.430> monster<00:03:19.700> machine<00:03:20.150> and

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
anyway that's the monster machine and

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.270 
anyway that's the monster machine and
it's<00:03:21.140> going<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.319> be<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.440> colossal<00:03:21.709> pain<00:03:22.040> in<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
it's going to be a colossal pain in the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.309 
it's going to be a colossal pain in the
ass<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.700> remove<00:03:23.239> all<00:03:23.390> these<00:03:23.540> torches<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.170> make

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
ass to remove all these torches to make

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.910 
ass to remove all these torches to make
it<00:03:24.440> functional<00:03:24.860> again<00:03:25.010> but<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:25.880> wanted<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.920> show

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
it functional again but I wanted to show

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.589 
it functional again but I wanted to show
the<00:03:28.069> couple<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.430> friends<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.790> had<00:03:28.970> requested

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
the couple of friends that had requested

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.690 
the couple of friends that had requested
it<00:03:29.890> anyway<00:03:31.480> see<00:03:32.480> y'all<00:03:32.660> later
