about<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.250> show<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.460> that<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.140> see<00:02:13.140> once<00:02:13.320> you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
about to show you that to see once you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680 
about to show you that to see once you
have<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.950> information<00:02:14.480> pieces<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
puzzle just fall together I'm gonna scan

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.830 
puzzle just fall together I'm gonna scan
the<00:02:19.500> horizon<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:20.180> I'm<00:02:21.180> gonna<00:02:21.330> show<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.600> what

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the horizon here I'm gonna show you what

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.730 
the horizon here I'm gonna show you what
I'm<00:02:21.930> talking<00:02:21.990> about<00:02:23.810> how<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:25.050> earth<00:02:25.350> do<00:02:25.620> they

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
I'm talking about how on earth do they

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.260 
I'm talking about how on earth do they
program<00:02:26.190> computers<00:02:26.760> inside<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.740> me

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
program computers inside you and me

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.640 
program computers inside you and me
those<00:02:30.270> are<00:02:30.420> late<00:02:30.540> flight<00:02:30.960> super<00:02:31.140> stadium

those are late flight super stadium

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.380 
those are late flight super stadium
there<00:02:31.830> or<00:02:32.340> parking<00:02:32.760> lot<00:02:32.880> don't<00:02:33.060> worry<00:02:33.239> about

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
there or parking lot don't worry about

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.490 
there or parking lot don't worry about
that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.120 
that
but<00:02:35.040> what<00:02:35.190> I'm<00:02:35.280> getting<00:02:35.400> at<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:37.010> see<00:02:38.010> that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
but what I'm getting at is see that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.059 
but what I'm getting at is see that
right<00:02:38.310> there

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
right there

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.120 
right there
cellphone<00:02:40.969> tower<00:02:41.209> right<00:02:42.219> no<00:02:43.219> no

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
cellphone tower right no no

that's<00:02:45.760> how<00:02:45.940> they<00:02:46.090> program<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.020> computers

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
that's how they program the computers

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.330 
that's how they program the computers
inside<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:49.740> they're<00:02:50.740> everywhere

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
inside you they're everywhere

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.330 
inside you they're everywhere
